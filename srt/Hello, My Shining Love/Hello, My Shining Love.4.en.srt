1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,920
Hold on.

2
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,120
to wait a moment

3
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
Why are you standing there? Come in.

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,920
Are you afraid that I will eat you?

5
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,200
I will be afraid of you.

6
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
Why are you so numb?

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,880
Is it the leakage of electricity?

8
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,000
It's possible.

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,760
I knew it.

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,880
Is it good to meet you?

11
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,640
How dare you say that?

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,320
You are the jinx.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,040
When I met you,

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,880
And his luck went down.

15
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,600
I don't know.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Who was drunk that night?

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
A pair of snot and tears.

18
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
And insisted on my staying.

19
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,960
This matter is over.

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,440
Don't mention it in the future.

21
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
Be mature, okay?

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,360
You know I'm sorry.

23
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,720
Don't talk to a man

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,760
Go out and drink.

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
She's fine with me.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
I know who you are.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,000
If you meet some pornographer,

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,800
What happened?

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
It's too late for you to regret it.

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,320
Do you know

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,400
You're worried about me.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
I've always cared about you.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
If you want to commit suicide,

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
Who should I buy this house from?

36
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
I've always been curious.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,440
Why are you

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,160
To my house,

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
So persistent.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,480
If it's common people,

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,360
She's long gone.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
Why are you so obsequious?

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,880
Stay here.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,920
Can you tell me?

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
why

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,360
The less you know, the better.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,600
Freak, freak.

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,560
He ran away.

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
What did he mean just now?

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,040
Did he come to laugh at me?

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,440
You're here to care about me.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
Don't leave.

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,040
Okay, I'm not leaving.

55
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,760
Come here.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,480
Come here.

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,880
I must have been single for too long.

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,200
So thirsty.

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
Why would I

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,040
Such a shameful thing.

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
OK?

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
It can be softer.

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,960
A little more to the left.

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Got it. All right.

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
A little bit exposed.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
good

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Hello, President Ji.

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
You're here.

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,880
Hello, President Ji.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,120
Are the clothes ready?

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,160
to be ready

72
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
You can have a look.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
It's beautiful. Look at it.

74
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Look at this dress.

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,080
President Ji.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,640
We are going to

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,320
Wearing these clothes?

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,080
Are you sure we can fit in?

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,200
What about the clothes?

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,840
Are all designers.

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,160
It's tailor-made for you.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
No matter how the fabric is cut,

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,120
Or present?

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,440
Is very suitable to your temperament.

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,960
You can easily

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
You can wear it.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
Luckily, I brought black stovepipe socks.

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
It matches the clothes.

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,120
You don't need silk stocking.

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
Black will make it worse.

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,160
The proportion of your lower body

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
But you don't wear thin leg socks.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,440
Won't your lower body look thick?

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,200
Trust me.

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
The legs are exposed naturally.

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
It's part of your body.

97
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,240
There's no need to cover up.

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,640
What I need.

99
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Is the real you.

100
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,240
Relax.

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,440
You're reckless.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
I need you to prove it.

103
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,920
fat

104
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,120
Or beautiful.

105
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
Then let's get changed.

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,840
well

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
It's so beautiful.

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,000
President Ji.

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
Look, the first model

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,480
She kept zipping her lips.

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,600
It means she has been

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
Control your emotions.

113
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,960
He didn't express it at all.

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,880
The real me.

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,800
Look at the second model.

116
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,200
She didn't dare to do too much.

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,120
Leg movements.

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,600
Because of the short skirt.

119
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
And exposed his legs.

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
Look at the third model.

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,640
She has been

122
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,680
To avoid the eyes of others.

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,040
The inner eyebrow is pulled up.

124
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,600
Thank you.

125
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,800
I feel anxious.

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,080
Very confident.

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I want more than

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
Show the dress.

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,600
But the one wearing the dress.

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,000
Can express confidence.

131
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
But President Ji,

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
This is what they have developed for a long time.

133
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,840
Habits and psychology

134
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
It's hard to change it later.

135
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,680
Be confident.

136
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
Look at yourself in the mirror.

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
You are so beautiful.

138
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,960
Your skin is very white.

139
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,760
Wearing this green dress,

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,360
Will appear

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,640
You're so graceful.

142
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,440
Smile.

143
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,440
It's beautiful.

144
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,920
You think your legs are thick?

145
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
But I think

146
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,080
With this skirt,

147
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,840
It will appear that

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
Leg proportion

149
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,600
Will be more powerful than professional models.

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,840
The proportion of legs is better.

151
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,280
You kept zipping your lips.

152
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,960
Actually, I think

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,640
You're perfect.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
Now we just need to match

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,800
A confident smile.

156
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,080
It's cute.

157
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,480
Don't look

158
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
Focus on your arms.

159
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,680
Your lines are actually beautiful.

160
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,680
Wearing this dress will look

161
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,280
And become healthier.

162
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,240
And sexy.

163
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
Actually, beauty is not given by clothes.

164
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
But you.

165
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
That you have.

166
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,080
The aesthetic is not objective.

167
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,160
But subjective.

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,120
It's for everyone.

169
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
Psycho-oriented embodiment

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
I know you...

171
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
I used to be

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,880
I've been exposed to many people.

173
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,840
Cynical

174
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
But you have to

175
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,920
The man who taunts you said

176
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
You're wrong.

177
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,040
But first,

178
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
You must admit that you are beautiful.

179
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,320
I believe I'm beautiful.

180
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,000
Now?

181
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,080
In the mirror,

182
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,080
Smile with confidence.

183
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,680
I think it's okay.

184
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Watch me.

185
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,400
It's so beautiful.

186
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
The prettiest. Yours.

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And yours.

188
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,120
I love this green.

189
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
My legs are not thick at all.

190
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, that's it.

191
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,480
Get ready to shoot.

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
good

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Start

194
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,920
What are you doing, Miss Chen Fei'er?

195
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
Get out of the car.

196
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
I told you that after I came back,

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Don't pick me up.

198
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,840
I need to relax.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Okay?

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Chen Fei,

201
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,520
Relax. You don't need money.

202
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,600
You're buying clothes.

203
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
You don't need to do your hair.

204
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,080
Look at the number of the bank card.

205
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,840
all right?

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's go.

207
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
Let's go. Hurry up and work.

208
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
What can I do?

209
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Blame me

210
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,720
The beautiful things in the world

211
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,280
That's a lot.

212
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,160
And beautiful things are more expensive.

213
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,600
Stop it.

214
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,120
You don't need the money. I do.

215
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,880
I have to make money.

216
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,160
Let's go.

217
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,760
Alright.

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,960
I'll leave alone.

219
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,360
Let's go.

220
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,840
What happened

221
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
Is this taken?

222
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,360
I got the time wrong.

223
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,640
It's him.

224
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,880
Now I need you to laugh.

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,560
Don't be afraid to highlight the facial muscles.

226
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,640
That's apple muscle.

227
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,440
Average person

228
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,360
And injection of hyaluronic acid.

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Think about it.

230
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,000
How much money did you save?

231
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,480
Smile.

232
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,320
A horse may slip a hundred times.

233
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,280
The wrong time.

234
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
We're in the afternoon.

235
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Didn't you just say that

236
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,440
Do you want to relax?

237
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Shall I go shopping with you?

238
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,480
Turn around.

239
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,280
to wait a moment

240
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,320
I want to see them shoot.

241
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
What's there to see?

242
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Are you mad at me?

243
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,840
There's always something small in life.

244
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,840
good

245
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,800
Now I need you

246
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Jump up.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
You have to check it for us.

248
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
Is the material qualified?

249
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,640
right or wrong?

250
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,160
Come on. I'll dance.

251
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,040
Let's dance together.

252
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,000
Is that President Ji?

253
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,880
What a coincidence.

254
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,360
But the models

255
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
Why are they all fat?

256
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll do it.

257
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,760
Don't look at me, look at the camera.

258
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,680
Am I so handsome?

259
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
Nice

260
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,480
Nice

261
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,840
Hold on. Keep going.

262
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,160
Great. Come again.

263
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,560
Nice

264
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,160
good-looking

265
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
Hold it for me.

266
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,920
President Ji, you are the boss.

267
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Actually, there's no need.

268
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
To do this for us.

269
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,280
To serve a beautiful lady.

270
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,720
It's my pleasure.

271
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,680
Go on.

272
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
didn't expect

273
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
He's so patient with Fatty.

274
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
He's a good man.

275
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
You've only seen people twice.

276
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
I thought he was a good man.

277
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,040
Smile.

278
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
The president of a big company.

279
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,520
In the studio.

280
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,560
For these models.

281
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
To prove that he's approachable.

282
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,240
Without airs.

283
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,320
Men are usually

284
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
She's a pretty woman. Nice.

285
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Very polite.

286
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,200
Because they are visual animals.

287
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
It's their instinct.

288
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
Something beyond instinct.

289
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,520
Is a man.

290
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,640
The real quality.

291
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,640
Hold on.

292
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,200
The feeling of being respected.

293
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,120
Who has never been fat.

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,080
You wouldn't understand.

295
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,520
Yes

296
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,520
Yeah, that's right.

297
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,240
good-looking

298
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Let's go.

299
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
It's beautiful.

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,920
come

301
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,240
I asked you to help me last time.

302
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,680
About the fashion contract.

303
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,640
How's it going?

304
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Didn't you say that

305
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,240
Aren't you in a hurry to work?

306
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm not in a hurry.

307
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
They wanted to sign a contract with me.

308
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,640
Now, I want to be

309
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Their spokesman.

310
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,760
Contact me right now.

311
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,480
To sign the contract.

312
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,160
Yes

313
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,960
This contract

314
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,040
We must let their president, President Ji,

315
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,200
Sign it with me.

316
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,760
Do you know

317
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,440
It's important.

318
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,080
I heard that her former artist

319
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,880
She ran away with someone.

320
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
She recently signed a new artist.

321
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,520
Do you know who it is?

322
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,160
Who is it?

323
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
Sida

324
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,080
Sida

325
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,640
That's right.

326
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,960
The Wannian Passerby Armor.

327
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
No one wants the extra.

328
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,680
It's him.

329
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,480
Really?

330
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,320
Is she crazy?

331
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
They're always acting on the wind.

332
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,840
snob

333
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,800
Are waiting to see me.

334
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,480
Dugu Ruoruo is a man, right?

335
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,520
I won't let you succeed.

336
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,760
Waiting

337
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,680
How can I cultivate

338
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,160
A rising star.

339
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,640
Sida?

340
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,440
Come to the office now.

341
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
I will train you myself.

342
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,840
From now on,

343
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,240
I'll start from the acting,

344
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,680
Physical talent.

345
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
To train you.

346
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,480
good

347
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,800
first

348
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
I want to see your foundation first.

349
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,520
Come on.

350
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,400
Study this play.

351
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,120
Take a look.

352
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,160
This is about

353
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,760
You're a sad

354
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,040
A lonely man.

355
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,440
And this scene is

356
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,640
Your girlfriend wants to break up with you.

357
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,680
And you were sad.

358
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,720
This side of the red line.

359
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
You have to get her back.

360
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,320
In love and hatred,

361
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,640
And a little bit of

362
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,640
mournful

363
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
And hide it in my heart.

364
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,280
That kind of sadness.

365
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,040
That kind of torn emotion.

366
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,600
Okay?

367
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
To act so pitifully.

368
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,200
To make people feel sorry for you.

369
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,960
How about that kind of grief?

370
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,760
Sure. Come on.

371
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,840
Try to figure out

372
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
Try to figure out

373
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
Why are you avoiding me?

374
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Go away.

375
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't want to see you now.

376
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm not leaving.

377
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,800
Tell me when you're ready.

378
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,960
good

379
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,680
to be ready

380
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,160
That's enough.

381
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,040
That's enough. Come on.

382
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Three, two.

383
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,320
start

384
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
Why are you avoiding me?

385
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,040
Go away.

386
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,880
I don't want to see you again.

387
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,680
I'm not leaving.

388
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,440
Because I love you.

389
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
I really love you.

390
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,640
But your love is suffocating me.

391
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,920
I did it for you.

392
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,400
You know what?

393
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,240
Stop, stop.

394
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,280
If you keep acting,

395
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
I'm suffocating.

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,880
It's not important.

397
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,840
The script is not important.

398
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
Don't read the script.

399
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,440
Do you have

400
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,160
compare

401
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm good at.

402
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,320
The best.

403
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,360
The best.

404
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,040
Yes

405
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,800
Yes

406
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,560
Great. Show me.

407
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,240
good

408
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,840
Don't be nervous.

409
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,680
Relax.

410
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,000
good

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay, tell me.

412
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,960
That's it.

413
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,360
All right, come on.

414
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,120
Three, two.

415
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,040
start

416
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Sida

417
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,560
Sida

418
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,800
Sida

419
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,920
Sida

420
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,280
Sida

421
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,200
Stop

422
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
How is it, sister?

423
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,480
all right?

424
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,440
The director said

425
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
Even if you play a corpse,

426
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,760
You can't breathe, but you can be real.

427
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
Unless you shout,

428
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,200
All right? Give it back.

429
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,840
I was in the group.

430
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,320
Are you the best?

431
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,080
Other roles can be performed.

432
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
Is alive.

433
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
Who can breathe.

434
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,840
Yes, I have.

435
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,680
Alright, alright.

436
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
Then I'll do that.

437
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,280
waiter

438
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,960
bandit

439
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,280
bandit

440
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
Outlaw

441
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,200
And living zombies.

442
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,120
Zombies, zombies alive.

443
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
Stop, stop.

444
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,560
That's good. It's real. Stop.

445
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,720
How's my acting?

446
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
It's great.

447
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,280
That's great, isn't it?

448
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,200
It's real.

449
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,960
I think I accept your acting.

450
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
We need more time.

451
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's adjust it.

452
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,079
Let's train first, okay?

453
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,760
To adjust the body.

454
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
My zombies aren't real?

455
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,280
Okay, let's settle on this.

456
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,960
End position.

457
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Let's start from the beginning.

458
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,520
Five Six Seven, let's go.

459

Two, three, four, five, six, eight.

460
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,080
Two, three, four, five, seven.

461
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,560
OK

462
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,120
The girl did well today.

463
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,040
Xiao Lan, Hao Hao.

464
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,320
Go down and practice more.

465
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Okay, that's it.

466
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,800
Thank you, teacher.

467
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,480
Miss Tong,

468
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,440
Then the training today

469
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
This is it. Look.

470
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,680
Why are you here?

471
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,080
I see you've finished practicing.

472
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
I want your guidance.

473
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,000
My new man.

474
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,760
Come on.

475
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,560
Hello Teacher

476
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
Here's the thing.

477
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm the only one in charge of the company.

478
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
Miss Tong's artist.

479
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,840
Alright.

480
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,400
I don't need people.

481
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
Can I use the venue?

482
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,720
teacher

483
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,120
I think the male part

484
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,320
You're not very good.

485
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,800
I want them

486
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,960
Keep practicing.

487
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,840
So I'm sorry, Senior.

488
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm afraid the venue is not good enough.

489
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,840
Great. Let's practice together.

490
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Come on.

491
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,320
Sorry, excuse me.

492
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,000
Come on.

493
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
What are you hiding from?

494
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,000
Sorry

495
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,920
Sorry, thank you.

496
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,960
What are you doing?

497
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,480
I asked Star to practice with everyone.

498
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,640
Are all artists of the company.

499
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,200
We can share the resources.

500
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,160
Or do you want to...

501
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,760
In front of them,

502
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,120
To bully the newlyweds.

503
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,880
head

504
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
Alright, let's practice together.

505
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,400

506
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,680
Come on.

507
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
Come on.

508
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
Then, everyone, go back.

509
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
Si Da, you need to follow me a little bit.

510
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,520
All right.

511
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,600
Ready to go.

512
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
Two, three, four, five, six, eight.

513
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,320
Two, three, four, five, seven.

514
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,760
It's okay, Star.

515
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,080
If we turn this way,

516
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,000
Right foot in front.

517
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,200
That's it.

518
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay?

519
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh

520
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,800
That's right.

521
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,040
That's it.

522
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,160
Okay, let's do it again.

523
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,040
Two, three, four, five, six, eight.

524
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,560
Two two, four, five, six.

525
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,720
Hold on.

526
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,000
You're really on time.

527
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,720
I made an appointment

528
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,000
During rush hours after work.

529
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,720
I thought you would be late.

530
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
I went out for an appointment.

531
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,080
Usually,

532
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,360
Including the traffic jam,

533
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,440
Like President Ji.

534
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
A man of principle.

535
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Cut a long story short

536
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,120
Our group wants to

537
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,400
A one-year endorsement contract.

538
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Then you can have a look.

539
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,760
If there's anything to change,

540
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,560
And the legal affairs of our group

541
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,480
Further communication.

542
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,440
But I heard that

543
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,160
Are you trying to contact me

544
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,120
The other sisters in the modeling world.

545
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,560
It seems that the sincerity is not enough.

546
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,000
I hate being a backup.

547
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,160
I'm the only one who chooses others.

548
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,320
No one picked me.

549
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,760
It seems that it's time

550
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
You should reconsider.

551
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
With Wing Fashion Group.

552
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,880
If an object

553
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,000
No one wants it.

554
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,040
It means that the item is not good enough.

555
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,880
If that person

556
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,920
And got this item.

557
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,200
That means this person

558
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,280
He's not good enough.

559
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,480
And Miss Phyl is so

560
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Don't you have confidence?

561
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,480
When did I say that?

562
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,400
Are you the backup?

563
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,200
I didn't know that our company

564
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,560
Have you contacted other models?

565
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,600
But as the president of Wing Fashion,

566
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,280
Endorsing models.

567
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,160
You need my approval.

568
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,360
at least

569
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,800
So far,

570
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,040
I've only seen one model.

571
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,160
So,

572
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm your only choice.

573
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,800
Good cooperation.

574
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Good cooperation.

575
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,200
President Ji.

576
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
You scared me to death just now.

577
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,160
I thought she wouldn't sign it.

578
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,040
It seems that your competitive psychology

579
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,400
It won't work on her.

580
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,760
On the contrary

581
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,280
Actually, she has already decided

582
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,480
To sign the contract with us.

583
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,960
How could you tell?

584
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,840
When people are talking,

585
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,880
The accompanying hand movements

586
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,320
It's called hermeneutic action.

587
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,360
And fondle the ring.

588
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,600
It's called controlling action.

589
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,200
When the interpretive movements disappear,

590
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,080
And the controlling movements

591
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
When it increases,

592
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,760
That means she's lying.

593
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,120
So her dissatisfaction

594
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Is in disguise.

595
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Phil has been

596
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,760
Touch the ring.

597
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
It shows her lies.

598
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,960
Has been betrayed.

599
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,200
What she really thinks.

600
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
She really wants to sign with us.

601
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
Mr. Ji, you're still amazing.

602
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,440
I was fooled completely just now.

603
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
But I found something

604
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,160
She's very interested in you.

605
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,760
I think it's for you.

606
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,680
I'm not interested in her.

607
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,320
Why, Phil?

608
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,200
The dream lover of all men.

609
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,040
Don't you hate

610
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,000
A troublesome woman?

611
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
There are many rumors about Phil,

612
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,040
But she doesn't bother people.

613
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,000
She won't give it to you.

614
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
To make trouble.

615
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,440
I don't know if she is troublesome.

616
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,840
But the Dugu Ruuo Man

617
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,000
But it's really troublesome.

618
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,960
I don't want to be with her.

619
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
What does it have to do with?

620
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,200
You drank it again?

621
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
To sign a new one recently.

622
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,040
To train with him every day.

623
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,880
Tired

624
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
The agent is training with the artist.

625
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
In the past,

626
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,400
You don't need me to do it.

627
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,120
But now I'm demoted.

628
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,000
and

629
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,800
He's the only artist in my hands.

630
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,920
So I came alone.

631
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,720
Is it because of Song Zihao?

632
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,480
Or what?

633
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,760
What do you think

634
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,840
Look at how miserable I am.

635
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,440
You must be proud of yourself.

636
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,040
I did this to you.

637
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,760
Now I have my revenge.

638
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,600
Don't say that.

639
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm really happy.

640
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,800
Since you signed him,

641
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
You should train them well.

642
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,600
You're the gold manager.

643
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
I've never seen it.

644
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
A newbie with such a poor foundation,

645
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,320
Nothing.

646
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
I don't know where to start.

647
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,120
Since it's so bad,

648
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,440
Why did you sign him?

649
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
I just wanted to

650
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,480
A bet.

651
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,240
Later, the child

652
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,080
To the dream.

653
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,040
And every time,

654
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,680
When I persuaded him to give up,

655
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,160
He is so pitiful.

656
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,240
Little eyes.

657
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,040
I'm soft.

658
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,600
You have soft spots.

659
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,200
I thought your heart

660
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,280
It's made of stone.

661
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,400
I advise you not to do that.

662
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
You'll get anxiety.

663
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
I suddenly remembered.

664
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,120
Aren't you studying psychology?

665
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,880
So I'm telling you,

666
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Recently,

667
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,600
And anxious.

668
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,840
No, I'm anxious.

669
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,920
So can you...

670
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,040
Give me some advice.

671
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Please enlighten me.

672
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,680
You're so cheeky.

673
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,360
Why is it so thick?

674
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
You think this is your home?

675
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,600
If you want to get in, you can get out.

676
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,080
I promised my boss

677
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,520
Within a year,

678
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
The successor of Song Zihao.

679
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,560
And even more popular than Song Zihao.

680
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,320
And red.

681
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,920
But in a year,

682
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,280
Is actually not enough.

683
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,760
Because I have a poor foundation.

684
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,080
You said to send him now.

685
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,320
To study in a professional school.

686
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,360
It's too late.

687
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,240
So in a year,

688
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,520
Is actually not enough.

689
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,520
And become popular.

690
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,480
It's all about timing and talent.

691
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,160
You can't say that.

692
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,760
You'll be popular.

693
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
What if I can't?

694
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,120
Am I really going to

695
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,800
Quit the entertainment industry.

696
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,720
Don't you think so?

697
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,120
So I'm anxious now.

698
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,120
This is typical.

699
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,360
Obsessional behavior

700
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,480
If it gets worse,

701
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,480
Can cause serious mental illness.

702
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,040
I suggest you

703
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,640
Go to the psychiatric department.

704
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,360
Are you such a good teacher?

705
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,480
There's a way.

706
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,640
Give up.

707
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,480
I've said in the martial arts circles,

708
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,320
I will definitely make him popular.

709
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,360
If I give up now,

710
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
It's a slap in the face.

711
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,000
Rather than admit defeat,

712
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
I might as well be a psychopath.

713
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,120
You're lacking

714
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,200
A sense of security.

715
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,600
Everything I have today

716
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,480
All by myself.

717
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
And earned it.

718
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
I can earn money to support my family.

719
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,040
And beautiful as a flower.

720
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,640
I will be insecure.

721
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,520
Psychologically speaking,

722
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
Your behavior of asking for a kiss after drinking alcohol,

723
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Is subconsciously afraid of loneliness.

724
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,320
So I want to make physical contact

725
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,640
To relieve the loneliness.

726
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,520
The external behavior

727
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
Is overbearing and strong.

728
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,240
and

729
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,320
Don't accept other's advice.

730
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,160
And help.

731
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,720
Is very arrogant.

732
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,360
And competitive.

733
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,200
She looks strong on the surface.

734
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,360
actually

735
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,160
And vulnerable inside.

736
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,960
Can I still be saved?

737
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,840
There's no cure.

738
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,720
But there's a way.

739
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,760
What can I do?

740
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,880
Find a boyfriend.

741
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
To vent your emotions.

742
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
Don't kill while drunk.

743
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,000
To harass your male neighbor.

744
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Are you serious?

745
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,720
Are you fooling me?

746
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,000
Are you fooling me?

747
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,440
Are you going to vent now?

748
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
Even if I want to vent,

749
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,920
I wouldn't have thought of you.

750
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,520
Then don't easily

751
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,880
To a man's house.

752
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,960
You will suffer the consequences.

753
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,880
You're so flirtatious to all women.

754
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,200
Heartless

755
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,160
Look at you.

756
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,440
I didn't really love others.

757
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,560
Without feeling,

758
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
Who are you to ask me?

759
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Don't.

760
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,200
Be rather baffling

761
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,560
What's wrong with you?

762
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,160
She studied psychology.

763
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,880
EQ is so low.

764
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
My problems haven't been solved.

765
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
It's a waste of my time.

766
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,840
You're so flirtatious to all women.

767
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,040
Heartless

768
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,200
Look at you.

769
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,160
I didn't really love others.

770
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Without feeling,

771
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,640
We're here.

772
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,720
A very big sofa.

773
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,320
all right?

774
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,280
Then what?

775
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
If we have a fight,

776
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,120
I will punish you for sleeping on the couch.

777
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,440
It's been three years.

778
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm finally back.

779
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,280
Where is this?

780
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,760
This is our home.

781
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,400
Didn't you say that

782
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,320
Get married if you have a house?

783
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,360
You have a house now.

784
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,280
Marry me

785
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,040
Stop it.

786
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,560
I just came back.

787
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,360
After two years,

788
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,280
You're training today.

789
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,440
Your vital capacity

790
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,880
To improve your singing and speaking.

791
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,440
The problem of unstable breath.

792
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,680
Swimming is good for vital capacity.

793
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,200
The best sport.

794
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,040
Don't tell me.

795
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,600
You're a big girl.

796
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,560
Can't swim.

797
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,960
Alright.

798
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,080
Take off the towel.

799
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,640
down

800
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,400
I'll count to three.

801
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,720
When I said one, two, three,

802
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,560
Go down.

803
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,480
When I blew the whistle,

804
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,400
Get up again.

805
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,400
Understand?

806
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,720
down

807
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,120
sister

808
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,960
You're so slow.

809
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
How to be an actress?

810
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,640
What are you doing over there?

811
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,800
down

812
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,560
sister

813
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,320
sister

814
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,680
Hold your breath.

815
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,120
down

816
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,240
You'll be fine.

817
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,640
When you hear my whistle,

818
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
You have to get up.

819
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,600
You can get up now.

820
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,080
You can get up now.

821
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,400
Sida

822
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,520
Sida

823
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Sida

824
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Sida

825
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,960
Sida

826
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,280
Just cough it up.

827
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,000
Sida

828
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,040
Sida

829
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,680
Sixstar

830
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Why did you pass out again?

831
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,560
Sida

832
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,000
sister

833
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,360
Are you recovered?

834
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,760
Why can't you swim?

835
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,360
You didn't tell me at first.

836
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,760
You scared me to death.

837
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

838
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,080
I can't do anything.

839
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,280
Like a drag bottle.

840
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,040
I was afraid you wouldn't want me.

841
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
Why can't you swim?

842
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,480
There are many things you can't do.

843
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,080
Am I going to abandon you?

844
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,600
To sign a contract with you.

845
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
What does it mean?

846
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,600
I have no idea

847
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,960
Represents a promise.

848
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,920
I promise I will always support you.

849
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,840
To protect you.

850
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,680
Do you know

851
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
So if there's anything else,

852
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,960
Don't hide it from me.

853
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
Tell me everything.

854
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,880
Well

855
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,000
wrong

856
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,320
You just woke up.

857
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,080
Why did you pass out suddenly?

858
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,640
Are you feeling ill?

859
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,560
Or when it's over,

860
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,520
Take you to that hospital.

861
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,760
Check it, okay?

862
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,280
No, just now.

863
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,360
I thought you wanted to kiss me.

864
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,280
I passed out when I was nervous.

865
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,080
What are you thinking?

866
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,960
Neuropathy

867
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,400
I'll give you artificial breathing.

868
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,120
And passed out.

869
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
What's there to be nervous about?

870
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,920
You haven't kissed her, right?

871
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,720
No,

872
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,960
You're so handsome.

873
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,160
I haven't kissed him.

874
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,800
Haven't you been in a relationship before?

875
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,960
No,

876
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,080
Since I was young, I've been dealing with men.

877
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
I was nervous.

878
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,080
Then I asked the doctor.

879
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,880
The doctor said

880
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,200
I have a heterosexual disorder.

881
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,520
What is heterosexual communication disorder?

882
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,880
I have no idea

883
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,800
Then why are you

884
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,120
How can I be an actor in the future?

885
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,440
Without feelings, there is no soul.

886
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,280
Good actor.

887
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,880
They are very affectionate.

888
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,120
You have to be in love and pain.

889
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,080
He wanted to hurt someone, but he was also hurt.

890
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,480
Then you will understand.

891
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,600
Pleasure, anger, sorrow, joy

892
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
So that you can put your true feelings

893
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,800
Into the play.

894
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,320
With real emotions,

895
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,920
To interpret other people's lives.

896
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,719
sister

897
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,199
Are you...

898
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,440
I've been in a lot of relationships.

899
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,960
I remember it very well.

900
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,840
then

901
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,639
Hurt you so much.

902
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,040
Yes

903
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,600
About my lord,

904
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,760
Don't ask so many questions.

905
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,880
It's none of your business

906
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,239
I'm curious. How dare you hide?

907
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
You're hiding from me.

908
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,400
Sister, sister.

909
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,000
Do you think I...

910
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,000
We can't catch up.

911
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,320
Nice

912
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,320
You are holding your breath this time.

913
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,920
More than 30 seconds.

914
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,880
You can come up now.

915
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,640
good

916
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,800
He's so handsome.

917
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,840
sister

918
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,160
I have thought of what I want you to be.

919
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,960
What?

920
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
model

921
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
You're so handsome.

922
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
And has a good figure.

923
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,240
It's a waste.

924
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,240
I don't want to be a model. I...

925
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
Never treat yourself

926
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,200
I don't want to do anything I haven't done.

927
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
As a model,

928
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,360
Can be red.

929
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,200
If you become popular,

930
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,560
A lot of people come to you to shoot.

931
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,000
A lot of people come to you to shoot.

932
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
You can still be an actor.

933
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,320
But I...

934
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,720
Recite the rules of the artist.

935
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,440
yes

936
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,320
I only need

937
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,200
Listen to you alone.

938
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,320
Everything you asked me to do,

939
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I have to do it.

940
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,160
What you don't want me to do.

941
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,400
I can't even think about it.

942
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
I can't not reply to you.

943
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,600
Hiding from you, lying to you.

944
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,680
The phone is 24 hours.

945
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
You must keep it on.

946
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,400
Within two minutes,

947
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,240
You must reply.

948
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,640
If you point to the east, I can't go west.

949
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,360
You asked me to be a vegetarian.

950
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,480
I can't go out and cheat.

951
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,960
Right?

952
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,320
Would I hurt you?

953
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,200
but

954
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,000
Sister, I can't even walk on stage.

955
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,440
Where can I be a model?

956
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,240
Don't worry about it.

957
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,480
This is my ability.

958
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,080
Alright

959
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,600
President Ji.

960
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,800
The models

961
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm almost ready.

962
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
You can practice at any time.

963
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,440
Where's Phil?

964
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,320
You didn't tell her?

965
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,520
I've told her.

966
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,600
Getting changed.

967
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,240
Aren't you coming?

968
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,360
I'm a very

969
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,640
Who has a sense of time.

970
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,080
Although this is just a rehearsal,

971
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,880
But you shouldn't waste it.

972
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,440
Everyone's time

973
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
I'm waiting for you to change.

974
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,760
Mr. Ji just signed the contract with me.

975
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,040
Let me rehearse.

976
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,400
You know how to seize the time.

977
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,640
Since you don't like to waste time,

978
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,640
Then let's start.

979
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,640
President Ji.

980
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,760
Big models are different.

981
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,760
Come on.

982
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,560
Stop the music.

983
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,520
Come down.

984
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,520
I

985
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,280
What's wrong?

986
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,280
Now,

987
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
It's not what I want.

988
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,760
this

989
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,680
What do you mean?

990
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,200
It's a bigger show.

991
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,200
I have.

992
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
You invited me here.

993
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,920
Now you're saying that

994
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm not what you want.

995
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,040
Are you trying to embarrass me?

996
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,720
Because you're not confident enough.

997
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,040
You've been subconsciously

998
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,240
Imitate the American and European models.

999
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,880
Exaggerated steps and facial expressions.

1000
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,240
To attract attention,

1001
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,760
To attract people's attention.

1002
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,440
Because you're extremely insecure.

1003
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,600
Too many distracting thoughts.

1004
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,560
This is not what I want.

1005
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,400
No

1006
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,360
Mr. Ji, stop it.

1007
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
Our Fei's body and face

1008
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,560
It's everywhere.

1009
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,920
How could you not be confident?

1010
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,000
Let him finish.

1011
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,880
Everyone's definition of beauty

1012
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,800
Are different.

1013
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
In my opinion,

1014
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,920
A beautiful woman.

1015
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,400
It's not because of her impressive figure.

1016
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
A pretty face.

1017
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,320
But because of the unique temperament.

1018
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,160
And personality.

1019
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,080
I signed you to Wing Fashion.

1020
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,240
Because I want your share.

1021
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,320
The one and only temperament.

1022
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,240
Not just the way you look.

1023
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,840
And now you're being punished

1024
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,480
The common definition of beauty

1025
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,320
And give up your own characteristics.

1026
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
What a pity.

1027
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,240
Mr. Ji, your suggestion.

1028
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,680
I will accept it humbly.

1029
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,080
After all, I'm a professional.

1030
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,640
Don't worry.

1031
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,200
As long as it's what you want,

1032
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,720
I have both.

1033
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,640
Yes, yes. It's all there.

1034
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,720
Let's change to another one.

1035
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,520
Hold on.

1036
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,560
Mr. Ji, look.

1037
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,400
Although it's the same suit,

1038
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,920
It's totally different.

1039
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,840
A lot of energy.

1040
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Also

1041
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,200
I think you just did that.

1042
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,240
It's really great to suppress it first.

1043
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,800
I thought

1044
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,120
You two will argue.

1045
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,160
But unexpectedly,

1046
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,880
You made Phyl submissive.

1047
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,400
Women still need to be coaxed.

1048
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,880
You've completely conquered her.

1049
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,480
She's only a model in my eyes.

1050
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,640
Partnership

1051
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Phil!

1052
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,360
Goddess.

1053
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
You can't even see it.

1054
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,800
Do you really like

1055
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
What kind of woman?

1056
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,480
Chen Fei.

1057
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,480
Did you offend Zimmer?

1058
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,000
Why would he

1059
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,120
There are so many people talking about you.

1060
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,440
I think he's right.

1061
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,040
At first, I walked

1062
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,760
A little too casual.

1063
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,200
But Ji Mo

1064
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,080
He's so sharp.

1065
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,160
You know what?

1066
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Every time I talk to him,

1067
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,920
I always have

1068
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,840
As if I was seen through.

1069
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,440
You know,

1070
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
Could he be

1071
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,120
It's intentionally caused.

1072
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,440
My attention.

1073
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,480
You've gone through so many rounds.

1074
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,760
Actually, it's just a compliment.

1075
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,880
With unique temperament.

1076
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,160
You're thinking too much.

1077
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,120
Really?

1078
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,880
You're not sharp enough.

1079
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,600
If you don't,

1080
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,880
How could he be single?

1081
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,080
I think that Aaron

1082
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,920
It's pretty good.

1083
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,840
Do you want it?

1084
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,840
To set you up.

1085
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,840
Are you trying to set me up with Aaron?

1086
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,560
still

1087
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,800
Tell me the truth.

1088
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,960
Are you interested in Zimmer?

1089
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,120
Why don't you

1090
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,400
Don't go to the show.

1091
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,680
In front of people.

1092
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Take off your clothes.

1093
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,160
You wouldn't understand.

1094
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,480
In a word, this man

1095
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm getting more and more interested in him.

1096
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,200
Chen Fei'er, you're amazing.

1097
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,560
Are you trying to cause trouble?

1098
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,840
What about

1099
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,320
Do you want to help me?

1100
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,800
Can I not help you?

1101
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,880
But I'm really

1102
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,680
A little sad.

1103
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,600
You're so proactive.

1104
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,160
Ask me out.

1105
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,000
I thought you missed me.

1106
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,680
I didn't expect that

1107
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,960
Let me help you take the newbies.
