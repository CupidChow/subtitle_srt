1
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,960
Me,

2
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,560
Me

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,840
Do you want to borrow Ji Mo for a few hours?

4
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,160
Not bad.

5
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
Actually,

6
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,640
you can go if you want.

7
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
You don't have to ask me.

8
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,919
Am I that stingy?

9
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
Just go and have fun.

10
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,760
Just ignore me.

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,560
Go ahead.

12
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,800
It's a little cold.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,800
Put on more clothes,

14
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Thank you.

15
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
No need.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,880
Don't worry.

17
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,200
It won't be too far.

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
I'm relieved.

19
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,200
You don't have to ask me.

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
Go ahead and have fun.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
Have fun.

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
Thank you.

23
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,880
You're welcome.

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Goodbye.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,720
Goodbye.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,000
This should be

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
our third time here, right?

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,560
From now on,

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
I don't think he'll come.

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,080
When you recover,

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,920
you can do it yourself.

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,200
No, I'm leaving.

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,640
Get out of here.

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,120
Go abroad for treatment.

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,320
During this period of time,

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,840
it's really hard for you.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,440
I'm sorry,

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
No.

39
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
I was going to make it up to you.

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,760
But I hurt you.

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,400
I heard from your brother,

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
you sent that email, right?

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,360
Wing Fashion is my dream.

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
You helped me realize my dream.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,000
How can I see it destroyed?

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,280
And maybe,

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
I still trust my brother

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,240
more in my heart.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
That's why

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
I dare to post the photos.

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
Because I know,

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,480
he will understand eventually.

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,400
Forgive me.

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
Ji Mo,

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm selfishly asking you

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,480
to forgive my brother

58
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,160
for what he did before,

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,280
because

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,160
He did this because of me.

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,519
Okay?

62
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,920
Did he do this

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,280
because of

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,320
my mistakes?

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
You didn't miss it,

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
but I missed it.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,440
Three years ago,

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,760
when I left,

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,600
I really think I'm very brave.

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
But now that I think about it,

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
running away is really cowardly.

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
Sometimes I think,

73
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
if I hadn't left three years ago,

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,400
We really won't miss it.

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
We'll be together.

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,280
Maybe I still don't believe it enough.

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,480
Your love for me.

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Do you like someone?

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Is it because you can see all his strengths,

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
and love someone?

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
I can accept all his shortcomings,

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
but I'm always afraid of you,

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
You saw my imperfect side,

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,280
but you made me understand.

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
What is true love?

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,440
Thank you, Ji Mo.

87
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,280
Don't be nervous.

88
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,840
I just want to hear your heartbeat.

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
Actually,

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,840
when I was doing treatment abroad,

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,680
I want to hear your heartbeat.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,640
flop

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Plop,

94
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,400
strong and powerful,

95
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,440
It's good to be back alive

96
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,880
and hear it.

97
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,080
Ji Mo,

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,000
do you love Ruonan?

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes, I love her very much.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
In fact, during this period of time,

101
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
I was really surprised.

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,960
I finally know

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,600
why you like

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,320
Dugu Ruonan,

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
She's a lovely woman.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,320
You're strong and real.

107
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
Actually, in the past,

108
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
I thought of you being with her.

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
That's why I'm annoyed.

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,320
But when I think about it,

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,000
I think,

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,760
Luckily, it's her who's with you.

113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,280
Ji Mo,

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
goodbye.

115
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
I heard it.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,720
What did you hear?

117
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,880
I heard you saying in your heart,

118
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
finally

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
You can make up with Ji Mo.

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Finally, today is the day.

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,800
No way.

122
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
I didn't say anything.

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
-You're not being

124
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,880
honest. -Okay.

125
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
Be honest first.

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
What did Su Xiao tell you?

127
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,640
She said

128
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,360
she likes you very much.

129
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
It seems that

130
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,600
she has a good taste.

131
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
You have a good taste, too.

132
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,680
Don't flatter yourself,

133
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,800
you're still guilty.

134
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
What crime have I committed?

135
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,720
However,

136
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm quite generous.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
Let bygones be bygones.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,120
But in the future,

139
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,600
whether it's coercion or inducement,

140
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,400
You can't just go out alone

141
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,320
with another woman.

142
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,000
In your eyes,

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm the only one you can see.

144
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay, I'll make an oath then.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
From today on,

146
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,960
I can only give Dugu Ruonan,

147
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
You cook alone.

148
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,000
I made the soup.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,400
I can only give it to you alone.

150
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,880
Are you

151
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,120
the only co-pilot

152
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
who can sit on my bed?

153
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,280
I'll only sleep for you.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
What are you thinking?

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,039
All in all,

156
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,360
I, Ji Mo,

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,600
only belong to Dugu Ruonan.

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
Ai Li, a coward,

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,840
ran away after he confessed.

160
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,240
I haven't even received a letter these days.

161
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,800
What do you mean by him?

162
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
A man is really

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,440
so coy,

164
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,360
What do you think he meant?

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,960
I really don't get it.

166
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
Help me analyze it.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
Not a single WeChat message.

168
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,600
If it were you,

169
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,960
Won't you be angry?

170
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,800
If he doesn't want to see you,

171
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,760
go find him.

172
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
Just get him back.

173
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
Aren't you familiar with this kind of trick?

174
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm Chen Fei'er.

175
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
I took the initiative,

176
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,960
I chased him so actively,

177
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,000
but now you want me to do it backwards?

178
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Are you listening to me?

179
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I got it. I got it.

180
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,840
Okay, I'll continue.

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
What did I just say?

182
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,760
Posting it backwards?

183
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,240
Posting it backwards?

184
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,280
It's impossible.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,760
I got it.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
He must be playing with me.

188
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
Playing hard to get?

189
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,840
Little one,

190
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
can't I cure him?

191
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
Anyway, if he doesn't look for me,

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
I won't look for him.

193
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
It's a big deal to take a beat and break up,

194
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,120
and go back to our homes.

195
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
Let me ask you,

196
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,560
face matters.

197
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Or is Ali more important?

198
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
Can Ali compare with my face? Do you think

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
so?

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,720
But,

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
It seems that without Ali,

202
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,280
my face

203
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,920
would be useless.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,320
Don't worry about it.

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Go find him.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
He must be waiting for you.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,080
You know how he feels about you,

208
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,840
but in front of the person he loves,

209
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,440
You just have to

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,280
be honest and say

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,200
what you think,

212
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,800
Because he loves

213
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,600
the real you.

214
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,800
But, you know, people like Ali,

215
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,440
I go further,

216
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
He can take 80 steps back.

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,800
I have to think of a cruel trick

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
to force him to submit.

219
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Yes.

220
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,800
Have you thought of it?

221
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,480
No.

222
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,360
Think about it.

223
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,080
Are you thinking about it for me?

224
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,560
Yes,

225
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Do you really have one?

226
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Yes

227
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,760
Sida?

228
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,200
Morning,

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,960
Where's Qiansha?

230
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,720
Qiansha didn't come to

231
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,800
the crew today. Isn't it a break today?

232
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,480
I think she's not feeling well.

233
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,200
She asked for leave.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,280
Please give this

235
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,040
to her for me.

236
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay,

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,400
Thank you.

238
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
You're here?

239
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,120
I thought

240
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
I'd never see you again.

241
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
Is there anything you want to tell me?

242
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,760
I didn't go to the company.

243
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,440
I know.

244
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,160
You must have

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
breathed a sigh of relief.

246
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,800
That haunting ghost,

247
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,960
finally, doesn't bother you anymore.

248
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,000
No, no, no,

249
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,600
I don't think

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,720
you're particularly annoying either,

251
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,480
I just... I just think

252
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,880
that I,

253
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,880
I'm just kidding.

254
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
I just

255
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
sorted out

256
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
the things between us a little bit,

257
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
I remember

258
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
my unrequited love for you,

259
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,520
I think it started

260
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,120
at the bus stop.

261
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,560
Let's

262
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,520
say goodbye here.

263
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,120
Like I said,

264
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't like to take the bus,

265
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,720
But when I sit down,

266
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,560
I like it.

267
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,160
You don't like me now,

268
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,880
but if you look at me,

269
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,800
Then you like it.

270
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
I suddenly found out today,

271
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,880
seem

272
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,640
The bus is still not suitable for me.

273
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,480
I won't pester you anymore.

274
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,640
My Unrequited Love bus, Shen Qiansha,

275
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
has finally arrived.

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
I remember.

277
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,320
I told you,

278
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,120
what if one day

279
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,920
you give up on Ruonan?

280
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,440
I'll give up on you.

281
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,520
Yes.

282
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,360
Sida?

283
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,200
Today,

284
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,320
I, Shen Qiansha,

285
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
I finally gave up on you.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,280
I gave up on you.

287
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,120
I gave up on you.

288
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,320
Qiansha,

289
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,320
Qiansha,

290
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm leaving.

291
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,080
Look at me.

292
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Only when you're far away

293
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,640
can you leave.

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,760
Before that,

295
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
I followed you all the time.

296
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,600
this time

297
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
It's my turn to leave you behind.

298
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,640
Qiansha,

299
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Qiansha.

300
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,120
Qiansha.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,600
Qiansha,

302
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Qiansha, don't go.

303
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Hold my hand.

304
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
Don't fall down again.

305
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,080
Sida?

306
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,760
Sida?

307
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,320
Sida?

308
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,760
I like you.

309
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,760
After everything I've been through,

310
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,360
I suddenly realized,

311
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,520
I seem to like

312
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,400
this profession a lot,

313
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,640
Even if there is

314
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,120
a little bit of feedback.

315
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
I'll be very satisfied.

316
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,480
Maybe this is the dream

317
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
you mentioned,

318
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm lucky.

319
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,880
I found it.

320
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,960
I noticed that there's light

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,800
in your eyes.

322
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,280
Thank you.

323
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,320
Qiansha,

324
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,800
Sida?

325
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,200
Who is it?

326
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,960
Okay, I'm coming.

327
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,280
Enough. Stop pressing it.

328
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,319
Who is it?

329
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
Chen Fei'er Chen Fei'er,

330
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,960
Chen Fei'er, Chen Fei'er,

331
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,720
Don't hit anyone, okay?

332
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,400
Just talk it out, okay?

333
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,960
Stop!

334
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,920
Stop right there!

335
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,520
Why are you so weak?

336
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,360
Why do you always want to do it?

337
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
Can you talk nicely?

338
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,600
Chen Fei'er,

339
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,280
Ali,

340
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
Talk nicely. Stop right there.

341
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,200
I really have something to tell you.

342
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,200
Listen,

343
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm only going to say this once,

344
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,480
After we pass through this village,

345
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,320
we won't have this shop anymore.

346
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
I, Chen Fei'er,

347
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,880
want to have a face,

348
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,040
You have to have a body,

349
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,840
but not as

350
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
gentle and considerate as you want,

351
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
I'm vain, willful,

352
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,520
temperamental

353
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,680
and pretentious,

354
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,520
But,

355
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,480
I like you.

356
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,160
I really like you.

357
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,200
You know I'm impatient,

358
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,400
and I like someone,

359
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,160
I can't wait

360
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,280
to be with him,

361
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,840
So I can't stand waiting.

362
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,680
Will you accept me or not?

363
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,760
Give me an accurate answer.

364
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,640
How could you confess your love like this?

365
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,160
You said so many shortcomings,

366
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
and you scared him away.

367
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,240
Then run away.

368
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,720
If you run 10 meters, I'll chase you for 9 meters,

369
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,560
if you run 800 meters, I'll chase you for 6 meters.

370
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,800
799 meters.

371
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,040
Why is it always one meter short?

372
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,520
Because the distance between us

373
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,680
is one meter,

374
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
I'll leave a distance of one meter,

375
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,320
waiting for you to come to me.

376
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,480
If I can't

377
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,680
catch up with you all the time,

378
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,960
Would you like to

379
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,560
pick me up and then,

380
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,760
And come with me.

381
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,760
Yes, I do.

382
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,840
However,

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,080
I also have shortcomings,

384
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,440
I'm selfish.

385
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,840
Unless you prove to the world,

386
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,640
I'm your boyfriend.

387
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
My whole world is you.

388
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,680
All right,

389
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,200
my dear babies,

390
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,520
I made it.

391
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,760
Everyone present

392
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,680
can testify for me.

393
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,120
As long as I kiss him,

394
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,160
he will be my man.

395
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,880
And his name is Ai

396
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,760
Chen Fei'er. I love you.

397
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,160
Qiansha,

398
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,720
let's sit here,

399
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,160
It's been half an hour.

400
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,360
If you don't say a word,

401
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,240
won't it be awkward?

402
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,080
As a lovelorn person,

403
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
I was sad for half an hour,

404
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,640
Is it too much?

405
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
You haven't even started dating yet.

406
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,280
What kind of brokenhearted is this?

407
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm in

408
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
unrequited love.

409
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm not lovelorn.

410
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,520
Why?

411
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,920
Why doesn't the person

412
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,960
I like like like me?

413
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,320
I may,

414
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,440
I may never be tempted again

415
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
in my life.

416
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Why?

417
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,360
Why is it so hard

418
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
to fall in love with someone.

419
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,080
No,

420
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,960
you can't do anything.

421
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,000
So extreme.

422
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,280
Did you fall once?

423
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,040
I won't walk anymore.

424
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,760
Don't you want to eat after throwing up once?

425
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,040
No,

426
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,040
you really won't be tempted anymore.

427
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
Are you sure you won't fall in love

428
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
with another person?

429
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,080
I think Star

430
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,880
is the best person

431
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,680
in the world,

432
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,000
I feel like I'm going to die alone

433
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
for the rest of my life.

434
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,000
Why is he the best?

435
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,320
I think I'm better than him.

436
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,400
Don't flatter yourself.

437
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,400
Well,

438
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
why don't you go to the hospital every day?

439
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,880
When I was in trouble,

440
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,080
you were more anxious than anyone else.

441
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,640
Do you dare to say that

442
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,920
you don't like me at all?

443
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,320
I came to the hospital to see you.

444
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,040
It's because I feel sorry

445
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,200
for you. It's sympathy.

446
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,840
It's not feelings.

447
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
Wake up.

448
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,640
Just be stubborn.

449
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Let me tell you,

450
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,880
the charm of my superstar,

451
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,040
No one can stop him.

452
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,480
But

453
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,120
even if you don't like me now,

454
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
I can keep chasing you.

455
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
I'll surely get you.

456
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,280
Don't chase me!

457
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,560
Don't chase me!

458
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,320
Don't chase me! Don't chase me!

459
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,800
Don't chase him!

460
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,640
Shen Qiansha,

461
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,280
I won't let go again

462
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
this time.

463
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Listen to me,

464
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
if you're sad in the future,

465
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,400
You can come to me anytime.

466
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,440
Where is the chest of a superstar like me?

467
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
I can lend it to you for free.

468
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,080
This is your exclusive

469
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,120
hooligan.

470
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,720
My woman is so cute.

471
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
What are your plans in the future?

472
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,320
What plan can I have?

473
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,720
I've been fired from the company.

474
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,280
If you don't have a job now,

475
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,440
look for it again.

476
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,960
Unfortunately, now everyone in the industry knows that

477
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
I was kicked out by Yuxing.

478
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,240
No one wants to invite me again.

479
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,680
Actually, you can live a better life.

480
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,120
It's just that you're too impatient.

481
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm really anxious. I'm already

482
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
in my thirties.

483
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
I have no friends, no lovers,

484
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,400
and no one loves me.

485
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,960
I seldom contact my parents.

486
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,480
Every once in a while,

487
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,960
he asks me for living expenses,

488
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,640
Did you ask me if I got promoted?

489
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Did you get a raise?

490
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,400
I know.

491
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,600
Children should be dutiful

492
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
to their parents.

493
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
I worked hard, too.

494
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,960
But I'm not

495
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,240
a money-making machine either,

496
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,520
During the three years I've been by your side,

497
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,200
everything you've given me,

498
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,920
I've been working very hard on it.

499
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,960
Because I hope

500
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,160
you can see,

501
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,480
I'm capable.

502
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,280
I am an independent person.

503
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,920
I don't want to live in

504
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,480
anyone's shadow anymore,

505
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
I want a life of my own.

506
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
Is it wrong for me to do so?

507
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,640
You got your life in the wrong order.

508
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,240
People have to have themselves before they have others.

509
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,000
You should live for yourself.

510
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,280
Instead of living in other people's

511
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,360
comments and eyes.

512
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,560
If you still have

513
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,480
hope for yourself,

514
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,360
Then live a good life.

515
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,800
Start over.

516
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,680
This is the name card of Star Brokerage

517
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Director,

518
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
I've already talked to him.

519
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
You have the ability and experience.

520
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,080
In the past, you can bring artists directly,

521
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,400
so you don't have to feel sorry for me.

522
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,320
Because I'm not worth it.

523
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't feel sorry for you.

524
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,360
I just hope that

525
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,680
you can respect yourself,

526
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,920
We've been fighting for so long,

527
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,480
and now we've finally stopped fighting?

528
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,600
From now on, we'll go our separate ways.

529
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,640
If we meet again,

530
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,400
we won't be friends.

531
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
But I hope,

532
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,920
you will be a good opponent.

533
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,080
Take care.

534
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,720
Tong Tong,

535
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,640
it's a good thing you're in the company,

536
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,960
You're the one I trust the most.

537
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,160
With you by my side,

538
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,440
I feel much more at ease.

539
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,520
When we're done with this,

540
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,760
I'll tell the boss,

541
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,480
I'll promote you to be Deputy Director of Brokerage.

542
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,080
Hello.

543
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,680
It feels like everything is familiar,

544
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,000
as if

545
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
it just happened yesterday.

546
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Yes.

547
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
The location hasn't changed,

548
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,240
and the people haven't changed.

549
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,440
But I've changed my mind.

550
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,680
That's why the wine has changed.

551
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
What's the difference with this wine?

552
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
It's made

553
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,320
from lime that's about

554
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,600
to go bad.

555
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,560
It's sour in your mouth,

556
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,480
but after you swallow it,

557
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,440
There will be a hint of sweetness on the tip of your tongue.

558
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,680
Does it have a name?

559
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,760
Yes,

560
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,440
Call me,

561
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,360
It's been a long goodbye.

562
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
I'm taking Xiaoxiao away.

563
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
Take her abroad for treatment.

564
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,360
But before I left,

565
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,280
I thought twice about it.

566
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,440
I still want to see you again.

567
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,440
I want to say so much,

568
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,040
but I don't know where to start,

569
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,720
So I made this glass of wine.

570
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,560
Put everything I want to say

571
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,480
in this glass of wine.

572
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,960
I hope someday,

573
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,080
when you think of me,

574
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
Not only sour,

575
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,120
how many

576
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,520
It will be a little sweet.

577
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,880
Now that I think about it,

578
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,440
it seems that

579
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,520
ever since you appeared in my life.

580
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,880
A lot of things happened

581
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,840
in the beginning,

582
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,640
Your shadow is everywhere.

583
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,280
Yeah,

584
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,640
I've done so many

585
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,840
paranoid things,

586
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,800
I've caused you

587
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,880
so much trouble,

588
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,040
Do you regret knowing me?

589
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,040
No, I won't.

590
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,200
On the contrary, I'm grateful to you.

591
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,200
If it hadn't been for you,

592
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
Ji Mo and I might have stayed

593
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
in the ambiguous stage forever.

594
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,600
He won't leave Su Xiao

595
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,240
and doesn't dare to love me.

596
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,480
Because of you,

597
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,000
those old memories

598
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
are in front of each other.

599
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,920
He can put an end to the past.

600
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,600
And I know

601
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,080
my heart better,

602
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,240
Sometimes I think,

603
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,320
maybe it's because of you,

604
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,160
That's why the two of us

605
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,440
will get closer.

606
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
The truth is right,

607
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,560
but it sounds like,

608
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm the catalyst

609
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
for your love,

610
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,720
Actually, there's a question

611
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,880
I've been meaning to ask you,

612
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,920
if

613
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,720
I knew you earlier than Ji Mo.

614
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,800
Will you fall in love with me?

615
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,480
Okay,

616
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,800
It seems that

617
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,120
I really should

618
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,920
give up completely.

619
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,520
I really don't like

620
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,440
Ji Mo, right?

621
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,880
But the two most important people

622
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,120
in my life,

623
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,920
They all fell in love with him.

624
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,840
Maybe it also shows that

625
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,880
he is the best person.

626
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,640
And you, too,

627
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,280
deserve to be loved by the best.

628
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,600
I don't need the best.

629
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,320
I just need the one that suits me the best.

630
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
But thank you

631
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
for everything you've done for me.

632
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,640
If one day,

633
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
you need any help.

634
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,240
Please remember,

635
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,680
you have an old friend,

636
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,080
I can show up for you at any time.

637
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,960
I can help you at any time.

638
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,320
I'll always stand behind you.

639
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,240
Be your back road.

640
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,560
If the male or female sister

641
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,440
is raining due to the weather,

642
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,120
So we temporarily

643
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,000
changed the venue.

644
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,280
Star might have to wait a little longer.

645
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,080
It's okay,

646
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,360
Why is Song Zihao here?

647
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,480
Isn't he sick?

648
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,200
Didn't he beat Sida before?

649
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,920
He's not here to cause trouble, is he?

650
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,520
Thank you.

651
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,160
Good morning.

652
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,680
Good morning.

653
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,720
Morning

654
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,240
Ruonan

655
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,120
is good.

656
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,760
You're being polite.

657
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,080
I feel like I've grown up.

658
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
I've grown up a long time ago, okay?

659
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,720
I'm just a little older,

660
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,840
I know.

661
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,880
I was too immature before.

662
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,840
I asked you to clean up

663
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,960
a lot of mess for me.

664
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,920
Sorry for the trouble.

665
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,720
It's good that you know it.

666
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,520
Well,

667
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,240
thank you and I'm sorry.

668
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,040
What?

669
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,960
I didn't hear you clearly.

670
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
I said I'm sorry.

671
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,200
Thank you.

672
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,840
I don't know how to say thank you.

673
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,880
You're just fooling around.

674
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,440
Why are you thanking me?

675
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
A few days ago,

676
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Sida came to the hospital to see me,

677
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,080
He told me everything

678
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,240
that happened after I passed out.

679
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,960
I didn't give up on you.

680
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,680
I know.

681
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,240
You've never given up on me.

682
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,680
It's just that

683
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,840
there's something wrong

684
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,800
with my mentality.

685
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm jealous of Sida.

686
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,760
I'm even more jealous that you have a new person around you,

687
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,720
that's why I put the cart before the horse,

688
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,040
Use extreme tactics

689
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,520
to attract your attention.

690
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,200
In the end, not only did you hurt others.

691
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,000
I hurt myself, too.

692
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,120
Ruonan,

693
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,040
I know what I did was wrong.

694
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,000
A lot of things

695
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,840
have caused you

696
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,800
a lot of trouble,

697
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,360
So I want to

698
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,800
apologize to you today.

699
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,400
Sis,

700
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm sorry.

701
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,560
I hope you can forgive me.

702
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,680
Silly boy.

703
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,720
It's all in the past.

704
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
I've never blamed you.

705
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,800
Actually, after your accident,

706
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
I reflected a lot.

707
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,840
In the past,

708
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,840
I always asked you

709
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,880
by my own standards.

710
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,080
Because I value your ability very much,

711
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,120
but I ignore

712
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,560
the pressure you have to bear,

713
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,800
On the surface, I succeeded,

714
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,200
but in fact,

715
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,640
I think I failed.

716
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,000
Because I lost

717
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,160
that healthy and happy Song Zihao,

718
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,680
In fact,

719
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,040
after what you said to me today,

720
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,560
I'm very happy,

721
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,880
because you've really grown up.

722
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,480
I hope from now on,

723
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,960
we all have to move on.

724
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,160
I wish I could see

725
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,680
the swaggering Song Zihao

726
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,320
I knew back then

727
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,640
Sis,

728
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,160
You didn't fail in my heart.

729
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,520
He will always be

730
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,720
the best agent.

731
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,360
If I were good,

732
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,600
I wouldn't have made you sick.

733
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
How are you?

734
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Are you feeling better?

735
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,880
It's not completely cured yet,

736
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,120
but I've learned to

737
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,400
live in peace with it.

738
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,920
I'm relieved

739
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,000
to hear you say that.

740
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,400
You didn't happen

741
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,040
to just come to see me today.

742
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,760
Where is she?

743
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,000
Sida, why don't you wear this today?

744
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,520
Put the script there first.

745
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,600
Not bad.

746
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,120
Hair.

747
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,440
Shen Qiansha,

748
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
what are you doing?

749
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,920
Song Zihao,

750
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,920
why are you here?

751
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,840
If I don't come,

752
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,520
you'll stick it on his face right away.

753
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,640
Brother Hao, you misunderstood.

754
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,400
Shut up!

755
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,320
Nonsense.

756
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,480
Come with me.

757
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,960
You,

758
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,440
What are you doing?

759
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm working?

760
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,360
Still working?

761
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,680
Put me down.

762
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,760
There are so many people.

763
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,720
Put me down.

764
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,840
Song Zihao,

765
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,160
put me down.

766
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,600
What are you doing?

767
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,120
Don't hug me

768
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,840
in front of others.

769
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,960
So embarrassing.

770
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,200
Aren't you ashamed

771
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,520
to be close to another man openly?

772
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
That's different.

773
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,160
What's the difference?

774
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
Tell me

775
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,080
what's different?

776
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,080
Sida is my artist,

777
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,120
You are.

778
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,080
What am I?

779
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,840
You're a pain in the ass.

780
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,480
What are you doing here?

781
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,400
How dare you ask me

782
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,760
for so long,

783
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,720
Why didn't you come to see me?

784
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
You didn't come even if I was discharged from the hospital.

785
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,280
She didn't answer the phone.

786
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,040
You didn't reply to my WeChat messages.

787
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,800
What do you mean?

788
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,640
Me,

789
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,480
I'm busy.

790
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,720
I'm very busy.

791
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm so busy

792
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,920
every day,

793
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,160
And I don't want to see you.

794
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,920
What do I do

795
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,760
as soon as I see you?

796
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,040
I'm just...

797
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,960
I'm just a mess.

798
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,360
I'm so confused.

799
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,440
I'm so confused.

800
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,320
And I can,

801
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,440
I can also panic.

802
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll give it back.

803
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,800
I'll give it back.

804
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,120
My heart rate is also tachycardia.

805
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,840
My heart is flustered,

806
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,280
my heart rate is too fast,

807
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,200
Isn't your heart beating faster?

808
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,280
I see.

809
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,240
You're avoiding me on purpose.

810
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Because you have fallen in love with me.

811
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,120
Who likes you?

812
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,480
I'm crazy. I like you.

813
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,800
Yes, you are crazy.

814
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,040
Love can drive people

815
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,000
crazy. Shameless.

816
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,840
You're

817
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,120
right. I'm shameless.

818
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,120
If you can like me,

819
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,280
I can give up everything.

820
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,720
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

821
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm leaving.

822
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,920
I asked you to come here today

823
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,400
to talk about business

824
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,480
with you. Business,

825
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,160
What business do you want to see me for?

826
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,880
I saw on the company's website

827
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,640
that you're looking for an assistant,

828
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,120
That's good.

829
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,040
I just lost my job.

830
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,640
I might as well condescend

831
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
to be your assistant.

832
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,000
Song Zihao,

833
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,840
you're my assistant,

834
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,120
What do you think?

835
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
You didn't expect that, did you?

836
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,400
I used to be a big star,

837
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,600
to be an assistant

838
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,320
to your little short leg,

839
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,040
Song Zihao,

840
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,560
are you crazy?

841
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,520
No matter what,

842
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,440
you used to be a big star,

843
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,240
Everyone knows you.

844
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
If you're my assistant,

845
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,680
you won't be afraid of others pointing fingers at you

846
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,120
and making irresponsible remarks.

847
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
That's right. I'm just crazy.

848
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Didn't I just tell you?

849
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,680
Love can

850
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
drive people crazy.

851
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,080
And I'm not afraid at all.

852
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,040
As I said,

853
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
I want to be an ordinary person.

854
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,360
And then live a normal life,

855
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,600
and find a normal woman,

856
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,800
In an ordinary relationship,

857
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,840
and this ordinary woman,

858
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,280
It's you.

859
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,200
Since you refuse to admit it,

860
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,320
saying that you like me,

861
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,800
Then I have to apply

862
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,960
to be your assistant.

863
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,880
In this way,

864
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,200
I can see you every day.

865
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,800
And stay by your side

866
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,040
justifiably.

867
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,160
Well,

868
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,040
I don't need an assistant anymore.

869
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,800
The recruitment information

870
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,440
was sent by the agent of the next group.

871
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,120
But,

872
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,120
but I still

873
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,480
have a position here,

874
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,600
I don't know if you're interested in

875
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,480
giving it a try.

876
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,120
What position?

877
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,200
Boyfriend?

878
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,680
Rogue,

879
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
if it's a boyfriend,

880
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,120
You don't have to try.

881
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,120
I can take up my post right away.

882
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,880
Really?

883
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,360
Stop running!

884
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,920
I can really take up my post right away.

885
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,160
I have a very good position.

886
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
Come on.

887
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,240
Brother,

888
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,320
Let's wait.

889
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,560
Let's go inside.

890
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,320
But after leaving,

891
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,640
it could be another three years,

892
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,920
Even longer.

893
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,440
Are you sure

894
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,320
you won't see him again.

895
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,120
No matter it's three years or forever,

896
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,040
I don't want to see it anymore.

897
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,920
I said goodbye to him.

898
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,920
I told you I didn't want to cry.

899
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm afraid when I see him,

900
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,160
I'll shed tears later.

901
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
Three years ago,

902
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,680
I ran away secretly.

903
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,280
Pretend to be smart this time.

904
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
Can you make it?

905
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,080
It'll be 9 o'clock in time.

906
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,840
Check the flight.

907
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,760
I found it. I'll go first.

908
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,720
Call her first. See where she is.

909
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,160
Ji Mo,

910
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,040
this is the last message

911
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,000
I sent you.

912
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,640
After sending it,

913
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
I'll delete your number.

914
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,080
Don't come to me.

915
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,560
You know,

916
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,920
I don't like parting,

917
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,400
Besides,

918
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,200
it could be a farewell.

919
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,360
Maybe this

920
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,600
is the best result.

921
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
Thank you for giving me a dream.

922
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,040
Also,

923
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,520
tell Ruonan for me,

924
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,040
Luckily, she met you afterwards.

925
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,080
I feel at ease.

926
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,880
I'm happy for you, too.

927
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,480
In this place,

928
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,400
there are so many people every day,

929
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,480
Ups and downs,

930
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,320
some people come and some people go,

931
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,560
If we meet or get to know each other,

932
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,440
it's fate.

933
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,000
It's a pity that most people

934
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,320
just miss it,

935
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,160
Yes.

936
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,720
Missed is normal.

937
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,280
That's why those who are with each other

938
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,800
are the most precious.

939
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,600
Everyone plays in a different order,

940
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,240
so the ending is different.

941
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
As long as you meet the right person

942
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
at the right time,

943
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,440
To get to the finish line.

944
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,200
Okay,

945
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,160
I got it.

946
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,120
Thank you.

947
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,240
Ruonan, what's going on?

948
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,880
What's going on?

949
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,800
How's it

950
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,560
going, sister?

951
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,120
Star was shortlisted for the Best Newcomer Award.

952
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,080
Sida?

953
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,560
That's great.

954
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,120
That's great.

955
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,720
That's great.

956
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,760
Thank you for your hard work.
