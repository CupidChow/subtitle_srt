1
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,480
Zimmer

2
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,720
Tell me.

3
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,560
Is your company

4
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,880
Something serious happened.

5
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,120
I went to see Zhao Yucheng.

6
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,160
He said I was with him.

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,880
He will let you off.

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,120
But I rejected him.

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
Because I told him

10
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
I will always be with you.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,640
No matter what happens,

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
I won't give up on you.

13
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,040
Because I believe in you.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
I believe in your ability.

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
You will definitely win this battle.

16
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,720
If a man

17
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,040
I once said that

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,720
I don't want you to get involved.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
In complicated matters,

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
I just want you to live a pure life.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,960
But I didn't cash it.

22
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,680
My promise.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
You have so many burdens now.

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,920
But I can't bear it for you.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
Don't worry about me.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,880
As long as you are with me,

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Nothing is a burden.

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,040
What can I do for you?

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,040
Holding my hand all the time.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
And stayed with me.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,480
I will never

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,520
Let go of your hand.

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,480
AiLi

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,560
I happened to pass by your hospital.

35
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
Shall we have dinner together tonight?

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,560
Do you have a minute?

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Let's talk.

38
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,880
So you came to me today.

39
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,640
To fight?

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,640
Or fight?

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
Are you with Ellie?

42
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,680
Really?

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,640
Whether we are together or not,

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,920
What does it have to do with you?

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,160
Haven't you broken up?

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,960
We broke up.

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
But I wish him well.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,600
I don't want him to be failed again.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
I don't want him to fall in love again.

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,880
The wrong person.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
You can rest assured.

52
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,079
I won't let him down.

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
Also

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm such a  in the world.

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
There are only a few.

56
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,200
He has you now.

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,680
very good

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't be hard on yourself.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,360
Don't force yourself anymore.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,040
No more.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
Put up with other people's unreasonable.

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
He's a good man.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Please cherish him.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
At the beginning, I was too headstrong. Now,

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
You still like him?

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,960
Is this answer meaningful?

67
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,840
Some things are missed.

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Ali is right.

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,880
We are

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,160
People from two worlds.

71
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
It's me.

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,760
Is not good enough for him.

73
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,840
And observe it.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,680
If it's a few days later,

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,400
If there's no problem,

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
You can be discharged.

77
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,640
good

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,920
Chen Fei.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Didn't I tell you?

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,560
Don't come again.

81
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,200
Are you talking to me?

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
Sorry, sorry.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,840
good

84
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
Is there anyone

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
She's pretty.

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
A woman named Chen Fei'er is in hospital.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Doctor Ai.

88
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
You're not doing well recently.

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,280
Do you want to take a rest?

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,760
I'm fine.

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,040
AiLi

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm sorry. What were you talking about?

93
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
You ran away.

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
Since you met Chen Fei'er,

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,080
Every time we meet,

96
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,120
You will be distracted.

97
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,600
This insight

98
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,680
I still have it.

99
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm sorry. I didn't want to waste your time.

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
But I really

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
I didn't contact her.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,720
I don't know either

103
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,680
What's wrong with me?

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,080
Actually, Chen Fei,

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,280
She came to me later.

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,880
She came to you.

107
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,640
What did she tell you?

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
She told me something.

109
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,480
and

110
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,120
Let me take care of you.

111
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,760
what?

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
first

113
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,160
first

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,040
If you like him,

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,680
Don't be his patient.

116
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,720
second

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,080
Don't eat too much.

118
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
Because he would be worried

119
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,080
Third

120
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
When he confessed his love to you,

121
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
You should promise him right now.

122
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,760
When he cares about you,

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
Hold him now.

124
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't pretend to be indifferent.

125
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,640
And when he kissed you,

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,960
You have to tell him.

127
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
You're actually very happy.

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,320
Also

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,480
Don't test your feelings for him.

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Because at that time,

131
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,600
You've fallen in love with him.

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
Last

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,320
If someone asks,

134
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,840
What's your relationship?

135
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,960
Be brave.

136
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,040
Tell everyone

137
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
He's your boyfriend.

138
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
and

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,400
Is the best boyfriend in the world.

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
She also said that

141
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,840
Love can be very fragile sometimes.

142
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,440
Can't stand the test.

143
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
She lost her love.

144
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,080
Can't be found again.

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,200
Good luck to you

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Please love him for me.

147
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Because you love someone,

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
You have to pay everything.

149
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,640
Don't be like me.

150
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,280
And regret after losing it.

151
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
Why are you here?

152
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,400
I went upstairs and rang your doorbell.

153
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
I thought you were avoiding me.

154
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,080
So I came down to have a look.

155
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Is your car here?

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
So what are you trying to say?

157
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Chen Fei'er, are you...

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
You're eating junk food again?

159
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,480
You're not my doctor anymore.

160
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,280
What should I eat?

161
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,480
It's not your business.

162
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,960
Phil, your current condition

163
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,760
Don't you know?

164
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,680
You can't eat this rubbish.

165
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
I don't have to worry about you.

166
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,480
you

167
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,320
Move out of my way

168
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,000
I won't allow it.

169
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,360
Move out of my way

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
I won't allow it.

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,920
you

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,480
Move out of my way

173
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,440
You won't tell me.

174
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,280
You owe me.

175
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,360
If I am not allowed to eat anything,

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,120
Don't eat anything.

177
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,160
You said you wouldn't listen to me.

178
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
This is not junk food.

179
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm not eating.

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
Because I can't eat it.

181
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,640
Every time I eat it,

182
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I thought of you.

183
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,520
you

184
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,520
Is the fly in my brain.

185
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
In my mind,

186
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,800
I can't beat you to death.

187
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,680
You came out from time to time.

188
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
To disturb me.

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
Go, go.

190
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,400
I never want to see you again.

191
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't do that, okay?

192
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,320
I apologize to you. I'm sorry.

193
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,680
Don't pretend to be kind.

194
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,920
You should care about your girlfriend.

195
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,440
She's not my girlfriend.

196
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,720
We have nothing to do with each other.

197
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,920
Before I came,

198
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
Make it clear.

199
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,640
I won't see her again.

200
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,600
What do you mean?

201
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
What do you mean?

202
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,040
You said you were...

203
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,600
The flies in my head, right?

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,520
You are the same.

205
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,120
You're the one

206
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
A haunting person.

207
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,480
You know what, Chen Fei'er?

208
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,960
I can't forget you.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,760
What are you talking about?

210
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,640
I...

211
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,760
Did you hear what I said?

212
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,920
What did you say

213
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,440
Chen Fei,

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Say it again.

215
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't do that, okay?

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
You heard what I said.

217
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
Say it again.

218
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,800
Chen Fei, when I see you,

219
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,880
My heart will panic, my legs will be soft.

220
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
I don't know how to express it.

221
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,920
I'm a little

222
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,520
Do you still like me?

223
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
say

224
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
I don't know either

225
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,680
Come back.

226
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,240
You're back.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,640
Ellie, you coward.

228
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,280
Allen

229
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,560
Inform the public relations department.

230
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
To clarify it.

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,680
The previous shutdown rumors

232
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,800
to wait a moment

233
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
This is what I prepared before.

234
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,320
Design and fabric technology

235
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,160
Technical patent.

236
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,000
Tell the sales department about it.

237
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
To make them all public.

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,560
And declare that

239
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
This patent

240
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
For the next season.

241
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
In production and design,

242
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,520
President Ji.

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,800
When did you hide it?

244
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,080
So many technology patents.

245
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,400
With the advantage of technology,

246
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
I believe

247
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
The share price of our group

248
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,080
There will be a turning point soon.

249
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Go.

250
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Even if Zimmer successfully rescues the market,

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,440
My brother must have a second hand.

252
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,520
I know my brother.

253
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,800
You can't achieve your goal.

254
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,600
He won't let it go.

255
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Moreover, behind his back,

256
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,880
Or Rui Qi?

257
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,680
The capital is so powerful.

258
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,880
Zimmer won't be able to hold on.

259
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Where are you going?

260
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,080
I want to beg my brother.

261
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,160
What if he relents?

262
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Maybe I will forgive Ji Mo.

263
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,920
If you do this,

264
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,400
Is not helping Zimmer.

265
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,680
Are you helping Zimmer?

266
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
The way you helped him,

267
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,680
Is to watch him sit and wait.

268
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,800
Because I know Zimmer.

269
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
Even if Zhao Yu Cheng

270
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Decided to stop.

271
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,440
Zimmer won't accept it.

272
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Because that would be

273
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
It's a shame.

274
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,440
With Zimmer's ability,

275
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
I believe he has

276
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,800
I came up with a countermeasure.

277
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
but

278
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,480
The game in the market

279
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,640
It's not that simple.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
It's not about trust.

281
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,000
Can be solved.

282
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't want Ji Mo to lose.

283
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
What if he loses?

284
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
Even if he loses,

285
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,520
I will accompany him to make a comeback.

286
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,120
I believe in him.

287
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Since he has

288
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
It can make the wing fashion.

289
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,000
Even today,

290
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,720
He can start over.

291
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
Are you gambling?

292
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
And he doesn't have much leverage.

293
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,600
What if he loses everything?

294
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,720
Life is a huge gamble.

295
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,520
Even if I

296
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,840
There's only one card.

297
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,600
I'll choose to gamble once.

298
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,160
Life will be happy like this.

299
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Dugu is like a man.

300
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
You and I thought

301
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,120
It's very different.

302
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
Are you going to say

303
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,360
It's too late for us to see each other.

304
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,440
I'm on you.

305
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,640
I found such a little flash.

306
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,880
You're amazing.

307
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
It's a pity.

308
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,480
If you know me,

309
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,560
If you stay longer,

310
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,960
You will find me

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,840
Inside and outside,

312
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
Are all bright spots.

313
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,360
Time is up.

314
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,520
And sent you to the hospital.

315
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,880
Don't be so slow.

316
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,040
Don't make me wait for you.

317
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Where is Star's costume tomorrow?

318
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,400
Before the production starts tomorrow,

319
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
It's not too late to prepare.

320
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,520
Don't bother today.

321
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,920
No, just in case,

322
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,040
The daily costume of Star

323
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
You have to prepare in advance.

324
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,240
This is Ruonan.

325
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,160
Let's go and get it together.

326
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,160
How is Star prepared?

327
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,960
Mr. Lu, you're ready.

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,960
You can start at any time.

329
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,400
Your acting has improved recently.

330
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,040
The director has been praising you.

331
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
I was right about him.

332
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm flattered.

333
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,280
Sit down.

334
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Correct!

335
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,960
Where are you going?

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
She seems to be

337
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,200
To prepare the costume for tomorrow.

338
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
Qian Sha has grown up recently.

339
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,880
To be the leader.

340
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,920
That's right.

341
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,400
If the man trained by the man

342
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,319
Are all talents.

343
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,720
However

344
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
Compared with Ruonan,

345
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,880
A little courage.

346
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,560
That's right.

347
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,640
If you're a male,

348
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,240
Is always unparalleled.

349
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,839
She was always so good.

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Such an excellent agent.

351
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,520
Losing her,

352
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,960
It's Yuxing's loss.

353
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,319
Correct!

354
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,319
She came to my office

355
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,720
She also told me

356
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,640
About you again.

357
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
About me.

358
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,840
What did he say?

359
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,680
She said

360
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,320
I know that

361
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,600
To invite Zihao to perform,

362
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,760
And spent a lot of money.

363
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,440
So the promotion fee you are paying now

364
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
It's not enough.

365
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
What about me?

366
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,640
You can use my contacts

367
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,240
And resources.

368
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
To promote your play.

369
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,440
However

370
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,840
I have my own conditions.

371
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
I hope Sida

372
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
Can appear in

373
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
The publicity materials

374
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,560
Our Si Da

375
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,480
It'll be a big fire sooner or later.

376
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Are you sure you want to

377
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,760
Songzihao

378
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,520
Don't you get along well with me?

379
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,360
If your relationship with me

380
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,560
If you can't handle it well,

381
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,560
You and I...

382
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,560
In the publicity industry.

383
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,880
Will get along well.

384
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,800
Your loss will be

385
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,080
It's not just the show.

386
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,280
You don't know about this?

387
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,040
She used to

388
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,920
For a long time.

389
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,760
When I see her now,

390
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,920
I was afraid of her.

391
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,640
But I'm afraid that

392
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,040
Speaking of work,

393
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,160
She's the best.

394
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,240
You really don't know about this?

395
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,320
I have no idea

396
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
It's okay.

397
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,680
Then I'm leaving.

398
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,560
Get ready.

399
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
Don't bother. I'm leaving.

400
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,840
It will start in 20 minutes.

401
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,200
Don't you prepare in advance?

402
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Thousand yarn.

403
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,240
Do you think

404
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,520
What did you do wrong?

405
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
What's wrong?

406
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,480
It's my fault.

407
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,920
Shouldn't fall for her.

408
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
I shouldn't force her to accept me.

409
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,760
It's all my fault.

410
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,000
I made her leave.

411
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,560
It's not wrong to fall in love with someone.

412
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,280
There's nothing wrong with liking someone.

413
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
What's wrong is that

414
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
That person doesn't like you.

415
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,640
Then tell me.

416
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,200
I still have a chance.

417
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,560
To make up for this mistake?

418
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
You already know what to do.

419
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,560
Don't you think so?

420
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,560
No, no. It's me.

421
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,320
Why are you here suddenly?

422
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
Because I don't want to hide anymore.

423
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,120
Sida

424
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
If the paparazzi captured it,

425
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,400
It will be troublesome.

426
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
But I want to...

427
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
Make it clear.

428
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,520
If what you want to say is

429
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,520
And asked me if I wanted to go back to Yuxing.

430
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,440
Then you don't have to go on.

431
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Go on.

432
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,800
Because I have decided to leave.

433
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm not going back.

434
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,760
Sister, I was wrong.

435
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,200
I just want to be like a normal person.

436
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Can be upright and upright.

437
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
I like you, I pursue you.

438
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,280
didn't expect

439
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
I didn't expect to hurt you.

440
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,800
Sister, do you remember

441
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,800
When we first met,

442
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,520
You gave me the right to dream.

443
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
later

444
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,080
Then I gave up.

445
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,560
To be a waitress.

446
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,560
And lost my dream.

447
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
You helped me to get it back.

448
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm back now.

449
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
But now you want to give up.

450
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,440
Sida

451
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm not giving up on you.

452
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,200
But I have decided to leave.

453
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,800
I have my own considerations.

454
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
Without me,

455
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
You can achieve it.

456
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,560
Anything you want to achieve,

457
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,800
But you're

458
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,320
A part of my dream.

459
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,200
Are you really willing to do that?

460
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,080
Give up?

461
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
therefore

462
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,000
You finally rejected Star.

463
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,360
I don't know how to face him.

464
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
Because this is Star's dream.

465
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,640
Is also my dream.

466
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,960
But if

467
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,600
If I go back to Yuxing,

468
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,080
This means

469
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
I want to end it completely.

470
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,280
The love that Star has for me,

471
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,360
I know Star very well.

472
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,520
He is a simple

473
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,600
And sincere.

474
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,200
Simple and stubborn.

475
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,920
So I'm really scared.

476
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,640
He was hurt a little bit.

477
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,080
So you chose to escape.

478
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Don't forget one thing.

479
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
Star likes you.

480
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
You can't choose to love someone.

481
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,320
Can't be changed.

482
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
What should I do now?

483
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,480
The most difficult thing to cure in love is the heart disease.

484
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,280
And you're his best doctor.

485
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,320
This is also the first time

486
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
What I should do.

487
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,840
Although you've been

488
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
And stayed with me.

489
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,280
But I don't think you're happy.

490
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,400
If a man

491
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,520
Go back to the star.

492
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,560
That's where you are.

493
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,360
Where you should be.

494
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,520
That's your dream.

495
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,040
When you protect your dream,

496
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,160
Will glow.

497
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,280
What's more,

498
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,080
In the workplace,

499
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,360
Is the happiest.

500
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,840
When you were in Guardian Wing Fashion,

501
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Are you protecting your dream?

502
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,400
Wing Fashion and you

503
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,520
Is my dream.

504
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,080
So I'm going to

505
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
To stick to them.

506
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
I won't give up.

507
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,040
Could be a lifetime.

508
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,480
What are you doing?

509
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,080
I'm still angry about last time.

510
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
You're still in the assessment period.

511
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,280
When can I pass this?

512
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,920
The assessment period?

513
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
Why don't you tell me

514
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,760
We'll talk after it's done.

515
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,880
good

516
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
Since you said so,

517
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,400
I will do my best.

518
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,920
When Tong Tong was suspended,

519
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,280
The position of the company's director of brokerage.

520
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
Has been vacant.

521
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,880
In order to manage

522
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,280
The company's artists

523
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,040
Can resume efficient operation.

524
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,400
I have hired

525
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,440
The new manager.

526
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,320
She will be officially hired today.

527
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,080
No way

528
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
I strongly oppose it.

529
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,520
The manager should

530
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,040
For every artist in the company,

531
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,120
I know everything.

532
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,760
And has high business ability.

533
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,280
I disagree. That's it.

534
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,800
Just ask someone to fill the number.

535
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
In my heart,

536
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,520
Who can be qualified for this position.

537
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,320
There's only one.

538
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,720
If you're a male,

539
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,880
If you're a male sister,

540
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,720
Alright, I'll announce.

541
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
This is us.

542
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,360
The new manager.

543
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,880
Dugu is like a man.

544
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,280
very good

545
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,080
You're finally back.

546
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,120
I miss you so much.

547
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,120
Hello, Director.

548
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,520
sister

549
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
You're finally back.

550
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,080
congratulations

551
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,000
And became the director of management again.

552
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,560
Sida

553
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,000
When I decided

554
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,640
To come back to work.

555
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Which means

556
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,720
From now on,

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,280
We're just agents.

558
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,240
And artists.

559
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,200
Sister,

560
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,960
You still won't forgive me.

561
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,680
I've never blamed you.

562
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,760
I just have no way.

563
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,120
Accept your relationship.

564
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I know.

565
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
My love for you

566
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,640
From the beginning to the end,

567
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,960
It's all wishful thinking.

568
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Actually, I've done it countless times.

569
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
I want to give up.

570
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,040
But I really don't know.

571
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,240
How can I not like you?

572
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,880
Sister,

573
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
Can you grant me a wish?

574
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,280
You know,

575
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
You haven't been hired yet.

576
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,640
I want to

577
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,560
As an ordinary person.

578
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,040
I'll go out with you for a day.

579
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,160
OK?

580
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,080
Appointment?

581
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,040
A lot of things.

582
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,480
Maybe I've experienced it.

583
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,920
I won't leave any regret.

584
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll treat this day as

585
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,360
It's a farewell ceremony.

586
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
Then I'll put it down.

587
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,800
All your thoughts.

588
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,520
And be your artist.

589
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,600
The most difficult thing to cure in love is the heart disease.

590
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
And you're his best doctor.

591
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,680
This is also the first time

592
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,840
What I should do.

593
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,960
Alright.

594
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,320
I promise you,

595
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,520
feed

596
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,960
Do you have time to be together?

597
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Go out for a meal.

598
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,960
I have a date today.

599
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,080
Let's talk about it another day.

600
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,640
Appointment?

601
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
With whom?

602
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm still single.

603
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,960
Dating rights and freedoms.

604
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,440
Keep your date a secret.

605
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,320
All right, go back to your work.

606
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,200
Let's talk later.

607
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,360
I promised you.

608
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
No one will bother you today.

609
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,080
There are only two of us.

610
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,640
Where are we going?

611
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,760
The first stop.

612
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,200
I have imagined countless places.

613
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,040
Today is our first date.

614
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
Is also the last time.

615
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,680
I want to transfer my previous fantasy

616
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,280
And become a reality.

617
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
You're an idol now.

618
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,400
She will be killed

619
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,040
Recognize it.

620
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,080
Don't go to a place

621
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,640
Where the paparazzi captured it.

622
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,360
Otherwise, I will help you.

623
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Solve the problem, you know?

624
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,760
I know.

625
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,680
Don't worry.

626
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
I specially designed it.

627
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,760
No one will see it.

628
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,800
This is the first stop.

629
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,880
That's right.

630
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,800
I want to take you to see the scenery.

631
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,080
Looking at the scenery.

632
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,360
I heard that

633
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,560
And the one you like.

634
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,120
And watched it together.

635
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,320
The scenery of this city

636
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,360
That's why

637
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,800
And leave a real sense of belonging.

638
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,400
Actually, I always hope that one day,

639
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,760
To go with me.

640
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I've seen

641
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,720
The most beautiful scenery.

642
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,160
I finally have the chance today.

643
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,240
But I can't ride a motorcycle.

644
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,720
Why would I let you ride it?

645
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,800
I'll ride with you.

646
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,760
good

647
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
Unexpectedly, Si Da

648
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,560
With such a cool side.

649
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,000
Let Qiansha take care of your book.

650
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,760
Pick one.

651
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
A better role.

652
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
Will definitely attract a large number of fans.

653
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,720
Sister, I'm not an artist today.

654
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,040
Can we not talk about work?

655
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Don't talk about work.

656
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,840
good

657
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,600
good

658
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
Just go out for fun today, okay?

659
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,520
good

660
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,320
Set out

661
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,120
Can you ride it?

662
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,160
Who are you looking down on?

663
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
I'm sure.

664
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,520
Let's go.

665
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,840
The wind is strong, hold on to me.

666
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,360
I'm living in Shanghai.

667
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,400
For so many years,

668
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,040
I don't think so.

669
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,000
To see the scenery.

670
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,720
What about

671
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Are you happy?

672
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,680
Happy

673
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,200
sister

674
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,800
Maybe you don't know.

675
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,120
I've been thinking

676
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,840
Driving like this,

677
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,600
I want you to sit in the back.

678
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
You can hold hands when you have the chance.

679
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,720
And walked down the alley together.

680
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,800
Go shopping.

681
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,600
To bargain with those grannies.

682
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,320
And then go home.

683
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,600
I'll cook for you.

684
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,840
Is your life ordinary?

685
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,480
But it's really

686
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,880
My dream life

687
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,880
I want to be like this.

688
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,400
And protect you.

689
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,040
To protect you from the wind and rain.

690
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,920
I won't let you go through so much.

691
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,280
Silly, right? I...

692
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,640
No, it's not stupid.

693
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,240
The second thing,

694
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,680
I want to be with someone

695
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Hand in hand, shopping on the street.

696
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
I want to tell the world

697
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,240
Let them have a look.

698
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,560
How happy I am now.

699
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,760
Don't think about it.

700
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,440
Forbid

701
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,720
why

702
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
You can't be here today.

703
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,240
Public occasions

704
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,400
To maintain your image.

705
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,640
There are so many people here.

706
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Do you want to be on the top search list tomorrow?

707
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,480
Don't worry.

708
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,680
I've thought about this for a long time.

709
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,080
Look.

710
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,720
So that no one

711
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,400
You recognize us?

712
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,160
This method

713
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,480
Only you can figure it out.

714
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
In this way,

715
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,160
My wish.

716
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,600
Let's go.

717
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,480
Hurry up.

718
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,120
fast

719
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,360
Let's go shopping.

720
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,520
to take a walk

721
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,120
So many children.

722
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,560
Children

723
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,320
Children

724
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,719
Why?

725
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,679
Why?

726
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,080
Beat you to death, brat.

727
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,679
sister

728
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,920
Forgive me for getting carried away.

729
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,960
This is the first time I really

730
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,120
Holding your hand,

731
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,040
For the first time.

732
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,280
To kiss you officially.

733
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,320
Is also the last time.

734
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,520
To say goodbye to you.

735
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,639
I used up all of them.

736
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,920
Impulse and courage.

737
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,719
I really want to tell you.

738
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,719
I love you

739
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,080
But there's no chance.

740
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,679
So I finally

741
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,000
Let's do it again.

742
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,679
Bye.

743
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,600
Turn.

744
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,520
Turn right.

745
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,679
Move forward.

746
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,719
And mysterious.

747
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,679
where

748
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,440
Don't open your eyes.

749
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,320
Right away.

750
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,000
Hold on.

751
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,160
Hold on.

752
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,200
How is it? Do you remember?

753
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,960
I remember this place.

754
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,080
You said that

755
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,320
To quit the entertainment industry,

756
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,960
To serve the dishes.

757
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,960
yes

758
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,760
You booked a banquet for me.

759
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll book a room for you today.

760
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,880
And this one.

761
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,480
What about

762
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,600
This is a record.

763
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,720
The photos of our past

764
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll look for it.

765
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,600
The picture of us before.

766
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,000
Look at this photo.

767
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
This is from the catwalk.

768
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
This is

769
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,920
This is the first time

770
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,000
This is the time for the celebration party.

771
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,240
It finally caught on.

772
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,120
So proud of me.

773
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,200
Yes, I remember.

774
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,320
These photos

775
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,440
These memories

776
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,840
And made the current Star.

777
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800
I will take these memories

778
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,040
Keep going.

779
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,640
Even if the next road

780
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,560
You need me to face it alone.

781
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,120
sister

782
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,120
Have a seat.

783
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,120
I've prepared something for you.

784
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
A surprise.

785
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
You've been asking me

786
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,760
The Big Woman's song.

787
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,880
To whom?

788
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,880
As you know,

789
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,120
It must be addressed to you.

790
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,840
Every word in the song

791
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,080
Every melody

792
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Are all addressed to you.

793
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,680
Today, I will

794
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,240
Sing to you alone.

795
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,480
I just need to listen to you.

796
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,120
If you're alone,

797
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,280
Everything you asked me to do,

798
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,200
I have to do it.

799
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,080
What you don't want me to do.

800
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,400
I can't even think about it.

801
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
I can't not reply to you.

802
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,240
Hiding from you, lying to you.

803
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,960
The phone is 24 hours.

804
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
You must keep it on.

805
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Within two minutes,

806
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,000
You must reply.

807
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,800
You mean East?

808
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,040
I can't go west.

809
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,960
You asked me to be a vegetarian.

810
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,160
I can't cheat.

811
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,880
Actually, in this circle,

812
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,920
How high you climb is not the point.

813
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,080
The point is, can you...

814
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,640
Can stand the test.

815
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,560
When you're popular,

816
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,880
Stand up to those

817
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,120
To praise you.

818
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,760
Your body is clean and pure.

819
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,440
I like your character.

820
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,960
No matter what you do,

821
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,840
Never forget.

822
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,080
At the beginning,

823
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,840
Is my own responsibility.

824
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,160
I'll do everything myself.

825
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,240
I quit the entertainment industry.

826
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
So easily.

827
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,040
Quit the entertainment industry.

828
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
You think it's so easy?

829
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,960
What happened to you?

830
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,480
Have you forgotten your dreams of acting?

831
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,600
I'm not afraid of negative news.

832
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,320
I'm not afraid of being harassed by fans.

833
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,320
I'm not afraid of being beaten.

834
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,880
I'm afraid that my artist

835
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,720
You said you wanted to give up.

836
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,280
You promised me.

837
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
To go to the podium together.

838
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,440
I was waiting for you on the stage.

839
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,840
Thank me out loud.

840
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,160
Do you remember the first day I saw you,

841
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,200
You told me you wanted to be an actor.

842
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,720
I am in your eyes.

843
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,880
And saw the stars.

844
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,960
I don't want that star.

845
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,840
Was erased by reality.

846
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,320
An artist should be ambitious.

847
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
To go further.

848
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,560
In this new generation,

849
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,360
Entertainment circle

850
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,120
If you don't fight for it,

851
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,320
Is the chance

852
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,480
It fell on your head.

853
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,480
I just want to grow up.

854
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,760
I just want to be able to

855
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,240
To share more things.

856
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,480
I want to act to prove myself.

857
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
I'm no longer the man

858
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,080
Who needs your care.

859
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I will become

860
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,240
The man you can rely on.

861
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,640
sorry

862
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,160
I used to make trouble.

863
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,320
To make you angry.

864
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,160
But actually,

865
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,800
I just want to protect you.

866
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,760
I don't want you to be like a big woman.

867
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,920
You have to do everything.

868
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,960
Face it yourself.

869
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,640
I don't want to

870
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,680
In your eyes,

871
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,200
I'm just a little boy.

872
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,240
I also wish you

873
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,480
We can find

874
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,960
Can make you trustworthy.

875
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,200
Who wants to rely on.

876
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,080
Can make you cry if you want.

877
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,320
Who can laugh if you want.

878
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,560
From now on, I will be

879
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,960
The brightest star.

880
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,320
I know.

881
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
I'm still single.

882
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,360
Dating rights and freedoms.

883
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,840
Keep your date a secret.

884
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
I know you're working overtime.

885
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,080
I brought you a midnight snack.

886
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,440
Aren't you on a date?

887
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,640
What about that man?

888
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,920
How do you know I have a new boyfriend?

889
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
You two are together.

890
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,360
Who is that man?

891
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,160
Why should I tell you?

892
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,200
My new boyfriend's name.

893
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,200
It's none of your business.

894
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
Your expression is wrong.

895
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,760
The tone is rising.

896
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,440
Chin up.

897
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,560
Her eyes are wandering.

898
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,680
You're bluffing.

899
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,600
He's not

900
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,680
Your new boyfriend.

901
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,240
What are you hiding?

902
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,720
I didn't hide anything.

903
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,280
I've been with Sida all day.

904
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,120
Sida

905
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,560
No, you want me to go.

906
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,520
To cure him?

907
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,600
So I stayed with him.

908
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,760
And dated for a whole day.

909
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,000
To see if it can open his heart.

910
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,280
that

911
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,680
You went to cure him.

912
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,400
When are you coming?

913
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,880
Cure, cure me.

914
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,560
What's wrong with you?

915
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,520
Look, I'm tired at work every day.

916
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
So I need someone to accompany me.

917
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,720
Mr. Ji, you have been working hard recently.

918
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,720
Working overtime every day.

919
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,560
There's no time to rest.

920
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,120
The business of Wing Fashion is big.

921
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,800
Am I busy?

922
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,760
I can help you.

923
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,440
Can you help me?

924
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,360
Don't move.

925
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Charge it for me.

926
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,000
If a man

927
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,080
You know what?

928
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,480
Even if I lost everything,

929
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,400
As long as I have you,

930
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,760
So I went on.

931
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,000
The power to go forward.

932
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,280
Alright

933
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,200
Since you need me so much,

934
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
I'll be your charger.

935
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
And fill it up for you.

936
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,720
all right?

937
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,000
I will always be by your side.

938
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,800
That's it.

939
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,640
Thank you

940
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,400
Si Da, where were you yesterday?

941
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,720
Why can't I find you all day?

942
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,280
I went to sort it out.

943
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,200
Your relationship.
