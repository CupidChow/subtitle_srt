1
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,080
Sida

2
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,600
Don't be afraid.

3
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm here to help you.

4
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,000
I know you hate me.

5
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
But if this kind of hate

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Will cure you.

7
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,680
Heterosexual communication disorder

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,800
I'd rather be hated by you.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,640
Brother

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,480
I can't. I really want to vomit.

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,120
Go there and vomit.

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Come on. No, no.

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
I'll do it myself.

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,040
What are you doing?

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,880
Don't talk.

16
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
Sida

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,080
Start speaking.

18
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Because of you.

19
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,960
So I have

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
The ability to love someone.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
This love

22
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,280
Make me happy and worried.

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm delighted and anxious.

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Brother,

25
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
Sida

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,280
Keep an eye on Qiansha.

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,800
You need to numb yourself.

28
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Just treat her as

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,920
The person you love in the script

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,800
You love the people you love,

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,720
Don't you think so?

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Thank you.

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,200
Let me experience it again.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,880
The most complicated emotions of mankind.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
But I realized that

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,600
Love needs to be responded to.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,080
But sometimes it's hard.

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,320
I don't have to pay for it.

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,960
Can be felt.

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,080
But no matter what,

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,760
I want to tell you today.

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,560
I loved you once.

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,240
And loved you.

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,400
What you said,

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,760
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
You know I'm waiting for you.

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,120
How hard I waited?

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,640
I waited until...

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
I waited until I thought

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
We won't have a future.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
sorry

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,880
I'm too obtuse.

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Are you willing to accept me again?

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
I will.

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Hold me.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
Hold me.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
Qiansha, I'd like to.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,839
The drama.

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
This is a play.

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,000
Thousand yarn.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
What are you doing?

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
It was written in the script.

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,920
You need to hug me at this moment.

64
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,040
You didn't hug me.

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,080
So I hugged you.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Sida

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,560
Qiansha is right. Hold her.

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,920
Sister, this is a play.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,560
What hug?

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,880
Come on.

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Thousands of yarn.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,680
Thank you.

73
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,960
Thank you.

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,600
Sida

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
Don't you know I just

76
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,520
How touched.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you. I'm so touched.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
I was so moved I almost cried.

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,240
Thousand yarn.

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
Why are you here?

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,000
I heard from Aaron that you've been busy recently.

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,720
As long as you need it.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,280
I will appear.

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,520
I think I have found the sense of drama.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
As long as you practice,

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,040
I will pass this interview.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you need me,

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,840
I can be with you every day.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,520
To practice.

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,040
I'll make sure you can audition successfully.

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
You can practice.

92
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
But don't take advantage of me.

93
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,920
Your brother said to use poison against poison.

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,640
Only when you adapt to me in life,

95
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,320
To make the film more natural.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,480
Brother

97
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,480
Don't.

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,360
Come on, Star.

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
That's enough.

100
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
That's enough.

101
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,960
That's enough.

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll answer the phone.

103
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,520
feed

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,840
Old Zhao.

105
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,480
No way

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
I have to work today.

107
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm rehearsing with Star.

108
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,080
No, no.

109
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,040
I'm going back.

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,040
Alright then.

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,080
See you later.

112
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,320
Zhao Yucheng.

113
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,840
And asked me out for a midnight snack.

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,600
He said to talk about work.

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,400
Sister, I'm hungry. I want to go too.

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Take me with you.

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
And brother.

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,360
Thanks to him today,

119
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,840
Why don't you invite him to dinner?

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,720
And Star.

121
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,880
What are you doing?

122
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
Go and practice with me.

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,840
No

124
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Brother, brother.

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,320
It's up to you.

126
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,160
that

127
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
Are you going with me?

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,360
Just now,

129
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,320
I was embarrassed when I got the phone.

130
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
You want to refuse?

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,760
And after answering the phone,

132
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,360
in the first moments

133
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,600
So I came to ask how I felt.

134
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
To prove that you care about me.

135
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
In your heart,

136
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm more important than Zhao Yucheng.

137
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm confident enough in myself.

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,840
Trust you enough.

139
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
You don't need to use the man-marking mode.

140
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,280
Narcissist

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm going to work.

142
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,880
Old Zhao.

143
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,480
When did you arrive?

144
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,200
Just arrived.

145
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
You told me you wanted to talk about the company.

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,400
what?

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
Based on the current situation,

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,840
As a spokesman,

149
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,320
It's impossible for Star.

150
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,640
But,

151
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,280
I came up with other ways.

152
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Because I know

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,920
Actually, every year,

154
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,600
Will sign with some stars.

155
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
As the promotion ambassador of the group,

156
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
They can stand for the group.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,240
You can also attend the commercial performance.

158
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,880
So I want to sign Star.

159
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,840
I just don't know.

160
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,760
Are you interested in

161
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,440
Yes

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,040
Of course I'm interested.

163
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,520
It can enhance

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
The commercial value of Star.

165
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
And famous.

166
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
But also solve his problem

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,720
A rather embarrassing situation.

168
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,040
Thank you.

169
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
Your idea is really great.

170
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,000
don't mention it

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Anyway, I'm using

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
In the name of work.

173
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm a little tired today.

174
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,680
This plan

175
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,040
Let's talk about it next time.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Alright.

177
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,960
I'll send you home to rest.

178
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright.

179
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
Thank you

180
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
I've arrived at the office.

181
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,840
I remembered I just hugged you.

182
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm full of power.

183
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,160
You are really my...

184
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,280
It's a universal charger.

185
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm warning you.

186
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
Don't be casual in the future.

187
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Take advantage of me.

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
If you think you're suffering,

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,680
We can't

190
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,640
I'll give you a hug.

191
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,600
Since you're tired,

192
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't always look at your phone.

193
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,760
Shouldn't you have a good rest?

194
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Also

195
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,920
I hope you and I

196
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,080
When we were together,

197
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Don't let anything

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
And become distracted.

199
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
I was rude just now.

201
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
Old Zhao.

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,240
I really appreciate you

203
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,680
To support and help me.

204
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,080
But I don't think it's my job.

205
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,760
We should keep a little distance.

206
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,520
It's better.

207
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,920
And I want to tell you that

208
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,040
My relationship with Zimmer

209
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,000
Is getting better.

210
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
That's why I don't want

211
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
And caused some unnecessary misunderstandings.

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,680
You'd better not

213
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
It's a waste of time.

214
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
What about the relationship?

215
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,840
It's about your love.

216
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,360
You have the right to reject me.

217
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
In the same way,

218
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,360
I have the right to pursue you.

219
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,040
Right?

220
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
Don't say no.

221
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,520
As long as you haven't officially

222
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,760
With Zimmer,

223
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,200
I won't give up.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm leaving now.

225
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,600
President Ji.

226
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
This whole night,

227
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,200
Are working overtime here.

228
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,960
That's right.

229
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
I haven't slept.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,640
That's right.

231
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,400
Can you stand it?

232
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,880
All the reports on the table

233
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,000
I've almost finished it.

234
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,120
You've read so many books.

235
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Actually, I already have it in my heart.

236
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,920
The concrete planning prototype.

237
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
The top priority now

238
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,120
To increase sales as soon as possible.

239
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,520
So I have to solve it.

240
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,400
The spokesman's problem.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
I have to find Phyl now.

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
To talk openly.

243
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,560
President Ji.

244
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,520
I think you should go back first.

245
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,560
Rest for a while.

246
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
No need

247
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,240
What was the charge last night?

248
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
So full.

249
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,400
secret

250
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
I know what you want to say.

251
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,920
But now,

252
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,280
I don't want to work outside.

253
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
Why don't you want to work outside?

254
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,680
Do you want to stay at home?

255
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,560
To escape?

256
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,080
What you have to do now

257
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,760
Is to eliminate your negative influence.

258
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,120
No matter you are a model,

259
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
Or a spokesman?

260
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,880
Can't continue to escape.

261
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,200
Eliminate the negative effects.

262
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,680
What can I use to eliminate the negative effects?

263
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,000
Those are my real past.

264
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,360
I can't refute it.

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Since it's true,

266
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
You should face it.

267
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,000
Plastic surgery and obesity are not crimes.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,880
What are you afraid of?

269
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
But others don't think so.

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,280
Do you know I just went out?

271
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,680
Was recognized.

272
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,160
They're watching it like a monster.

273
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,200
Look at me.

274
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
I can't stand the ridicule.

275
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,120
And the look of contempt.

276
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,720
But I can't blame anyone.

277
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,720
Because it's me.

278
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
I lied to them.

279
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
I brought it on myself.

280
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
You're not the one who's wrong.

281
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
Those who taunt and attack you.

282
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,320
They don't even know you.

283
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm not qualified to judge you.

284
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
They just played up

285
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,600
Subjective cognition

286
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,080
And criticized you on the contrary.

287
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,360
Instead of being misunderstood,

288
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,560
It's better to be generous.

289
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,320
Admit it?

290
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
Then what should I do?

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,080
How did you start the live stream?

292
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,560
Those foodies of yours.

293
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,000
How do we start the live stream now?

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,720
Break it.

295
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,760
Tell your mind

296
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
To the public.

297
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,760
Are you crazy?

298
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,680
He's crazy. No.

299
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,200
Phyl will be scolded to death.

300
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,160
To change the world,

301
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,200
The prejudice against you.

302
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,680
The fastest and most effective way.

303
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
To fit in with them.

304
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,440
Impress them with your true feelings.

305
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
The basis of prejudice.

306
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,400
According to psychology,

307
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,560
Is a conformity effect.

308
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
It's people who distinguish group cognition.

309
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
An instinctive reaction in the activity.

310
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,160
The more you avoid it,

311
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
The deeper they get.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,160
The fixed impression of you.

313
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
It's better to admit that

314
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,320
To weaken their position.

315
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
To accept you.

316
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,640
Is what Mr. Ji said useful?

317
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,280
According to social psychology,

318
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Is an exposure effect.

319
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
And let everyone know you.

320
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
To know you.

321
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
I know you.

322
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,200
So that you'll be in love.

323
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,320
And resonate with you.

324
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,840
Look.

325
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,280
The difference is too big.

326
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah, she was too fat.

327
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,080
Really?

328
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,400
Doctor Ai.

329
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
This Chen Fei'er

330
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Isn't it your former patient?

331
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,000
She really

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
According to the newspaper,

333
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,680
And risked everything for Hong.

334
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,160
Plastic surgery and liposuction?

335
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,800
I think it's probably true.

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,880
Dr. Ai must be

337
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
In the dark.

338
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,600
Yes, it's good.

339
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,320
You didn't go on.

340
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,160
And develop with her.

341
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,520
Otherwise, I will be hurt

342
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,440
You're so fooled.

343
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,200
And gossiping at work.

344
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
Are you free?

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,640
Also

346
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
Who are you?

347
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
To judge Chen Fei.

348
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,680
No matter what happened to her in the past,

349
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,320
She is the most beautiful in my eyes.

350
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,280
yes

351
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
We didn't develop.

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,520
It's not because

353
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,880
I hate her past.

354
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,800
That's because she didn't

355
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
You don't care about me.

356
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,360
I don't know about Phil.

357
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,440
How is it now?

358
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,920
You haven't replied to my messages.

359
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,200
Must be very sad.

360
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,400
live broadcast

361
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
Chen Fei'er, don't be irritated.

362
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
Do something stupid, okay?

363
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
Hello, everyone.

364
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm Chen Fei'er.

365
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
I know.

366
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
Recently, everyone is concerned about

367
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,520
My condition

368
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,240
It's real.

369
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,920
Every word

370
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,080
And every picture.

371
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,120
It's all true.

372
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,400
But I don't want to

373
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
To explain anything.

374
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
I just want to

375
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,520
To share.

376
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,400
From the ugly duckling,

377
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,480
To become a swan.

378
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,240
The person I used to be,

379
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
It's ugly.

380
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,280
Very fat.

381
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,200
And has low self-esteem.

382
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,720
So, I used plastic surgery

383
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,320
And liposuction.

384
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
I've changed my appearance.

385
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,320
I thought that by changing,

386
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,760
The way I look,

387
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,240
I can eliminate

388
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,920
My sense of inferiority

389
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,040
But actually,

390
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
It's not like this.

391
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,280
When someone calls me beautiful,

392
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,080
You're in good shape.

393
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,800
The more I fear losing it all.

394
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,240
I

395
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,920
I was on the live stream.

396
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,599
What do you mean?

397
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
a face without makeup

398
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,079
Are lying to everyone.

399
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,440
Actually, my diet

400
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,359
Diet and vomiting.

401
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
Come on, Chen Fei.

402
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,360
Come on, you're the best.

403
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,400
Come on

404
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,520
I know that being a

405
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,560
Public figure

406
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,880
I shouldn't pretend to be a fake person.

407
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
And deceived everyone.

408
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,760
sorry

409
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,720
I don't expect your forgiveness.

410
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,960
But I just...

411
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
I just hope

412
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,720
It can make more people

413
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,200
Or because

414
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,640
The girl who is not confident in her appearance knows that

415
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
Even if you change your appearance,

416
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,240
But you can't change it.

417
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,800
Your own inner

418
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Hello, everyone.

419
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,640
I'm Phil's.

420
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,560
Private psychologist.

421
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,960
I know she's not like

422
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
What she said.

423
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,200
One-sided and vain.

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
She just chose wrong.

425
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,840
The way to change yourself.

426
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
Please

427
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
Treat her as a longing.

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,840
Who is recognized by others.

429
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Don't judge again.

430
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,440
And disturb her life.

431
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,680
alone

432
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
To face it.

433
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,680
Your pain and weakness.

434
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,320
She deserves

435
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,520
Everyone's respect.

436
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,960
Chen Fei, did you see it?

437
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,720
Someone is supporting you.

438
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,440
There are many people like you.

439
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,480
The feeling.

440
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
You're not alone.

441
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,800
And suffer.

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,720
Sida

443
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,920
I have good news for you.

444
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,520
sister

445
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,440
Your audition.

446
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
Was approved by the director group.

447
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,520
In two days,

448
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,200
You can go to the shooting.

449
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,200
Thanks to you.

450
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,800
If he hadn't directed me,

451
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,040
I won't be recognized by them.

452
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll get this information

453
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,680
Tell him.

454
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,160
Don't bother Zimmer.

455
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
She has her own business.

456
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,240
You need to be busy.

457
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,880
Don't always ask for help.

458
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
You're right.

459
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,800
That's right.

460
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,520
I won't tell him.

461
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,440
Isn't that famous model

462
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,120
Chen Fei'er?

463
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,920
That's right.

464
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,440
She didn't disappear.

465
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,320
For a long time?

466
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,240
Why are you coming out again?

467
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,880
It's live.

468
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,240
Yeah, why are you here now?

469
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
It's quite pretty.

470
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,040
Thank you for listening.

471
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
My story

472
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,320
And thank you for supporting me.

473
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,840
And trust me.

474
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm Chen Fei'er.

475
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
My face and body

476
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,960
Are all fake.

477
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,160
But this time,

478
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm standing in front of you.

479
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,000
With the most real me,

480
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,200
To meet everyone.

481
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
So please give me advice.

482
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,360
How am I doing?

483
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,800
Isn't it great?

484
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,640
Phil!

485
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,120
You're really great.

486
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,960
We're proud of you.

487
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,240
Thank you for your hard work.

488
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
You can finally have a good rest.

489
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,080
Get some sleep.

490
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,360
What happened later,

491
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
Leave it to me.

492
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Zimmer

493
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,920
Thank you.

494
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
You shouldn't thank me.

495
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
You should thank yourself.

496
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
Crying and laughing.

497
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
Like a madman.

498
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,280
That's enough.

499
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
I have something to ask you.

500
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm really curious.

501
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,520
It's my scandal.

502
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,080
After the exposure,

503
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,560
You can cancel my contract.

504
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,120
Why are you helping me?

505
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,960
Because you're Ruo's boyfriend.

506
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,360
My friend.

507
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,160
If the man is so happy,

508
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
With you by her side,

509
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm happy for her.

510
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
He's here.

511
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,560
He's here.

512
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,480
Who is it?

513
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,720
Are you all right?

514
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,640
Nothing

515
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,720
I'm fine.

516
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,640
Why are you here?

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
I mean, you...

518
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,160
Why are you live-streaming?

519
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Without telling me.

520
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,280
Are you telling me?

521
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,240
I can give you some ideas.

522
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,000
Sometimes,

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,200
You need to face it yourself.

524
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,440
Although I have nothing now,

525
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,000
But I was relaxed.

526
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,480
And I'm not alone.

527
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
Zimmer and Xiao Xiao were both here.

528
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,040
Zimmer was here just now.

529
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,800
And he convinced me

530
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,680
Live.

531
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,880
He said

532
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,520
You must face it with courage.

533
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,760
All the troubles

534
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,400
So that it can be quelled.

535
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,960
I didn't expect that

536
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
Has helped a lot.

537
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Before that,

538
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,880
Now it's you.

539
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,680
If a man

540
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,560
Seriously,

541
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
After this incident,

542
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,440
I think Zimmer's character

543
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
It's great.

544
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,440
He is kind.

545
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,280
And love each other.

546
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,560
The most important thing is to love you.

547
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,160
You know I just started

548
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,040
To him.

549
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,440
I always think that

550
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,480
And unpredictable.

551
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,240
But now I understand,

552
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,560
He's like a strong liquor.

553
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
At the beginning,

554
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,680
It's bitter and spicy.

555
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
But you drank until the end.

556
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,720
So that you can taste it slowly.

557
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,600
Mellow

558
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,320
Now I'm speaking for Zimmer.

559
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,440
No

560
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,280
I'm definitely not

561
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,120
He helped me.

562
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,640
That's why I speak for him.

563
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,000
I just want to

564
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,160
Let me tell you something.

565
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,760
To see a man.

566
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,080
Whether you care about a woman or not,

567
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,160
Not only to see

568
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,600
To this woman.

569
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,880
But also this woman.

570
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,560
The people around you, okay?

571
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
Zimmer was willing

572
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,680
Help me and Star.

573
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,960
It's all because of you.

574
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,200
He wants to share your worries.

575
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,040
It's a sign that he loves you.

576
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,720
So, seize it.

577
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,600
Chen Fei.

578
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,400
Are you really

579
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,120
When people are good, they tend to make old mistakes.

580
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,440
You can't be a man.

581
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm fully recovered now.

582
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,760
So you should leave now.

583
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,840
I'll think about it.

584
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,360
My future life plan.

585
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,680
No

586
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,440
I've only been here for less than 10 minutes.

587
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,040
I don't even sit hot in my ass.

588
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,360
You want to drive me away?

589
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,080
You're too realistic.

590
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,960
So you know?

591
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,880
Oh that's true!

592
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
No, I'm not.

593
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,120
I want you to think about it.

594
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,760
Who should you choose?

595
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,640
Who should I choose?

596
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,120
President Ji.

597
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,360
The live stream of Phil.

598
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,600
That's great.

599
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,480
Because of her.

600
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,440
There are many netizens.

601
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,360
Has been recommended and purchased.

602
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,440
Our products.

603
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,760
Look.

604
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,880
A short day.

605
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,840
Our sales

606
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,480
It went up ten percent.

607
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,480
Phil's story is not unique.

608
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,680
everybody

609
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,400
Will resonate.

610
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,960
yes

611
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,160
The whole life of a woman

612
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,240
Are trying to maintain their bodies.

613
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,360
And beauty.

614
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,120
The sweetness and bitterness of it

615
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,960
Only them.

616
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,760
I know.

617
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
So, President Ji,

618
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,680
You have to design more

619
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,640
That can cure women.

620
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,240
To comfort their hearts.

621
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,440
Care for women.

622
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,360
We are men.

623
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,560
What I should do.

624
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,800
To heal people with clothes.

625
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,400
Is also our wing fashion.

626
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,200
The design concept.

627
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,960
yes

628
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,960
According to this trend,

629
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,680
If it goes up another 20 percent,

630
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
Where are you now?

631
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
I want to see you.

632
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,360
Then we'll reach

633
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm going out.

634
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,560
Where are you going?

635
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
There will be a meeting later, Mr. Ji.

636
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,480
There's nothing else.

637
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,200
Is more important than this.

638
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,960
She misses me.

639
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,040
who

640
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,120
feed

641
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
Where are you now?

642
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
I want to see you now.

643
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,120
Turn around.

644
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,200
Why are you here?

645
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,920
Because I want to see you.

646
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
I miss you so much.

647
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
I want to thank you.

648
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,000
For me.

649
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,480
And for the people around me.

650
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,200
Everything I did,

651
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,320
Everyone is looking at you.

652
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,360
Let them have a look.

653
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,320
I'm the boss.

654
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,040
I love it.

655
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,520
Holding the woman I like,

656
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
Stop it. Hurry up.

657
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Stop it.

658
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
A hug sent me away.

659
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
What do you want?

660
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,000
What are you expecting?

661
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
No.

662
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,680
go

663
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,960
If a man

664
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,920
I have a lot of work to do.

665
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,640
I didn't finish it.

666
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,440
I can't stay with you.

667
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,480
But I won't let you go.

668
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,440
Can you stay with me?

669
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,200
Stay longer.

670
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,720
Sure.

671
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,880
I'll stay here.

672
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,320
As your charging treasure.

673
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,680
I'll leave when you're charged.

674
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,960
good

675
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,520
I'm going out.

676
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,080
A man who works hard.

677
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,280
You're really handsome.

678
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,360
You came to my house in the middle of the night.

679
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,320
Give me one.

680
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Footbath

681
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,040
Give it back.

682
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,960
Help me clean up the house.

683
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,000
What do you want to do?

684
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,440
Chen Fei.

685
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,320
You can't eat it anymore.

686
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,200
This kind of junk food.

687
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,080
Do you know?

688
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,640
From now on,

689
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,880
I want to be

690
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,120
Your psychiatrist.

691
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
I don't care whether you agree or not.

692
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,360
I don't care about you.

693
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,520
How much should I pay?

694
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,560
Anyway, I'm in charge.

695
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,160
I don't need your pity.

696
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
Anyway, I'm already

697
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,240
The broken pot broke.

698
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,560
Everyone knows that

699
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,720
About my past.

700
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,520
My career

701
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,720
Is over.

702
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,400
I don't have any motivation to lose weight.

703
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
And I don't want to

704
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,960
And become ugly and fat.

705
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,440
Because of you.

706
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,680
Chen Fei.

707
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320
I will never abandon you.

708
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,520
No matter what you become,

709
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,560
I like you.

710
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,720
I will always love you.

711
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,840
Who wants you to like it?

712
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
You are so affectionate.

713
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,880
Are you flattering yourself?

714
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,800
I don't know.

715
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,120
But,

716
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,720
I made you a nutrient congee.

717
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,800
Have a drink.

718
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,640
Then I'll...

719
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,200
Just try it.

720
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,560
Come on.

721
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,880
My wife.

722
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Have a taste.

723
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,640
Why are you looking at me?

724
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,120
Am I so handsome?

725
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,320
I wish time

726
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,160
Can stay at this moment.

727
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,800
We still have a lot of time.

728
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,440
If a man

729
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,080
I want to confess something to you.

730
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,040
About Zhao Yucheng,

731
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,440
What a coincidence.

732
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,360
feed

733
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,560
Old Zhao.

734
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,440
This floor

735
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
What material?

736
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,600
What's that sound?

737
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,120
It's okay.

738
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,200
I accidentally kicked something.

739
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,800
Some words.

740
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,440
I want to tell you.

741
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,680
a row

742
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,880
I have something to tell you.

743
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,680
good

744
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,560
I'll send you the address later.

745
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,120
Well

746
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,040
See you later.

747
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
naive

748
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,160
Vinegar King.

749
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,840
Can you stop looking for Zhao Yucheng?

750
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,920
Do you believe me or not?

751
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,800
believe

752
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,640
but

753
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,840
Then listen to me.

754
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,120
I will handle it well.

755
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,120
I'm not the kind of person

756
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,720
A man who has two sides,

757
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,560
Okay?

758
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,560
Stay here and wait for me.

759
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,720
That's it?

760
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,200
Well

761
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,440
You're too hasty.

762
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,920
Well

763
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Thank you for your wine.

764
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,440
I have something to tell you.

765
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,239
Don't worry.

766
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,719
Finish your drink.

767
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,360
I won't drink the wine.

768
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,679
Because I want to wake up.

769
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,040
I'm telling you this.

770
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,920
You're nice to me.

771
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,239
At work,

772
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,560
You really helped me a lot.

773
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
I really appreciate you.

774
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,719
But I have to be honest with you.

775
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,800
In contact with you.

776
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,679
During this period,

777
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you remember

778
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,960
I've told you

779
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
The story?

780
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,840
I only told half of it.

781
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,600
To hide the other half.

782
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,000
And this glass of wine

783
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,320
There's a name.

784
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,280
It's called the truth.

785
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Drink it.

786
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,920
I'll give the whole story

787
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,480
I'll tell you everything.

788
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,800
Take it as

789
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,920
Is the last drink with me.

790
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,880
Okay?

791
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,400
Thank you

792
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,440
Do you remember what I told you before?

793
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,080
To me,

794
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,400
Is very important.

795
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,560
That girl?

796
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,280
remember

797
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,840
She's my sister.

798
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
It's Su Xiao.

799
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,080
Suxiao

800
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,680
Do you mean Su Xiao?

801
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,400
that's right

802
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,560
Is Zimmer's ex-girlfriend.

803
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,720
It's also the first time

804
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,600
The one I owe the most.

805
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,680
So you knew Zimmer.

806
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,640
yes

807
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
So you...

808
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,920
You approached me on purpose.

809
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,040
I admit that

810
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,520
When I first contacted you,

811
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,440
It's because of Zimmer.

812
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,120
Because I want to know

813
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,280
After my sister,

814
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,080
Zimmer will fall in love with

815
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
What kind of girl?

816
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,440
But during the whole process,

817
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,360
I fell in love with you

818
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,320
Can't get rid of it.

819
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,360
This...

820
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,440
It's not what I expected.

821
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,840
And within the scope of the plan,

822
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,640
But if a man

823
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,240
Please believe me.

824
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,280
The reason why I told you everything,

825
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
I don't want to see

826
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,200
You're the same as my sister.

827
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,040
In the hands of Zimmer.

828
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,800
Well

829
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,680
Does Zimmer know who you are?

830
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,200
know

831
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,680
You both know who the other is.

832
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,120
I don't know.

833
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,920
You two combined to lie to me.

834
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,640
If a man

835
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,920
This...

836
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,400
I can solve it.

837
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,000
Thank you for the wine.

838
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,000
And thank you for the truth.

839
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,960
If a man

840
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,240
Two men are chasing a woman.

841
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,000
Are two liars.

842
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,240
To fool a fool.

843
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,200
Calm down.

844
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,200
Zhao Yucheng said that.

845
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
maybe

846
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,640
Why don't you ask Zimmer?

847
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,800
What's there to ask?

848
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,680
One motive is not simple.

849
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,960
The one who didn't report it,

850
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,040
I hate the most.

851
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,280
A man lied to me.

852
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
I think

853
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
What about the one with ulterior motives?

854
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,480
You don't like it anyway.

855
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,160
Forget it.

856
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,080
The one who didn't report it.

857
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,680
What if he has a problem?

858
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,280
What's wrong with you?

859
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,360
I don't know the situation.

860
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,400
Are you my best friend?

861
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,440
You want to speak for me?

862
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,960
Whose side are you on?

863
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
Stop it.

864
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,600
That

865
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,880
I need to use the restroom.

866
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,000
President Ji.

867
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,280
The report has been sorted out.

868
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
Put it here.

869
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,200
President Ji.

870
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,200
What's wrong, President Ji?

871
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
You're so happy.

872
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,200
My face is cramping.

873
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,280
What's wrong?

874
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,080
get up

875
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,760
What's wrong?

876
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,920
If anything good happens to you,

877
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,880
Share it.

878
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,960
What do you know?

879
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,720
This is the magic of love.

880
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,080
Love, I'm telling you.

881
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,800
I might.

882
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,280
You're in love.

883
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,880
You're in love.

884
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,080
Who is it?

885
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,600
If you're a male,

886
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,840
is or isn't

887
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,120
feed

888
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,320
If he knows,

889
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,240
The identity of Zhao Yucheng.

890
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
I know you've been lying to her.

891
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,280
I've never seen it before.

892
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,640
She was so angry.

893
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,040
Come to your home to beg for mercy.

894
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,440
If it's too late, it will be impossible.

895
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,040
No

896
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Before I could tell her,

897
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,520
How did she know everything?

898
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,160
Zhao

899
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,520
Zhao Yucheng said it himself.

900
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,440
I can't tell you so much.

901
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,960
If Ruuo knows about it,

902
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,680
If I tipped them off,

903
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,880
She will scold me to death.

904
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
I can only help you so far.

905
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,600
The rest

906
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,040
It's up to you.

907
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,640
First,

908
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,200
Hang up.

909
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,000
President Ji.

910
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,920
You haven't told me yet.

911
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,000
When did it happen?

912
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,480
What's up

913
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
It's over.

914
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,080
What is it?

915
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,920
I'm not in a relationship yet.

916
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,800
You might be lovelorn.

917
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,440
So fast?

918
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,880
No

919
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,440
President Ji.

920
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,240
So fast?

921
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,680
The mood swings are so fast.

922
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,440
Is there anything else?

923
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,160
Hang up.

924
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,640
I'm downstairs now.

925
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,480
Give me a chance to explain.

926
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,200
all right?

927
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,960
not good

928
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,880
Zhao Yucheng.

929
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,960
What's wrong with you?

930
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,320
Why did you tell her?

931
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,080
You can't let her

932
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,160
To live simply?

933
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,680
Because I want her to know

934
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,160
What kind of person are you?

935
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,840
Even if she doesn't choose me,

936
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,600
I shouldn't be with you.

937
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,080
You're really selfish.

938
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,600
You don't deserve to love a man.

939
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,560
You know what?

940
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,600
But you didn't even

941
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,160
You are not qualified to talk about whether you are qualified or not.

942
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
Enough

943
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,760
If a man

944
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,440
You two,

945
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,800
Stop pestering me.

946
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,960
Don't you want to disturb the neighbors?

947
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,360
If a man

948
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,560
That's enough.

949
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,000
I repeat.

950
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,440
I don't want either of you.

951
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Are you done?

952
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,480
If you don't leave,

953
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,840
Zimmer

954
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,440
I heard from Chen Fei'er.

955
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,160
What about

956
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,360
If I have forgiven you,

957
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,240
I told you.

958
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,640
You should tell Zhao Yucheng

959
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,800
I told her in advance.

960
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,320
To save you from being so passive now.
