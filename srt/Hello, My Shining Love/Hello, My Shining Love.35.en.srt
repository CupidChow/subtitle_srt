1
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Every time you sleepwalk,

2
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,360
You can dream back.

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
Are you cheating?

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not leaving.

5
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
Go home early.

6
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,440
Waiting for you.

7
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,120
Why are you so late?

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm going out soon.

9
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,960
There's food in the fridge. Help yourself.

10
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,000
Where are you going?

11
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Go on a date.

12
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
The first day after I broke up,

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
After being kicked out of the house,

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
You left me at home alone.

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
You're right.

16
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,760
And made your senior brother look like a supercilious wolf.

17
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm doing this for you.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Phil and Ruuo's relationship

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
They are best friends, right?

20
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll go to Phyl's.

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
To find out what Ruowan thinks.

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,920
I'll beg her to beg for you.

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,840
Explain.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
You should apologize to me.

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,440
This matter will be solved.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,600
It's not as easy as you think.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
You should go on a date.

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,240
How will you know if you don't try?

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,760
a row

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
I'll go then.

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,680
Correct!

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,680
Tonight,

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
If I don't come back,

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,760
Don't contact me.

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,880
Why did you change your attitude again?

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
Don't smile like that. It's scary.

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,840
I want to see you

38
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,160
As a roommate,

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,480
My love for you.

40
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,120
I have no feelings for you.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,840
You are so messy and overbearing.

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,880
A snobbish woman.

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,280
How could I have feelings for you?

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,600
And I can't move out.

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
cockroach

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,960
let go

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
good

48
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
Don't go. Pack up.

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you...

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,480
Read the contract carefully.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
It's clearly stipulated in it.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Don't violate personal privacy.

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Forget it. Go.

54
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,240
I can't talk to you.

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,839
Such a messy woman.

56
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,000
Living under the same roof.

57
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,360
Let's go.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
What a clean walk!

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
It's like I've never been here before.

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,440
Come on.

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,960
come

62
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,480
to

63
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,360
Enough wine tonight. Cheers.

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,880
Phil!

65
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,520
Should we

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,600
Have a drink.

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,040
That's right, Phil.

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
Have a drink. Come on.

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
Come on.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,560
Give me a cup.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,320
What are you afraid of?

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Come on. That's right.

73
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Give me a cup.

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Come on.

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,040
She doesn't want to drink with you.

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Can't you see that?

77
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
Who are you?

78
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm his boyfriend.

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,760
And return your boyfriend.

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,760
Last time,

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Phil, the driver?

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,280
That's right. I remember it too.

83
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,760
A driver.

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't pretend.

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,680
Namely

86
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
Phil, let's go.

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,760
Chen Fei.

88
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,440
He wants to take advantage of you.

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,360
Phil, get out of here.

90
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,120
Chen Fei.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Don't go out.

92
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Why?

93
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,560
Let go of me!

94
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
Chen Fei.

95
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,280
Let go of me.

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,000
Chen Fei.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Go out, Chen Fei.

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,640
Let go of me!

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Come to Chen Fei.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,880
Phil, let's go back for a drink.

101
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
Yes, sit down and drink.

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,280
Come on. Sit down.

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,200
Hurry up. Ignore him.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,560
Let's drink and drink.

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
The most important thing is to be happy.

106
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,200
come

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,760
Let go of me!

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
Let me in.

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,000
Why don't you let me in?

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm looking for a friend.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
If you don't leave, I'll do it.

112
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,480
good

113
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm leaving. Have you finished?

114
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,920
Move out of my way

115
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Let me in.

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,200
Let me in.

117
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,400
roll

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,120
Now,

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
What a cat and dog.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,080
You treat yourself as a human.

121
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
That's right.

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
I didn't take a mirror to look at it.

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
To see who you are.

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,320
Come on, drink.

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
Let's go play over there.

126
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,640
come

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,800
Let's take a photo.

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,200
I have something to tell you.

129
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,080
Be my woman.

130
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,880
Don't you want our company

131
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,320
For the next season.

132
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
The main show?

133
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,480
Tonight,

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
Come with me.

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,480
What do you want

136
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,600
I'll give it to you.

137
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
A lot of job opportunities.

138
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,000
Pick any one.

139
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
As long as you listen to me,

140
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,320
You are so naughty.

141
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,080
Let go of me.

142
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,960
What are you doing?

143
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,280
What a hooligan!

144
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,360
Is that clear?

145
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,160
And you.

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,240
Without a good thing,

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,840
The man

148
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
He is my boyfriend.

149
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,920
what?

150
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,440
Why are you looking down on me?

151
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,160
And in my eyes,

152
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,920
Than all of you.

153
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,040
you

154
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
What are you wearing?

155
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,120
Come on.

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,880
Don't be angry.

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't be angry.

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,880
We'll drink with you.

159
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,720
Don't be mad. Have a drink.

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,480
AiLi

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,160
AiLi

162
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,880
AiLi

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,440
Are you all right?

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,040
Why are you here?

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
Don't bother me.

166
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,400
Ali, are you all right?

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,560
AiLi

168
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
Can you talk to me nicely?

169
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,720
Chen Fei.

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
The two of us

171
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
Are not from the same circle.

172
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
I still want to squeeze into it.

173
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
I think I'm a bitch.

174
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
What do you mean?

175
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,640
Do you know what I did

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
I just gave up

177
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
What a great job opportunity.

178
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
Do you know what I did

179
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,760
How long have I been fighting for?

180
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
It's good for you to give up.

181
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
The man inside is not a good man.

182
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,480
Don't go in.

183
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
Ali, what are you doing?

184
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,640
Ali, come back.

185
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm not coming back.

186
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
What are you talking about? I can't hear you.

187
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
Speak louder.

188
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
I'm not coming back.

189
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,520
you

190
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,160
You won't come back.

191
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
You said you wouldn't come back.

192
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,560
What do you mean?

193
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
Are you breaking up?

194
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,520
Make it clear.

195
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,800
But I just admitted that

196
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
You're my boyfriend.

197
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,560
you

198
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,560
Aren't you on a date?

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Why are you back?

200
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
What happened to your mouth?

201
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
It's okay.

202
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
No

203
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
Does Phil know?

204
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,360
We broke up.

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
It's so sudden.

206
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
I don't think she has ever

207
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,560
And loved me.

208
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,120
I didn't feel it.

209
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,080
Her love for me

210
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
She didn't

211
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,160
She admitted that I was her boyfriend.

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm actually a backup.

213
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,680
She probably enjoys

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
The feeling of being liked.

215
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,840
We are really hard brothers.

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,640
You lost your love all together.

217
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,960
That's true.

218
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,880
We are both

219
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
She studied psychology.

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,120
Why can't I wear it?

221
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,680
What's a woman's idea?

222
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,560
Love is really

223
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
The clinical science is too tricky.

224
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,560
The problems are so diverse.

225
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,400
And experienced doctors.

226
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,440
You have to follow the rules.

227
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
Then,

228
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,800
If you really want to end it with Phil,

229
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
I don't want to think about it.

230
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
It's too hard.

231
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,440
What's up

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,880
What's up

233
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,000
What's wrong?

234
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,400
AiLi

235
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,080
Ellie is an asshole.

236
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,640
He left me alone on the street.

237
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,240
You want to break up with me?

238
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,600
That's what you do.

239
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
You don't cherish it at all.

240
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
The other person's sincerity

241
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,880
She likes you.

242
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,120
You take it for granted.

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,560
She's gentle and considerate to you.

244
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,120
Take it as a daily routine.

245
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
It's not worth it.

246
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,560
And give it my heart.

247
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,280
Dugu is like a man.

248
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm lovelorn now.

249
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,360
you

250
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,320
Aren't you supposed to comfort me?

251
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,680
How could you...

252
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,920
Why did you scold me?

253
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm lovelorn too.

254
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
You broke up with Zimmer?

255
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,480
Yes?

256
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
Alright.

257
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm fine.

258
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,320
But as your best friend,

259
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,680
I'm willing to share your pain.

260
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,840
I was thinking

261
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm holding you and Zimmer.

262
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,840
The exclusive information about the breakup.

263
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,800
Ai Li will definitely

264
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,880
And come back to me.

265
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,120
Wait until he comes back.

266
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,080
When you were looking for me,

267
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,760
I will never let him

268
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
And easily escape from my hands.

269
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,800
Actually, sometimes,

270
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,720
I really envy you.

271
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,760
You've been in love for a long time.

272
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,680
Every time,

273
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,920
You can still

274
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,320
So brave to love.

275
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,840
Every time,

276
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,920
Do things with vigor and vitality

277
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
And finish it beautifully.

278
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,200
But I'm different.

279
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,400
If I have feelings,

280
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,040
You need to work hard.

281
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,840
It's been a long time.

282
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,080
So I don't want to

283
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,400
To fall in love with someone again.

284
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,280
It's too painful.

285
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm fine. I am fine.

286
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,240
If a man

287
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,520
to hug

288
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
I'm telling you,

289
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,200
Men are big hoofs.

290
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,680
You'll change.

291
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,080
But we can't.

292
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,880
Because I won't eat pig's trotter.

293
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,520
right or wrong?

294
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
Pig's trotter is so delicious.

295
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,480
So much collagen.

296
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,520
No, no.

297
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,840
We can't get married

298
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,040
Crying.

299
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,360
go

300
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,480
Let's go.

301
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,920
Where are you going?

302
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Just follow me.

303
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
It hurts so much.

304
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,440
All right.

305
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,520
That's enough.

306
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,600
That's enough.

307
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,600
That's enough.

308
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,800
Alright, take a rest.

309
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,920
The sandbag was hurt by you.

310
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,160
Come on.

311
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,640
What about

312
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,560
Is it very soothing?

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
It's so refreshing.

314
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Isn't it great?

315
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,880
It's more than an addiction.

316
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,800
So,

317
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
If you still want to fight,

318
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Don't be mad at me.

319
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,440
So I came here to take the sand bag

320
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,560
As someone you hate.

321
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,600
You can play as much as you want.

322
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,200
good

323
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,480
However

324
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,640
I just hit

325
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
I was thinking

326
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,040
If you're not looking at a sandbag,

327
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,480
But Ai Li's words.

328
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,720
I may not want to hit him like this.

329
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,200
I've thought about it.

330
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,720
Actually, Ai Li is right.

331
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,240
Because after all, I won't admit it.

332
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,040
He's my boyfriend.

333
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,440
Is too much.

334
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
I shouldn't have

335
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,280
It's so weird for him.

336
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,800
Actually, I've been thinking recently.

337
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,240
Is Zimmer really wrong?

338
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,800
However

339
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
He's having an affair with his ex-girlfriend.

340
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,080
And a thorn in my heart.

341
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,200
You are indeed worse than me.

342
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
So,

343
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,040
That's how I comfort myself.

344
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,480
Love is

345
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,640
The timing.

346
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,680
As long as the timing is wrong,

347
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
Nothing is right.

348
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm also

349
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Who are afraid of getting hurt.

350
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
I want to hurt each other

351
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,520
It's better to interrupt everything.

352
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,640
So that the two of us

353
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
And hate each other.

354
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
You're typical.

355
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Once bitten by a snake,

356
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,120
I've been afraid of Jing Sheng for ten years.

357
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,040
Maybe

358
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
I thought Lin Huan's case

359
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,640
It's been so long.

360
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,520
I've already practiced it.

361
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
The Immortal Body of King Kong.

362
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,560
I didn't expect I was still so vulnerable.

363
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,280
So vulnerable.

364
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't think it's vulnerable.

365
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,640
Because in everyone's heart,

366
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
There's a hole.

367
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,360
Even if the armor outside your body

368
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
No matter how hard it is,

369
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
But the wound

370
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,760
It will still be there.

371
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,600
So the only solution

372
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,280
Is to make sure that

373
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,560
Complete healing

374
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,480
Otherwise, no matter how strong you pretend,

375
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,320
It's just

376
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
You're bluffing.

377
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
Adult love.

378
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,720
He's good at bluffing.

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,960
This is the last time.

380
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,520
Computer body scanning and

381
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Pathological examination

382
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,040
The incision site of the tumor three years ago

383
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
There's a lump.

384
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,640
There are nodules in the right lung.

385
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,560
Estrogen receptor and

386
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,680
Progestogen receptor test results

387
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Are negative.

388
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,480
Is it a relapse?

389
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
It can be confirmed that

390
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,560
Breast cancer recurrence

391
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,200
And the lung has appeared.

392
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Cancer cell metastasis

393
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
Fortunately,

394
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,400
Was found in time.

395
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Recurrence range

396
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,480
Has certain limitations.

397
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
Radiation therapy can

398
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,000
Inhibitive

399
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,680
So,

400
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,440
You must be optimistic.

401
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,240
To reduce emotional fluctuations.

402
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,560
Actively cooperate with treatment.

403
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,880
I know.

404
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,600
Cancer is not cured.

405
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,560
You will recover as long as you take active treatment.

406
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,280
Right?

407
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,760
Don't worry about me.

408
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,280
In my dream,

409
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,120
Has appeared countless times.

410
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,800
Now,

411
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,840
The stone has finally landed.

412
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,560
I don't have to struggle anymore.

413
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,200
Zimmer

414
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,080
Can you...

415
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,040
Don't tell my brother.

416
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,200
And Dugu Ruuo.

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,240
Why did you hide it from them?

418
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
If my brother knows the result,

419
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,320
It will definitely be worse than me.

420
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
Dugu is like a man.

421
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,440
Just let me keep it.

422
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,800
The final dignity.

423
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,240
good

424
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,080
I know.

425
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
Can you go back to the wing fashion?

426
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
Wing fashion belongs to you.

427
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,720
I won't interfere anymore.

428
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,760
Don't reject me.

429
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
Think about it.

430
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,600
My body

431
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
Will get weaker day by day.

432
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,600
I don't have the energy.

433
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
To manage the fashion wing.

434
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,200
It can only rely on you.

435
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,160
No

436
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,560
You'll be fine.

437
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
You're here today.

438
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,160
Because of pity.

439
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,880
Or guilty?

440
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,480
I once owed you.

441
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,040
So I'll give you an explanation.

442
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,600
But besides that,

443
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,800
I can't give you anything else.

444
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Today,

445
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
The courage has run out.

446
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,560
Without courage,

447
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,360
To hear your answer.

448
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,360
Suxiao

449
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,520
Why are you here?

450
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
I know you're looking for me.

451
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,960
Do you have something to say to me?

452
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,960
I have a lot to say to you.

453
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,960
During your time away,

454
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,600
I've been living

455
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,800
Guilt

456
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,480
And blame yourself.

457
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
I dare not accept love.

458
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,960
I dare not.

459
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,080
To accept a new relationship.

460
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
Until I met her.

461
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,440
She asked me to change

462
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
Walking dead.

463
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,040
Has become alive.

464
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Every day is no longer numb.

465
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,120
And self-torture.

466
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,240
But looking forward to tomorrow.

467
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,640
Suxiao

468
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,000
I always wanted to see you.

469
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,960
In front of you,

470
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,120
Say sorry.

471
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,720
I can't lie to myself anymore.

472
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm in love with Dugu Ruuo.

473
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
If I don't say it,

474
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,440
Is disrespectful to her.

475
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,160
therefore

476
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
This is our last time

477
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,280
We met.

478
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,280
This is farewell.

479
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Right?

480
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,760
It's time to say goodbye.

481
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,320
I'll put the past

482
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,640
to come and go

483
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,320
In my heart.

484
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,360
Keep going.

485
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,200
Suxiao

486
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,280
I will always remember you.

487
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,000
And the love you gave me

488
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,480
To love.

489
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,480
sorry

490
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,840
Thank you.

491
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,720
Bye

492
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,160
Leave now.

493
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,840
Zimmer

494
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,520
Don't worry. Go to love.

495
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,200
Suxiao

496
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,240
Suxiao

497
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,280
Suxiao

498
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,280
Suxiao

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,240
From now on, if you

500
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,880
If you dare to appear in front of her again,

501
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,080
I will ruin your whole world.

502
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,440
She means the world to me.

503
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,440
That's great.

504
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,840
Si Da, you're so into the play.

505
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,360
And his acting

506
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,400
Much more than I thought.

507
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,440
I didn't expect you to be so

508
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,200
Acting talent.

509
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,760
The first work is so excellent.

510
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
There will be a huge fire.

511
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,880
You must.

512
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,480
Thank you

513
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,640
Thank you.

514
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,520
sister

515
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,440
What do you think

516
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
I think the performance

517
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Although it's a little green,

518
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
But as a newbie,

519
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
I can see your intention.

520
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,640
It's great.

521
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Did I hear it correctly?

522
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,040
Do you really think so?

523
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,120
I didn't hear that.

524
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
And after the play is broadcast,

525
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,040
Many people will see your acting.

526
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,720
Your efforts were not in vain.

527
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
Congratulations to Si Da.

528
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,680
very good

529
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,120
Sister, sister.

530
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,840
The live stream has come out.

531
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,600
How much is the data?

532
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,160
80 million yuan.

533
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,880
And now,

534
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,400
Is still rising.

535
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,120
What is 80 million yuan?

536
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,000
For the premiere,

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,280
It's a hit.

538
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,880
A popular drama.

539
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,760
Am I dreaming?

540
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,840
It's not a dream.

541
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,720
Finally,

542
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,040
To see my Star.

543
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,440
Over the past few months,

544
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
Everyone has worked hard.

545
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,040
After work today,

546
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,240
Celebrate it.

547
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,120
very good

548
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,960
I'm going to open the champagne.

549
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,080
How dare you hurt her?

550
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,760
I know.

551
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,280
This Song Zihao.

552
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,120
How to act?

553
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,640
Are all overbearing.

554
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
This is Song Zihao.

555
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
It's getting greasy.

556
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,880
Namely

557
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,960
After so many years,

558
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,840
The acting has not improved at all.

559
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,400
I can give up for her.

560
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
As the president.

561
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
The second male is called Star, right?

562
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,800
Yes, it's called Star.

563
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,520
I heard that we are in the same company.

564
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,680
She means the world to me.

565
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,120
Song Zihao, why are you

566
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,560
You missed work for no reason.

567
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Now the whole crew

568
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,640
Are waiting for you.

569
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,520
Do you know?

570
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
What have you been doing all day?

571
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,600
Hurry up.

572
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,400
Go to the scene with me.

573
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,320
I know you've been working hard recently.

574
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,600
When you're done,

575
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
I'll give you a holiday.

576
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,360
all right?

577
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,560
Song Zihao, did you

578
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,040
Are you listening to me?

579
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,600
Songzihao

580
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,280
Songzihao

581
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,560
Songzihao

582
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,760
Zihao, you...

583
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,080
Wake up.

584
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,680
Doctor

585
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,760
What disease is he suffering from?

586
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,280
Why did you suddenly pass out?

587
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,920
The patient is chronically sleep deprived.

588
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,920
And excessive alcohol.

589
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
His body is extremely weak.

590
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,440
Do you know anything about his mental condition?

591
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,640
I just wanted to remind you

592
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,560
Zi Hao is in a bad condition.

593
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,920
Song Zihao is emotional now.

594
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,960
Very big.

595
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
He's very unstable.

596
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,440
Can be easily irritated and irritated.

597
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,280
Sometimes it's easy.

598
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,320
Cachexia

599
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,160
How long has this been going on?

600
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,600
For a while.

601
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,960
It's very similar to depression.

602
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,720
You should take him with you.

603
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,600
Go to the psychological consulting room to check.

604
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,560
You said he was depressed?

605
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Although I don't know him,

606
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,400
The specific situation

607
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,760
But the longer it takes,

608
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,600
I'm afraid that his condition

609
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,680
Will become more and more serious.

610
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Doctor

611
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
I want to ask you a favor.

612
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,200
Look at him now.

613
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
It's not convenient to move.

614
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,840
Can we give him

615
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,640
Open it.

616
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
To ease his mood.

617
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,160
Sedative drug

618
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,160
When he's feeling better,

619
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,640
I'll take him to check.

620
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,280
Thank you.

621
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,840
Alright.

622
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,960
Thank you.

623
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,080
clinical depression

624
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,080
You woke up.

625
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,960
Why am I here?

626
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,800
Am I sick?

627
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
Don't think too much.

628
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,960
Your life is irregular.

629
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,360
The weakness of the body.

630
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,240
Suddenly fainted.

631
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,960
But why do I think

632
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,640
It seems that

633
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
There's a problem.

634
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,840
You're not feeling well.

635
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,200
I can't keep up.

636
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,920
That's right.

637
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,280
Didn't I tell you?

638
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,680
Don't stay at home.

639
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,160
Go back to work.

640
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,840
When you're busy,

641
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,000
Everything will be fine.

642
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,200
He will be discharged tomorrow.

643
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,320
I won't miss the recording.

644
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,120
I'm in this condition.

645
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,160
Can you still work?

646
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,120
Don't worry.

647
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,800
I've asked the doctor.

648
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,520
He said as long as you take your medicine on time,

649
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,120
It will soon be fine.

650
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,440
Here, take the medicine.

651
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,760
What kind of medicine is this?

652
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
The vitamins the doctor prescribed for you.

653
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,520
To strengthen the body.

654
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,160
such

655
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,560
Take the medicine and sleep.

656
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
Take a good rest.

657
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll be fine tomorrow.

658
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,440
come

659
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,320
To see the release of Star Wars.

660
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,440
congratulations

661
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,160
feed

662
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,880
President Ji, where are you now?

663
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,679
I'm in the hospital.

664
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,880
Mr. Wang didn't want me to tell you.

665
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,600
But this matter

666
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
I can't bear it.

667
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,800
Then I won't tell you.

668
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,639
I can't stand by and watch

669
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,120
There must be a huge mess in the group.

670
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,400
Something happened to the group.

671
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,679
We didn't go to the new one.

672
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,800
A new series?

673
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,520
Suddenly,

674
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,719
The quality problem

675
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,920
There are many customers.

676
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,800
There are symptoms of allergy.

677
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
There are lines outside this shop.

678
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,400
To return it?

679
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,440
board of directors

680
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,719
I can't make up my mind now.

681
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,880
If you don't come back,

682
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,159
That's the end.

683
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,080
Hold the shareholders.

684
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,400
I'll be there soon.

685
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
If it drags on,

686
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,840
It will only get worse.

687
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,960
Wing Fashion's corporate image

688
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
Will be seriously affected.

689
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,480
Once the quality problem is exposed,

690
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,200
A blow to the business.

691
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,560
Will be fatal.

692
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,800
That's right.

693
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,320
These things are useless.

694
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,160
The most important thing now is

695
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,920
Take measures now.

696
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,880
As soon as possible.

697
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,400
But now,

698
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
The position of president is vacant.

699
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,440
It's such a big thing.

700
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,760
Who can make an idea?

701
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,320
Who dares to be the boss?

702
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,240
According to the articles of association,

703
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,360
Emergency plan.

704
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,400
Under the current situation,

705
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You can only

706
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,520
First, a group elder like me

707
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,440
before

708
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,080
To take charge of it.

709
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
How about this?

710
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,240
It's not good for him to resign.

711
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,600
At this moment,

712
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Why are you back?

713
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Mr. Ji is back.

714
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,760
There's such a big problem.

715
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,440
I can't sit by and watch.

716
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,560
Old season.

717
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,080
Don't be nervous. Sit down.

718
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,800
That's right.

719
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,080
Ji, you submitted your resignation.

720
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,840
You just want to interfere.

721
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,080
You can't help it.

722
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,280
President Ji's resignation letter.

723
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,480
Hasn't gone through the procedure yet.

724
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,040
So all the shareholders

725
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,760
If President Ji continues to stay,

726
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
Is there any objection?

727
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,920
Of course I have no objection.

728
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,240
There's no objection.

729
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,880
you

730
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,720
Stop it. Go play.

731
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,840
Ji, I just...

732
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,280
Thank you for believing in me.

733
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
I will live up to your expectations.

734
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,720
To ride out the storm with winged fashion.

735
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,600
Alright.

736
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Return the goods.

737
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,400
Return goods

738
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,480
Return goods

739
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
Have you watched the video?

740
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,920
What's your opinion?

741
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,920
Wing Fashion has never

742
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,960
Happened on the costume.

743
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,720
Quality problem

744
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,480
So I think these customers

745
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,200
They must have been ordered by someone.

746
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,320
To make trouble on purpose.

747
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,440
I don't think so.

748
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
When people are angry,

749
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
The eyebrow will be pressed.

750
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,720
The muscles around the eyes will tense up.

751
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,840
The person in the video

752
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,000
Will react like this.

753
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,040
What does that mean?

754
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
The reaction is real.

755
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,720
They didn't suffer

756
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,680
Anyone's order.

757
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,640
But the goods.

758
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,200
There's really a quality problem.

759
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,200
What can we do

760
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,960
Can we just let them

761
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
The refund will go on.

762
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,680
I think the best way now

763
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is to withdraw all

764
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,160
There's something wrong with it.

765
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,360
And declare that

766
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,320
Wing fashion

767
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,720
Will take all the responsibility.

768
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,640
And compensation.

769
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
Ji, are you kidding me?

770
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,800
Too hasty.

771
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,360
This is not an indirect admission.

772
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,280
This is our company.

773
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,360
Your own responsibility?

774
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
Since there's a problem,

775
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,960
To solve it.

776
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,640
More and more customers

777
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,440
To return it.

778
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,040
When everyone

779
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,760
When they gather together,

780
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,400
All the emotions will be amplified.

781
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,000
If we don't take measures,

782
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,040
It will definitely intensify the conflict.

783
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,160
But our clothes

784
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,440
From production to shelf,

785
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,960
We have to go through more than ten rounds of quality inspection.

786
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,840
In theory,

787
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,880
There should be no problem.

788
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,840
Even if we admit it this time,

789
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,160
But we need to know

790
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,640
What's the problem?

791
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,440
What's the problem?

792
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,320
I believe that some people know

793
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,240
I will investigate it.

794
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,160
To give you a satisfactory answer.

795
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,960
We'll stop here for today.

796
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,760
The meeting is dismissed.

797
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:18,960
Old Wang.

798
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
Please stay.

799
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
President Ji, something is wrong.

800
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,240
Come on. Sit down.

801
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,800
Go ahead.

802
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,360
Before you come back,

803
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,480
I asked Aaron to look into it.

804
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,160
The purchase list of the fabric.

805
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
find

806
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,600
There's a deficit everywhere.

807
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,960
Because of the shortage of funds,

808
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,280
To buy those

809
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,080
That caused the allergy.

810
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,720
Cheap and shoddy fabric, right?

811
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
Can cook the books.

812
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,360
And paid off the quality inspectors.

813
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,600
Can only be our wing fashion.

814
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,480
Only insiders can do it.

815
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,440
Right?

816
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,120
So,

817
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,760
So this matter

818
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,440
Is it related to you?

819
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,000
Here's the thing.

820
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,480
When I was watching the video,

821
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,760
Everyone is watching it carefully.

822
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,480
Only if you keep your eyes down,

823
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,520
Looking around without any purpose.

824
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,440
Are you guilty?

825
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,320
And anxious.

826
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
Did you already know

827
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,720
There's something wrong with that batch.

828
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,800
Old season.

829
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,480
You're going round and round.

830
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,360
You want to throw dirty water on my head?

831
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,240
You just came back and retaliated.

832
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,440
It's too obvious.

833
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,640
You're mistaken

834
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,680
I didn't get it wrong.

835
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,120
Everyone in the company

836
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
You can doubt it.

837
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
But there's one thing.

838
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,520
evidence

839
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,720
Where is the evidence?

840
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,480
evidence

841
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,000
There will be.

842
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,760
President Ji.

843
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,640
I didn't expect you to come back.

844
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,720
I knew it.

845
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,360
You won't...

846
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,480
Without concern for fashion.

847
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,720
But during the two days I've been away,

848
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,920
Someone is stirring up trouble.

849
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,400
You mean Mr. Wang?

850
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
Keep an eye on him these days.

851
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,640
Anything suspicious?

852
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,680
Report to me immediately.

853
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,400
no problem

854
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,200
feed

855
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,920
If the man is me,
