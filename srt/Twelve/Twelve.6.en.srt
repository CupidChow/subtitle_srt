1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,517


2
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:11,196
TWELVE

3
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,395
I lost track of it again.

4
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,483
It's definitely nearby.

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,736
It couldn't have gotten far.

6
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,531
Let's split up and search.

7
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,450
- I'll go this way.
- Sure.

8
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,402
Mirr, it's me.

9
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,863
- You startled me.
- Geez, Kangji.

10
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

11
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,916
- It escaped us, didn't it?
- I wouldn't be here if it didn't.

12
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,419
I bet we scared it off.

13
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,799
What is it?

14
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,968
Isn't it weird?

15
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,429
- What do you mean?
- The evil spirits.

16
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,306
They used to come out only at night,

17
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,725
but now they show up at any hour.

18
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,061
There's more of them too.

19
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,938
Don't worry too much.

20
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,773
Let's come back with the others tomorrow.

21
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,401
Sure.

22
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,154
Will you stay seated there?

23
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,781
Let's go. We should go back
and join the others.

24
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,242
Sure. Go ahead without me.

25
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,703
On my own?

26
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,371
Why? What about you?

27
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,713
Mirr, don't tell me…

28
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,299
Are you still seeing him?

29
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,470
We told you to end it.
Until when--

30
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,972
This is my business. I'll handle it.

31
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,141
This isn't something you can handle alone.

32
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,061
What will you tell the others
and what if Taesan and Marok find out?

33
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,441
Mirr.

34
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,693
Be wise about this.

35
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,780
If you violate the rules
and keep seeing him,

36
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,033
Ogwi might have to pay a big price.

37
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,452
You and Ogwi.

38
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,122
I wish you'd choose
what's best for each other.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,170
This will be the last time
I turn a blind eye.

40
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,893
Mirr.

41
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,813
Don't forget this. Ogwi isn't like us.

42
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,731
He's human,

43
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,693
and we were created to protect humans.

44
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,967
TWELVE

45
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,689
<i>If it gets dangerous,</i>

46
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,191
just run. I'll handle them.

47
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,360
Hey,

48
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,530
are you belittling me
or looking out for me?

49
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,576
You know full well I'm the only one
whose powers aren't sealed.

50
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,623
I've got this.

51
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,220
You puny brat.

52
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,433
Way to go.

53
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,840
Goodness.

54
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,428
Uh-huh.

55
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,767
Samin, did you take my soul stone?

56
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,609
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

57
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,197
I have a choice to make.

58
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,159
One that brings me pleasure.

59
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,788
Who should I kill first?

60
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,112
Mirr.

61
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,864
Mirr, wake up.

62
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,740
Mirr?

63
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,450
Mirr!

64
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,249
Ogwi, you.

65
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,128
Your memories are back.

66
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,884
How does it feel

67
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,679
to be fully conscious yet unable to move?

68
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,809
Though I was trapped
for thousands of years,

69
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,812
I could never get used to it.

70
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,204
Why did you have me sealed back then?

71
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,875
That wasn't what I planned.

72
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,503
It was God's will.

73
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,629
I see.

74
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,550
The same God
who has ignored me my whole life?

75
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,804
How about I forsake you the same way?

76
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,809
Like the time I lost
in thousands of years of captivity

77
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,436
and the memories that were erased,

78
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,189
you will face death.

79
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,640
MAROK
INCOMING CALL

80
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,433
Chief, Marok's calling.

81
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,148
Hello? Old man!

82
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,691
Marok!

83
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,366
Taesan.

84
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,037
Well, I…

85
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,081
It hurts a lot.

86
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,709
Old man, what happened?

87
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,918
<i>You…</i>

88
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,754
are going to listen to me.

89
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,216
Samin…

90
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,053
seems to have acquired Haetae's powers.

91
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,181
<i>Now,</i>

92
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,768
he will control humans as he pleases.

93
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,062
<i>That's why</i>

94
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,190
<i>you must</i>

95
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,109
open the Hellmouth, Taesan.

96
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,361
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

97
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,323
<i>A world without humans</i>

98
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,617
will be Hell…

99
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,828
stripped of any future.

100
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,496
Hold on.

101
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,623
<i>Also,</i>

102
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,878
Ogwi took Mirr away.

103
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,088
<i>You must</i>

104
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,341
<i>find her.</i>

105
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,968
If Samin gets his hands

106
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,346
on the Dragon Soul

107
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,933
within Mirr too,

108
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,769
you won't be able to handle him

109
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,648
even if you guys get your powers back.

110
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,732
Do you hear me?

111
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,400
I got it, old man.

112
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,486
I'll get Mirr back, whatever it takes.

113
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,364
I'm on my way, so hang in there.

114
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,949
Got it, old man?

115
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,075
<i>I…</i>

116
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,994
wanted to fulfill my duties

117
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,539
as your guardian until the very end.

118
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:25,002
<i>I'm sorry to leave you</i>
<i>with this burden, Taesan.</i>

119
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,339
<i>Taesan,</i>

120
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,132
I…

121
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,303
The money…

122
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,139
The money I borrowed from you.

123
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,936
<i>I'm afraid I can't pay you back.</i>

124
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,691
Old man, you will pay me back!

125
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,276
Survive and pay me back.

126
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,860
<i>Pull yourself together!</i>

127
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,070
Forgive me…

128
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,115
for always…

129
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,785
leaning and depending on you.

130
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,582
I'm sorry.

131
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,460
<i>Taesan…</i>

132
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,171
I'm sorry.

133
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,217
I'm sorry.

134
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,471
<i>Old man?</i>

135
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,765
<i>Old man!</i>

136
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,436
<i>Old man!</i>

137
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,816
Old man!

138
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,319
Old man…

139
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,072
Wonseung.

140
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,535
We must hurry. Step on it.

141
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,620
Got it.

142
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,774
Over there.

143
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,762
Marok!

144
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,985
Taesan, Marok is…

145
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,743
Marok…

146
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:11,836
Old man.

147
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,223
Chief, Marok's gone…

148
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,104
Old man.

149
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,112
Marok.

150
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,948
Marok!

151
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,389
Marok…

152
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,589
Marok…

153
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,071
Marok…

154
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,060
Marok!

155
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,577
Marok.

156
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,597
TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

157
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,390
At last, the world has returned
to how it used to be.

158
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,560
Humans are

159
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,647
without a doubt special beings.

160
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,027
To honor and cherish their time together,

161
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,490
they unite in thought and strength

162
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,034
to build stone graves like this

163
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,663
for the deceased.

164
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,001
To protect these humans…

165
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,297
God sent you and the other angels

166
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,257
in human form.

167
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,134
Eventually,

168
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,679
as God intended, you and the angels

169
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,057
saved the human world.

170
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,812
My siblings are dead.

171
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,732
Sacrificing our lives to protect humans…

172
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,237
Is that what God really intended?

173
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,536
Protecting humans comes with sacrifices.

174
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,124
It is our destiny to accept such a life.

175
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,878
Taesan.

176
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,259
Do not let your siblings' deaths

177
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,178
cause you to waver. Okay?

178
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,022
That is one miserable destiny.

179
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,526
ANGEL

180
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,605
Chief!

181
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,323
What's he thinking,
opening the Hellmouth?

182
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,743
It was bound to be shattered
at some point.

183
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,913
Chief…

184
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,055
Now,

185
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,390
with the Hellmouth shattered,

186
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,520
evil will engulf the world.

187
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,730
We have one day

188
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,608
to find Mirr

189
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,986
and kill Samin and Ogwi.

190
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,280
After that,

191
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,034
we'll reseal the Hellmouth.

192
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,300
For reasons still unknown,

193
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,594
the sky has started to turn black,

194
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,263
darkening the day as though it were night.

195
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,017
<i>Strange fine dust continues to fall</i>
<i>from the sky,</i>

196
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,102
<i>causing damage in surrounding areas.</i>

197
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,106
<i>If you are watching this,</i>
<i>please take shelter indoors…</i>

198
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,400
Are you kidding me?

199
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,903
- Move, will you?
- Come on!

200
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,780
- Who's blocking the street?
- Are you serious?

201
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,327
Who are those nutjobs?

202
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,870
Get out of the way.

203
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,209
- Move.
- Move!

204
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,796
Get out of the way.

205
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,965
- Move out of the street.
- Move!

206
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,259
- I have no idea what's going on.
- Move?

207
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,641
Get out of the way.
What are you doing?

208
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,066
Move, will you?

209
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,914
So, for dinner…

210
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,418
Hey, your eyes!

211
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,385
What's going on? Run!

212
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,211
Let's go.

213
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,477
Chief.

214
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,971
I've hurt him enough.

215
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,349
Haetae has turned into an evil spirit.

216
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,267
He must be eliminated.

217
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,936
That is God's will.

218
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,269
Marok!

219
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,485
Marok, are you all right?

220
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,666
No!
