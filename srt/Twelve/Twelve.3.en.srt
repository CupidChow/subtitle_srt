1
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,767


2
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,837
Mirr!

3
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:15,927
Mirr!

4
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,285
Malsook!

5
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,620
Malsook…

6
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,914
Mirr.

7
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,125
Marok.

8
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,253
Evil spirits have reemerged.

9
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,755
How could that be?

10
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,466
Let's get out of here.

11
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,563
Come on.

12
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,704
Oh! Malsook, are you okay?

13
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,125
Marok, they're too strong.

14
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,671
We can't take them on now.

15
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,467
I see. For now,

16
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,720
let's get out of here. Come on.

17
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,806


18
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,366
Marok, behind you!

19
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,959
Samin?

20
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,009
Kangji.

21
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,719
Kangji, are you all right?

22
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,596
I'm fine, it's not that bad.

23
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,141
All right.

24
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,062
Doni, call Bangwool
and have her treat Kangji.

25
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,229
Sure, Marok.

26
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,232
Let's all head home.

27
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,776
- Kangji, let's go.
- Sure.

28
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,362
Let's hurry home.

29
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,323
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

30
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,616
Marok.

31
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,453
Evil spirits have reemerged, haven't they?

32
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,540
I can't say. I'm not sure what's going on.

33
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,292
Let's go.

34
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,086
Sure.

35
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,596
Wonseung, let's go.

36
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,681
What?

37
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,350
Sure. But hold on.

38
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,478
I can feel a familiar energy.

39
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,113
Marok,

40
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,158
you saw something
from the evil spirit, didn't you?

41
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,706
Well, I can't be sure of it just yet.

42
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,042
Taesan must be waiting, so let's go.

43
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,627
Sure.

44
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,436
It's been a while,

45
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,896
Marok.

46
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,696
TWELVE

47
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,285
<i>The person you have reached</i>
<i>is unavailable--</i>

48
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,977
Chief. Bangwool, can you tend to Kangji?

49
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,327
I'll get going.

50
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,420
It'll be all right.

51
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,947
TAESAN BUILDING

52
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,595
What's that smell?

53
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,435
I see.

54
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,396
- Kangji, that paste was made…
- Hmm?

55
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,149
…with the venom of a rattlesnake
and medicinal herbs.

56
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,900
It'll heal your wound in no time.

57
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,611
Thanks, Bangwool.

58
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,458
That hurts. I said that hurts!

59
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,544
That really hurts!

60
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,550
I see.

61
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,138
Malsook, you kicked so much
that your pelvis got twisted.

62
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,142
It's my wrist.

63
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,990
Got it. Mirr, she says you'll be fine.

64
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,159
Right. Thanks, Bangwool.

65
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,753
Where are you going?

66
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,178
I'll be back.

67
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,492
This must be a treasure trove
of all things healthy.

68
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,795
Having all of these to herself
explains her flawless skin.

69
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,108
Oh…

70
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,236
Mmm…

71
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,320
That's tasty.

72
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,951
No way. This will go great with beer.

73
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,289
This is really good.

74
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,708
I'll take this

75
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,918
and some of this.

76
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,886
Bangwool, what was that for?

77
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:25,972
What?

78
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,515
I shouldn't breathe?

79
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,018
How can I not breathe?

80
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,106
That left a mark.

81
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,833
I didn't know.

82
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,917
I'm sorry.

83
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,840
This doesn't seem to be doing anything.

84
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,592
Can I try turning this knob?

85
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,387
Okay, here we go.

86
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,930
Good. A little more.

87
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,018
Bangwool!

88
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,151
I just…

89
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,614
What's this for?

90
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,577
Marok, have you located the evil spirits?

91
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,164
No, not yet.

92
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,334
Chief.

93
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,213
This is urgent,
and we should spread out to locate them.

94
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,923
I told you to stay out of it.

95
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,759
Don't make me repeat myself.

96
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,135
But, Chief…

97
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,429
You'd think differently
if you had seen them.

98
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,058
Exactly. Anyway, I don't get
how evil spirits could have reemerged.

99
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,353
Marok, when the Hellmouth was sealed,

100
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,814
didn't the evil spirits without power
vanish too?

101
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,485
That's right. They were sealed away
along with your powers.

102
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,572
Even if Kangji manages
to locate the evil spirits,

103
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:10,201
we still stand no chance against them
in these human forms.

104
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,953
We can't do anything about it,

105
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,412
since God decided

106
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,332
to balance the power
between good and evil.

107
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,752
Still, we'll have to figure out a way.

108
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,674
Fighting those evil spirits
for the first time in ages made it clear

109
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,426
that we may not age like humans,

110
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,095
but we're just as powerless.

111
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,391
Before they harm humans, we must--

112
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,018
Rather than sticking
our necks out for humans,

113
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,565
we'll focus on keeping
only this family safe.

114
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,238
Still, these are evil spirits
we're talking about.

115
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,075
Chief,

116
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,786
can I say something?

117
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,041
Honestly, it's been a long time.

118
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,338
Because you were constantly in pain
over what happened,

119
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,426
we followed your lead and did as told,
but this is way too irresponsible of you.

120
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,515
The purpose of our existence
is to protect humans.

121
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,768
That's the duty we should honor
to the very end.

122
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,604
Kangji, come on.

123
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,814
So?

124
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,320
We protected humans
for thousands of years, but for what?

125
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,906
You see,

126
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,366
even God has abandoned us.

127
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,911
Look at what we've become.

128
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,754
I refuse to uphold that duty
if it means losing my family.

129
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,257
You're not the only one grieving
their deaths!

130
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,761
Stop acting like
you're the only one who cares.

131
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,555
- What?
- I mourn those we lost,

132
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,933
but we should still stay true
to who we are.

133
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm willing to die
while protecting humans.

134
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,354
Watch it, Kangji!

135
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
Both of you, that's enough.

136
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,323
Listen.

137
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,371
I refuse to lose anyone else.

138
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,875
Protect us, Chief.

139
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,587
Then we'll protect humans.

140
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,132
Duty or not…

141
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,554
that's why we exist.

142
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,092
Jwidol.

143
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,887
Didn't you make something
to track drug dealers?

144
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,306
Yes, Marok.

145
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,224
Good.

146
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,728
- Wonseung.
- Yes?

147
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,479
A word.

148
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,496
Ah…

149
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,296
Anyway, what did you want to talk about?

150
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,592
Well,

151
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,305
didn't you sense an odd vibe earlier?

152
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,890
Of course, I did.

153
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,185
Why did Kangji have
to tick off Chief like that?

154
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,439
His hatred for humans is nothing new.

155
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,607
Tell me about it.

156
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,613
Meanwhile, out of all of us,
Kangji is particularly fond of humans.

157
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,823
I mean,

158
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,451
evil spirits are causing us
distress as is,

159
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,328
so why are we fighting each other?

160
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,208
Wonseung.

161
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,377
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

162
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,213
Didn't you see that earlier?

163
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,799
Of course, I did.

164
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,635
Chief's eyes were burning with anger.

165
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,346
I'm talking about
how Taesan was looking at you.

166
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,310
Didn't you get the sense that he wanted

167
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,605
to ask you a favor?

168
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:55,528
- What?
- Taesan knows he should help humans,

169
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,780
but wanting to do right by the rest of you

170
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,075
keeps him from taking the lead
in this matter.

171
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,619
That's why he looked at you

172
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,415
like he was pleading for you
to find those evil spirits.

173
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,417
He was pleading with his eyes.

174
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,336
- He wants me to step in for him?
- That's right.

175
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,131
What do you think that means?

176
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,926
He obviously sees you

177
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,304
as the next chief.

178
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,641
The next chief? Me?

179
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,059
Exactly.

180
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:31,188
Taesan may be a big guy on the outside,

181
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,107
but he's actually quite shy.

182
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,818
- Right.
- Would it kill him

183
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,945
to just ask for favors out loud?

184
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,322
Why does he do it with his eyes?

185
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,075
He always lets his gaze speak for him.

186
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,168
Wonseung.

187
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
Yes?

188
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,922
Here's to becoming the chief.

189
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,267
We'll join you in time.

190
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,864
The one who awakened the evil spirits

191
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,157
is Samin.

192
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,411
Samin?

193
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,495
That's right.

194
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,748
The high priest who turned Haetae
into an evil spirit.

195
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,918
He still lives.

196
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,337
But he's a human. How is that possible?

197
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,464
It's not, so I should look into it.

198
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,844
Either way, I'll say this now.

199
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,846
Leave my kids out of this.

200
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,014
Taesan.

201
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,932
Our purpose

202
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,561
is to help the human world.

203
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,187
And I should protect my family.

204
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,232
We're just ordinary humans now.

205
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,443
We have no power to fight evil spirits.

206
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:29,987
Taesan.

207
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,114
Sacrificing to protect humans?

208
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,867
That's pointless.

209
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,843
TAESAN BUILDING

210
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,969
So, how are you feeling?

211
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,767
Though it's long overdue,

212
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,853
I'm thankful you returned.

213
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,564
Sorry it took me so long.

214
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,775
Don't say that.

215
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,111
<i>I refuse</i>

216
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,864
to lose anyone else.

217
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,574
Protect us, Chief.

218
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,742
Then we'll protect humans.

219
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,120
Duty or not,

220
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,290
that's why we exist.

221
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,202
GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD

222
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,621
It's Mr. Taesan.

223
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,339
What's all this?

224
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,215
Let me buy it.

225
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,427
- What…
- What are you talking about?

226
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,513
Let me buy this food cart from you.

227
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,807
Mr. Taesan…

228
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,521
Here.

229
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,068
It could get dangerous,
so stay out of the country for a while.

230
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,302
Here.

231
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,387
Thanks.

232
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,391
If you press the red button,
the surrounding area will appear

233
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,184
- in green on the map.
- Okay.

234
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,937
If there's an irregularity,
orange spot will show.

235
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,815
I see. Sounds easy enough.

236
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,610
What task did Marok assign you
that requires this device?

237
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:39,695
What?

238
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,697
Well…

239
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,325
Well, he's after… Yes, drugs.

240
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,413
He's gearing up
for a crackdown on drug offenders

241
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,415
and asked me to lend a hand.

242
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,666
Really?

243
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,419
Why you, though?

244
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,004
Who else could he ask?

245
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,631
I'm the only one
who's good at this kind of thing.

246
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,716
Don't you agree?

247
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,010
Unbelievable.

248
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,511
Something feels off.

249
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,638
Red…

250
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,436
Seriously, does this thing even work?

251
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,667
Hey, Bangwool.

252
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,212
I'm glad you're practicing,
but do I have to hold this up?

253
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,048
I trust you, of course,

254
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,550
but that was pretty intense.

255
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,853
Bangwool, wait!

256
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,439
What do you mean,
nervousness helps you focus?

257
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,650
It's best to practice relaxed, Bangwool.

258
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,158
No, the apple's too risky.

259
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,242
Aim at this instead.

260
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,329
Geez.

261
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:14,915
Be careful.

262
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,381
Bangwool, wait. I'm getting a call.

263
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,633
Just a second.

264
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,848
Why did you shoot
when I was getting a call?

265
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,559
I told you the apple was too risky!

266
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,979
Aim at this instead.

267
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,398
Practice with this, okay?

268
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,527
- A black stone?
- That's right.

269
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,364
It's the only relic missing
from the recent discoveries.

270
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,783
That's the stone.

271
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,039
What on earth is that?

272
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,380
Was there any other damage?

273
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,757
No, that's all they took.

274
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,263
- Sir.
- Yes?

275
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:12,889
You should see this.

276
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,485
- Sir.
- Yes?

277
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,862
I think you're getting a call.

278
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,041
- Hey, Wonseung. Found anything?
- <i>Marok.</i>

279
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,710
<i>Well,</i>

280
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,589
I don't think the device
Jwidol gave works.

281
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,340
Nothing's showing up on it.

282
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:50,594
Still, keep scanning the whole area.

283
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,473
I remember that's where the evil spirits
first started emerging.

284
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,351
Shouldn't we tell Chief?

285
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,896
I said I'd take
full responsibility for this,

286
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,981
so just do as I say.

287
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,484
I'm worried Chief will be mad at me.

288
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,029
Remember what I told you?

289
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,201
Who is set to eventually become
Taesan's successor?

290
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,662
<i>You know that can only be you, Wonseung.</i>

291
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,207
Besides, Taesan hates this sort of thing.

292
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,291
<i>Of course.</i>

293
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,419
If you can locate the evil spirits first

294
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,796
and prevent war, this world…

295
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:31,635
<i>You'll be a true angel</i>
<i>who saves this world,</i>

296
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,261
<i>as you should be.</i>

297
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,725
I have to sacrifice myself
for everyone, don't I?

298
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,062
Yes, do just that.

299
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,939
That's my burden to bear.

300
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,942
<i>This must be the path of a chief.</i>

301
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,319
That's it. Bear the burden.

302
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,197
<i>I mean it. You're the only angel</i>
<i>who can do this.</i>

303
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,242
Of course.
Becoming chief is no easy path--

304
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,994
What was that, Detective Kim?

305
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,372
Sure, I'll be right in.

306
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,668
Wonseung, they're asking for me.
We'll talk again later.

307
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,337
Don't forget. Make some sacrifices.
All right, bye.

308
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,172
Hello? Marok?

309
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,967
He must be busy.

310
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,638
This is exhausting.

311
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,766
Ah…

312
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,020
I should have one of these.

313
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,359
Mmm…

314
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:30,986
Mmm!

315
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,074
That boosted my energy.

316
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,079
Let's carry on.

317
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,852
Mirr, are you bored?

318
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,440
We're almost there, so hang tight.

319
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,984
Where are we going?

320
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,778
A place you'll also love.

321
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,713
ANGEL CAPITAL GROUP

322
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,257


323
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,724
- Kids, hi!
- Hi!

324
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,850
I'll take that.

325
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,227
Mirr, come on. Let's head inside.

326
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,606
Have you been well? You've gotten taller.

327
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,774
- Let's go inside.
- Sure.

328
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,651
Don't rush. One at a time.

329
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,999
Let me refill your glass, Mr. Taesan.

330
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,794
Don't stand up.
Others might get the wrong idea.

331
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,961
How could I?

332
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,880
I know my manners.

333
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,549
I guess you're right.

334
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,636
"SEOUL AIRLINES"

335
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,681
Why did you bring the bag back?

336
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,975
I can't take this money.

337
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,688
You could all be at risk
if something happens.

338
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,940
I understand your concern,

339
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,694
but I can't abandon my mom's food cart
and leave the country.

340
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,198
You, of all people,
know how hard my mom fought to keep it.

341
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,167
What's taking him so long?

342
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,837
He's still got five minutes.

343
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,477
Oh…

344
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,498
Hey, Chief.

345
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,418
What exactly happened?

346
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,712
Do you remember the thug
who borrowed money from us

347
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,964
to buy land in the marketplace?

348
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,716
Yongpal, the boss of the Samgeori gang.

349
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,718
Sure, Yongpal, the boss
of the Samgeori gang.

350
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,179
Anyway, he duped Ssangkal,
the boss of the Jongno gang,

351
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,181
and took off with his money.

352
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,684
In retaliation, the Jongno gang is tearing
up the market and forcing everyone out,

353
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,102
claiming they'll open bars.

354
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,856
The Samgeori gang's boss, Yongpal,
bought the marketplace land with my loan.

355
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,109
Until he pays me back, the land is mine.

356
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,695
The Jongno gang has already
taken over the marketplace.

357
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,825
This is hurting the vendors there,
so we should probably do something.

358
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,702
I'm worried people will get hurt.

359
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,039
Why are you guys working like this?

360
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,626
I told you to focus only on what's ours

361
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,377
and pay no attention to the humans.

362
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,091
Let's go and get my land back.

363
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,428
Guys, let's go.

364
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,432
Chief, wait for us.

365
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,104
What are they doing?

366
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,856
Don't do that.

367
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,942
Oh, dear.

368
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,235
"GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD"

369
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:49,285
Lady, I told you
to pack up and leave ages ago.

370
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,787
It's best for all of us

371
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,998
if you leave quietly
while we're still being nice.

372
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,376
Damn you!

373
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,878
Damn it, woman. Get lost already.

374
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,463
- Okay.
- Would you rather crawl out?

375
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,424
- I'll leave, okay?
- Be gentle, will you?

376
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,551
Why you…

377
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,469
Come on.

378
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,431
- We've struggled against them enough.
- Oh?

379
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,183
- Let's go.
- You.

380
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,434
Haven't we met before?

381
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,061
As if.

382
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,146
- I know you from somewhere.
- Geumsoon.

383
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,150
Would you look at that?
You're like two peas in a pod.

384
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,988
That glare is straight-up the same.

385
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,742
I see you only learned
the nastiest things from your mom.

386
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,162
Hey, since the mom's busy,

387
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,914
teach the daughter a lesson.

388
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,712
All right, people. Over here.

389
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,046
- What now?
- Who's he?

390
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,840
- Excuse us.
- What now?

391
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,635
Kim Yongpal of the Samgeori gang
put this land up as collateral,

392
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,097
and Angel Loans will be taking over
as of today.

393
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,181
What the heck?

394
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,602
Everything here,
down to the tiniest item, is ours,

395
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,187
and you'll get hurt if you touch anything.

396
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,733
You folks of the Jongno gang,

397
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,152
please make a swift exit this way.

398
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,489
Hold on. Which one of you is Ssangkal?

399
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,538
Oh, there you are.

400
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,165
Got it. Noted.

401
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,958
Good.

402
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,295
Boys, take them out.

403
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,506
- We're up.
- Sure.

404
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,606
- What was that?
- Hold on.

405
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,115
You again?

406
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,409
I knew it.

407
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,828
Unbelievable.

408
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:56,913
Do you know me?

409
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,473
I told you to be good, you punk.

410
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,184
You were a bandit in a past life.

411
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,062
I'll be good from now on.

412
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,107
My liver…

413
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,052
If evil spirits return,

414
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,848
you'll protect us
like you did in the past.

415
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,484
Would you like a refill?

416
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,361
Sure.

417
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,241
You probably have sore knees,
so stop getting up like that.

418
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,826
- I'm okay.
- Thanks.

419
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,418
By the way, are you two together?

420
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,087
What are you saying, mister?

421
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,923
You could be, if you're both willing.

422
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,468
- You make a sweet couple.
- Right?

423
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,304
Just so you know,

424
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,014
my type

425
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,684
is someone as sweet and beautiful
as Geumsoon.

426
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,521
Manbok sure has great taste in women.

427
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,483
She was known as Audrey Hepburn
back in the day.

428
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,984
Sweet and beautiful.

429
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,863
You two should seriously consider this.

430
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,989
Mister!

431
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,618
Mister, here.

432
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:03,790
Have one of these.

433
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,668
- Enjoy it with your drink.
- Sure.

434
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,590
Ah…

435
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,551
Have you lost your mind? Unbelievable.

436
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,763
Give one to Manbok too.

437
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,808
- Mister, please.
- Ah…

438
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,936
Eat it yourself.

439
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,564
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

440
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,067
Enjoy.

441
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,527
Thank you.

442
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,488
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

443
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,448
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

444
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,492
Yes.

445
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,536
- Would you like more?
- Sorry.

446
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,662
Don't be.

447
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,873
What matters is that we're together again.

448
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,315
<i>Mirr?</i>

449
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:12,984
Mirr.

450
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,695
What?

451
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,946
You were spacing out.

452
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,407
I'd like my food, please.

453
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,033
Sure. Sorry about that.

454
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,619
- Take your time and eat your fill.
- Got it.

455
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,581
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

456
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,249
- It's tasty.
- Please enjoy.

457
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,667
Thank you.

458
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,858
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

459
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,194
The day Haetae was killed
by Taesan and the angels,

460
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,363
it left behind three soul stones.

461
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,365
Once you gather the soul stones

462
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,868
and feed their energy
into the Dragon Soul,

463
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,078
which oversees the energy
of angels and demons,

464
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,831
you can revive Haetae's power.
