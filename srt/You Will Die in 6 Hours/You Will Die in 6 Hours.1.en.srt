Did you in charge of Nam criminal?

537
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,439
[Park]

538
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,568
But what is it related to this case?

539
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,612
I found out while checking the forensic data.

540
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,780
Both victims

541
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,074
I have a history of working as a Maze Club member

542
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,826
Are you sure?

543
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,994
Yes, certain

544
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,957
In addition, the suicide suicide may be related to Sangdo -dong suicide.

545
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,712
[Min Kyung] Sangdo -dong woman was also a member of the Maze Club

546
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,213
-I have a history of stalking damage- [cool music]

547
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,314
[sigh]

548
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,608
[Frequent music]

549
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,985
[Captain] This is the detective of Park

550
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,863
[Sagi -Sound of paper]

551
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,239
[Min Kyung] Yes?

552
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,200
- [Inscription -Sound of paper] - [Class] told Detective Park to pass

553
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,285
[Min Kyung] Class

554
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,455
-I can do that- [Pale phone ringtone]

555
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,416
No, it's not you can't

556
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,377
This is the case that Park was in charge before he was appointed.

557
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,630
So it's right that Park is in charge, huh?

558
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,008
You can take over and proceed with your senior

559
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,302
[Captain] Don't sweet

560
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,596
Go and look at

561
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,473
[Small] Oh, me…

562
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,601
[Park's sigh]

563
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,936

[Far away]

566
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,070

-Hyeong- [Dark Music]

571
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,750
I'll do it myself, look

572
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,297
[sigh]

573
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,259
[Far away]

574
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,719
[Sweet -door opening sound]

575
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,554
[Sweet -The sound of closing the door]

576
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,557
[Sound of breathing]

577
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,727
[sigh]

578
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,402
[Well -key sound]

579
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,865
[Sound of sweetness]

580
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,450
[sigh]

581
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,623
- [The crumpled effect flows] - [Frequent music]

582
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,041
[Cicada crying]

583
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,253
[Jeongyun] After about a month after closed the club door

584
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,838
Stalking began

585
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,131
[The sound of barking from afar]

586
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,049
Mail and courier disappear

587
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,010
Call every night

588
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,053
[Men] What is the report?

589
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,555
[Jeongyun] Of course I did it

590
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,849
The man I met in the club is clear

591
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,058
[Man] So?

592
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,646
[Jeongyun] There is no evidence that the man is the culprit

593
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,482
[Man] It may not be that man

594
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,276
It may be the other guest you met

595
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,028
[Jungyun's pale laugh]

596
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,657
[Jeongyun] I don't give our personal information to our customers in the club

597
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,993
As much as that one is thoroughly managed

598
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:02,415
I can't meet personally, so it's all money

599
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,794
But because the man met me several times

600
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,129
I must have been followed by

601
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,050
I must have followed home after the date

602
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,635
- [Sound of breathing] - [city noise]

603
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,304
- [Hu -breathing breath] - [Chiji -cigarette burning sound]

604
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,722
- [Tak -Sound] - [Pale car horn]

605
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,558
No matter how much you think about it, it seems to be deliberately excluded

606
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,934
[Hu -Kihoon's breathing breath]

607
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,895

[Kihoon's sigh]

609
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,190
[Kihoon] When it is converted to a chain

610
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:31,110
It's so complicated in many ways, so you're sensitive

611
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,362
[Sighing] I know

612
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,532
But all the touches I was doing are handing over to seniors

613
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,617
I am…

614
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,413
Is it because I am a woman?

615
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,123
what

616
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,751
It could be that

617
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,835
yes?

618
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,380
Ah [sigh]

619
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,507
Detective Yu says

620
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,844
I'm empathizing with this case.

621
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,308
[Kihoon] Looking at the victims

622
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,937
Well, it's natural to feel anger as the same woman

623
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,021
that…

624
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,940
But [sigh]

625
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,859
To empathize with the victim

626
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,363
It never helps with rational judgment

627
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,198
[Kihoon] I mean it is emotion

628
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,033
Facts

629
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,703
Sometimes it is distorted

630
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,296
Oh, Mr.

631
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,173
-Do you look so braid? Seeds- [Hu -Minkyung's breathing breath]

632
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,969
no

633
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,555
I'll cool my hair and go in

634
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,723
[Kihoon] Yeah [Healthy breath]

635
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,102
Spread it in moderation

636
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,478
[Pale sigh]

637
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,856

[Bulbulet crying]

640
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,194
[Jeongyun] 1 year ago

641
00:35:56,445 --> 00:36:00,867
I closed the door because it took me to hire a minor in the club where I worked.

642
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,288
I was also investigated because I needed a statement

643
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,875
[Kihoon] These people

644
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,752
-Do you know you're a minor? - [Jeongyun] No

645
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,966
When you get in touch with the app, go to the designated place and work.

646
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,719
I don't know who is there and how many people are there

647
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,599
Everybody hides his real name and writes a nickname

648
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,808
[Pale phone ringtone]

649
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,351
What do I know?

650
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,023
"Maze"

651
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,816
[Kihoon] What is this business card?

652
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,781
When the customer connects to the QR Code on the back, it will match with us.

653
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,783
When did you do this?

654
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,246
I'm not a minor, but should I say that?

655
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,540
Did you work elsewhere other than here?

656
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,126
No, it's my first time

657
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,088
You've been working since a minor, no?

658
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,173
No

659
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,718
[Sound of breathing] No, why are you doing this?

660
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,136
[Kihoon] It looks fine

661
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,517
[Pale laughter] Well, how is it fine?

662
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,479
You can make money just like others

663
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,649
Why aren't you trying to live well?

664
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,073
[I smile and breathe my breath]

00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,408

668
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,749
Do you know how many things you do a day?

669
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,005
Even if you work like that crazy

670

[Sound of breathing] My hands are trembling to buy a meal

00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,597
Even if I hold it, my breath is blocked

00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,307
How the hell

673
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,769
Are you living well?

[Bulbulet crying]

680
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,290
What I did

681
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,836
If you can make someone happy for three hours

682
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,131
[Sound of breathing] Is it meaningful?

683
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,678
well

684
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,015

It's all garbage

I went out except the room, today

01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,601
[Jeongyun] Still

1437
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,312
Prove

1438
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,439
Your dream

1439
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:44,524
[Calm music]

- [City Noise] - [Pale Car Horn]

1442
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,830
[Junwoo] My girlfriend was dead a year ago

1443
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,332
- [Sound of pale people] - [Continued calm music]

1444
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:06,296
I watched a video of my girlfriend dying, but I couldn't do anything

1445
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:10,342
I didn't see the date or time.

1446
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:15,055
The dress I bought

1447
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,477
I was stained with blood

1448
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,275
I saw a scene of dying again at my girlfriend's funeral home.

1449
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,905
It was her friend

1450
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:38,119
It wasn't long after that man was eventually dead

1451
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:39,996
[Frequent music]

1452
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,207
I told you about what I saw, but I didn't believe it

1453
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:46,586
So three women are dead

1454
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:49,798
[Pale Notice Broadcasting Notification]

1455
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,842
Later, I found out that I worked in the same club with my girlfriend

1456
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,763
So I started looking for people who worked there

1457
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,809
I can't change my fate

1458
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:02,978
why?

1459
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,897
It's only you more painful

1460
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,859
Suddenly I thought

1461
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:15,991
If you follow the foresight I saw and meet the murderer

1462
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:18,952
[Junwoo] Even if you can't stop someone's death

1463
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:20,745
Can that murder be prevented?

1464
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:24,457
at that time

1465
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,334
Did you find me?

1466
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,878
As soon as I saw you, I saw death again

1467
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:32,298
But this time, I learned the date and time

1468
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,678
At the moment my prediction occurs

1469
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:38,471
I thought I could be there

1470
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:41,975
so

1471
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:44,436
You followed me to the end

1472
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,690
You can't change your destiny

1473
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,609
[Jeongyun] I must be at the site where I am killed

1474
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,904
Because you can catch a killer

1475
01:23:58,575 --> 01:23:59,576
I did it

1476
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:02,537
[Junwoo] Huh?

1477
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,664
You changed your fate

1478
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:07,667
-The more people- [calm music]

1479
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,088
[Pale sigh]

1480
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:16,259
Is it that?

1481
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,969
[Jeongyun] Believe

1482
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:20,847

[Soft music]

1495
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,646
[Jeongyun] I thought I would meet someday

1496
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,065
Did you meet faster than you think?

1497
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,651
[Junwoo] How are you doing well?

1498
01:25:57,735 --> 01:25:58,862
[Jeongyun] How do you see?

1499
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:00,697
Looks good

1500
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,782
[Pale laughter]

1501
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,244
how about you?

1502
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,914
Do you still see a nightmare?

1503
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,584
no

1504
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,502
I can't see it anymore

1505
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:16,921
[Jeongyun] It's a bit unfortunate

1506
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:18,673
When you meet you

1507
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:22,218
I tried to ask how I die

1508
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,556
Lastly, the grandmother in the video

1509
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,019
With a grandmother -like family

1510
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,438
It was together in a comfortable and warm house

1511
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,317
[Junwoo] My grandmother was lying in bed and taking a breath

1512
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:40,737
The grandfather who looks like a husband is

1513
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,614
I was holding my hand

1514
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:44,616
I was not

1515
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,202
[Junwoo, Jungyun's light laughter]

1516
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,996
The video is over

1517
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,625
So you

1518
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:57,378
I will live happily from now to the end

1519
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,756
Isn't it a lie?

1520
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,761
You still can't believe me?

1521
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:08,223
It wasn't 12 o'clock at that time?

1522
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,060
There is one thing I couldn't say

1523
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:14,938
at that time

1524
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,149
My wrist clock was 1 minute slow

1525
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:22,820
[Jeongyun] So, your Yeji was exactly right

1526
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,323
Your words

1527
01:27:26,115 --> 01:27:27,116
I'll believe it

1528
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,204
60 years later

1529
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,041
You die
