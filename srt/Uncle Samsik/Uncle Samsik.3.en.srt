181
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,754
and I'll make you Deputy Commander
of the Capital Defense Unit.

182
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,803
Is this really possible?

183
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,389
How many soldiers
have you stripped of their titles?

184
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,684
When Rhee Seungmin's administration
comes to an end,

185
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,229
you think those soldiers
would just leave you alone?

186
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,691
Hong Youngki's easy to get to.

187
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,360
Do you know
what his main weakness is, Hanmin?

188
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,404
I don't.

189
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,698
It's that he has too many enemies.

190
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,410
And the fear that that gives Hong Youngki
is his greatest weakness.

191
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,747
Why did you lock up those petty thieves?

192
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,250
[Youngki] The US Military Command

193
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,419
goes on and on about exploitation.

194
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,423
And it's all nonsense.

195
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,721
They think I captured all those people
and then framed them as communists.

196
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,099
[laughs]

197
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,811
Those fuckers don't know
the first thing about commies.

198
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,108
Anyway, I locked those thieves up
because I had to do something.

199
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,611
To satisfy them.

200
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,657
You should let them go.

201
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
Why would I?

202
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,251
We're in business with some
of the US Military Supply officers.

203
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,090
If you grant a few of our requests,

204
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,927
30% of the profits will be yours.

205
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,473
And I'll even provide you
with a few sturdy men for your protection.

206
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,936
[Hanmin] <i>And that's how we won over
Commander Hong Youngki.</i>

207
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,105
<i>Yeah, in the end,</i>

208
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,609
the Seodaemun thugs
were released immediately.

- [thug 1] Yeah!
- [thug 2] All right.

211
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,078
That's the way this man called
Uncle Samsik generally likes to operate.

[Doochill] Korean people have always had
incredibly robust stomachs.

219
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,368
They can eat canned food

220
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,578
- and they'll be completely fine.
- Yeah. Expired food?

221
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,622
- I'd eat that.
- [Doochill] And Koreans are great drivers.

222
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,582
You know that? The best drivers, huh?

223
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,419
We can drive incredibly safely
even with tires that US troops

224
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,920
have been using for 10 years.

225
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,506
Yeah, driving around on worn out tires?

226
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,341
That's okay. We'll drive on 'em.

227
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,592

the finer details.

Yes, that's right.

All right, tell me what it is.

278
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,518
Oh, San.

279
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,897
We're trying to build
a caustic soda factory.

280
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,773
- A lye factory?
- Yes.

281
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,942
We already have a grant
for five-ton pilot plant.

282
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,863
But apparently, Daemyeon Construction
submitted an identical application.

283
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,533

So they're trying to intercept it.

284
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,703
Well, I've already filed for an appeal.

285
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,706
Is there any way you can help?

286
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,375

Samsik's ploy to win Kim San over?

290
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,927
And the military supply business was bait?

291

<i>…presenting myself as a candidate</i>

532
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,749
<i>in the upcoming presidential election.</i>

533
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,959
[cheering]

534
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,386
[chanting]
Rhee Seungmin! Rhee Seungmin!

535
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,641
- Rhee Seungmin!
- Rhee Seungmin!

536
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,688
- Rhee Seungmin!
- Rhee Seungmin!

00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,233
[♪ tense music]

538
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,336
[clatters]

00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,469
- [telephone ringing]

540
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,846
[ringing continues]

541
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,820
It was the day that the president
announced his candidacy.

542
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,490
All his supporters
were out in the streets.

543
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,371
[Kim San] <i>During the war when our country
was taken from us,</i>

544
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,164
<i>we were defenseless.</i>

545
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,501
[scoffs]

546
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,086
[chuckles]

547
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,550
An incompetent head of the household.

548
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,385
[telephone ringing]

549
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,222
[Kim San] <i>A coward of a man.
That had always been my idea of a father.</i>

550
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,479
Mr. Choo Intae had been
another father figure to me.

551
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,024
But in the end…

552
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,486
he was no different than my own father.

553
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,949
But I guess I'd always thought that…

554
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,121
fatherhood looked that way.

555
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,460
[telephone ringing]

556
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,261
[ringing continues]

557
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,901
[sighs]
You finally picked up.

558
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,613
No matter how hard I try…

559
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,702
there's nothing that I can do.

560
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,373
Effort is meaningless in this world.

561
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,166
Why not flip it upside down?

562
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,253
And what if it's wrong?

563
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,713
Then spit it out.

564
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,549
You'll know if it's poison
the minute it touches your lips.

565
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,551
And my proposal?

566
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,346
Can we save it?

567
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,099
Save it, or kill it, we can do anything.

568
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,351
[Kim San] <i>I'm asking if we can make it
happen naturally.</i>

569
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,104
Letting it happen on its own

570
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,189
will also cost you.

571
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,526
Does the Earth's rotation and revolution
just happen?

572
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,153
Is it a coincidence that the Sun
lights up the Earth?

573
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,992
I want more power. Tell me how to get it.

574
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,744
I will give it to you.

575
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,123
I'm the one who can give it to you.

576
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,545
I'll wait to hear from you.

577
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,385
[handset clanks]

578
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,554
[handset thuds]

579
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,729
[♪ tense music]

580
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,074
Mr. Hong, my name is Samsik.
