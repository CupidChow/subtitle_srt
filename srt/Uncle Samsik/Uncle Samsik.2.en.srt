00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,342
[Kim San] I was an Albright scholar
at an American University.

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,262
During my time in America,

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,016
there was beauty and abundance
everywhere I'd look.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,060
Meanwhile, my countrymen
were stripped bare and starving.

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,189
Do you know what pizza is?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,983
Has anyone tried it?

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,985
Mr. Pak, have you tried it, sir?

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,904
No, I haven't, boy.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,658
[Kim San] During my time abroad,
I lived above a pizza shop

10
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,161
and couldn't afford
a single proper meal a day.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,914
Every day, I smelled pizzas baking.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,876
Every night, it kept me up.

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,419
[audience member] Was it really that good?

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,880
[audience chuckling]

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,925
[Kim San] Listen, the economy
matters more than guns.

16
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,804
I saw a country
where no one worried about food.

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,057
Where you can have
three decent meals every day.

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,185
What I envied during my studies abroad

19
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,604
wasn't their fighter jets
or aircraft carriers, it was…

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,355
it was pizza.

21
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,608
What is the point

22
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,110
of winning a war

23
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,821
when the entire nation
is starving to death?

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,949
That's why Mr. Choo Intae said

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,993
that I should study economics.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,038
The Republic of Korea…

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,294
can use its young and abundant work force
to become an industrialized nation.

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,299
With our peninsular position,
we could become the next center of trade.

29
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,053
That is exactly the kind of nation…

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,640
that Mr. Choo Intae dreams of.

31
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:46,356

Thank you.

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,444
Oh wow, that was a great speech, huh?

45
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,488
Yeah, I'll bet you'll make
a great addition to the Democratic Party.

46

[laughter]

47
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,617
- Indeed. I found your speech touching.
- Is your boyfriend looking…

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,285
- [member] We could set up a meeting.
- …to get into politics?

49
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,121
- [assemblyman] Yes, exactly, exactly!
- Not at all.

50
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,123
You'll be the Democratic Party's
greatest asset.

51
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,042
[chuckles]
That is, if you want to join us.

52
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,501
- [member 1] So you must join us!
- [assemblyman] Yeah!

53
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,003
[member 2] We'd be glad to have you.

54
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,504
- Of course.
- San.

55
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,673
- Shall we go?
- [Kim San] Sure.

56
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,092
Assemblyman Sun, we will be in touch.

57
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,969
Oh, right. Sure.
[laughs]

58
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,596
Of course, of course.

Have a good evening, sir. Bye.

60
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,268
Wow, amazing speech, don't you think?

62
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,860
Will your father be okay?

63
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,905
I'm gonna go find him right now.

64
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,907
I'll come with you.

65
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,909
No, it's okay. I'll talk to you later.

Thank you. Oh, gosh.

- Oh, it's okay.
- [vendor] Your clothes are all dirty now.

73
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,555
- I'm terribly sorry about that.
- You're not hurt, are you?

We can take it from here now.

78
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,902
- I'm sorry about the fruit.
- That's fine. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you for that.

82
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,920
I see you've got great potential.

83
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
Sorry?

84
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,424
You know what pizza tastes like.

85
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,260
Have you really had it before?

86
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,263
[chuckles softly]

87
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,347
Yes.

88
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,850
I found your speech very impressive.

89
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,396
Especially "a country where you can have
three meals a day."

90
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,441
Yeah, that part
really brought tears to my eyes.

91
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,900
I appreciate it.

92
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,654

Hello.

97

We won.

98
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,850
- Oh, you won?
- Yes.

99
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,227
- You saw us destroy 25 men.
- We only had 10 guys.

100

It doesn't matter
that you only had 10 guys.

101
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,523
I would've hired more men
with the money I gave you

- Yoon Palbong was your target.

[Doochill] Either way, well done.

The minister requested
that you be transferred.

Could it be
because of that speech last night?

128

You just had to go there, huh?

Sir, listen. I've spent my life

He was carrying a copy of the proposal
I had worked on for over two years.

- The National Reconstruction Proposal?
- [Kim San] Yes.

It was obvious
Minister Choi Minkyu gave it to him.

But the thing is…

161
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,575
I still can't forget
the look in the man's eyes.

162

was tear me apart.

Oh, so you're famous now?

00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,357
I left the Ministry of Home Affairs
not knowing what was next for me.

[Kim San] <i>I just wandered the streets
for the rest of the day.</i>

179
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,201
I was angry. I felt defeated.

180
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,747
I had nowhere to go and no one to tell.

181
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>I felt so lost.</i>

182
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,630

183
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,884
I felt like no one wanted to listen
to what I had to say.

184
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,054
It seemed like nobody even cared
about the future of South Korea.

186
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,643

[panting]

188
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,320
"Just go teach somewhere?

189
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,656
Or go into business
and be a complete sell-out?"

[thugs panting]

191
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,203
[thug] Damn it.

192
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,122
Ah, shit.

193
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,043
Just how far
are you guys gonna run, assholes?

194
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,382
- Look behind you.
- What?

195
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,467
I said look behind you, now!

196
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,513
We've got you now, asshole.

197
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,264
Bring it on.

198
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,267

[breathes deeply]

208
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,468
…Uncle Samsik showed up again.

[door slides open]

210
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,186
[Kim San] Can I help you?

211
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
You remember my boss, right?

212
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,653
[Kim San] Yes.

213
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,197
He's waiting for you right now.

- I'm glad you could make it.
- What's this about?

217
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,305
[Doochill] Please, have a seat.

218
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,605
I enjoyed reading
the National Reconstruction Proposal.

219
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,773
How'd you get a copy?

220
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,108
I get anything I want from Home Affairs.

221
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,611
[Doochill exhales deeply]

222
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,238
I always dreamed

223
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,742
of eating a red bean bun.
So much so that…

224
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,828
that at 16…

225
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,417
I killed a person for the first time.

226
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,879
[Doochill]
But now I eat as many as I want.

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,298
I bought this little bakery.

228
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,175
So what's the point of telling me this?

229
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,760
[sighs]

230
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,262
The point is that…

231
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,183
I tend to get…

232
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,103
everything I want from people.

233
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,233
I happen to have a special skill.

234
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,736
I can tell just by looking
into someone's eyes

235
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,238
whether they'll make it or not.

236
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,447
You, Manager Kim,

237
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,201
have potential to become president.

238
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,496
Well, at least minister, for sure.

239
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,791
- Yeah, maybe I'll call you Minister.
- Sure.

240
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,669
[Doochill] I can see it with my own eyes.

241
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,629
You've got strong ambition.

242
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,048
We met
for the first time yesterday, right?

243
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,216
[Doochill] Yes.

244
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,010
And what a fateful encounter it was.

245
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,389
Minister, do you know
the principles that govern this world?

246
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,310
Spring arrives, then summer.
Flowers bloom, then wilt.

247
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,480
They're what make the world go around,
the sun rise and set.

248
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,149
Are you referencing
the rotation of the Earth?

249
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,194
That's right.
The Earth's rotation and revolution.

250
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,447
Can you feel it right now?
The rotation and revolution?

251
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,620
Yeah.

252
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,875
That is precisely the kind of man I am.

253
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,836
The Earth's rotation and revolution.

254
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,506
Minister, we're both dreaming
the same dream.

255
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,592
But why me?

256
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,595
There's a lot of qualified people
out there.

257
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,055
Those kinds of people
aren't prepared to do

258
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,391
what needs to be done
in order to help others.

259
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,272
You said you read the proposal I wrote?

260
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,317
How long would it take to get it running?

261
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,236
We at least need to foster talent

262
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,947
and complete the industrial complex
in five years

263
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,074
to establish an export-led industry
within 10 years.

264
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,868
Five years, seven at most. If we don't…

265
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,204
other countries will leave us behind.

266
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,499
That's the dream that I have.

267
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,253
Can you make this happen?

268
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,338
I knew it.

269
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,883
How is it that you and I think
so much alike?

270
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,260
Can you make it work?
Give me a straight answer here.

271
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
A straight answer?

272
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,848
I've got a straight answer for you.

273
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,767
What is it?

274
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,145
Stop seeing Choo Yeojin.

275
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
What'd you say?

276
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,983
You and Choo Intae's daughter
can't be dating.

277
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,908
You don't even know me, all right?
That's crossing the line.

278
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,495
You said we both had the same dream.

279
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,663
Exactly right.

280
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,541
And if you're Choo Intae's son-in-law,
the dream will never be fulfilled.

281
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,965
Have you had pizza?

282
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,552
Yes, of course.

283
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,179
What's pizza taste like?

284
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
What?

285
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,392
Taste?

286
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,936
How do you even explain taste with words?

287
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,938
What does it taste like?

288
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,483
It's something that can't be explained.

290
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,445
Sounds like you don't know
what it tastes like.

291
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,326
So then,

292
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,620
- did you break up with Choo Yeojin?

Then, when was it
that you saw Samsik again?

296
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,756
[Kim San] After that night…

297
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,137

[Kim San] I'll be fine.

They drove you to the Audit Bureau
because of your speech, didn't they?

309
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,560
Sure, but the Audit Bureau…
could be interesting.

310

No, and I wouldn't break up with her

So what is this plan of yours?

354
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,481
That'll all be revealed to you
when you're ready to receive it.

355
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,609
- [Kim San sighs]
- Here, share these with your niece.

356
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,569
A full stomach tends to open one's mind.

357
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,489
Pick Choo Intae and I promise you,

358
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,116
you'll be hungry forever.

359
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,118
No… Wait a second.

360
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,545
When your stomach's full,
your mind really does tend to open.

361
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,838
He was right about that.

362
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,051
I'd never had such delicious
rice or snacks in my whole life.

363
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,931
And the reality in this country was…

364
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,437
you couldn't afford those things
with the salary of a Home Affairs manager.

[people laughing]

368
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,448
Ah, goodness.

369
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,243
- Must be a lot of work for you, huh?
- Not at all.

370
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,078
- It's good to see you again.
- Of course.

371
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,121
- Have a seat inside.
- All right, keep up the good work.

372
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,207
- [guest 1] Congratulations.
- Have you set a date?

373
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,417
We will, after the election.

374
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,170
- [guest 2] You're doing such great work.
- Thank you.

375
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,465
Just gonna be a housewife
after you're married?

376
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,883
[Yeojin] Hmm?

377
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,885
Top of your class in Korean literature.

378
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,679
Come to Aemin Daily with us.

379
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,765
You're here.

380
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,558
How is everything? Where's your father?

381
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,354
Oh Inwoo. Reporter for Aemin Daily
and classmate of Yeojin.

382
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,315
- I'm Kim San.
- [Sun grumbles]

383
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,068
Looks like you've come down here
to celebrate, huh?

384
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,486
- You doing all right?
- [Sun] Of course.

385
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,030
So you're joining the Democratic Party.
[laughs]

386
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,448
- It's been a while.
- Indeed.

387
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,741
- [member 1] I'll see you again soon.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,868
- [member 2] It's good to see you.
- [Kim San] Good to see you.

389

Seonyoowon

390

[car door closes]

391
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,718
[Minkyu] The foreign press is saying
there's no way we can win.

392
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,012
[Seongmin] The opposition party's
influence is too strong

393
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,346
in the major cities right now.

394
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,724
[sighs]
What do we do about it?

395
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,892
Increase voter turnout in the provinces.

396
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,519
So how will you achieve that?

397
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,895
Campaign and encourage voting.

398
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,439
That's about all we can do, right?

399
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,525
You won't get anywhere with that attitude.

400
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,485
You're the future party leader.

401
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,279
If you have something in mind,

402
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,823
then let me hear it.

403
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,451
[sighs]

404
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,411
Amend the Local Government Act,

405
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,373
so we can mobilize
local government workers for the campaign.

406
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,586
That's abuse of power and it'll lead
to resistance from the opposition.

407
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,630
Some people will be against it
even within the party. It'll get tense.

408
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,717
Will you be able to handle
something like that?

409
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,178
You know that politics…

410
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,097
is all about beating those against you
and getting them to join you.

411
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,016
It's a chance
to take control of the party.

412
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,810
Perhaps it is.

413
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,187
[Seongmin] As you prefer.

414
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,314
I guess I didn't see the big picture.

415

[camera shutters clicking]

418
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:51,536
Well, I had no intention of participating
in real politics until now.

419
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,830
But for the sake of the people's desire

420
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:59,127
to prevent the current administration
from regaining power and strength,

421
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,297
I intend to run
in the next presidential election.

422
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,093

424
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,438
[Intae] Democracy this, democracy that,
we're always busy talking about it,

425
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,732
but we don't know what it actually is.

426
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm a novice when it comes to politics.

427
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,194
You're young.

428
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,865
You have time to face the…
the obstacles of reality,

429
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,784
because you're young.

430
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,954
Well, I'm honored, sir.

431
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,039
But I'd like to think about it,
if that's all right.

432
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,835
[♪ light music playing]

433
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,505
So what did you discuss with my father?

434
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,716
He wants me to join the Innovation Party.

435
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,010
Did you give him an answer?

436
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,806
Well,

437
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,975
I said I'd think about it.

438
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,562
- Should we postpone our wedding?
- Hmm?

439
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,898
Just a minute, okay?

440
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,235
- [Yeojin] Good evening.
- [stall owner] Oh, welcome.

441
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,237
- Can I please have a basket?
- Oh, sure.

442
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,824
Jina likes this one, doesn't she?

443
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,659
Oh, you don't have to do that for Jina.

444
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,412
[Yeojin] Uh, I think this is
the one she likes, right?

445
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,039
- Uh, it's this one.
- [chuckles softly]

446
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,167
- Can we have a bag of these here?
- [stall owner] Oh, sure.

447
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,170
I'd prefer it

448
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,131
if you stayed out of politics, actually.

449
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,927
Is that selfish to ask?

450
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,346
No, it isn't.

451
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,809
- Yes, how much is it?
- Thank you so much.

452

[stall owner] It's 300 hwan.

It's okay. Let me buy this for Jina.

[member] How have you been?

460
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,749
[Jiwook] Why did you call me here?

461
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,043
The president is announcing
his candidacy very soon.

462
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,920
The entire world knows that.

463
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,213
Well, what they don't know yet

464
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,674
is he'll be appointing me
as the chairman of the election committee.

465
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,969
[member] We need your influence, Mr. Pak.

[chuckles]

467
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,350
And what influence do you think I have?

468
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,523
Don't you control the police?

469
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,485
[Seongmin] We need some men
to secretly work for us in the outskirts.

470
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,697
[member] The president must have given him
the chair position for a reason, right?

[♪ tense music playing]

472
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,874
So what do you need?

[groans softly]

474
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,579

00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,042
Are you serious? If I could've faced
those punks one-on-one,

477
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,044
they'd be dead right now.

478

[Doochill] You're done with street fights.

479
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,550
We're now in an age
of fighter planes and submarines.

480
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,510
Did you come to make me angry?

Oh, I'm here to save Yoon Palbong.

487
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,709
All right. Well then…

488
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,171
tell me what I've got to do.

489
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,799
You gotta win
the Innovation Party's nomination.

490
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,426
The Innovation?

491
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,219
Choo Intae?

492
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,597
But I don't like Choo Intae.

493
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,891
The safest spot's right next to Choo.

494
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,185
Tell Kang you'll get nominated

495
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,021
and you'll spy on Choo Intae
for him from the inside.

496
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,399
He would never kill someone
if he finds them useful.

497
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,986
Hey, how am I supposed to get nominated?

498
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,321
There's always a way.

499
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,823
There's a string attached.

[member 3] We cannot accept that--

525
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,819
Think about this.
If our partners were to pull out,

526
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,364
we lose what we've invested.

527
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,700
So what do you say?

528
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,286
- [hand thuds]
- It's not feasible for us.

529
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,954
That's way too much, 30%.

530
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,539
[member] We're talking about a debt here.

531
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,458
And for you to use 30% of the loan?

532
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,835
Once I become
the chair of the election campaign,

533
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,212
I will make sure
that our Cheongwoo Federation

534
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,964
takes control of the Liberal Party.

535
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,424
Then we can push for special laws

536
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,801
and see that the industrial complex
is completed.

537
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,513
Lend me your support
and put your trust in me.

538
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,768
Now applaud!

539
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,937
[applause]

540
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,073
30%, that's totally ridiculous.

541
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,581
[members murmuring]

542
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,769
Is there really a need
to kill Yoon Palbong right away?

543
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,687
You'll need him for the next election.

544
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,772
I don't need him.

545
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,737
It's not easy these days
to find people to do the dirty work.

546
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,371
I told you, I keep having nightmares.

547
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,251
I'm gonna need some time then.

548
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,880
What's Cha Taemin up to?

549
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,966
Taemin?

550
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,595
Well, Taemin, I assume

551
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,807
is at the salt farms
regretting what he did.

552
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,810
Give it to Taemin.

553
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,105
[sighs]
That's a little…

554
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,815
[Seongmin] What?

555
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,441
Does that make you uneasy?

556
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,113
Should we just throw you to the fish, or…

557
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,490
should we work together?

558
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,658
Cha Taemin
Leader of the Sineui Alliance

559
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,327
No, it does not.

560
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,454
I will arrange to meet with him.

561
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,332
I'm sure he's got a grudge
against Yoon Palbong.

562
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,461
Tell him I'll send him to Osaka
if he gets the job done right.

563
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,505
Yes.

564
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,465
Do this for me

565
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,926
as quickly as possible.

566
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,311
[door opens]

567
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,979
The Sineui Alliance is worthless.

568
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,399
It's a puppet exploited by your ambitions.

569
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,443
Why should we…

570
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,696
Why should we kill people for you?

571
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,406
Is that why you betrayed me?

572
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,284
[Doochill] <i>So please,
just let Taemin live.</i>

573
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,996
I'll send him off to the salt farms
and keep a close eye on him.

574
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,919
[soft knocking on door]

575
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,253
Call the salt farm.

576
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,297
Tell them I'm coming.

577
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,132
Very well, sir.

578
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,260
- [telephone ringing]
- [typewriters keys clacking]

579
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,314
What's going on here?

580
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,982
- [staff 2] Well…
- Huh?

581
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,277
The Reconstruction Bureau
is being shut down.

582
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,987
Wait, what are you saying?

583
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,489
[staff 2] It's the minister's order.

584
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,702
What now?

585
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,831
What exactly is going on?

586
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,417
Well, we have an election to handle.

587
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,338
Would you just tell me what this is about?

588
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,257
What's going on?

589
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,844
- [sighs]
- [Kim San] Tell me why.

590
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,140
You and I spent
all those sleepless nights, didn't we?

591
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,267
You missed your children's graduations.

592
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,186
And you put up with delayed payments.

593
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,899
You even rejected decent job offers.

594
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,777
For what?

595
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,570
Tell me, sir.

596
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,824
There were dreams, weren't there?

597
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,577
Dreams that we were planning
on fulfilling, you and I.

598
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,287
Right?

599
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,081
I hear what you're saying.

600
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,333
And I feel the same way.

601
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,796
So then why are they doing this
all of a sudden?

602
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,966
He says that a planned economy
is for communists.

603
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,342
That's complete nonsense.

604
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,468
[sighs]

605
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,513
Each department will send employees
to the election headquarters.

606
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,766
They're using government workers
for the election?

607
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,977
Every non-essential department
is getting disbanded

608
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,395
to focus on the election.

609
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,069
[Kim San] Sir.

610
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,195
Yes?

611
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,865
What have you been doing this whole time?

612
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,119
Were you planning on just riding
our coattails until you got promoted?

613
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,704
Kim San.

614
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,540
How… how dare you?

615
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,001
I owe you nothing from this point on.

616
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,838
[♪ soft somber music playing]

617
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,673
[sighs]

618
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,888
The National Reconstruction Project.

619
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,516
I'm not gonna give it up.

620
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,602
- What?
- I will continue working

621
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,479
on the National Reconstruction Project.

622
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,483
So set the materials aside.

623
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,028
[♪ tense music building]

624
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,870
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

625
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,044
What did Samsik propose to you
when you first met him?

626
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,550
[Kim San] <i>He reached out to me
as soon as I left the Ministry.</i>

627
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,097
<i>It turns out
he had been watching me all along.</i>

628
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,517
<i>He also knew
that the National Reconstruction Bureau</i>

629
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,894
- <i>had been disbanded.</i>
- [whirring]

630
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,190
Mom, is this really gonna work?

631
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,400
[Jina's mom] I guess we'll see.

632
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,777
Hi, I'm home.

633
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,071
Oh, Uncle, someone sent us a telephone.

634
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,656
A telephone?

635
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,077
Who sent this?

636
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,121
Uh, some people came
to drop it off earlier today.

637
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,997
[telephone ringing]

638
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,207
[Kim San sighs]

639
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,043
[telephone ringing]

640
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,673
- Yes, hello?
- [Doochill] <i>Hello, Minister.</i>

641
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,174
Can you hear me all right?

642
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,887
I sent you a telephone,
so that we could chat every now and then.

643
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,722
[Doochill] <i>It's great to hear your voice.</i>

644
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,015
What do you think you're doing?

645
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,559
<i>Minister, I heard they shut down</i>

646
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,352
<i>the National Reconstruction Bureau.</i>

647
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,355
Those poor fools,
they just don't understand.

648
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,232
They don't see what a blessing you are.

649
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,026
In my opinion,

650
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,572
blessings are only blessings if and when
they're placed in the right hands.

651
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,324
For those who are unable
to appreciate them,

652
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,784
they become poison.

653
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,162
And the poison spreads.

654
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,206
<i>I'm confident
that I can make very good use</i>

655
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,250
of the blessing that is Kim San.

656
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,962
Don't defy what's in your destiny.

657
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,843
[Kim San] <i>He told me
not to defy what's in my destiny.</i>

658
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,222
<i>Uncle Samsik is the kind of man
who can forge destiny out of thin air.</i>

659
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,019
<i>So, where was I destined to go next?</i>

660
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,980
<i>Well, of course,</i>

661
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,565
- <i>he had the answer to that.</i>
- [thudding]

662
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,152
<i>He knew it wasn't
to the place that needed me,</i>

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,739

665
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,921
Hey, what are you doing here?

666
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,008
Just passing by and wanted to see you.

667
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,343
[soft chuckle]

668
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,429
Can you wait a second?

669
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,889
I'll tell Father that you're here.

670
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,265
[Kim San] Oh, don't.

671
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,060
I came here to see you.

672
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,398
Well then, can you sit down
and wait a little while?

673
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,003
Yeojin, about that speech
scheduled for this weekend.

674
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,340
I think we need to cancel.
We have no campaign vehicles.

675
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,134
Let's wait a little longer.

676
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,638
[Kim San] <i>The place I needed to be.</i>

677
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,225
<i>But where did I have to be
for my own sake?</i>

678
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,698
[member 1] The foreign press is predicting
Choo Intae will win the election.

679
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,867
[member 2] Should we just trust
Kang Seongmin and leave it up to him?

680
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,035
No, we can't.

681
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,371
So?

682
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,833
What's the other option?

683
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,418
Well…

684
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,754
I have a great plan for us.

685
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,882
The Cheongwoo Federation will eventually
control the entire country.

686
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,303
So how do we do that?

687
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:29,265
We plan the establishment of a parliament

688
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,311
and we buy off
the entire National Assembly.

689
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,859
Was Samsik involved
in the illegal loan acquired

690
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,569
from the Development Bank?

691
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm not sure about that.

Was Samsik involved

695
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,505
in the election fraud
that took place on March 15th?

696
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,799
I'm not sure about that.

697
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,178
You want the ballot boxes…

698
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,346
Too risky?

699
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,014
You're stealing ballot boxes, aren't you?

700
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,557
You better not be caught this time around.

701
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,184
[Doochill]
<i>If it seems even a little dangerous,</i>

702
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,894
<i>leave the ballot boxes
and get out of there.</i>

703
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,645
If you're caught this time,
I can't save you.

704
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,897
Did Samsik

705
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,733
coax and win over key figures

706
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,569
in the military and the government?

707
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,657
I'm not sure about that.

708
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,951
Go and meet Hong Youngki.

709
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,330
[Doochill] <i>Politics.</i>

710
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,791
<i>That's what poisoned the military.
Don't you see it?</i>

711
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,127
<i>The government turned the military
into its puppet.</i>

712
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,297
<i>We need to reform politics
to cleanse the military and if not,</i>

713
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,300
then the military has to cleanse politics.

714
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,844
Was Samsik the one…

715
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,556
who planned coup d'état?

716
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,352
[Doochill]
<i>Let's turn the world upside down.</i>

717
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,647
<i>South Korea is too small
of a vessel for us.</i>

718
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,401
<i>A bowl too small
to hold our great potential.</i>

719
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,069
<i>We need to shatter it first</i>

720
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,196
<i>in order to create a bigger one.</i>

721
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,786
[lighter clicks]

722
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,666
[lighter clicks]

723
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,137
[♪ dramatic music playing]

724
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,038
[♪ dramatic music continues playing]

725
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,101
