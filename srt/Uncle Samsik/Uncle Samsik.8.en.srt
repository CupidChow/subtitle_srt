[young Doochill] If you ever get hungry,
you just come find uncle, huh?

00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,453

Samsik, sir.

Samsik?

22
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,854
Apparently, he'll do anything
to get three meals a day.

23
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,482
Makes me wonder
if he'd kill someone to get four.

And when he does, you have to make sure
your presence is known.

00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,203
We should let him get away with it.

His reputation will need to stay intact.

Be honest with me.

I can do even more than that.

[Hyunseok] The Pak Jiwook bribery incident

140
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,878
And you knew all about it.

Then what?

144
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,516
Then Pak Jiwook could be the bait
to get Choi Hanrim, that's what.

Here you go, take this to your mother.

153
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,041
[Soojin] This one needs some mending.

My mom does this kind of work?

Mm-hmm. You didn't know that?
She's actually quite talented.

156

We've had enough! Let's make changes!

163
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,357
We'll end up worse off by making changes!

What are you doing out here?

167
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,825
Everyone in the neighborhood
has been talking about you.

168
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,202
Let me take that.

169
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,412
They saw me in the paper?

170
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,249
They say they'll vote for you
if you run for the Assembly.

171
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,333
Really?

172
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,293
[Jina] Are you gonna be
an assemblyman one day?

173
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,212
Well…

174
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,840
If Jina wants me to.
Is that what you want?

175
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,217
[chuckles, clicks tongue]

176
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,844
I think it's…

177
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,764
it's less about the job you have

178
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,476
and more about the things you actually do.

179
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,146
Yes, you're right about that.

180
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,692
You're so grown up, Jina. Let's go.

181
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,113
[Jina] Soojin just gave me this.
It's for Mom to mend.

182
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,993
I didn't know she's been working.

183
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,954
She must be doing it while I'm asleep.

184
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,707
Election Campaign Headquarters

185
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,834
Well done.
It's passed, the bill went through.

186
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,712
[Minkyu] <i>No need to worry about the rest.</i>

187
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,796
<i>It's handled.</i>

188
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,381
Right.

189
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,842
The bill's gone through.

190
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,136
Soldiers and government workers,
get them on board.

191
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,471
We'll have assemblymen
stationed at the voting centers.

192
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,556
[Minkyu] Send them right away.

193
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,308
I'll have it done by the end of the day.

194
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,892
- And what about Army Headquarters?
- [employee] Yes.

195
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,352
- They're confirmed?
- [employee] Yes, sir!

196
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,064

197

[pedestrian gasps]
Isn't that him?

198
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,782
It is! He looks even better in person,
don't you think?

199
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,577
Hello, stranger.

200
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,872
Just a moment.

201
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,917
- [Kim San] How are you?
- I'm well.

202
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,085
How are you though?

203
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,838
Not bad. Why?

204
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,300
Well, it seems like everywhere we go,

205
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,511
- you seem to be the talk of the town.
- Yes, I know. I feel uneasy.

206
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,556
Quite the performance, Mr. Kim.

207
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,976
[Kim San] I just happened to be there.

208
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,521
I'll see you around then.

209
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,982
Sure. See you when I see you.

210
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,776
Goodbye.

211
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,154
Actually, Mr. Kim…

212
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,033
Why don't the two of us
have dinner tonight?

213
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,827
Tonight?

214
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,954
Yes, dinner tonight.

215
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,956
Meet you at the hotel later.

216
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,250
[Rachael] Let's go.

217
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,253
[breathes deeply]

218
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,091
[Inho] Wow. Our friend's turning into
a real star.

219
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,968
- Wonderful.
- [chuckles]

220
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,387
[Hanmin] Hey, Captain Pak.

221
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,055
You asked about
getting a hold of a book, right?

222
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,807
Oh. Can you get it?

223
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,642
I can have it shipped from Japan.

224
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,102
Wow, thank you.

225
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,021
What do you need a philosophy book for?

226
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,482
[Inho] Man, this guy's trying to be
a philosopher, huh?

227
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,608
[Inho chuckles]

228
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,443
Are you a fan of Mister Choo Intae?

[soft chuckle]

230
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,496
[Yeonchul] Oh, Samsik! Over here!

231
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,373
Come on, hurry up!
Visiting hours are almost over.

232
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,625
Why are you so late? This way.

233
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,168
Is he gonna pull through?

234
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,796
Let's just get in there
and talk to him first.

235
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,880
Which one is it?

236
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,049
[knocks on door]

237
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,885
In here.

238
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,847
Oh my, hmm, how could this happen?

239
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,392
I'm old. It's not that shocking, is it?

240
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,354
[sighs]
Still… it's such a critical time.

241
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,482
[soft groaning]

242
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,110

[groans]

244
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,198
…who do you think will take over then?

245
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,951
[Yeonchul] Sir, please,
no need to think about that now.

246
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,704
[groans]

247
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,417
There. That one.

248
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,252
[Yosub] He's not like his brothers.

249
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,920
He's young,

250
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,381
he has a gentle disposition.

251
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,509
He'll need your guidance.

252
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,386
[Yeonchul] Yes, sir.

253
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,764

254
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,516
Samsik.

255
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,643
Yes, sir?

256
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,229
I wanna try a red bean bun.

257
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,775
One of the buns from your bakery.

258
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,652
Of course.

259
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:03,032
Next time I come, I'll bring it all.

260
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,617
Red bean bun,
sticky rice mochi, everything.

261

Yeah.

269
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
Welcome.

270
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,868
I trust
Mister Oh's already explained everything?

271
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,245
Yes.

272
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,539
I'll admit,
we're not the best news outlet around.

273
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,415
A new reporter can't be greedy.

274
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,169
[Kim San] Hmm.

Let's have you try on some clothes.

278
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,301
Take that jacket off. Here.

279
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,513
Hey, uh, wait. Don't you think
the pinstripes look fancier?

280
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,306
Huh? Do they?

281
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,516
[Kim San] I'll take that.

282
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,185
Does this make you look like
the heir to a big fortune?

283
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937

in the middle, it's… it's not on any side.

My God, would it kill you

287
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,447

- Hang on. Why… why are we doing this?

288
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,741
[Doochill] Here. Take this.

289
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,620
From this point on,

290
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,540
you're CEO Kim Kwangmin
of the Sanae Corporation.

291
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,209
Hey, don't you think
this makes him look like he's wealthy?

292
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,129
Yes, it's the colors. Huh.

293
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
You wait outside.

Why should I?

295
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,633
So he can get changed.

[Miss Kim] Where do I go?

297
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,720
Go get something from the bakery.

298
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,763
I don't like bread.

299
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,015
Just get out!

Here, do you want it?

Here, take it. It's bread, enjoy it.

347
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,548
- [Kim San] Exporter… Okay.
- "Ex… exporter has requested…"

348
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,301
- "To receive it…"
- [Kim San] Mm-hmm.

349
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,636
- Receive what?
- "Payment."

350
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,221
- Okay. Again.
- [Han Soo] Uh…

351
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,849
- [Kim San] The market…
- "The market…"

352
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,142
- "Market value."
- [Han Soo] Market val…

353
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,478
- "Value." Yeah, that's good.
- [Kim San] Market value.

354
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,730
[sighs]
Mister Han Soo.

355
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,025
Are you… illiterate?

356
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,736
- [Kim San] Can you read or not?
- Don't talk down to me.

357
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,530
You little know-it-all.

358
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,243
In the process of exporting
the raw materials, we agreed…

359
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,245
to receive our payment
in the form of flour,

360
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,622
as per the exporter's request.

361
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,582
As per the exporter's request…

362
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,167
[Han Soo] "As per the exporter's request…"

363
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,752
- …we agreed…
- [Han Soo] "…we agreed…"

364
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,253
…to receive payment in the form of flour.

365
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,630
[Han Soo] "…to receive payment
in the form of flour."

366
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,298
- We want…
- "We want…"

367
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,176
- [Kim San] …the flour…
- "…the flour…"

368
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,304
…to be transferred
at the official exchange rate.

369
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,015
What's an exchange rate again?

370
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,391
- [spits]
- [door opens]

371
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,976
[Han Soo] Uncle Sam.

372
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,895
This is way too hard.

373
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,396
He can't memorize two sentences.

374
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,317
You still haven't memorized it?
It's two sentences.

375
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,736
Here. Try it again, huh?

376
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,740
In the process of exporting
the raw materials, we agreed…

377
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,119
to receive payment in the form of flour,
as per the exporter's request.

378
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,622
But we want it transferred
at the official exchange rate,

379
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,374
- so we wanted to meet with you--
- What?

380
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,795
He's gonna say,
"But hang on, that would mean

381
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,922
that your profits
would increase fivefold."

382
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,591
- [Han Soo] It's--
- Christ, with the official exchange rate,

383
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,385
your profits will increase fivefold.

384
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,178
"The profits will increase fivefold."

385
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,596
- If that's the case…
- [Doochill] Yes.

386
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,474
If that's the case, we will…

387
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,354
So we'll give you 20% of the profit,
and build a bridge…

388
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,064
- a bridge in your district. Mm-hmm.
- We'll build a bridge in your district.

389
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,859
- A bridge?
- [both] Yes, sir.

390
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,778
- No, you could do that?
- Yes, of course, I can.

391
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,114
We'll give you whatever you want,
I promise you, sir.

392
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,367
[Doochill] <i>If you tell Pak Jiwook that
you'll build a bridge in his district,</i>

393
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,493
<i>he'll take the bait.</i>

394
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,290
Why's the export price
for the Sanae Corporation

395
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,875
- back on the table, huh?
- I'm not sure.

396
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,419
We agreed to their request
to receive payment in flour.

397
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,296
We worked out an agreement last time.

398
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,715
Let's make the Sanae Corporation payments

399
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,675
with the official exchange rate.

400
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,926
What did you say?

401
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,387
If we do that,
their profits will increase fivefold.

402
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,222
[assemblyman]
What on earth has gotten into you?

403
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,891
You dozed off during that meeting.

404
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,727
Let's take a short break, huh?

405
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,770
Why do you always stick your nose
in everything? Hmm?

406
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,022
Let's take a short break, I said.

407
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,607
[sighs]
What time is it?

408
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,110
Are you really gonna be difficult? Huh?

409
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,155
You didn't approve the payment extension
for Mankang Corporation.

410
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,658
All right, fine.
So I'll approve the extension.

411
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,535
I'll do it. You have my word, huh?

412
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,204
Really?

413
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,831
[chuckles]
Well then, that changes everything.

414
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,666
And you?

415
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,795
What if… I want to give Guin Foods
more of the cornmeal supply?

416
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,964
Well, all right, it's a deal.

417
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,591
[chuckles]
All right.

418
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:21,178
Then we're all in agreement
for Sanae Produce. Okay?

419
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,472
[Jiwook chuckles]
Okay.

420
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,622
[groans]

421
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,417
- It's been approved.
- Thank you, sir.

422
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,670
- [Jiwook] And the bridge?
- I've placed the order

423
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,921
with Daemyeon Construction.

424
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,005
It's all settled, sir.

425
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,007
- This kid!
- [Han Soo] Sir.

426
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,592
I like how you handle things.

427
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,302
[chuckles]

428
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,222
[Han Soo] Oh, it's not much,
but here's a gift for you.

429
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,307
Go ahead, open it up and take a look.

430
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,687
Why don't you put it
in the trunk, quietly?

431
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,772
Yes, sir,
I'll put it in the trunk quietly.

432
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,656
[♪ tense music playing]

433
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,366

Sineui Alliance Charter

435
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,334
[Han Soo] We'll, uh…

436
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,922
We'll make sure it all gets done,

437
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,466
without any hitches, sir.

438
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,678
That's it, we're strangers again.

439
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,054
Of course.

440
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,056
- You head home.
- [Han Soo] Good evening, sir.

441
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,600
Take care of yourself, sir.

442
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,729
[car engine stars]

443
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,234
You think he pulled it off?

444
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,279
- Oh, uh, who knows?
- [door opens]

445
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,531
- [manager] I'm back.
- Oh, how did it go?

446
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,408
The official exchange rate
has been approved.

447
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,492
It has?

448
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,579
I did pretty well, didn't I?

449
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,372
Yes, you did. Well done!

450
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,498
- [Doochill] Hmm?
- [chuckles]

451
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,208
Han Soo,
we should prepare for the hearing now.

452
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,918
You don't wanna mess up
the witness statement.

453
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,503
- [Doochill] Right.
- There's more to memorize?

454
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,506
No, don't worry, it's not much.
You're a quick learner anyway.

455
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,633
What was inside that box there?

456
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,010
[Han Soo] Huh?

457
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,179
The wooden box inside his trunk.
What was it?

458
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,933
Sineui Alliance with a signature.

459
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,935
[Han Soo]
There was some kind of signature.

460
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,063
Kang Jinseong? Kang…

461
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,522
- Kang Seongmin!
- Kang Seongmin.

462
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,274
Their Code of Conduct.

463
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,609
You said you saw him burn it.

464
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,361
[manager] I'm sorry, sir.

465
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,655
Huh, so Pak Jiwook stole it,
that sneaky bastard.

466
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,865
Is it important?

467
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,576
- Should I go get it?
- No, wait, wait.

468
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,660
[manager] What is it?

469
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,621
Are you sure
Kang Seongmin's signature was on it?

470
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,997
[Han Soo] Yeah.

471
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,501
I thought Pak Jiwook burned it all,
but it seems he kept this one.

472
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,044
Why would he have put this aside?

473
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,922
Yeah. Why would he keep it?

474
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,841
Hey, you just focus
on learning your lines.

475
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,344
No, wait, I'm curious, what is it? Why?

476
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,513
- Pak Jiwook…
- [Han Soo] Yes?

477
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,765
…plans to stab Kang Seongmin in the back.

478
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,683
- You get it?
- Why though?

479
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,811
Why don't we focus on this? Come here.

482
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,695
[Kim San] Well done today.

483
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,364
- [Doochill] Good work.
- [Han Soo] Thank you, I'll see you later.

[♪ tense music continues playing]

485

Pak Jiwook has taken the bait.

486
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,339
Yeah.

487
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,258
Things will start
getting more complicated.

488

[Kim San breathes deeply]

489
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,179
As you gain more recognition,
people will start approaching you

490
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,224
and try to sway you.
Still, you have to refuse to be swayed.

491
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,435
Yes, I understand.

492
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,855
Kim San will be
the next Prime Minister of South Korea.

493
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:04,651
You must focus on that goal,
if we are ever to fulfill that dream.

494
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,239
I know.

495
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,701
If anybody tries to sway you,
then you must tell me right away.

496
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,579
[breathes deeply]

497
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,705
I won't be swayed.

Uncle, where are you going?

00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,296
I'm off to Osaka.

505
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,465
I'll get rich and then I'll come back.

506

I do not resent anyone.

512
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,251
If I did, I would have left already.

I'll have to stop him

it's all falling into place.

696
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,003
You must think I'm a traitor, don't you?

697
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,674
Aren't you though?

698
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,261
What do you really think of me?

699
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,349
You think I'm a dirtbag general.

700
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,978
A dirtbag general
who uses and discards you.

701
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,859
You think I don't know
how you guys see me?

702
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,237
What do you mean by that?

703
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,406
I've already explained it to you.

704
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,452
I will use Han Soo as bait
to get to Pak Jiwook.

705
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,665
You're honestly going to use
Assemblyman Pak to get to General Choi?

706
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,167
Yeah.

707
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,627
That's the way things work in this world.

708
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,839
[Doochill] Hmm.

709
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,885
There are two things that determine
the direction of a person's life.

710
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,181
Your nature, how you're born,
and nurture, how you're raised.

711
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,476
You can't escape these two factors.

712
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,561
You'll ask, "Why did I act that way?"

713
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,313
"Why did I say all those things?"

714
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,440
The answer comes down to those factors.

715
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,694
It's your nature and your nurture.

716
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,033
What is the nature of General Choi?

717
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,827
He's an honorable and upstanding person.

718
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,247
It's in his nature to see everything
as either right or wrong.

719
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,958
People like him haven't the slightest clue

720
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,087
about the kind of atrocities
other people are capable of.

721
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,422
What about nurture?

722
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,675
He has been nurtured
by admiration his whole life.

723
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,969
People do admire him though.

724
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,972
That is why he can't possibly imagine
a version of himself

725
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,849
that isn't showered with admiration.

726
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,646
So then what could he do
that would cost him that praise?

727
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,731
[sighs]

728
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,441
I'm not sure.

729
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,323
Have suspicions of Kim San.

730
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,868
He will end up leaving the military
because of that.

731
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,872
At which point we'll take
his well-crafted plan for ourselves.

732
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,293
He has a completely different perspective
of the world.

733
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,964
When someone has an impeccable plan…

734
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,883
it's normal to feel threatened.

735
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,218
But with Samsik…

736
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,514
he decides to steal that plan.

737
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,143
From now on,
you're never to leave his side.

738
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,563
Why not?

739
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,649
Because Choi Hanrim's weakness
is you, Kim San.

740
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,821
[♪ eerie music playing]

741
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,781
Why did I do what I did?

742
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,578
Why did I say what I said?

743
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,708
I should have never
let him leave like that.

744
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,503
[chuckles]

745
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,548
[sighs]

746
