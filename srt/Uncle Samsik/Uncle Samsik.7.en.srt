[panting continues]

00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,621
Hey, Kim San!

00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,958
[Kwangmin] Can you slow it down a little?
[groans]

00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,126
[Hanmin] Kwangmin, hurry up!

[groans]

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,133
Slow down, hey!

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,221
- Victory, sir!
- Victory.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,434
Here you are. Well done.

- Here. Well done.

16
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,610
Thank you, sir.

00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,580
Sorry. I'm sorry.

[Kim San coughs]

26
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,808
I was gonna take these

27
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,559
- for my niece, Jina.

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,816
I'm sure you feel uneasy.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,901
No, I'm fine.

32
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,238
Don't worry about anything. Just study.

33
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,864
It's one of the perks of being away.

34
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,910
We're sending you off so you can study
without worrying about your family.

35
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,079
I'll keep that in mind.

36
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,292
How is your father's health?
Still very ill?

37
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,421
Yes, he's not doing well.

38
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
[sniffles]

39
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,094
I'll give you… some money to live on.

40
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,138
That's all right, general.
Don't worry about us.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,642
Just take it and don't say a word.

42
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,855
Thank you, sir.

43
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,944
- Hey, take the rest of that home.
- Yes, sir.

Uncle Samsik

50
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,984
Father vs. Uncle

51
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,114
He's probably grasping onto Yosub's hands
and sobbing right about now.

52
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,908
Completely unaware he's taken the bait.

53
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,785
[Professor Hwang chuckles]
<i>I'm sure Kang Seongmin would be grateful.</i>

54
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,286
Yes, of course he would.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
He would have never imagined this role.

56
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,834
That kid has been in the palm of my hand
since the day I bottle-fed him.

57
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,753
Why are there so many US soldiers?

58
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,088
[Professor Hwang] <i>US soldiers?</i>

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,133
Something doesn't feel right here.

[♪ uneasy music playing]

61
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,640
[Michael] It seems most young officers
are in agreement with this declaration.

62
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,768
There's also new intelligence
from the US Army.

63
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,521
[inhales sharply, exhales deeply]

64
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,317
Uh, I will… be sure
to keep the military under control.

65
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,028
[Yosub] The Assembly can be bought…

66
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,947
but not the military.

67
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,199
The occupation taught us that.

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
What other intelligence was there?

69
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
[Michael]
The military looks set to appoint

70
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,621
a new First Operations Commander.

71
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,581
A new commander?

72
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,376
General Choi Hanrim is highly regarded
within the military.

73
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,962
He's also very close
with the US Army Commander.

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,592
Choi Hanrim?

00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,681

Did you first meet
First Operations commander, Choi Hanrim,

78
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,858
- at the Albright farewell party?
- Yes, I met him there.

79
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,193
Is that when you discuss the coup d'etat?

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,405
[inhales deeply]

81

[tapping on table]

82
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,625
General Choi Hanrim was the soldier
that I had the utmost admiration for.

83
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,794
He helped me when I needed it most.

84
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,342
He was just like a father to me.

- [chuckles]

90
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,950
Is it true what they are saying?

91
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,244
I have joined the Democratic Party.

92
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,789
The political arena's difficult, huh?
[pats on Kim San's arm]

93
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,083
[Hanrim] People think
they're different from each other.

94
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,419
Eventually, they figure out
that they're all the same.

95
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,173
When they figure it out, it's too late.

96
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,466
I'll keep that in mind.

97
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,551
- Shall we?
- [doors open]

98
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,762
[indistinct chatter]

99
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,351
We both know too many people
admire General Choi Hanrim.

100
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,605
Do you normally like those
who are… admired?

101
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,399
- [scoffs]
- They're just the worst.

102
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,735
[Doochill] Oh, there he is now.

103
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,489
Kim San is sticking right by his side.

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,450
Yeah, of course he is.
That's why we're here tonight.

105
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,452
General Choi Hanrim is here.

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,122
Do they look a bit too close to you?

107
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,332
[Doosik] You said that's why you came.

108
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,168
Well, it's not necessary
to appear so close.

109
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
He's like a father to Kim San.

110
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,966
Choo Intae is like his father.
Choi Hanrim is like his father.

111
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,677
Every man and his dog
could be like his father.

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,429
- Is Samsik getting jealous?
- [lighter clicking]

113
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,931
Jealous?

12 scholarship recipients to America.

119
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,703
Now please welcome my little sister,
Rachael Jeong…

120
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,538
of the Albright Foundation.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Rachael Jeong
from the Albright Foundation.

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,385
First and foremost,
I'd like to say thank you for your time

124
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,762
and that I truly, deeply appreciate

125
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,639
each and every one of you
here with us today.

126
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,058
It is an honor to do what we do.

127
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,770
But without further ado,
it is my pleasure to introduce to you

128
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,148
the Albright scholarship program students.

129
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,649
[crowd applauding]

130
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,985
Let's congratulate
our scholarship recipients.

131
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,740
[Rachael]
Presenting, we have our Albright alumni.

132
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,951
Kim San, Jeong Hanmin,
and Kim Kwangmin to the front, please.

133
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,411
Attention. Salute.

[crowd applauding]

137
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,723
Rachael, have you spoken
with the minister yet?

138
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,183
Long time no see, Colonel.

139
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,643
You told your uncle, right?

140
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,769
When I go back to America--

141
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,146
"Let us not become weary in doing good,

142
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
for at the proper time,
we shall reap a harvest

143
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,900
if we don't give up."

144
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,569
Galatians 6:9. Words I live by, Colonel.

145
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,280
As long as you don't give up
and as long as I don't give up,

146
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,575
I feel that all the seeds we've planted
won't go to waste.

147
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,577
You haven't told the minister yet?

148
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,580
I haven't told my uncle yet
because I feel that he'd be…

149
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,124
- disappointed.
- [colonel] Mm.

150
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,878
Colonel, the Albright Foundation
has its eyes on you

151
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,673
and your level of patience.

152
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,299
Whether you're growing weary or not…

153
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,678
have some faith.
Imagine the harvest we'd soon reap.

154
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,722
I'll send your best
to my father and my uncle.

155
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,474
- [colonel] Mm-hmm.
- Now if you'll excuse me.

156
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,147
- [Michael] Uncle Samsik.
- Oh, Michael.

157
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,941
My little sister, Rachael.

158
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,484
Rachael, this is Uncle Samsik.

159
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
- Uncle Samsik.
- You've heard all about him.

160
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,946
It's a pleasure.

161
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,240
I've heard many great things.
It's nice to meet you.

162
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
Nice to meet you.

163
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120
There's something very American about you.

164
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,664
[chuckles]
Well, I am American.

165
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,999
Ah.

166
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,459
I'm going to take a moment
'cause of my shoes, okay?

167
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,128
- Ah, okay.
- Excuse me.

168
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,796
My shoes are uncomfortable.

169
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,214
[Rachael] I'll see you next time.

170
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,969
- Ah, Rachael, hi.
- [Rachael] Hello.

171
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,560
Seonyoowon

172
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,904
Cha Taemin killed three of my men
and then ran away.

173
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,490
I assume you took care of the evidence?

174
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,118
Yes, of course. Burned every bit of it.

175
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,665
[Jiwook] Oh, one more thing…

176
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,084
Yes, go on.

177
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,046
Uh, so, you know
how we had that big flood?

178
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,549
Well, a bridge was destroyed
in our district.

179
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,301
We'll discuss district matters later.

180
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,679
[sighs]

181
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,598
All right, well, fine.

182
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,768
I mean, you said, "Go on", so…

183
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,562
[Jiwook sighs]

184
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,411
[Rachael] Excuse me.

185
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,871
Yes, miss?

186
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,748
Can you help me fix my shoe?

187
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,501
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,419
You want me to fix your shoe?

189
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,421
Yes, please.

190
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,385
[puffs]

191
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,719
Okay.

192
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,306
Actually… never mind.

193
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,100
I'll figure it out myself.

194
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,061
[exhales sharply]
As you wish.

195
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,864
[clacks]

196
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,128
[high heels clacking]

197
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,511
[high heels clacking]

198
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,096
[breathes sharply]

199
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,558
Excuse me.

200
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,935
Can I get a light?

201
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,482
Do you remember
the Battle of Nakdong River?

202
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,652
- Ah, of course, I remember.
- [chuckles]

203
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,280
Oh, we were bombarded
for 28 hours straight.

204
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,823
[Hanmin] What should I say?

205
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,958
[commander] I thought you were dead then.
[chuckles]

206
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,168
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

207
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,044
And I thought to myself,

208
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,090
"What are these communists
doing here? Huh?"

209
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,634
- I don't…
- [Hanmin clears throat]

210
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,678
What is it?

211
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,556
Sir, you mentioned earlier
I should meet some of the Americans.

212
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,100
Of course, we're sharing war stories.

213
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,978
The commander here
thought I died at Nakdong.

214
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,731
[Hanmin] Excuse me, sir.

215
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,066
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Nah.

216
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,902
- [commander chuckles]
- Nice to meet you, sir.

217
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,321
Uh… you thought he died?

218
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,323
- [Hanrim] Mm-hmm.
- Oh, but you came back,

219
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,992
because… you saw some communist in heaven.

220
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,119
[laughter]

221
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,788
- Hey, that's a good one.
- Yeah.

222
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,500
As you said,

223
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,503
I thought I was a goner but I'm here.

224
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,171
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughter]

225
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,048
He is a funny one.
[chuckles]

226
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,394
Sineui Alliance Charter

227
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,897
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

228
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,695
[colonel] Who knew that Cuba would fall
under a communist regime, right?

229
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,489
Surprised everyone, I would say, sir.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,868
It's people like you, General Choi,
who should be in politics.

231
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
- Are you thinking of running, sir?
- I'm not doing that.

232
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,248
That's foreign interference.

233
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,584
To bring up politics
to a military officer? Hey.

234
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,295
In the event

235
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,757
that South Korea really does become
a communist country…

236
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,176
[inhales sharply]
Well, mm…

237
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,180
Uh… the general feels like
you shouldn't talk about politics,

238
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,224
considering his position.

239
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,810
- And although he doesn't think that…
- [footsteps approaching]

240
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,812
- …South Korea could become a comm--
- [officer clears throat]

241
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,107
I believe that you're in my seat, sir.

242
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109
And who are you?

243
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,737
Jason Arrent.
I'm a political officer at the US embassy.

244
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,906
Embassy?

245
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,867
Okay. Embassy.

246
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,536
[sighs]
Right.

247
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,506
What is it? Why'd you come back?

248
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,260
Well, a guy from the embassy said
that I was in his seat.

249
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,220
Yeah, but you could have
stood your ground.

250
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,597
Why'd you walk away?

251
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,098
- [Hanmin sighs]
- What were they saying?

252
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,601
Is he getting into politics?

253
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,311
Is he?

254
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,064
Uh, well, he had said that…

255
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,859
in the extremely unlikely event

256
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,944
that South Korea becomes
a communist nation…

257
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,572
If it does, what?

258
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,491
Well, that's when
the embassy guy interrupted.

259
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,786
[sighs]
At the most critical second,

260
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,079
you got pushed out.

261
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,424
[Rachael] Do you remember me?

262
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,304
I do.

263
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,222
From the scholarship ceremony.

264
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,683
- Right?
- Right.

265
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,185
Lovely.

266
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,937
Very good memory.

267
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,232
I remember everything about that day.

268
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,693
Your National Reconstruction Plan.

269
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,946
I found it interesting.

270
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,906
Eye-opening, actually.

271
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,075
Thank you.

272
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,119
Do you really think it's possible?

273
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,454
Maybe.

274
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,459
Only if we open it up
and pull everything apart

275
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,127
to rebuild it from the ground up.

276
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,505
[laughs]

277
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,839
What's funny?

278
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,925
You couldn't fix a shoe.

279
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,635
You got to give it to me to fix it.

280
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
And if I do,

281
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,431
can you fix it?

282
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,523
A lot of people have lost money
from making investments in Cuba.

283
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,442
Why would anyone want to invest in Korea

284
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,403
if things are even worse here?

285
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,991
Um, South Korea is different from Cuba.

286
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,410
I can't trust the Korean government
just yet.

287
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,203
So…

288
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:41,667
are you saying that you're not going
to invest in our… industrial complex?

289
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,836
What more do you need?

290
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,505
Guarantee of payment
from the Korean government.

291
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,384
Right, yeah.

292
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,559
Are you… really getting into politics?

293
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,227
Yes, I am, sir.

294
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,187
Think you can beat seasoned politicians?

295
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,605
I will do my best.

296
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,486
[Hanrim] Come and see me sometime soon.

297
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,322
- I got something to tell you.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,124
[engine starts]

299
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,504
[engine revving]

300
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,881
- [door opens]
- [Doochill chuckles]

301
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,633
You're bowing to the rear end of a car.

302
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,094
What did Petron Harvest say?

303
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,346
They want a guarantee of payment
from our side.

304
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,182
Come on, we can't guarantee that.

305
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,851
- [Kwangmin] What a mess.
- Hop in. I'll give you a ride home.

306
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,102
- [Kim San] Stay in touch.
- Bye.

307
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,228
See you later.

308
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,030
Hey, you did all right.

309
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, was it worth it
spending time with your father, Mr. Choi?

310
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,206
Wow, how childish.

311
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,751
You've got a father in every town, huh?

312
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,586
Not as many
as the nephews you have, Uncle.

313
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,796
Okay.

314
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,631
So what, you've been counting my nephews?

315
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,134
General Choi Hanrim is best left alone.

316
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,178
Why? Because he's your father?

317
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,597
- Will you kill him if he is?
- [chuckles]

318
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,182
You act like I'm a horrible person.

319
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,642
Well, you said it yourself.

320
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,020
I guess so. I guess I did.

321
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,772
But that was just…

322
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,776
That was only in certain circumstances,

323
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,444
for certain reasons,
when there was no other way.

324
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,696
In each time,
didn't you get Cha Taemin to kill them?

325
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,118
I won't kill Hanrim.
I'll strip him of his rank.

326
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,120
Could you do that?

327
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,997
I've spent my whole life
doing that type of thing.

328
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,916
What's the plan?

329
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,421
I plan to go after Pak Jiwook
and use Han Soo as bait.

330
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,841
Then what?

331
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,928
Then Pak Jiwook could be the bait
to get Choi Hanrim, that's what.

332
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,639
[newsperson] Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

333
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,684
Kang Seongmin's ambition behind his push
for the Local Government Act amendment

334
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,768
[newsperson] Extra, extra!

335
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,937
[Doochill] <i>There will be an article
about the Local Government Act</i>

336
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>in tomorrow's paper.</i>

337
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,983
<i>Choi Minkyu will start hassling
Kang Seongmin,</i>

338
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,776
<i>trying to rush the election.</i>

339
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,029
I think the assemblymen
who are against the bill leaked it.

340
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,574
[Minkyu] <i>How is it you still haven't
taken control of the party?</i>

341
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,576
I need this bill passed now!

342
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,662
- We still have time to get control.
- There's no more time left. Get on it!

343
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,788
<i>If we don't have the numbers…</i>

344
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,999
then forge the votes we need.

345
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,792
Get it done now!

346
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,169
- [call ends]
- [knocks on door]

347
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,295
[door opens]

348
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,216
What'd he say?

349
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
He said to get the bill passed now.

350
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,554
Right now, huh?

351
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,556
Can we do that?

352
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,936
National Assembly

353
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,939
[assemblyman 1] This is just…
such a blatant abuse of power.

354
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,443
[assemblyman 2] Why would you get
government workers involved in elections?

355
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,777
Because they're needed.

356
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,239
We simply can't agree
to such a ridiculous proposal.

357
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,741
It's just out of the question.

358
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,285
Hey, this is all for the president.

359
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,120
You say it's for the president's sake?

360
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,747
It's clearly for Kang Seongmin's sake.

361

00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,839
[Jiwook clears throat]

363
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,304
I spent over 20 years of my life
serving in the police force…

364
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,390
and I realized…

365
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,272
everyone has got
skeletons in their closest.

366
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,149
And…

367
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
if you look hard enough,

368
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,199
you'll be shocked…
[gasps]

369
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,493
…of what you'd find in there.

370
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,083
I have records of the assets
you keep under different names,

371
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,253
records of the bribes from businesses
in your district and documents

372
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,047
regarding your kids
and the schools they got into.

373
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,177
I've got all the dirt, yeah.
Got it from the National Security Bureau.

374
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,306
When we serve Kang Seongmin,
we serve the party itself.

375
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,850
And of course, the president, yeah?

376
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,395
[chuckles]

377
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,939
Kang Seongmin in the Sineui Alliance?

378
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,024
Are you insane, huh?

379
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:22,030
Each of you could be brought down
in a second, you idiots!

380

[Jiwook sighs]

383
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,021
[sighs]
So, I've summoned all those assemblymen,

384
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,230
the ones who ran away.

385
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,775
- Well done.
- By tomorrow evening,

386
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,111
we could have up to a 180.

387

of the Local Government Act amendment

Oh,

390
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,787
and those articles
that keep getting published…

391
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,376
I think that Samsik
is leaking information.

392
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,464
[Jiwook] Who else could get
those documents from Cha Taemin?

393
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,258
[Seongmin] <i>The Sineui Alliance ones
that were on the paper?</i>

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,719
<i>Let's just focus
on the Local Government Act.</i>

395
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,430
I'm suspicious of that Samsik guy.

396
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,058
I had someone follow that kid.

397
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,144
[Jiwook] <i>Kim San, Choo Intae's son-in-law.</i>

00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,693
They even met with An Yosub.

401
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,905
[Jiwook clicks tongue]
You can't trust that guy, Samsik.

402
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,491
Where does Kim work?

403
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,951
[Jiwook] He was
at the National Reconstruction Bureau.

404
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,912
[Kim San] Sir, I need to speak with you.

405
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,083
This man looks familiar.

406
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,168
[Minkyu] Didn't you read today's paper?

407
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,714
Oh, I remember. I've seen him before.

408

409
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,605
What do you think?

410
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,981
Should I keep digging?

[telephone rings]

412
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,118
Hello?

413
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,245
Yes, he's here.

414
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,705
The call's for you, sir.

415
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,300
- This is Kang Seongmin.
- Assemblyman.

416
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,095
Ah, good, you're there.

417
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,974
Well, I've got something
to pass along to you. It's pretty urgent.

418
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,477
Ah, what should I do?
I make I could meet you there, I suppose.

419
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,814
- All right. I'll wait here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

420
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,903
Who was that?

421
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,698
Take good care of the assemblymen
who come back to the city.

422
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,199
Hey, who was on the phone?

423
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,785
Was it Samsik?

424
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,746
- That piece of shit.
- I'll take care of it myself.

425
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,458
You know what Samsik does, right?

426
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,710
Do you know
what Samsik is up to right now?

427
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,339
I said I'll take care of it.

428
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,133
Now go.

What are you doing?
Get the car started, kid.

435
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,248
- [driver] Yes, sir.
- [Jiwook] Watch it!

437
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
Here.

Résumé:
Kim San

439
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,807
So, An Yosub is…

440
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,060
is replacing me with Kim San?

441
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,773
[sighs]
Right, well, uh… it's absurd, you know.

442
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,858
This caught me off guard.

443
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,611
So, An Yosub
is still suspicious of me then?

444
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,613
[sighs]

445
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,785
Do you think that perhaps getting close
to Kim San would be useful here?

446
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,414
Just in case. That way,
if things get out of hand, I mean, I can…

447
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,709
you know, I can take certain actions.

448
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,173
Thank you.

449
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,342
Not at all. I feel like…

450
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,219
Well, isn't that what my role is?

451
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,516
Even if everyone in the world told me
I should not trust Uncle Samsik,

452
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,561
I'd still put my trust in you.

453
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,066
Then work on the Local Government Act.
You have to get it passed.

454
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,028
Yes, we need it passed
before 11 p.m. tomorrow.

455
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll make sure those opposed
stay completely out of your way.

[Doochill] Oh, be careful.

457
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,168
Uncle Samsik always got me out of trouble.

458
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,590
I'll work twice as hard
to make up for Yoon Palbong too.

459
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,425
Uh, have a good night.

460
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,802
Wait.
[grunts]

461
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,888
I need to relieve myself first.
You go ahead.

462
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,390
No, no, let me walk with you.

463
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,517
No, just go. Just go ahead.

464
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,775
Well done, sir.

465
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,154
Tell Han Soo to make sure
the guys are ready.

00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,453
You mean go up against Kang Seongmin?

526
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,914
Just as I thought, you catch on quickly.

527
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,958
We need him to get it passed.

528
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,043
His reputation
can't be changed with the Liberals.

529
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
That's it.
I have nothing else to teach you now.

530
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,089
And I will get in his way

531
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,925
and be thought of
as a champion for democracy, right?

[line ringing]

538
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,140
Yeah. Are the Liberal Party members
on their way?

539
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,725
[manager] <i>Yes, sir. I have confirmed</i>

540
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,060
<i>with the ones coming back
from the smaller towns.</i>

541
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,562
All right.

542
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,316
[Sun] Of course. Yes, okay.

543
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,574
I have gathered
10 of the strongest assemblymen.

544
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,035
One of them is even a former wrestler.

545
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,829
All right, I call you.
Just have them ready.

546
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,289
Oh, all right.

547
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,625
You think 10 is going to be enough?

548
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,627
The other side probably has over 100.

549
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,922
Sir, listen.
There's nothing to worry about.

550
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,840
It'll be fine.

551

[♪ suspenseful music continues playing]

552
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,276
All right, use that to block the door.

553
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,202
- Let's go inside.
- In there?

[dog barking in distance]

555
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,303
Two more rice wines.

556

Thank you for making time, huh?

563
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,171
I'm actually very curious about

564
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,716
the National Reconstruction Plan details.

565
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,718
If you're offering to explain it
to us independents,

566

- we would be very grateful.

[assemblyman 1]
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

569
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,017
- [assemblyman 1 chuckles]
- [assemblyman 2] Great to meet you.

570
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,769
- [Sun] Go ahead. Take a seat.
- [assemblyman 1] Thank you.

572
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,355
Oh, no!

573
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,441
There's an important document
that I forgot.

574
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,694
- I'll start the presentation then.
- All right, all right. I'll be right back.

575

- [Sun] Huh?

578
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,333
Uh… I seem to have forgotten something.

- [assemblyman] Sir, you're here.

Ah!

582
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,552
[Sun] You came. Oh, good to see you.
[chuckles]

583
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,262
We can stay here, relax, have some tea

584
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,056
before we go to the National Assembly,
all right?

585
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,850
- That'd be nice.
- Oh, well. It's nothing too serious.

586
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,143
I just want to see you all

587
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,438
somewhere, uh, more quiet.
[laughs]

588
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,981
- [Sun] Oh, assemblyman Kim!
- [line ringing]

589
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,655
We partner with companies
who can transfer technology.

590

Within five years,

591
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,493
we project up to a million dollars
in exports.

592
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,455
He seems to be taking a while.

593
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,539
You're right.

594
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

595

- [assemblyman 2] We should hurry.

Assemblyman Lee Chungwon, are you here?

604
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,207
- [Chungwon] Yes, I'm here.
- [member] Ah, there you are, right.

605
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,252
Yes, sir.

606
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,295
What did he say? Come now?

607
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,588
Stand by for a moment.

608
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,673
Gosh…

609
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,800
Look at the time already.

610
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,137
Goodness, why is it taking so long?

611
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,055
Well then, bring me some whiskey.

612
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,141
[sighs]
He told me no drinks for you.

613
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,143
Who did? Samsik?

614
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,062
Hey, I'll deal with him.
Bring the whiskey over.

615

- Come on, don't be like that.

- [Kyungju] Oh, I'm here.
- [member] Oh, right, yes.

Welcome, Assemblyman Moon.

- [assemblyman 1] Hey, you. Get us out!

620

- Please get back down.
- [assemblyman 2] What are you doing?

Time to head home. You can't stay, right?

627
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,764
The Liberal Party is out there
trying to steal the election.

628

- Are you serious?
- What for?

629
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,643
The Local Government Act.

630
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,061
We need to block them now!

631
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,523
How can 4 people block 100?
It's not like we're Admiral Yi Sunsin.

632
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,150
[assemblyman 1] That's abuse of power!

633
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,776
This is a fraudulent vote!

We can't stop these guys.

638

We need to call the Democratic Party.

[Sun] Hurry. Come on, let's get moving.
Go. Let's go!

648

Ah! You're supposed to be
at the National Assembly!

649
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,580
You can't even stand up.

650
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,666
You thought this was a time
to have a little whiskey?

651
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,750
- You crazy old man!
- I'm going! I'm going!

652
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,835
What if Kim San ends up getting hurt
because of this?

653
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,128
Get out! Hurry up!

654

to the Local Government Act.

- How dare you try to steal the vote?

Yeah? Well, you're no assemblyman.

[Kim San chuckles]

694
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,880
[spits]

695
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,717
[Kim San exhales deeply, breathes sharply]

696
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,555
What's all this? What happened?
Who did this to your handsome face?

697
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,599
Who else would it be?

698
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,018
Kang Seongmin of course.

699
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,357
You did very well.

700
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,984
I got it.

701
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,280
You're not seriously worried about Kang,
are you?

702
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,700
Of course not.

703
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,496
[breathes deeply]

704
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,500
[Hyunseok] The rushed passing
of the Local Government Act…

705
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,044
I see you were very involved in it.

706
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,842
So, should we discuss the stolen election
of March 15th now?

707
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,928
Can we at least have a smoke first?

708
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,781
