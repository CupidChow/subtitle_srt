Cha Taemin has stolen the ballot boxes…

[Hyunseok] Why didn't you notify

You just watched them

I didn't think
stealing the ballot boxes would…

167
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,266
would really affect
the outcome of the election.

168
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,686
Why would he do that?

169
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,355
I bet… I bet he'll give
the story to the press.

170
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,440
If the press gets wind of this,
it'll cause a riot.

he's repositioned troops

Hanmin did that on his own?

Yes. He's gonna make a move.
I have a feeling.

That's not true. It's completely absurd.

00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,674
He was the one suggesting
we stage a coup if the…

180
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,844
if the Democratic Party
ever lost the election.

181
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,096
[♪ ominous music playing]

182
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,975
[Hanmin] Field grade officers
are incredibly dissatisfied.

183
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,102
This is not something
anyone can shut down.

184
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,937
[sighs]

185
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,565
Doesn't matter
if it's politics or the military,

186
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,483
all the people in power are idiots.

187
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,528
And General Jang?

188
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,490
Jang Doosik's an opportunist. Hmm?

189
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,033
He'll be fine on his own.

190
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,243
All we're doing is using him.

191
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,204
[Hanmin] San.

192
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,333
I intend

193
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,502
to make a new world for you.

195
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:40,259
Just convince General Choi
and the Albright Foundation for me. Yeah?

196
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,012
[Hanmin] Okay?

197
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,096
[chuckles softly]

198
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,853
[Hanmin] The commanders
who are already committed

199
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,438
are not gonna back down easily.

200
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,358
What about General Choi?

201
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,404
General Choi has not completely
lost interest in this, but he…

202
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,283
he's concerned
that if the Democrats win the election

203
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,827
then it won't be justified.

204
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,912
That's what I'm saying.

205
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,081
Justification's crucial with these things.

206
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,168
Yes, but sir, we make the justification.

207
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,045
General.

208
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,298
Are you satisfied
commanding the Capital Defense Unit?

209
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,179
General Choi possesses none of the, uh…
the courage to do great things.

210
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,974
General, you just say the word.

211
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,935
We're determined…

212
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,063
to make you the country's next president.

You think I believed those guys?

I know exactly
what those brats think of me.

219
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,345

Hanmin would say such things.

That's a load of shit.

All I did was do what Kim San told me to.

223
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,063
He said we gotta convince Jang,

224
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,148
because he needed Capital Defense
on our side.

[inhales sharply]

226
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,155

Right, sir, we do.

228

Get him to the bunker, all right?

Let's try to convince him.

230

We mobilize the troops if it doesn't work.

Yes.

Kang Seongmin the Prime Minister.

Is there even a chance for reform?

360
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,981
I'm not sure to be honest.

361
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,900
[Kichul]
Parliamentary reform is unfeasible.

362
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,735
I've told my father as much too.

to be Prime Minster after reform,

366
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,581

Well, I was curious about Kim San.

373

Could you be more useful to me
than Kang Seongmin?

374
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,566
[Kichul] It would take forever
to become an assemblyman,

375

and do everything you want.

407
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,536

Yes, he knows about everything.

418
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,740
He's gonna stage a coup soon,
no matter what.

419
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,245
He wants me to convince General Choi.

420
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,664
He'll probably eliminate
everyone after that.

421

00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,022
An infringement upon democracy.

533
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,774
We reject
these fraudulent election results.

534
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,069
We demand a new election
be carried out as soon as possible.

535
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,239
As students, we must continue

536
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,950
to fight to defend democracy.

537
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,745
We must condemn
this blatant act of corruption

538
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,622
until justice is finally served."

539
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,418
The president had
a landslide victory in the election.

540
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:09,088
Protests broke out all over the place
over the election fraud.

541
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,009
General Choi was forced
to examine it closely.

542
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,093
[Hanrim] I see.

543
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,149
People are protesting the election.

544
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,151
This is happening
everywhere in the country.

545
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,652
Let's give it more time.

546
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,447
General Choi,
the protests are not a problem for us.

547
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,742
These protests justify our delay.

548
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,453
Go to your unit.

549
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,871
General, but…

550
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,730
There was intense backlash
from the fraudulent election.

551
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,150
And it just provided
more justification for staging a coup.

552
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,947
Jeong Hanmin threw an incredible fit.

553
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,450
Said he'd prepared all of this,

554
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,661
just to have General Choi ruin it.

555
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,914
He was on the second floor of Taepyeongga

556
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,333
screaming his head off
at the top of his lungs.

557
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,378
Everyone there,
everyone downstairs could hear it.

558
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,799
[Hanmin thumping on table]
General, please…

559
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,301
Please take the lead, General!

560
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,054
Lower your voice.

561
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,723
The Capital Defense Unit
is more than sufficient.

562
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,185
General Choi Hanrim,
he won't be able to pull this off. No!

563
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,104
The guy just doesn't have a plan.

564
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,023
- Jeong Hanmin.
- General Jang!

565
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,109
I told you, that's enough.

566
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,194
Sir, listen to me,

567
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,405
you've gotta make up your mind.

568
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,868
It's a mess 'cause of the election.

569
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,537
Don't go doing something rash.

570
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,123
[Hanmin] General Jang.

571
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,793
Sir, you've gotta make a decision now!
Sir, listen to me!

572
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,962
[frustrated groan]

573
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,048
Jeez.

574
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,344
So many leftovers for someone
who loves Chinese food.

575
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,054
[sighs]
Uncle Samsik.

576
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,268
Why are you in such an incredible rage
right now?

577
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,938
Pathetic fucking generals…
We should kill them all.

578
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,276
Our Lieutenant Colonel Jeong Hanmin.

579
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,487
He has a burning fire in his soul.

580
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,990
Yeah.

581
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,701
I wanna set everything I see on fire.

582
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,372
Be careful.

583
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,627
It could be you who burns to death
in that fire of yours.

584
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,089
We'll stage the coup by ourselves.

585
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,635
We don't need Jang Doosik,
that sad excuse for a general!

586
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,720
We could use the field grade officers,

587
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,306
wipe out all these incompetent generals
with our own coup!

588
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,683

Yes, go ahead.

592
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,575
Captain.

593
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,335
[Sooil] This is Captain Lee.

594
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,256
Understood, sir.

595
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,176
[handset rattling]

596
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,803
[Hanmin] What is it?

597
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,098
What?

598
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,226
Do… do… do they want me dead?

[grunts, breathing heavily]

602
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,320
- Just call… call Samsik, okay?
- Arms up.

603
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,822
Ask Samsik about this.

604
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,241
The Punishment of Corruption Act.
The coup d'état!

605
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,702
They're the ones who planned it all!

606
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,869
Why should I die?

607
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,746
- Sit still!
- Ask Samsik about it.

608
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,708
Get Samsik in here! Call Samsik, please!

609
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,751
Get Samsik!

610

[Hanmin whimpers]
Samsik! Get Samsik!

611

It wasn't me!

The Punishment of Corruption Act.

They're the ones who were doing it all!

Why should I die?

615
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,726

Samsik will explain things!

Where's Samsik?

624

Ask Samsik about it. Jang Doosik!

Something has gone wrong, San.

I tried to explain,
but nobody's listening.

San, can you tell them? Huh?

643

There's been a huge mistake.
