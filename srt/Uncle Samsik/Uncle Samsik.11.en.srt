Stealing ballot boxes is dangerous.

177
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,465
- Don't do it.

178
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,384
It's fine as long as we're discreet.

179
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,386
Listen, you have nothing
to lose here, Minister.

180
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,555
If the Liberals win,
we introduce a parliamentary system.

181
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,558
And if the Democrats win, you get
your National Reconstruction Bureau.

Is that why you came here?

184
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,111
I think General Choi Hanrim

185
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,780
is in contact
with commanders of other units.

186
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,201
And you don't know where he is?

187
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,041
We said no secrets.
I thought we were on the same page.

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,754
Hanmin is meeting the other officers

She said An Kichul wanted to meet.

Rachael?

194
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,768
What should I do?

195
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,729
Should I take the meeting?

We'll take control of Gyeongmudae,

If we block the streets,
it will take half a day.

263

it's on General Choi's orders.

was all Samsik's idea.

The Capital Defense can block roads

if they do, our mission will be a success.

In 12 hours, it will be done.

will have already been deployed.

00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,708
Kim San set everything up
from the very beginning.

352
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,128
Who would think
to exploit General Choi like that?

353
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,463
He's the only one.

354
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,549
Fuck! This is why we need
to turn the world upside down.

355
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,301
Hanmin.

356
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,473
Don't talk about it, make it happen.

357
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,892
[sighs]
Yeah, then what?

358
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,394
Will you join me?

359
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,188
That depends on what you do.

360
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,149
From the beginning, those bastards…

361
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,444
were always planning to betray us.

362
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,322
- From the beginning.
- [sighs]

363
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,783
They'd always planned to use General Choi.

364
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,245
That's quite the story you got.
You should have been a writer, huh?

365
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,914
Jeong Hanmin is a real motivated man,

366
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,041
but I can't see him acting by himself.

367
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,253
Who's the brains behind this?

368
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,589
Kim San was always against the coup.

369
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,554
I believe anybody can change their mind.

370
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,807
[Doosik] Kim San is the one
who planned this coup d'état.

371
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,102
Kim San, his greed got the better of him.

372
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,186
That man is not innocent.

373
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,355
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

374
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,902
I'm telling you right now, I can save you.

375
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,613
[Doosik] Samsik…

376
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,492
everything I'm saying is true.
[chuckles]

377
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,248
General Jang Doosik was appointed
Commander of Capital Defense.

378
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,333
[Doosik chuckles]

379
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,254
Lieutenant Colonel Jeong Hanmin,
Capital Defense Unit.

380
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,507
They decided to promote me two ranks,
to Lieutenant Colonel.

381
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,761
- Do your best.
- Commander, thank you.

382
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,848
I was named
Deputy Commander of Capital Defense.

383
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,976
[Doosik]
We've been rewarded for our efforts.

384
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,644
Jeong Hanmin and myself.

385
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,774
Who is the person
who didn't stand to gain anything?

386
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,068
It's Kim San, isn't it?

387
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,321
Who do you think
went to the Albright Foundation

388
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,073
and suggested General Choi?

389
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,453
[♪ suspenseful music continues playing]

390
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,751
Hello, thank you for meeting us.

391
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,628
I'm Rachael Jeong
of the Albright Foundation.

392
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,837
Oh, nice to meet you.

393
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,673
- Is General Choi here?
- Yes, he's waiting for you upstairs.

394
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,758
Shall we?

395
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,970
Whose idea do you think it was
to use Choi Hanrim?

396
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,765
Rachael.

397
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,476
Samsik can't know about you…

398
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,604
about you meeting General Doosik today.

399
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,440
He trusts me, I have to tell him.

400
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,609
It's the only way.

401
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,195
Albright…

402
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,575
Who benefits from having Choi Hanrim
dragged into it?

403
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,160
You can choose me,

404
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,122
and the Albright Foundation is yours.

405
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,293
Welcome, sir. I'm An Kichul.

406
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,045
[Kim San] I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Kim San.

407
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,840
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

408
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
Please sit.

409
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,220
[door creaks, closes]

410
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,348
Résumé: Choi Hanrim

411
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,355
[exhales deeply]

412
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,443
Is parliamentary reform possible?

413
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,195
Personally, I don't think it is.

414
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,114
I don't care
if it's a parliamentary system

415
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,323
or a presidential one.

416
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,285
All that I really want
is to make South Korea a wealthy nation.

417
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,246
I share your thoughts on the matter.

418
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,958
Then do you think General Choi Hanrim
is a worthwhile investment for us?

419
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,376
Take Cheongwoo's capital,

420
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,336
the Albright Foundation's network,

421
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,797
and add to that
General Choi's leadership and reputation,

422
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,758
why wouldn't he be good for us?

423
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,554
What about Uncle Samsik's plans?

424
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,599
[breathes deeply]

425
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,728
[chuckles]

426
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,022
Who would take a dirt road

427
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,108
when you could just take the freeway?

428
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,154
Sounds good.

429
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,115
Really?
[scoffs]

430
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,366
How interesting.

431
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,205
Who benefits from having Choi Hanrim
dragged into it?

432
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,334
All right,
so An Kichul stole our plans in the end.

433
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,336
And Jang Doosik betrayed us all.

434
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,296
What more is there to say?

435
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,759
Even then…

436
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,138
I never agreed with the coup d'état.

437
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,809
[♪ dramatic music playing]

438
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,041
[knocks on door]

439
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,628
Ah, you're here.

440
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,926
Are you startled?

441
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,135
Why…
[clears throat]

442
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,514
What are you doing here, General?

443
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,848
I brought him here.

444
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,183
I asked him to.

445
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,478
[Rachael] Petron Harvest is going to send

446
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,147
a secondary investigation team
to the Philippines.

447
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,315
So we've run out of time.

448
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,861
There's a chance that everything
we've been working toward will disappear.

449
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,782
That's why we've come
to a kind of agreement on this issue.

450
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,954
Lieutenant Colonel Jeong
has already enlisted

451
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,789
the commanders of key units.

452
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,167
55th Howitzer Regiment,
3rd Marine Regiment,

453
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,669
and 12th Airborne Brigade.

454
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,589
55th Howitzer Regiment,
3rd Marine Regiment,

455
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,090
12th Airborne Brigade.

456
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,551
You've been busy going around

457
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,845
abusing General Choi's name.

458
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,015
It was thanks to you

459
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,642
that I heard about the coup.

460
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,147
[Sooil] Thank you.

461
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,399
Jeong Hanmin.

462
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,444
I was against the coup d'état
until the very end.

463
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,903
If the Democratic Party won the election--

464
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,780
[Hyunseok] Would they still win
after Samsik stole the ballots?

465
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,241
The Democratic Party
was set to win the election!

466
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,535
Why would I stage a coup d'état?

467
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,079
- [♪ tense music playing]
- [sighs]

468
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,501
It's time for you and your generation
to lead our country.

469
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,130
And I'm willing to be a stepping stone.

470
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,007
You're someone I can trust.

471
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,594
- Kim San, I really need your help.
- General.

472
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,264
The Democratic Party will win
this election no matter what.

473
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,058
And then you'll be reinstated.

474
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,019
We'll establish the Reconstruction Bureau.

475
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,939
There's no need for us
to stage a coup d'état.

476
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,027
You shouldn't stand by

477
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,904
and let them deceive you.

478

[♪ tense music continues playing]

479
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,534
Jeong Hanmin told a different story.

480
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,912
General Choi was first…

481
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,623
brought up at the US Army club.

482
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,335
The day the military reform declaration
was issued.

483
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,337
The declaration I wrote.

484
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,880
Yes.

485
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,674
We first discussed him that day.

486
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,677
- [Kwangmin] Hey.
- [Hanmin] Hey, Harrison.

487
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,929
Did you hear?

488
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,014
It's a mess out there.

489
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,349
What's the matter?

490
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,227
Oh, the younger officers
issued a declaration.

491
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,478
[Hanmin] About what?

492
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,605
See for yourself.

493
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,651
[sighs]

494
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,991
"We condemn all factions, corruption,

495
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,536
and political activities
within the military.

496
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,207
We will discipline all military personnel
involved in fraudulent elections.

497
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,751
We will enforce punishments
on generals involved in corruption.

498
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,504
We demand new reform within the military."

499
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,755
[Hanmin] Did you see this?

500
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,424
- No, show me.
- [Hanmin] Here.

501
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,176
[Harrison] Do you know who Choi Hanrim is?

502
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,012
He's the general of the First Infantry.

503
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:48,518
I hear the military are planning a coup
with him as their leader.

504
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,521
What will you do
if General Choi stages a coup?

505
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,652
What can I do, huh?

506
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,071
What? You wouldn't join him?

507
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,450
- What?
- There's no one like him in South Korea.

508
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,911
Whether he stages a coup or doesn't…

509
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,874
he's going to do what's right.

510
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,500
[♪ tense music playing]

511
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,086
Kim San said that General Choi
was unrivaled in Korea

512
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,088
and that we should join the coup with him

513
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,965
Is that really what Hanmin said?

514
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,343
Yes.

515
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,641
That was just an emotional response.

516
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,521
I've never tried to seize power
or steal anyone else's position.

517
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,359
My only goal was to establish
the National Reconstruction Bureau.

A new commander?

522
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,128
General Choi Hanrim is highly regarded
within the military.

523
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,672
He's also very close
with the US Army Commander.

527
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,069
We need to keep an eye on him.
All of us do.

528
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,404
We can bribe the National Assembly…

529
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,533
not the military.

530
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,121
So you think it's difficult,
but not impossible?

[Doochill] <i>That day, An Kichul

He just fell asleep.

536
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,822
[Kichul]
He was in critical condition last night.

537
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,408
[Doochill] I see.
He's going to pull through.

538
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,413
Do you think I'll do well?

539
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,874
Huh?

540
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,710
What… Ah, of course.

541
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,756
To be honest, I'm a little scared.

542
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,552
Scared that I'll ruin everything
my father has achieved.

543
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,139
Well, I'll assist you where I can.

544
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,477
His influence over the Federation
has been too great.

545
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,690
[Doochill] Once we reform the system,
that'll be over.

Is parliamentary reform possible?

548

Yes.

549
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,251
[Yosub] Don't do…

551

[Yosub] Reform…

557
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,194

558
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,529
and Samsik.

559
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,282

576
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,606
Not bad.

577
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,026
Well, it seems like everywhere we go,

- you seem to be the talk of the town.
- Yes, I know. I feel uneasy.

00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,872
Actually, Mr. Kim.

583
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,834

Yes, I am.

Good evening, sir.

594
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,666
Thank you for being here.

595
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,835
Thank you for having me.

596

Capital Defense Unit, General Min Soochul.

597
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,132
My name is Kim San.

598
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,134
General Choi Hanrim was my idea.

599
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,053
[Kim San] What?

600
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,097
I'm the one that chose you too.

601
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,147
I think South Korea lacks the capacity
to become a democracy right now.

602
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,567
That's why we need an incredible leader.

603
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,362
That's the dream I've had
since I came to Korea.

604
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,117
To make a great leader for us.

605
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,629
Samsik can't know about you…

606
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,925
about you meeting General Doosik today.

607
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,887
Let me deal with that.

608
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,599
[Doochill] <i>And then,

don't you?

613
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,900
No, I don't know where he is.

614
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,903
I'll believe you.

615
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,655
Rachael came to see me earlier.

616
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,365

619
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,829
Should I take the meeting?

[Doochill] <i>Kim San told me everything.</i>

622
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,799
Who would An Kichul even know
in the military to plan a coup with?

623
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,093
Just think about it.

624
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,472
The military, politicians, Albright.

625
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,808
They all have one thing in common.

[Doosik] <i>We didn't know it at the time.</i>

631
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,865
Kim San is sticking right by his side.

632
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,659
Yeah, of course he is.
That's why we're here tonight.

[Kim San] How did it go?

636
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,878
I found a place we can keep
the general safe.

637
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,255
Kim San. What are you doing down here?

638
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,341
I'm here to escort you from here, sir.
Follow me.

00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
Shall we?

640
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,344
- Sure.
- Yes.

641
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,935
Why are you so protective of him?

642
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,901
I think it's time to head back.
[exhales sharply]

643

Don't you think it was San
who took advantage of Hanmin?

644
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,578
I can tell just by looking at him.

645
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,581
The Minister doesn't use other people.

646
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,292
Not like I do.

Our dear Minister is a pure soul.

His dreams are all he thinks about.

649
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,385
So don't you think
he would go after his dreams

650
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,470

Yes, I believe so.

Who had the initial plan
to manipulate General Choi Hanrim?

Exactly!

Did you remove General Choi

Yes, because I couldn't stand

I told you not to trust
anything Wooseok said.
