00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,767

[Kim San] <i>Why did you introduce him

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,814

8

- Per my father's wishes,

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,571
all of us have to clear out right now.

12
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,156

13

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,327
You see?
I told you that nothing would happen.

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,537
We don't know that yet.

16

Tell me now!

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,706
No, don't!

18
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,625

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,343
And he burned it?

[Seongmin]
<i>I was part of the Sineui Alliance.</i>

24

00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,315

- No, wait! Just wait!

29

Give me a chance.

30
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,609
You've got one chance.

31
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,277
- [Taemin] I have my eye on you.
- [breathing shakily]

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,696
Kang Seongmin will now try to pass
the Local Govenment Act

33
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,281

40

[Kim San] And I will get in his way

41

as a champion for democracy, right?

42

[Doochill] <i>I plan to go after Pak Jiwook

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,376
- [cafe owner] Welcome.
- [Yeonchul] Hello. Yes, over here, hurry.

170
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,753
- Hello, Mister Yoo.
- [Yeonchul] Hello.

171
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,129
- Introduce yourself.
- Yes.

172
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,297
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good.

173
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,466
I'm Kim Kwangmin,
CEO of Sanae Corporation.

174
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,178
He's not just young, he's a child.

175
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,139
[Yeonchul chuckles]
Yes, you're right, he looks young.

176
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,892
- Well, feel free to open the discussion.
- [Han Soo] Right.

177
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,144
In the process of exporting
the raw materials,

178
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,147
we agreed to receive payment
in the form of flour,

179
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,607
as per the exporter's request.

180
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,027
But we… want it transferred
at the official exchange rate,

181
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,820
- so we wanted to meet with you--
- What?

182
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,824
The raw materials exporter
has requested to receive it--

183
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,954
Christ, with the official exchange rate,
your profits will increase fivefold.

184
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,416
Ah, yes, you're right,
so we'll give you 20% of the profit,

185
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,794
- and build a bridge. Mm-hmm.
- We'll build a bridge in your district.

186
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,462
- A bridge?
- [both] Yes, sir.

187
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,466
- No, you could do that?
- Yes, of course, I can.

188
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,718
We'll give you whatever you want,
I promise you, sir.

189
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,346
[Han Soo] Yes, sir.

190
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,976
Why don't you put it
in the trunk, quietly?

191
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,143
[Han Soo] Yes, sir.

192
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,398
Yeah, yeah, see you.

193
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,485
What?

194
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,988
Why are you blocking my way?

195
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,823
[prosecutor] We're here
from the Prosecutor's Office, sir.

196
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,366
Prosecutor?

197
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,827
[scoffs]

198
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,455
How dare a low-life prosecutor

199
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,041
block the path of an assemblyman?

200
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,837
[prosecutor] Get him.

201
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,381
- Hold him tight. Grab him.
- Let go, you fuckers!

202
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,174
- Let go, assholes!
- [prosecutor] Let's go!

203
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,053
Did Assemblyman Pak approach you first,
requesting campaign funds?

204
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,306
Yes, he said he needed money.

205
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,558
Mister Pak said that himself?

206
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,018
Uh-huh.

207
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,478
So you're acknowledging the allegations?

208
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,023
Sorry, what's that mean?

209
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,983
Did you bribe him?

210
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,526
I bribed him. Yes.

211
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
Simple as that.

212
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,654
[chuckles]

213
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,156
That's right, I bribed him.

214
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,661
[Inwoo] Hmm.

215
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,331
I don't think Pak will get away with it.

216
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,082
This morning's witnesses conceded.

217
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,126
Is Kim Kwangmin a witness in this?

218
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,503
Do you know who that is?

219
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,756
Kim San's old friend.

220
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
[Inwoo] Here he comes now.

221
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,597
[reporter 1] Sir, do you acknowledge
the bribery charges brought against you?

222
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,890
[reporter 2]
What do you have to say to these charges?

223
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,934
[reporter 3] Sir, can you answer
to the allegations of bribery?

224
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,020
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [♪ tense music playing]

225
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,400
- Democratic Party!
- [crowd clamoring]

226
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,904
[crowd chanting]
Choo Intae! Choo Intae! Choo Intae!

227
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,832
So that's him then?

228
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,542
[Inwoo] Mm-hmm.

229
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,003
That was not Kim Kwangmin just now.

230
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,883
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

231
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,646
[sighs]

232
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,949
[whispers]
They switched a witness.

233
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,158
Can you go inform everyone who's inside?

234
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,077
- Really? Switched a witness?
- Yeah.

235
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,995
So go on inside
and make sure that they know.

236
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,085
[♪ suspenseful music continues playing]

237
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,338
[whispers]
You need to see this.

238
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,548
[assemblyman 1 clears throat]

239
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,557
Wait, has a witness been switched?
Do you know?

240
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,225
- [assemblyman 2] What does that say?
- Take a look.

241
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,561
- Something's going on.
- [scoffs]

242
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,105
What is this?
The witness lied on the stand?

243
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,773
- So where is he right now?
- [door opens]

244
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,858
Hold on.

245
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,278
- [♪ tense music playing]
- [camera shutters clicking]

246
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,032
- [assemblyman 2] All right, witness.
- Yes?

247
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,537
Are you currently a member
of the Dongdaemun criminal organization?

248
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes.

249
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,249
- Did you give a false testimony?
- Yes.

250
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,625
[scoffs]

251
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,129
Are you telling us that you agree
to officially retract your testimony?

252
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,589
Yes.

253
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,466
[assemblyman 2] Is it true
that you provided political funds

254
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,050
to Assemblyman Pak Jiwook?

255
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,719
Yes, that's something I did.

256
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,471
It was under my boss' order, yes.

257
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,139
Yoon Palbong. You know Yoon Palbong?

258
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,308
The Sineui Alliance, they killed him.

259
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,936
[assemblyman 2] So you're saying
that you provided Assemblyman Pak Jiwook

260
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,147
with political funds
on Yoon Palbong's orders?

261
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,231
Yes, that's right.

262
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,108
[assemblyman 2] What was the reason?

263
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,612
I don't know. I'm a grunt,
I do what I'm told. One moment.

264
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,947
[scoffs]
Oh, boy.

265
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,991
You just did it on his orders?

266
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,410
I have to do what he tells me to do.

267
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,788
[assemblyman 2] We have one more question.

268
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,790
Did you meet Mister Pak

269
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,459
through the CEO
of Daemyeon Construction Yoo Yeonchul?

270
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,628
Who is that?

271
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,631
[slams on table]
What'd you just say? What are you pulling?

272
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,299
- [Han Soo] Hey, don't yell at me!
- You piece of shit!

273
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,675
- [Jiwook] Who told you to do this?
- [Han Soo] What, fucker?

274
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,302
Why's he shouting here?

275
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,390
Yoon Palbong, my boss,
instructed me to win over Mister Pak.

276
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,309
He even gave me money to bribe him.

277
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,477
Right, we get that.

278
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,187
If Yoon Palbong did this, why?

279
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,897
- I'm not sure. Not sure why.
- [assemblyman 2] Why did he do it?

280
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,607
I don't know why! It was an order.

281
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,234
If…

282
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,945
if the boss gives a subordinate an order,
he follows it.

283
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,571
[whispers]
Something's off about this.

284
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,573
Why?

285
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,783
[Han Soo] I told you. I don't know.

286
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,701
It was me who introduced
Yoon Palbong to Father.

287
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,036
[Han Soo] I said it. I do it, that's it.

288
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,204
It's nice to meet you.

289
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,498
Oh, and I'm Yoon Palbong.

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,168
[Inwoo] <i>You knew Yoon Palbong?</i>

291
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,881
Wait here for a minute.

292
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,467
[Inwoo] Hey, where are you…
[sighs]

293
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,900
[staff] How can I help you?

294
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,652
What is your business here?

295
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,915
Pak Jiwook, Kim Kwangmin,
how are they related?

296
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,586
And Yoon Palbong? The Dongdaemun thug?

297
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,005
I know him, yes.

298
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,758
Kim Kwangmin, he brought Palbong
to the Innovation Party.

299
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,471
Kwangmin, he came
and approached me deliberately.

300
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,891
And Palbong was shot
when he was with my father.

301
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,225
Does this mean that…

302
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,522
Does this have anything to do
with my father?

303
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,732
[Kim San sighs]

304
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,693
When did you see Kwangmin last?

305
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,653
I just saw him yesterday.

306
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,071
Let's not do this right here.

307
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,158
We should talk outside.

308
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,258
[door closes]

309
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,721
[Kim San]
I'm not quite sure where to start.

310
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,975
Pak Jiwook manipulated evidence
during the Japanese occupation.

311
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,561
He framed a lot of people.

312
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,980
Mister Choo Intae
was a victim of that too.

313
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,651
So because Pak Jiwook did those things,

314
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,612
you believe it's okay
to do the same thing to him?

315
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,572
That's not what I'm saying.

316
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,075
Then why did a Dongdaemun thug
join the Innovation Party?

317
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,204
To join the National Assembly,
I would guess.

318
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,665
Who arranged all this?

319
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,293
I'm sorry,
but I'm not able to help you there.

320
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,630
You know who it was though?

321
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,343
[soft sigh]

322
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,514
Someone…

323
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,811
wants to get rid of
Yoon Palbong and Pak Jiwook.

324
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,355
That's all I know.

325
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,108
I'm not aware of anything beyond that.

326
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,571
Can I believe you?

327
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,908
Yes.

328
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,661
If you mess with my father,

329
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,455
I will stop at nothing.

330
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,291
[♪ tense music playing]

331
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,589
- [Jiwook] What do you think you're doing?
- [security guard] Mister Pak! Sir.

332
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,841
- Hey!
- Let go of me.

333
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,884
Hey, let's talk, huh?

334
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,637
- [member] The reporters will hear you.
- Yeah? Well, I don't give a shit.

335
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,181
- [Jiwook] Hey, Kang Seongmin.
- Were you won over by Yoon Palbong?

336
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,349
What?

337
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,477
I wonder who was giving
Yoon Palbong his orders.

338
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,771
You're really suspicious of me right now?

339
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,649
All will be revealed, I assume,
after the hearing.

340
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,570
Hey, Kang Seongmin.

341
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,947
Why are you doing this to me?

342
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,118
[Jiwook grunts]

343
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,746
Why did you do what you did to me?

344
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,289
What the hell did I do?

345
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,623
You asshole.

346
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,130
[whispers]
The Sineui Alliance Code.

347
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,008
You said you burned it.

348
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,428
Turns out you didn't.

349
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,267
[Seongmin breathes deeply]

350
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,778
You should've kept it locked away
in a safe.

351
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,698
Why the hell would you drive around
with it in the trunk of your car?

352
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,575
- [door opens]
- [hurried footsteps approaching]

353
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,874
- [reporter 1] Assemblyman Kang.
- [reporter 2] Sir!

354
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:09,922
[reporters clamoring]

355
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,926
[manager] Hello. Welcome.

356
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,844
Hello.

357
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,055
You can get it done today, is that right?

358
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,851
Well, I won't know for sure
until I see the item.

359
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,270
It must be done
by the end of the day. Here.

360
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,523
We'll double this amount,

361
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,274
if you finish today that is.

362
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,198
Well, I bet I can if I get a move on it.

363
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,324
- [chuckles]
- Shall we?

364
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,575
- Sure.
- This way.

365
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,670
- Here.
- Right.

366
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,381
The Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct
Kang Seongmin

367
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,675
Wait. "Sineui Alliance…"

368
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,176
Uh, what's this?

369
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,512
Well, there's no need
to read it thoroughly.

370
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,056
How long to make an exact copy of it?

371
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,016
Uh… I don't know.

372
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,895
Uh, can I… can I have
until midnight tonight?

373
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,355
Why the long pause there?

374
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,693
Can't you just draw this bit and this bit
and this bit and do it like that?

375
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,362
Uh, that's not really possible…

376
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,198
I can't do it all at once.

377
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,993
Please keep today's work a secret.

378
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,829
You do it in three hours,
we'll give you more.

379
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,205
- Uh, more?
- Yes.

380
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,375
[nervous chuckle]

381
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,712
It keeps coming.

382
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,338
Uh…

383
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,094
[Doochill] Who?

384
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,388
[sighs]
Choo Yeojin?

385
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,765
Wait, you met with Choo Yeojin again?

386
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,977
[Kim San]
<i>Was Mister Choo Intae somehow involved?</i>

387
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,188
Ah, I'm a little busy,
so let's talk later.

388
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,647
Why didn't you say anything?

389
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,902
And I'm busy too, you stay on the phone.

390
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,363
Well, just… just refrain
from meeting with Choo Yeojin.

391
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,324
Can't you do that? Just stop seeing her.

392
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,743
I'm not seeing her.
She came to see me saying…

393
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,371
if her father was involved,
she'd stop at nothing.

394
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,082
Fine. I'll deal with it.
I'll make the appropriate arrangements.

395
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,292
What arrangements?

396
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,253
I'm going to your office.

397
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,009
[sighs]

398
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,594
- Is that the campaign schedule out?
- Yes.

399
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,972
Ah, Chairman Kim,
we're also getting a lot of requests

400
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,057
for speaking engagements.

401
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,350
I appreciate your hard work.

402
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,897
[Doochill]
Can you tell the difference? Huh?

403
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,233
- [manager] No.
- Which is the real one?

404
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,569
[surprised grunts]

405
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,447
[Doochill] Why don't you learn to knock?
Come on.

406
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,949
What are you doing?

407
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,868
Right. This is to bleed Kang Seongmin dry.

408
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,954
Which one's real? Just wait.

409
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,830
Is this the one?

410
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,040
Was this the one on the left?

411
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,000
Which one is real, the left or right one?

412
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,252
Left one. It's the left one.

413
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,544
[Doochill] The left one.

414
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,629
[sighs]

415
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,632
This is the real one.

416
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,428
[breathes deeply]

417
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,430
You suit looks very nice.

418
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,932
[Kim San] Let's talk for a minute.

419
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,275
I haven't seen this one.

420
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,734
Where's Kwangmin right now?

421
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,654
He's probably at the National Assembly.

422
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,366
Did Kwangmin deliberately approach Yeojin
and introduce Yoon Palbong to her?

423
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,243
What is it now?

424
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,661
Answer my question.

425
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,330
Yeah.

426
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,000
[♪ light suspenseful music playing]

427
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,211
[reporter 1] Yeah, we can ask him now.
Here he comes.

428
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,714
[reporter 2] Sir, do you have anything
to say before you go in?

429
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,133
Please say a few words.

430
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,010
[reporters clamoring]

431
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,512
Do you have a final statement
before you go in, sir?

432
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,473
[door opens]

433
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,852
[reporters clamoring]

434
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,062
Where'd the new suit come from?

435
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,272
Don't change the subject.

436
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,732
They've got good taste, whoever it is.

437
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,608
Did you also use Kwangmin?

438
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,319
Why'd you do that to Mister Choo Intae?

439
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,654
All you need is General Choi
to leave the military.

440
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,072
Are you concerned about Choo Yeojin?

441
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
That is not what we are discussing.

442
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,785
Just tell me who bought you this suit.

443
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,995
Answer my question.

444
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,330
Was it Rachael?

445
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,664
The woman is all show.

446
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,207
You're not answering.

447
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,668
Is she pushing you to stage a coup?

448
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,171
Do you want to stage one?

449
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,173
I don't.

450
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,509
We can take care of Choo Intae
along with Choi Hanrim easily,

451
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,969
under the charges of espionage

452
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,847
for receiving
Workers' Party Directive No. 29.

453
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,141
Why didn't you say anything?

454
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,851
[Doochill]
It just came up out of the blue.

455
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,311
Did Seongmin put you up to it?

456
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,812
Yes.

457
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,522
Doesn't that worry you a little?

458
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,650
[♪ tense music playing]

459
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
[assemblyman 1]
Sanae Corporation received payment

460
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,494
for raw materials in the form of flour.

461
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,913
You earned an illegal profit
when it was transferred

462
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,373
at the official exchange rate.

463
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,292
I thought transferring
at the official exchange rate

464
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,377
was strange as well.

465
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,172
[assemblyman 2] Did you ever make
the request directly to Mister Pak Jiwook?

466
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,218
I've only heard him mentioned
through a military officer.

467
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,552
A military officer?

468
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,221
Which officer was that?

469
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,347
[assemblyman 1 clears throat]

470
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,308
Captain Kim Inho, Capital Defense Unit.

471
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,395
And why exactly were you meeting
with military officers?

472
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,313
I work with an army supply business.

473
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,608
[assemblyman 1]
What did you hear from them?

474
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,152
[♪ tense music playing]

475
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,988
That Yoon Palbong had…
that he'd made some requests.

476
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,741
[assemblyman 1]
What exactly did he request?

477
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,621
To meet with several high-ranking
generals and politicians.

478
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,334
And would you tell us <i>which</i> politicians?

479
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,631
[Doochill] <i>All you need to do is mention
Pak Jiwook's name at the hearing.</i>

480
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,386
<i>No harm will come
to our dear CEO Kim Kwangmin. Huh?</i>

481
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,974
If an honorable life is what you want,
let go of your greed.

482
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,725
The lye factory, the Cheongwoo Federation,

483
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,602
you want it all, don't you?
You want it all?

484
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,522
People only get to fulfill
25% of their desires.

485
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,400
It's impossible to fulfill 80 or 90%.

486
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,778
Everyone gets the same 25,
so how do you change that?

487
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,823
You need to increase your desires
by 30, 40, 50…

488
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,283
Do you have zero ambition?

489

[chuckles]

490
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,496
And that's when I heard…

491
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,790
the officer mentioned Assemblyman Pak.

492
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,293
- Bullshit! That is complete bullshit! Hey!
- [assemblyman 1] I see…

Hey, who are you?

494
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,255
Samsik put you up to this, didn't he? Huh?

- You bastard.

Jeez, come on.

- Excuse me.

[indistinct chatter]

504
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,209
[assemblyman 1]
You're currently being investigated by

505
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,085
the Counter Intelligence Corps, correct?

506
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,339
- Yes.
- What's the nature of the investigation?

507
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,510
It's regarding
Workers' Party Directive No. 29.

508
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,887
Uh, what is that?

509
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,682

00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,103
to win over
high-ranking Southern officers.

512
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,564
[crowd murmuring]

513
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,239
Wait. Why is a Dongdaemun thug

514
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,950
involved in North Korean
espionage operations in the South?

515
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,204
Yoon Palbong was receiving orders
from the North is what I heard.

516
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,414
[murmuring continues]

517
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,666
Yoon Palbong?

518
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,376
Who the Sineui Alliance killed?

519
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,919
Yes.

520
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,046
[Inho] I heard he received his orders

521
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,590
through shortwave broadcasts
from North Korea.

522
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,469
Then was able to distribute keys
to decipher the codes in the broadcast.

523
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,346
Distribute to who?

524
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,601
I heard he relayed it…

525
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,104
to Pak Wonil,
the Captain of Capital Defense.

526
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,523
Some care packages just came in.

527
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,149
[Soochul] Care packages?

528
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,610
There's an importer that supplies goods
to Logistics Command.

529
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,196
I ordered extras
because I wanted to bring them here.

530
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,576
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

531
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,995
I've already made alliances
within the Capital Defense Unit,

532
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,746
<i>and Hong Youngki has made his moves</i>

533
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,332
<i>with the Workers' Party Directive No. 29.</i>

534
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,334
[Hanmin] You asked about
getting a hold of a book, right?

535
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,877
Oh, can you get it?

536
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,879
I can have it shipped from Japan.

537
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,047
Wow, thank you.

538
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,175
Are you a fan of Mister Choo Intae?

539
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,182
Assemblyman, there's a sure way to win.

540
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,686
What is it?

541
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,188
The late Choo Intae.

542
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,318
How do I use a dead person?

543
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,946
[Doochill]
<i>You can use him because he's dead.</i>

544
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,324
[crowd murmuring]

545
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,701
The path of coexistence

[♪ ominous music playing]

547

[Inwoo sighs]

548
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,503
What is it?

549
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,632
They're gonna make my father a target.

550
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,762
[insects chirping]

551
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,519
Is Samsik somehow…
connected to Choo Intae's assassination?

552
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,104
No, he's not.

553
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,815
It was all an accident.

554
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,319
So Choo Intae's death,
it just happened to be an accident?

555
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,072
You said Pak Jiwook was used as bait.

556
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,282
Didn't you know about all of this?

557
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,079
You really wanna get General Choi
using Pak Jiwook as bait?

558
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,288
Yeah.

559
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,208
That's the way things work in this world.

560
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,919
[Hyunseok]
Why did you hide General Choi Hanrim away?

561
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,214
You wanted to use him
behind Samsik's back.

562
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,550
<i>You planned everything with Jeong Hanmin</i>

563
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,679
<i>and confirmed General Choi Hanrim's
hiding spot ahead of time, didn't you?</i>

564
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,681
[Buddhist] Hello.

565
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,474
Welcome.

566
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,032
[Kim San] How'd it go?

567
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,493
I found a place
we can keep the general safe.

568
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,370
Nice job, Hanmin.

569
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,831
There's another exit here.

570
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,666
I'll show it to you. We'll meet there.

571
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,294
[Hanmin] Attention!

572
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,383
[♪ suspenseful drumming music playing]

573
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,981
On election day, the president will be
at the villa in Jinhae.

574
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,234
We expect his security detail
to be around 20 people,

575
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:02,490
and nearby, the 122nd Battalion
will be waiting with around 500 troops.

576
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,454
March 15th, the day of the election,

577
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,873
is the greatest chance we've got.

578
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,795
Prepare to sacrifice your life
for South Korea!

579
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,263
[Hanmin] We've got 30 troops
from Army Headquarters,

580
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,307
1,000 from Logistics Command,

581
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,601
500 from the Howitzer Regiment,

582
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,853
and 1,000 from the 31st Division.

583
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,273
We'll take the villa in Jinhae
and south of Chungcheong.

584
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,569
Capital Defense and the 3rd Marines
will monitor main roads into the capital.

585
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,613
We will seize control of the following.

586
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,948
The Bank of Korea, media stations,

587
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,034
as well as our five major cities.

588
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,620
Under presidential order,
we'll declare martial law.

598
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,527
We should all go back
to our units for now.

00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,529
I guess we should.

Return to your unit.

You can't go back to your unit.

What?

605
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,544
If you go back, you'll be arrested.

606
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,381
Sir, I'll take you to a secure place.

Oh, Kim San? What are you doing down here?

- Sure.
- Yes.

00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,282
Where's General Choi?

614
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,075

[Doosik] Mm-hmm.

627

How do you suppose that…
the general caught on?

628
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,365
You think
someone smuggled him outta there?

629
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,161
Do you have any idea who's behind this?

630

[Hyunseok] Tell me, why did you
sneak General Choi Hanrim away?

You're sure you weren't interested
in staging a coup then?

We still don't have confirmation
on General Choi's whereabouts.

No, I couldn't reach him at all.

637
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,228
You didn't notice anything suspicious?

638
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,023
Was I supposed to notice
anything suspicious?

into our office like this!

and <i>Peaceful Unification</i>

651
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,636
were used to decipher secret broadcasts
by the North Korean regime.

Collectively referred to
as the Workers' Party Directive No. 29.

Resident spy Choo Intae's operation

and military generals.

We believe he may have established
the Innovation Party

656

[Hanmin] You'll have to be here

00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,869
We're looking into it.

673
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,080
So were you planning to bring me here…

675
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,501
Yes, sir, that's right.

Was there a reason?

677

Choi Minkyu wants to eliminate you,

678
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,759
and then use you in the election.

679
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,388
Home Affairs informed us of this.

Choi Minkyu…

681
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,147
That's right. It's certainly effective.

682
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,982
Public opinion has definitely shifted.

684
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,487
it will be a close call.

00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,073
We could really turn the tables here.

686
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,200
[Minkyu] <i>I have a good idea.</i>

687
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,493
But I'll come to you.

688
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,329
No, I'll be there soon.

689
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,873
[handset clanks]

690
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,127
It was effective, that's for sure.

691
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,007
The election went from being one-sided
to being a close call.

692
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,428
[Minkyu] How many districts
are strongly leaning Democratic?

693
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,889
[member] It looks like it's around 20.

694
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,891
Approval rating for the opposition
is high.

695
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,602
That's a huge difference.

696
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,482
For these 20 locations,
we can't use any of our normal methods.

697
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,610
So are you saying that we would…
we would need to use force?

698
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,239
I'm saying we steal the ballot boxes.

699
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,201
Minister, we can't.

700
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,870
If we win, we're fine.

701
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,081
It doesn't matter after that.

702
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,625
We'll be in the clear,
but to get there, we have got to win.

703
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,877
We can't steal boxes from 20 districts.

704
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,591
Samsik can manage.

705
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,428
[Minkyu] He's good at things like that.

706
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,186
I'll think about it.

707
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,690
There's no time.
The election's around the corner.

708
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,110
Better call him right now.

709
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,281
- [sharp sigh]
- You want me to call?

00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,758
The Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct
Kang Seongmin

714
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,927
That's it. That's my signature.

715

[sighs]

716
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,024
You've saved me once again, Uncle.

717
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,863
And to think,
I've lost so much sleep over this.

718
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,490
Now you can rest easy.

719
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,584
Can I really become Prime Minister?

720
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,877
Yeah.

721
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,796
You can. We're almost there.

722
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,467
Choi Minkyu made
another ridiculous request.

723
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,469
What now?

724
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,974
I really think this is going too far.

725
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,767
All right, come on. Tell me, what is it?

726
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,270
The opposition is too far ahead
in some districts.

727
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,064
Don't tell me… the ballot boxes?

728
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,945
Too risky?

729
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,406
It's just, uh…

730
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,493
I've stolen a number of different things
in my life before,

731
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,996
but I've never stolen ballot boxes.

732
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,918
Right.

733
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,632
I shouldn't have said anything.
It's a lot.

[Sun]
You don't think it'll flip, do you? Huh?

736
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,477
Well, it's a very close call,

737
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,604
but we've got a definite lead
in many key districts.

738
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,566
See that?
In all the districts Kim San campaigned,

739
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,444
we've got a strong lead, huh?
[laughs]

740
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,612
We won't have to worry about
you being nominated, huh?

741
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,740
All I want
is the National Reconstruction Bureau.

742
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,158
[Sun] Uh-huh.

743
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,660
I told you,
you will definitely get that, all right?

744
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,911
- [laughs]
- [door opens]

745
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,082
- Please, excuse me.
- [Sun] Oh, sure, sure.

746
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,710
So, what are you doing here?

747
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,919
Uh, it's just…

748
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,255
Yeojin has been arrested.

749
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,215
What?

750
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,302
She won't be able to get out.
They think she's an accomplice.

751
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,512

Can you help her?

Ah, you gotta let me know
if you're in here.

756
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,010
I just did.
So, what are you so focused on reading?

757
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,554
[Doochill] Oh, it's nothing.

758
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,722
What is it?

759
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,351
[Doochill] Kang Seongmin…

760
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,019
"Electoral districts
led by the Democratic Party"

761
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,938
…he wants me to steal those ballot boxes.

762
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,732
Has the man gone insane?

763
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,485
Choi Minkyu is the one
forcing him to do it.

764
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,821
Are you defending Kang?

765
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,074
Why would I do that?

766
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,869
- You're… you're twisting my words.
- You're gonna steal ballot boxes? Really?

767
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,165
No. No, I won't. I'll just calm him down--

768
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,084
[scoffs]
Do you realize who he is?

769
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,711
There are just some things
I can't explain to you in detail.

770
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,963
[Kim San] Yeah? Well, I can.

771
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,174
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,846
Did Rachael buy you anything
besides your suit?

773
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,389
What exactly are you getting at?

774
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,474
Will you get a lofty position
if you stage a coup?

775
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,060
Am I the reason
you want parliamentary reform?

776
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,145
[Kim San] Huh?

[sighs, clicks tongue]

778
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,409

this late anyway?

00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,334

So you don't want to?

It's not that I don't want to…

00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,109
Is she really
a concern of yours right now?

Yes, I'm worried about her.

789
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,159
If we let her out, she'll continue
to hold us back, you know that.

Fine, forget it.
Don't do it if you don't want to.

I'm not saying I don't want to,

I'm just saying it will be a headache,
