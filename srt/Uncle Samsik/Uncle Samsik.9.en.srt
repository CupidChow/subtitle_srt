do not issue an official apology,

00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,661
The late Choo Intae.

181
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,373
[♪ tense music continues]

182
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,336
How do I use a dead person?

183
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,881
You can use him because he's dead.

184
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,974
Democratic Party

185
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,560
[phone ringing in distance]

186
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,404
Hi, come in.

187
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,449
[Wooseok sighs]

188
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,869
- Did you call on me?
- [democratic member 1] Yes.

189
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,625
Well, I've reviewed the entire draft
of your pledges.

190
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,419
The old faction has also agreed to it.

191
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,338
I may be getting ahead of myself,

192
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,048
but the old and new factions

193
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,884
are reviewing the next parliament.

194
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,386
Assemblyman Sun Wooseok

195
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,430
has suggested creating
a National Reconstruction Bureau.

196
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,391
What do you think?

197
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,394
So not part
of the Ministry of Home Affairs…

198
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,605
Why don't you prepare a proposal

199
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,942
for the National Reconstruction Bureau
ahead of time?

200
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,068
[sighs]

201
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,322
I could not have recommended you
more highly.

202
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,532
Mm.

203
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,080
Quick, come in.

204
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,415
[exhales deeply]

205
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,878
- [sighing deeply, laughing]
- [laughs]

206
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,965
The Reconstruction Project.

207
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,050
Isn't that exactly what you wanted?

208
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,344
- Thank you for your trouble, sir.
- Of course.

209
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,305
If the Reconstruction Bureau
gets established, who knows,

210
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,849
you might become its minister.

211
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,517
I'm not pining for it, but…

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,603
Will the new system work?

213
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,981
I'll ask Uncle Samsik.

214
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,192
No. Why would you discuss it
with that guy, huh?

215
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,653
Don't trust Samsik too much, okay?

216
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,406
He's well known for enticing people
with his words, got it?

217
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,866
Keep this to yourself.

218
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,411
[door opens, closes]

219
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,083
[Kim San] <i>Assemblyman Sun Wooseok
appeared to be giving up</i>

220
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,711
<i>on the parliamentary system.
And for good reason.</i>

221
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,047
<i>The Democratic Party's approvals
were through the roof.</i>

222
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,634
So, did you keep it a secret from Samsik?

223
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,388
No.

224
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,433
Why not?

225
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,101
[Wooseok] Well done.
[laughs]

226
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,854
Oh, I feel so relieved now.

227
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,899
- After you.
- [cafe owner] Welcome!

228
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,028
[Wooseok chortles]

229
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,405
- [Wooseok] Hey, bring us some whiskey.
- [cafe owner] Welcome in.

230
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,991
Sure. Should I bring out
your opened bottle?

231
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,659
- Oh, sure, sure. Just bring us whatever!
- Sounds great.

232
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,869
All right.

233
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,622
- [line ringing]
- [Wooseok] Please, have a seat.

234
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,707
- [democratic member 2] Right over there.
- [Wooseok] Okay, good.

235
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,628
Mr. Sun, you were quite popular
at the rally.

236
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,921
Nah.

237
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,547
It doesn't matter

238
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,175
who appears at campaign rallies
from now on.

239
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,301
- [laughs]
- Yeah, still,

240
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,303
you should arrange
more campaign appearances.

241
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,556
You'll need to exercise if you're going
to manage a busy schedule.

242
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,808
You're right.

243
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,226
The only exercise I get

244
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,480
- is from sex.
- [all chortling]

245
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,108
You can't call it exercise
if you only do two minutes a month.

246
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,487
- Oh, you're here.
- Or was it just one?

247
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,781
[scattered laughter]

248
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,449
Hey, you do get exercise.

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,286
You need to be fit to cozy up
to both sides, after all.

250
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
What are you doing?

251
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,042
[clears throat, laughs nervously]

252
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,169
Come on. Out here. Go.

253
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,756
[door closes]

254
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,299
What's wrong?

255
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,467
Kang Seongmin said something?

256
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,719
- What exactly did you say to Kim San?
- What?

257
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,638
Did you mention the Reconstruction Bureau?

258
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
Did you tempt him
with the position of minister?

259
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,059
Jeez. What'd he do? Did he rat me out?

260
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,645
He came to try to convince me.
He wasn't ratting you out.

261
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,690
That innocent Kim San.
He said he didn't care about status.

262
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,276
He wanted to know why
he should plot with Kang Seongmin.

263
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,027
That's how innocent he is.

264
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,904
And you tried to tempt
such an honest child.

265
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,989
God, you old man!

266
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,575
You're so superficial.
That's why you'll always be third-rate.

267
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,369
It's not like that.
I wasn't really trying to call it quits.

268
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,079
Should I go and tell
all those people in there

269
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,998
- that you're working with Kang Seongmin?
- [mutters]

270
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,749
I'm sorry.
[tuts]

271
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,045
Try and sway Kim San one more time,
and I won't just sit back and watch.

272
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,798
Okay then. I'll be more careful.

273
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,967
The merger will happen as discussed.

274
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,680
Okay, fine.

275
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,850
- Got it!
- [sighs]

276
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,608
[paper rustles]

277

[Hyunseok]
<i>Samsik would've been against establishing</i>

278
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,780
a National Reconstruction Bureau.
Why did you tell him?

279
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,909
Because you don't keep secrets
from each other?

280
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,995
[Hyunseok]
<i>Why did you always tell him everything?</i>

281
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,795
- [democratic member] Great work today.
- [Kim San] Thank you.

282
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
What's the occasion?

283
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,386
Hey, do you have a second?

284
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,558
Can we talk?

285
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,483
[door opens, closes]

286
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,861
I never should've gotten involved
with Palbong and the Innovation Party.

287
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,782
San.

288
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,911
I like being a part of the Federation.

289
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,039
But getting involved in things like this
really scares me.

290
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,584
Do you think you could help me out?

291
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,797
Can you talk to Uncle Samsik?
I can't take any more of this.

292
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,424
Don't worry about it, all right?

293
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,760
I'll talk to Samsik.

294
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,556
I'm sure it'll all be fine, hmm?

295
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,073
Oh, where have you been?

296
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,575
I had dinner plans earlier.

297
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,578
- Yeah, you can go now.
- Thank you.

298
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,790
[Doochill] Oh, wow.

299
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,043
You've made a lot of headway
with this lye factory.

300
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,045
- [door closes]
- Yes, sir.

301
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,381
[sighs]

302
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,594
Are you going to let all your work
just go to waste?

303
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,513
No, sir.

304
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,642
We should try to…

305
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,604
make a prime minister out of our Kim San.

306
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,273
Yes, sir.

307
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,277
Anyone who quits halfway through
is the worst kind of person.

308
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,903
- That's not what I was--
- You say you're his friend,

309
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,072
- yet you hold him back.
- I'm just so afraid right now.

310
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,701
Focus. Stay focused.

311
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,412
Do you really want to get
in our Minister's way?

312
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,747
That's what you want?

313
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,042
If an honorable life is what you want,
let go of your greed.

314
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,836
The lye factory, the Cheongwoo Federation,
you want it all, don't you?

315
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,004
You want it all?

316
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,757
People only get to fulfill
25 percent of their desires.

317
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,593
It's impossible
to fulfill 80 or 90 percent.

318
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,888
Everyone gets the same 25.
So how do you change that?

319
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,974
You need to increase your desires
by 30, 40, 50.

320
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,517
Do you have zero ambition?

321
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,186
[chuckles]

322
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,316
[Hyunseok] You were planning a coup
from the beginning, weren't you?

323
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,651
That's why you told Samsik.

324
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,448
[inhales deeply, exhales]

325
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,033
No.

326
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,910
I am…

327
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,080
planning to stage a coup d'état.

328
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,539
Capital Defense,

329
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,501
the 3rd Marines, the 55th Howitzers,

330
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,669
and a squad of 30 from Army Headquarters.

331
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,088
After the presidential election,

332
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,841
the president will head straight
to his villa in Jinhae.

333
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,053
When he does, we'll take him hostage
and declare martial law.

334
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,847
If we block all the main roads
leading to the capital,

335
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,265
we'll have a good chance of success.

336
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,560
[Hanrim] <i>There's nothing I detest more</i>

337
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,020
<i>than idiots in power.</i>

338
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,690
I never intended to stage a coup,
that wasn't my plan.

339
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,026
And yet you did.

340
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,737
[♪ tense music playing]

341
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,075
If you never trusted me to begin with,

342
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,287
why did you come meet me
at the Banya Hotel?

343
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,004
[water trickles]

344
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,300
Why did you call me there that night?

345
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,264
Don't you think we're cut
from the same cloth?

346
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,977
Sir, good evening.

347
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,562
Hello, thank you for meeting us.

348
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
I'm Rachael Jeong
of the Albright Foundation.

349
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,690
Oh, nice to meet you.

350
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,192
- Is General Choi here?
- Yes, he's waiting for you upstairs.

351
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,277

- [Hoyeon] Right. Okay.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,212
Have you looked into

532
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,672
how regional government
employees have been mobilized?

533
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,549
Yes, although it's worse than that.

534
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,803
We've received intel they've even had
voting rehearsals with many residents.

535
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,554
- Rehearsals?
- Yes.

536
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,224
They rehearsed voting for President Rhee
in small groups.

537
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,686
- Do you know where that is?
- Yes, should I go there right now?

538
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,897
Go. Cover that story, then call me.

539
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,148
[Aemin reporter 1] Yes, sir.

540
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,192
What's next?

541
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,611
Here's a follow-up article
about Kang Seongmin's

542
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,488

543

Links between anarchist group
Sineui Alliance and Kang Seongmin

544
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,119
Drop this one.

545
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,209
- We don't have any solid answers yet.
- No Sineui Alliance stories.

546
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,797
What's next? What'd you find?
Let's hear it.

547
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,881
Right.

548
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
What is it?

549
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,355
Uh…

550
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,609
Reporters who covered the Sineui Alliance
in the past were threatened.

551
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,779
Mr. Lee's just… He's worried about you.

552
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,951
The police report stated that

553
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,745
Yoon Palbong was shot first that day.

554
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,249
The following shot that was fired
was aimed at him as well.

555
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,585
What do you think that means?

556
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,838
I don't know.

557
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,631
The whole thing feels off.

558
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,634
And no one's covering it.

[Inwoo sighing deeply]

560
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,437
I know a detective who investigated
the Sineui Alliance.

561
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,938
I'll see what he knows.

562

00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,206
[Soochul] What's all this?

566
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,542
Some care packages just came in.

567
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,919
Where'd they all come from?

568
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,922
There's an importer that supplies goods
to Logistics Command,

569
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,090
I ordered extras
because I wanted to bring them here.

570
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,231
So let me guess, you still haven't found
those Sineui bastards?

571
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,401
Hey, what's with the silence, you punks?

- Yes, sir.

block the path of an assemblyman?

619
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,876
Get him. Hey…

620
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,336
- Get him.

The addresses are five years old.

641
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,480
It's hard to say if they'd still be there,
but that's what we've got.

642
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,274
I appreciate it.

643
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,567
Why are you looking into it?

Cha Taemin hasn't been caught yet.

They're not even looking for him.

Kang Seongmin's really not part
of the Alliance?

647
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,496
A little while ago,
Mr. Pak Jiwook took these addresses too.

648
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,375
He called his subordinates,
the ones from his old cop days.

649
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,169
Pak Jiwook, huh?

I'm done doing favors for you, all right?

The police are also getting involved
in the election, so things are crazy.

652
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,139
They're involving the entire police force?

653
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,765
I mean, can you prove that?

Assemblyman Pak Jiwook sent his former
cop buddies after the Sineui Alliance.

661
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,758
If they find those men,
they'll probably also find Cha Taemin.

Why would he get involved?

663

00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,896
Sineui Alliance

700
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,524
is an armed group
that fights against injustice.

701
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,860
Sineui Alliance

702
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
opposes the authorities and powers

703
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,407
that oppress our people and our nation.

704
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,371
We strictly condemn philosophies,
people, and groups who monopolize

705
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,789
their control and power.

706
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,209
We will prepare the weapons
and violence to enact this.

707
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,170
Anyone encouraging persecution

708
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,048
will be dealt with by the Sineui Alliance.

709
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,635
- [thudding, banging]
- [people clamoring]

710
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,220
All right. Okay.

711
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,304
Uncle.

712
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,306
- [student screams]
- [Kim San gasps]

713
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,394
It's all right, it's all right.
It won't last long.

714
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,729
Can you let those students go?

715
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,689
Of course.

716
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,069
What will become of Pak Wonil
and Kim Inho?

717
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,487
They've been captured.

718
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,489
They will both confess within the evening.

719
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,782
[sighs]

720
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,159
I have a confession too.

721
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,412
What is it?

722
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,664
Rachael and I slept together.

723
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,417
[laughs]

724
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,794
Is that why you were
in such a good mood before?

725
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,754
I can stop right now if you want me to.

726
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,091
Rachael is like…

727
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,510
pufferfish at a restaurant.

728
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,347
If you extract its poison correctly,
it becomes a delicacy,

729
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,558
but if you don't extract it right…

730
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,561
you could die.

731
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,064
Rachael was the one
who planned the coup d'état.

732
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,232
Yes, I'm aware.

733
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,779
Are you sure
we should still go through with this?

734
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,864
Yes.

735
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,658
All we have to do is stick to the plan.

736
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,118
But what if something goes wrong?

737
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,041
Life itself doesn't always go
according to plan,

738
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,627
and yet that fact is just a part of life.

739
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,337
And whose fault is that?

740
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,047
It's just how things go.

741
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,341
Huh?

742
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,676
[chuckles]

743
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,307
