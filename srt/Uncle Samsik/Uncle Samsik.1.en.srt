- Hey now, people are watching.

- Hey, just give me a straight answer.
- Come on, they're looking.

If what we did in Busan ever comes out,
the three of us are dead.

I won't take it lying down.

Have you gone insane?

182
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,060
I told you to stop bringing up Busan.

183
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,895
I'll stop when Kang Seongmin
keeps his promise.

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,980
And why are you being so impatient?

185
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,360
Listen, he surely has everything handled.
So, don't worry.

186
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,613
- Then why is he avoiding me?
- You keep visiting him uninvited.

187

what we did for Kang Seongmin, okay?

I'll be at the Innovation Party's speech
to show you what I'm made of.

190
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,084

The unemployment rate has sharply
increased due to the collapse of farms,

198

199
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,839
The agricultural surpluses
from USAID are fueling farming debt.

200
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,966
80% of which is in private loans

201
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,759
with annual interest rates of over 6%.

202
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,095
The agricultural economy
is on the brink of collapse.

203
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,389

abundant young workforce…

- The president is asking for you.

206
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,981
[minister] Is he running for reelection?

207
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,691
He said he's not sure yet.

208
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,569
- That's all for today.
- [Kim San] Sir,

209
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,446
- we've barely started the briefing.
- It can wait.

210
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,531
Our team spent all night
putting it together.

211
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,951
[minister] Who is that guy?

212
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,120
[staff] He's manager Kim San
from the National Reconstruction Bureau.

213
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,329
Minister Choi.

214
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,083
The way forward for South Korea…
is laid out here.

215
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,502
Why is he so cocky?

216
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,130
[staff]
Well, he studied economics in the US.

217
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,258
He was also an Albright scholar, sir.

218
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,718
- Albright?
- Yes.

219
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,889
- Were you in the military?
- Yes, that's right.

220
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,975
What's a military academy grad doing here?
You couldn't adjust to it?

221
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,604
Minister Choi,
the president is waiting for you.

222
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,774
Submit the report again.

223
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,859
We've already submitted several.

224
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,695
- But… we'll resubmit it.
- We've been doing that for two years.

225
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,615
Right now, the president's reelection
is our top priority.

226
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,325
Why is that your priority?

227
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,203
Unemployment is through the roof,
agriculture is falling apart,

228
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,830
this country can't do anything
without American aid.

229
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,333
- Is he out of his mind or what?
- Hey, hey.

230
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,918
Minister, please just give us an hour.

231

Yes, I do.

You're making a general
do menial task, huh?

stripped of their badges.

How's that? On what grounds?

270

Well, you're a commie
if Hong Youngki says you're a commie.

He goes and cooks up some evidence
and you're behind bars.

he can get generals dismissed.

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,558
An Kichul
An Yosub's youngest son

345
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,396
Hey, do you know what pizza is?
I doubt it.

346
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,191
They use an oven
that's wider than your bedroom

347
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,110
to bake bread bigger than you are.

348
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,281
And you add meat, cheese, vegetables. Ah…

349
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,699
You take one bite, and…

350
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,410
Ah, you probably
haven't heard of cheese either.

351
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,829
Cheese? Cheese is like bread, right?

352
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,331
Man, oh, man, oh, man!
Look at you, it's so obvious

353
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,791
you're a blue-collar worker.

354
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,295
Yoo Yeonchul, how are you
in the Cheongwoo Federation, huh?

355
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,673
People in America,
they eat that bread daily.

356
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,467
- And most of them don't even eat it all.
- [Yeonchul] Uh-huh.

357
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,511
Once the industrial complex is complete,

358
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,306
then we'll have bread like theirs
and we'll throw out the rest.

359
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,640
[laughs]

360
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,310
There must be some reason
they're suddenly doing this.

361
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,229
Think about all the money
we poured into this!

362
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,193
Isn't that a bit strange that all at once,
all eight are making the same demand?

363
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,113
I'll look into possible motives
right away, sir.

364
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,281
Kang Seongmin.

365
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,159
Bring him right now.

366
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,536
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,876
- Yeah, the day is coming soon.
- [laughs]

368
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,544
- Hey, how'd it go?
- [door closes]

369
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,171
- [sighs]
- What's going on?

370
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,173
[clears throat]
Petron Harvest is now…

371
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,925
making certain demands.

372
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,927
Huh? What demands?

373
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,015
I don't understand all this.
What does it say?

374
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,059
A payment guarantee from the government,

375
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,936
the right to use port facilities,

376
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,687
and the right to audit government grants.

377
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,606
Uh, but why all of a sudden?

378
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,151
Well, these bastards, they just
can't trust the Korean government.

379
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,236
[scoffs]

380
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,528
Unbelievable.

381
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,780
Well then, what's next?

382
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,699
I have no idea.
It could mean it's the end.

383
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,701
Am I…

384
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,287
I'm still a Cheongwoo Federation member,
aren't I?

385
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,040
If there's no Seohae Oil,
then it sounds like the show is over.

386
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,124
[sighs]

387
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,836
[clicks tongue]
Oh.

388
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,298
[engine revs]

389
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,974
Hey, hey, get out, get out, get out.

390
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,187
Kang Seongmin.

391
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,982
Why is it so hard to reach you?

392
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,818
I thought I told you to stay away.

393
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,154
You heard about
the Innovation Party speech today?

394
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,991
We're about to send 25 of our men.

395
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,119
So I'm asking you
to acknowledge what we've done.

396
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,954
Fine.

397
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,914
We'll speak after the election.

398
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,460
The Dongdaemun nomination,

399
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,463
there's a rumor
it's going to some other guy.

400
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,050
Keep your promises
and don't just use people.

401
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,969
Yosub will be there, won't he?

402
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,098
I wonder how he'll react

403
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,226
if he finds out
who killed An Minchul in Busan.

404
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,520
Should I tell him who killed his son?

405
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,315
[♪ tense music playing]

406
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,526
[car door opens]

407
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,031
Kang Seongmin
Liberal Party Assemblyman

408
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,035
[Doochill] We've come all this way
with a single goal in mind.

409
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,037
So we have to think of something fast.

410
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,830
Oh, welcome.

411
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,667
Samsik, a word.

412
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,003
[door opens]

[door closes]

414
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,639
Hey, what's the matter? What's going on?

415
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,893
Yoon Palbong approached me again
just a second ago.

416
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,061
Huh?

417
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,979
That idiot showed up again?

418
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,065
[scoffs]

419
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,150
I thought
I'd gotten through to him earlier.

420
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,781
I will have to teach him a proper lesson
at the Innovation Party speech later.

421
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,741
- Don't you worry about him.
- Kill him.

422
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,993
[♪ foreboding music playing]

423
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,078
Huh?

424
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,208
Kill Yoon Palbong.

425
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,959
Quickly.

426
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,629
I'm so afraid.

427
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,965
I keep seeing An Minchul in my dreams.

428
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,889
Assemblyman, that brat Yoon Palbong,

429
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,309
all he's ever wanted
is a national assembly badge.

430
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,396
- Can't you just give it to him?
- Please kill him.

431
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,439
Do you want to watch me
worry myself to death?

432
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,943
[♪ tense music playing]

433
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,070
Right.

434
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,780
As you wish.

435
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,330
Uncle Samsik,
you're the only one I can count on.

436
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
Please help me get some sleep at night.

437
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,677
[door opens, closes]

438
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,655
The eight partnering companies
sent us these demands all at once.

439
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,865
Why all of a sudden?

440
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,077
They distrust the Korean government.

441
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,705
Why on earth…

442
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,208
did I let you join the national assembly?

443
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,713
If Minchul was still alive right now…

444
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,175
he would be sitting there instead of you.

445
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,637
He would've done well far better than you.

446
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
[Doochill] <i>Kang Seongmin</i>

447
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
has ordered me to kill Yoon Palbong.

448
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,521
Why?

449
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,901
He keeps mentioning what we did
in Busan together. That lunatic.

450
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,614
And how we killed An Yosub's son.

451
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,995
[Yosub] Do you think
the president will run for reelection?

452
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,584
- It's not certain just yet.
- He definitely will.

453
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,213
He even went so far
as to hire those filthy protesters.

454
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,380
I will look into it.

455
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,090
You're always one step behind.

456
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,012
Our industrial complex
is slipping away from us here.

457
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,600
[Doochill] <i>That bastard Kang Seongmin
is another coward.</i>

458
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,355
He's not satisfied
until the people he fears are killed.

459
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,981
He wants you to do it?

460
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,317
I'll be the next one.

461
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,820
Those with power and with money

462
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,699
will do everything they can to stay out
of the mud while wearing their best shoes.

463
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,662
Why do you think
he's asked me to kill Yoon Palbong?

464
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,626
I've known Kang Seongmin a long time
since he was born.

465
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,462
He gets this look

466
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,839
as if he could murder somebody
without batting an eye.

467
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,510
He had it when he told us
to kill An Minchul.

468
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,680
And he had it again just now.

469
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,431
Just wait.

470
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,143
I'm all but certain
that he'll try to kill me next.

471
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,232
Petron Harvest apparently sent
an inspection team to the Philippines.

472
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,858
[Yosub]
They're trying to take our business there?

473
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,819
Are they out of their minds?

474
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,364
They sent an inspection team,
it's not out of the question.

475
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,783
We can't let someone else
reap our rewards.

476
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,746
Choi Minkyu has been dragging his feet
too long and now it's all ruined!

477

I'll meet with Mr. Choi Minkyu, sir.

The preparations are going well?

Well, I'm doing my best,
but I'm not so sure.

Yoon Palbong is sending 25 of his guys

Of course I can.

516
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,184
Han Soo, hey, look,
the police are all retreating.

517
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,103
- [Han Soo] All of them?
- Yeah.

518
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,814
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

519
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,944
[Han Soo breathes deeply]

520
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,992
Yeah, good, we can handle those 25 men.

521
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,327
Yoon Palbong is our prime target.

522
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,789
You better make damn sure
to break that bastard's legs, huh?

523
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,002
[Doochill] <i>There will be a lot of people
attending Choo Intae's speech.</i>

524
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,671
- [camera shutters clicking]
- <i>A lot of politicians.</i>

525
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,966
<i>All kinds of people will be there.</i>

526
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,177
<i>They're all trying to befriend Choo Intae.</i>

527
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,056
<i>He's more popular
than the president right now.</i>

528
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,434
<i>If he runs for office, he's sure to win.</i>

529
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,228
<i>No wonder he's being targeted.</i>

Peaceful reunification
and our nation's path by Choo Intae

Choo Intae!

- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,720
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

540
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,848
[Intae] Thank you.

541
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,641
I am Choo Intae.

542
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,271
A question.
What is the way forward for our country?

543
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,606
The answer,

544
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:04,153
first of all, peaceful unification,
and second of all, peaceful unification.

545
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,866
It is the peaceful coexistence
of South and North Korea.

546
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,117
[audience members] Hear, hear!

547
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,203

[fighting grunts]

552
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,948
What has the current administration

553
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,243
done for the people of South Korea?

554
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,873
[Intae] <i>Nothing. All the president's done
is impoverish our country,</i>

555
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,791
<i>bringing suffering to farmers and workers.</i>

556
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,210

00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,138
[Han Soo] Hey!

559
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,556
Get in there, you fucker.

560
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,601
Good fucking luck.

561
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,855
[banging on door]

562
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,027
The incumbent president

563
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,949
has been putting on a little show
by withdrawing his candidacy.

564
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,702
Who on earth could possibly
fall for his tricks?

565
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,870
[audience member] That's right!

566

<i>Can you stop them on your own?</i>

569
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,879
[Han Soo] <i>Of course.</i>

<i>As long as you give me their turf…</i>

571
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,926
Uncle Samsik.

- [engine starts]
- Let's go.

576
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,356

578
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,196
<i>It is his goal to wage another war</i>

and reach unification with violence!

580
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:17,370
Once again flooding these lands
with the blood of innocent people.

581
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,372
You'll take on 100 each, each of you.

If you go down, take three with you!

[all clamoring]

584
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,589
We cannot wage yet another war
on these lands.

585

Never again, everyone!

You motherfuckers!

Hey, you!

- Hey!
- [audience member] What are you doing?

601
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,065
Call the cops. Huh?

602
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,948
Hey! Call the fucking cops right now.

603
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,151
- [grunts]
- [laughs]

604
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,404
Shit or get off the pot, alright?

605
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,574
[coughs]
I got it done, huh?

606
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,576
Let's go.

607
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,834
Wait a minute,
has Mr. Choo Intae already run away?

608
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,836
[laughter]

609
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,423
That lilly-liver little commie.
Can't handle politics, huh?

610
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,342
- [chuckles]
- [audience member] No, he can't.

611
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,760
Excuse me.

612
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,055
- Are you talking to me?
- Who are you?

613
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,641
That's Pak Jiwook of the Liberal Party.
You should stop.

614
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,476
Ah, calm down, Assemblyman.

615
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,561
Calm down.

616
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,356
Who do you think you are
interrupting an assemblyman?

617
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,066
Mr. Choo Intae is not a commie.

618
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,069
- Apologize right now.
- [Jiwook] What?

619
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,573
He aspires to bring the people
peaceful coexistence and prosperity.

620
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,576
Well, that's precisely
what we call a commie, boy.

621
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,244
[laughter]

622
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,246
Do you have any idea
what kind of man he is?

623
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,831
Do you?

624
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,250
Have you read
<i>Co-prosperity on the Korean Peninsula?</i>

625
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,087
It's a detailed exploration
of the prosperity of a nation.

626
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,756
Do you know it, sir? I bet you don't.

627
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,216
- No, you punk.
- Well…

628
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,512
may I explain it to you?

629
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,223
- Be my guest.
- Thank you, sir.

630
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,978
[Jiwook] Let's hear what he has to say.
[chuckles]

631
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,689
[record scratching]

632
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,649
[♪ light music playing]

633
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,654
This is where I come

634
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,365
when I want to relax, think,
or just be alone.

635
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,078
Feel free to come here, have a drink.

636
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,748
Whenever you need a moment to yourself.

637
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,708
Is this about the Cheongwoo complex?

638
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,960
I can't help you.

639
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,879
The president's opposed to it.

640
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,715
He thinks a planned economy
is something only commies do.

641
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,510
[Kim San] Hello, everyone.

642
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,888
I work at the Reconstruction Bureau.

643
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,099
Prior to this,
I received a doctorate in economics.

644
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,228
I was an Albright scholar
at an American university.

645
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,856
During my time in America,

646
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,652
there was beauty and abundance
everywhere I'd look.

647
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,655
Meanwhile, my countrymen
were stripped bare and starving.

648
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,910
Do you know what pizza is?

649
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,829
Has anyone tried it?

650
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,748
Mr. Pak, have you tried it, sir?

651
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,917
No, I haven't, boy.

652
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,336
[Kim San] During my time abroad,
I lived above a pizza shop

653
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,880
and couldn't afford
a single proper meal a day.

654
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,968
Every day, I smelled pizzas baking.

655
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,428
Every night, it kept me up.

656
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,224
Listen, the economy
matters more than guns.

657
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,144
I saw a country
where no one worried about food,

658
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,397
where you can have
three decent meals every day.

659
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,316
What I envied during my studies abroad

660
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,861
wasn't their fighter jets
or aircraft carriers. It was pi…

661
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,490
it was pizza.

662
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,158
What is the point

663
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,122
of winning a war when the entire nation
is starving to death?

664
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,252
That's why Mr. Choo Intae said

665
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,380
that I should study economics.

666
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,468
[Seongmin] Steel, shipbuilding,
transport, chemical, oil, and textiles.

667
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,846
All the key industries a country needs.

668
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,433
They're each putting their life
on the line for this complex.

669
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,811
If we don't act quickly,
the overseas partners

670
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,022
we'll go do business
with the Philippines and Taiwan.

671
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,442
We can't afford
any further investments in facilities.

672
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,986
We poured everything we have
into this industrial complex.

673
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,863
If we can't secure foreign capital,

674
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,490
all the money we've put down…

675
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,036
it all goes down the drain.

676
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,747
So if the government
were to help us out here…

677
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,165
What?

678
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,335
You'll help us
with the presidential election?

679
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,544
Yes.

680
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,048
The president and Mr. An Yosub
are well into their eighties now.

681
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,843
How much longer do you think
they'll hold on to power?

682
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,308
My time will come soon. After that…

683
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,226
yours could too.

684
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,270
[Minkyu] You understand?

685
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,899
With your wealth and background

686
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,901
and my political power,

687
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,738
imagine what we could do
if we share what we have?

688
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,241
I believe…

689
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,702
we'd be invincible.

690
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,913
Right.

691
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,831
I think so too.

692
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,381
Use this election to your advantage
and take control of the party.

693
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,385
Become the chairman
of the campaign committee.

694
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,720
All I need to do
is speak to the president.

695
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,515
And I could give you

696
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,184
the chance to reign
over the Liberal Party.

697
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,853
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

698
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,188
So…

699
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,359
what are you asking for in return?

700
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,405
Do you have anything…

701
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,949
aside from the Cheongwoo Federation?

702
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,868
[scoffs]

703
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,415
Now take a look.

704
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,294
Seoul and Busan will be connected
by a new expressway

705
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,130
and we'll build
industrial complexes and ports.

706
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,215
Seoul and Incheon could connect too,

707
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,843
and we'd ship our goods
all the way to China.

708
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,178
If the 700 million people in China

709
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,474
each buy one pair of shoes,
we can sell 1.4 billion shoes to them.

710
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,019
Hey, smart-ass.

711
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,440
Why on earth would we sell shoes
to the damn Chinese?

712
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,984
That's the kind of ideal
only a commie would have.

713
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,152
- [audience member 1] Exactly, yeah!
- [audience member 2] That's right!

714
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,736
Don't commies wear shoes too?

715
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,990
[sighs]

716
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,083
The Republic of Korea

717
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,172
can use its young and abundant workforce
to become an industrialized nation.

718
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:14,180
With our peninsular position,
we could become the next center of trade.

719
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,892
That is exactly the kind of nation…

720
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,562
that Mr. Choo Intae dreams of.

721
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,064
[♪ dramatic music playing]

722
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,026
[audience applauding]

723
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,032
[crowd chanting]
Choo Intae! Choo Intae!

724
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,368
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

725
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,371
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

726
