1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,718
It's out of love and respect
that everybody calls me

2
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,221
Samsik, Brother Samsik, Uncle Samsik.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,931
And I just love it.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
Previously on Uncle Samsik

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,892
My nickname, I mean.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,769
[chuckles]

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,521
[Doochill] Once that's in place,

8
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,024
I'll be an official member
of the Cheongwoo Federation.

9
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,608
[Doochill] <i>You understand
what that means, right?</i>

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,278
<i>So I'll be the one
reigning over the nobility.</i>

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,407
Yes. We all will be eating pizza
like the Americans.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,950
Pizza,

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,869
I'm sure that none of you
have heard of it.

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,496
Ah, it's extraordinary.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,458
[staff] <i>He is Manager Kim San
from the National Reconstruction Bureau.</i>

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,793
<i>Well, he studied economics in the US.</i>

17
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>He was also an Albright Scholar, Sir.</i>

18
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,132
Minister Choi.
The way forward for South Korea…

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,301
is laid out here.

20
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,511
You know Yoon Palbong
of the Dongdaemun gang?

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,679
I can give you his turf.

22
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,765
[Doochill] <i>Yoon Palbong is sending
25 of his guys</i>

23
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>to the Innovation Party event</i>

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>so he can cause a scene
and ruin the speech.</i>

25
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,604
[Han Soo]
<i>Yoon Palbong is our prime target.</i>

26
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,356
[Haejun] <i>Better make damn sure
to break that bastard's legs.</i>

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,277
I will have to teach him a proper lesson
at the Innovation Party speech later.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,737
- Don't you worry about him.
- Kill…

29
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,530
Yoon Palbong, quickly.

30
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,615
Huh?

31
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,408
During my time in America,

32
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,412
there was beauty and abundance
everywhere I'd look.

33
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,248
Meanwhile, my countrymen
were stripped bare and starving.

34
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,708
Do you know what pizza is?

35
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,044
[Doochill] <i>You know
what pizza tastes like?</i>

36
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,172
Have you really had it before?

37
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
Seohae Oil, Sail Developments
CEO Pak Doochill

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,800
[Doochill] <i>I can tell just by looking into
someone's eyes,</i>

39
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>whether they'll make it or not.</i>

40
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>You, Manager Kim,</i>

41
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,013
have potential to become president.

42
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,308
Well, at least Minister, for sure.

43
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,894
Yeah, maybe I'll call you Minister.

44
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,687
How long would it take to get it running?

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,774
[Doochill] <i>I've got
a straight answer for you.</i>

46
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>Stop seeing Choo Yeojin.</i>

47
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,322
And if you're Choo Intae's son-in-law,
the dream will never be fulfilled.

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,033
The Reconstruction Bureau
is being shut down.

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,993
[Kim San]
<i>The National Reconstruction Project…</i>

50
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>I'm not gonna give it up.</i>

51
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,371
[Yeojin] <i>Is it true you left
the Ministry of Home Affairs?</i>

52
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,499
Do you think there might be
a position for me in the Innovation Party?

53
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,669
I think The Innovation Party
isn't ready yet.

54
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,963
[Kim San] <i>No matter how hard I try,</i>

55
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,173
<i>there's nothing that I can do.</i>

56
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,384
Effort is meaningless in this world.

57
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,636
Why not flip it upside down?

58
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,680
[Kim San] <i>I have this dream.</i>

59
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,099
<i>There's a version of South Korea</i>

60
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>that I want to create.</i>

61
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,727
Except that's not a real dream.

62
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,148
That's hypocrisy.

63
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,732
[Yeojin] Hypocrisy dressed as a dream.

64
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,944
Then focus only on
what you want from now on!

65
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,279
Focus!

66
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,697
I want to revive it!

67
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,284
I want the National Reconstruction Project
to go forward!

68
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,786
[breathes heavily]

69
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,746
[Kim San] <i>I'll break up with her.</i>

70
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,331
Leave.

71
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,750
[Doochill] <i>In life,</i>

72
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,795
<i>when you gain something,</i>

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>you're bound to lose something else.</i>

74
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,259
I have a great plan for us.

75
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,679
The Cheongwoo Federation will
eventually control the entire country.

76
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,098
A great plan?

77
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,225
The establishment of a parliament.

78
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,188
And we buy off
the entire National Assembly.

79
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,857
Is there really a need
to kill Yoon Palbong right away?

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,859
You'll need him for the next election.

81
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,943
I don't need him.

82
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,486
Give it to Taemin.

83
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,780
[Seongmin] <i>I'm sure he's got
a grudge against Yoon Palbong.</i>

84
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,949
Who does he want dead now?

<i>then you'll head to Osaka.</i>

88
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,081
I have evidence that

89
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,376
Kang Seongmin was an active member
of the Sineui Alliance.

90
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,422
Kang Seongmin has just put out
a hit on a certain Yoon Palbong.

91
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,883

Oh, Haejun!

Fuck!

99
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,112
[Inwoo] Kang Seongmin's father also died
in an explosive accident.

100
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,615
The Sineui Alliance
is known for using explosives.

101
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,034
The police report also states
that Yoon Palbong

102
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,744
was the first one to get shot.

103
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,580
It seems that Choo Intae
wasn't their initial target.

What brings you here at this hour?

115
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,350
You know Cha Taemin
of the Sineui Alliance?

116
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,684
What?

117
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,312
Did you introduce
Yoon Palbong to Kwangmin,

118
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,855
so he could join the Party?

119
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,315
Yes.

120
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,108
And your tip-off
for the Kang Seongmin article?

121
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,319
Yes.

122
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,487
What'd you do that for?

123
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,783
Oh, I'll take my coffee later.

124
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,950
- Yes, sir.
- [Doochill] Thanks.

125
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
Yoon Palbong, uh,

126
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,623
did a lot of Kang Seongmin's
dirty work for him, you understand?

127
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,583
Of course, I was involved in some of it.

128
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,795
Yoon Palbong has betrayed Kang Seongmin.

129
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,005
- [customer] One coffee, please.
- [cafe owner] Yes, sir.

130
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,841
Betrayed him, how?

131
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,885
Listen,

132
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,596
I can't go into those details
at the moment.

133
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,681
[Kim San] You said we had the same dream.

134
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,810
How can that be true
when you have so many secrets?

135
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,521
Well, it's just that
you're better off not knowing--

136
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,772
[Kim San] Mr. Choo Intae…

137
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,818
Did you order his assassination?

138
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,864
Again with that ridiculous imagination.

139
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,241
I broke up with Yeojin.

140
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,535
What exactly did you sacrifice?

141
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,830
You have quite the past, and you do
all these dangerous things in the shadows.

142
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,957
[Kim San] And you say we share a dream?

00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,971
About An Yosub's son, An Minchul?

[sighs softly]

148
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,188
Yoon Palbong and I were the ones
who killed him.

[assemblyman 1] I appreciate

[assemblyman 2] We're thankful
for all that you do.

155
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,241
[assemblyman 1] Hello, Assemblyman Kang.

156
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
Ah, you're here.

157
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,414
You wanted to see me?

158
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,499
I saw the National Security Bureau
yesterday.

159
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,084
Something I heard intrigued me.

160
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,544
What was it?

161
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,045
Regarding Cha Taemin.

162
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,506
Didn't he work for you in the past?

163
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,469
[Minchul] Definitely not as laissez-faire
as they claim to be.

164
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,929
I noticed they only killed off
your political rivals.

165
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,599
Very clever thinking on your end.

166
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,228
Let me use those
Sineui guys when I need 'em too.

167
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,939
Sharing is caring, after all.

168
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,820
An Minchul found out about the Alliance.

169
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,947
[Taemin] Seongmin.

170
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,782
It's time to end this.

171
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
What?

00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,371

173
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,790
We're heading for Osaka.

174
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,044
Uncle Samsik said he would
find jobs for us.

175
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,297
I can't do things like this.

176
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,717

Can you catch Cha Taemin too?

186
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,328
Yeah, I'll find him.
I'll take all my guys with me.

187
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,080
Why don't you just let Taemin leave?

188
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,624
You know very well that this one

189
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,960
is the Sineui Alliance explosives expert.

190
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,670
We can make use of him.

191
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,965
Use his knowledge,
and we can take care of An Minchul.

192
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,181
All right.

193
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,061
Then would Mister Yoon here be able
to do a little more work for us?

194
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,521
Sure, why not? Of course.

195

What can I do for you in return?

196
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,024
[Palbong] I, uh…

197
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,945
You know those badges,
for the National Assembly?

198
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,656
It's always been my dream to wear one.

199
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,034
If you nominate me
for the Dongdaemun seat,

200
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,869
then I will…

201
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,330

Did you think stowing away
like filthy rats

209
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,449
would stop me from catching you?

210
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,704
There is a way to get out alive.

211
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,498
It's simple.

212
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,171
[Palbong] Should we throw you
into the sea?

213
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,965
Or should we work together?

214
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
Huh?!

215
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,637

So Palbong and I ended up killing
Assemblyman An Minchul instead that day.

Palbong couldn't keep
his mouth shut about it

235

so we had no choice but to get rid of him.

236
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,755
Why did you introduce him
to the Innovation Party?

237
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,509
Because he was so obsessed
with getting a National Assembly badge,

238
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,720
I thought getting him
the Innovation Party's nomination

239
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,971
would shut him up.

240
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,265

Mm.

[member 4] What's this all about?

450
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,498
A demonstration like this…

451
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,502
isn't what he wanted.

452
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,298
This is not what my father fought for.

453
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,510
Nor what he believed in.

454
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,304
Violence and chaos

455
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,182
are not what he stood for.

456
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,602
[Yeojin] My father stood for the opposite.

457
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,229
Prosperity for all.

458
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:06,982
Coexistence…

459
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,818

460
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,322
Not for us to all die together.

461
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,242
And our party's future…

462
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,370
must be democratic…

463
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,873

00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,919

All of us

468
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,643
We've got to ensure

469
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,981

479
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,483
Kang Seongmin will now try to pass
the Local Government Act

under everyone's noses.

481
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,945
And when he does, you <i>have</i> to make sure
your presence is known.

482
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,989
You mean go up against Kang Seongmin?

483
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,659
Just as I thought, you catch on quickly.

484
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,077
[Kim San] We need him to get it passed.

485
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,704
His reputation can't be changed
with the Liberals.

486
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,332
That's it, I have nothing else
to teach you now.

487
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,792
[Kim San] And I will get in his way

488
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,419

as a champion for democracy, right?

the parliamentary system

00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,437
- Me?
- Yeah, kid, come on.

531
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,272
It's gotta be hard, following me around.

532
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,816
Why are you here every day?

533
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,610
- I get in trouble if I don't.
- [Doochill] Hand me the lighter.

534
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,364
I heard the police force fired you
for taking bribes.

535
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,534
Yes.

536
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,412
Here. No one will find out.

537
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,123
[Doochill] Take it,
go buy yourself a bowl of <i>gukbap</i>.

538
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,503
You know, you don't have to be
Pak Jiwook's lackey, you idiot.

539
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,838
Do your best.

540
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,055
[Miss Kim] Excuse me?

541
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,391
- Me?
- This bread's for you.

542
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,478
He'll be heading out very soon
to meet Michael Jeong.

543
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,646
He says to report that.

544
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,275
Thank you very much.

545
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,198
[♪ jazz music]

546
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,539
[vocalizing]

547
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
How's Yeojin?

548
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,969
Have you called her?

549
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,346
Got a light?

550
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,351
Are you all right?

551
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,147
[puffs smoke]

552
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,027
- [Inho] You're here early.
- [Hanmin] Can't you ever be on time?

553
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,403
Why are you always late? Huh?

554
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,363
The commander suddenly wanted
some things done.

555
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,449
- Like what?
- [Wonil] Personal things.

556
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,452
Taking care of his plants
and his ceramics.

557
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,871
[Inho] This is what Academy grads
end up doing.

558
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,289
[sighing]

559
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,583
Fuck. This is why we need to
turn the world upside down.

560
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,627
Hanmin.

561
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,257
Don't talk about it, make it happen.

562
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,384
What?

563
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,386
Don't just talk about it.

564
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,139
Do something about it.

565
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,059
[sighing]

566
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,435
Yeah, then what?

567
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,603
Will you join me?

568
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,482
That depends on what you do.

569
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,114
Oh, I'll show you how I change the world.

570
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,784
[Doochill] That's how
you should handle it.

571
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,205
Right.

572
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,749
We have been receiving calls
from all over the place.

573
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,586
The way they're all crying out for money.

574
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,590
Yes, in a matter of moments,
Kang Seongmin will come in here

575
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,800
to beg and plead in remorse--

576
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,468
Why have the withdrawals stopped?

577
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,472
Don't you realize how it affects
my reputation?

578
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,058
Sir, please, the thing is,

579
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,601
it wasn't for a lack of trying…

580
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,894
I told him not to.

581
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,731
Why?

582
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
Because of that ridiculous article?

583
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,945
Was it truly ridiculous?

584
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,701
Would you please excuse us?

585
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,056
What are you doing?

586
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,356
I know that you are suspicious of me.

587
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,402
Yes, I was part of the Sineui Alliance.

588
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,616
I wrote the Sineui Alliance
Code of Conduct.

589
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,701
No…

590
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,912
The Sineui Alliance was created by me.

591
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,667
I was young and foolish and committed
an unforgivable crime.

592
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,835
[Seongmin] I apologize.

593
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,546
[sighs]

594
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,256
But, sir,

595
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,383
I didn't…

596
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:18,598
I was not involved in the death of your…
of Min… Assemblyman An Minchul.

597
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,725
[Seongmin] Please believe me.

598
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,894
Okay?

599
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,314
[breathing shakily]

600
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,234
Minchul was someone I looked up to
like a brother.

601
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,237
Why would I kill someone like that?

602
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,031
Because you were after his position.

603
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
No, sir.

604
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,162
I saw the way you looked at Minchul.

605
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,497
You were envious.

606
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,794
Of course, I was envious.

607
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,338
It's true.

608
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,883
I envied him, and so…

609
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,636
I held him in great esteem.

610
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,389
Minchul's dream, I can…

611
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,975
I can make it happen.

612
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,311
I will.

613
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,563
Please? Just this once.

614
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,566
Give me one more chance, please.

615
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,651
You really

616
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,487
didn't kill my son?

617
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,867
Please, you need to believe me.

618
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,370
Then who killed my son, and why?

619
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,831
Why did they do it?

620
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,332
I'll find that out, I will.

621
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,584
I promise. And I'll tell you.

622
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,879
[Seongmin] Sir.

623
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,966
If the Federation casts me aside,

624
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,385
I have nowhere to go, sir, nowhere.

625
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,971
I'll call you Father.

626
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,097
I will!

627
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,224
You have my unwavering loyalty!

628
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,560
Please. Just this once, help me out!

629
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,895
Just this once. Save me, please.

630
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,523
I need you. Okay?

631
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,444
Choi Minkyu…

632
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,906
promised to give you control,

633
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,367
and to set you up as his successor.

634
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,539
Yes, sir.

635
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
Yes, but…

636
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,919
I have never thought about betraying
the Cheongwoo Federation, I promise.

637
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,130
And how will you prove that?

638
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,965
I'll do what's required of me.

639
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,719
- What's required?
- Yes, whatever it takes!

640
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,889
How about becoming Prime Minister?

641

[♪ ominous music]

642
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
Take control of the Liberal Party

643
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,479
and get 100 people together.

644
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:35,026
Sun Wooseok will bring about
50 from the Democratic Party.

645
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,362
[Yosub] The newly-appointed
and independents of the Assembly

646
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,200
the Cheongwoo Federation supports,
they make up another 20 to 30.

647
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,247
We create a new party
with those 170 seats,

648
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,292
plus you can become the Prime Minister.

649
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,586
How about it?

650
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,172
Can you gather 100 men?

651
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,092
Yes, I can do it.

652
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,471
[Seongmin] I will make it happen.

653
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,931
Yes.

654
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,350
No matter what. I will.

655
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,562
[sighs softly]

656
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,565
You are my son

657
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,652
in Minchul's place.

658
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,280
Thank you, sir.

659
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,246
I mean it. Thank you, sir.

660
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,876
He's probably grasping onto Yosub's hands
and sobbing right about now.

661
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,170
Completely unaware he's taken the bait.

[Professor Hwang] <i>I'm sure Kang Seongmin
would be grateful.</i>

663
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,340
Yes, of course, he would.

664
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,634
He would've never imagined this role.

665
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,888
That kid has been in the palm of my hand
since the day I bottle-fed him.

666
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,682
Hey, why are there so many US soldiers?

667
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,933
[Professor Hwang] <i>US soldiers?</i>

668
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,020
Something doesn't feel right here.

669
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,233
[Inho] I heard it almost became
an all-out riot.

670
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,026
[Wonil] It would have,
if not for Choo Intae's daughter.

671
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,070
Hey. She was his fiancee.

672
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,281
Must've been heartbreaking for you.

673
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,657

- [soldier 2] Hey.

00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,705
- [Kwangmin] Hey.
- [Hanmin] Hey, Harrison.

677
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,957
Did you hear?

678
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,959
It's a mess out there.

679
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,085
What's the matter?

680
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,754
Ah, the younger officers
issued a declaration.

681
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,548
About what?

682
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,466
See it for yourself.

683
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,103
"We condemn all factions, corruption,

684
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,564
and political activities
within the military."

685
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,983
[Hanmin] "We will discipline
all military personnel

686
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,735
involved in fraudulent elections.

687
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,654
We will enforce punishments
on generals involved in corruption.

00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,282
We demand new reform
within the military."

689
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,868
[Captain Lee] "We demand
better treatment of soldiers.

690
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,331
We are young officers who devoted
our youth to serving our country.

00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,376
We young officers have endured
our impoverished realities

with pride as soldiers.

We demand the punishment
of the corrupt generals

who trample on our pride."

695
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,513
Have you seen this declaration?

696
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,557
Yes.

697
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,975
I wrote it.

698
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,020
Oh.

699
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,150
It seems most young officers
are in agreement with this declaration.

700
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,070
[Michael] There's also new intelligence
from the US Army.

701
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,697
[Yosub groaning]

702
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,411
Uh, I will be sure to keep
the military under control.

703
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,163
The Assembly can be bought

704
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,374
but not the military.

705
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,250
The occupation taught us that.

706
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,252
What other intelligence was there?

707
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,757
[Michael] The military looks set to
appoint a new First Operations Commander.

708
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,134
A new commander?

709
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,262
General Choi Hanrim is
highly regarded within the military.

710
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,765
[Michael] He's also very close with
the US Army Commander.

711
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,145
Choi Hanrim?

712
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,274
[Hyunseok] Did you first meet
First Operations Commander Choi Hanrim

713
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,943
at the Albright farewell party?

714
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,736
Yes, I met him there.

715
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,696
Is that when you discussed
the coup d'état?

716
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,161
General Choi Hanrim was the soldier
that I had the utmost admiration for.

717
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,248
[Kim San] <i>He helped me
when I needed it most.</i>

718
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,332
General Choi Hanrim
First Operations Commander

719
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,962
He was just like a father to me.

720
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,968
Our dear Minister has so many
different father figures.

721
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,930
And so many he admires as well.

722
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,183
Unfortunately,

723
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,645
those fathers… are all dead now.

724
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,816
[laughing]

725
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,737
[♪ somber music]

726
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,666
[♪ closing theme music]
