you've deceived us.

What did I do?

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,536
The Sineui Alliance is worthless.

12
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,956
It's a puppet exploited by your ambitions.

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,042
Why should we…

14
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,920
why should we kill people for you?

15
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,965
You shouldn't've made the Sineui Alliance
if you wanted to become an assemblyman.

16
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,311
Is that why you betrayed me?

Taemin. We should forgive him.

19

Our dreams were almost destroyed…

I put a roof over, someone I raised.

21

Exactly.

So please, just let Taemin live.

No matter how hard I try,

there's nothing that I can do.

if we can make it happen naturally?

Letting it happen on its own

a little too much.

he said he would

end things with Choo's daughter,
with Choo Yeojin.

Yes, I will.

180
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,328
I'm heading to the office now.

181
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,790
[Kim San] Are you sure you feel up to it?

182
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,917
Yeah, of course.

183
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,127
All right.

184
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,048
Does this mean you're joining the party?

185
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm thinking about it.

186
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,598
There's really no need to force it.

187
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,021
I'll be in touch.

188
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,737
[Kim San breathes nervously]

189
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,323
How dare you show up here?

190
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,825
I could tell you the same thing.

191
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,244
[sighs]
Why are you here?

192
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,413
All right, how is this, Minister?

193
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,833
You promise me you'll see Yeojin in secret
and I'll recommend you

194
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,919
for the chairman of the Democratic Party's
Economic Policy Committee.

195
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
- In secret?
- Away from prying eyes.

196
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,717
How could I possibly become
chairman of that committee?

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,385
I've told you before, it's nothing.

198
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,846
Look, we've got a great plan here,
Minister, involving you.

199
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,930
So… so what…

200
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,266
what is this great plan of yours?

201
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,475
[Doochill] Well, what do you plan to do?

202
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,477
- End it?
- [Kim San] No.

203
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,937
Date her in secret?

204
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,440
Tell me what this damn great plan is
you keep mentioning.

205
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,024
Now you're changing the subject again.

206
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,360
I think you're great, but I don't like
this side of you, Minister.

207
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,028
I'm changing the subject here?

208
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,697
That's what you're doing.
I hate when you do this.

209
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,783
[Kim San sighs]

210
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,372
[thunder rumbling]

211
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,501
Capital Defense Unit, Secret Bunker

212
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,755
[colonel] How long's it been since you had
any contact with Mister Kim Kwangmin?

213
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,049
You knew that Samsik won him over,
didn't you?

214
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,886
I'm really not sure.

215
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,763
- How about the invite list?
- [staff 1] Here you go.

216
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,557
We were only able to pay
for the print material.

217
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,226
The issue is the campaign vehicle.

218
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,688
[staff 2] At this rate, we won't be able
to keep up with the campaign schedule.

219
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,816
[Yeojin] What brings you here?

220
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,026
Well, I was worried.

221
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,278
Ah, that's really kind.

222
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,362
[staff 2] Yeojin.

223
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,282
They said no bus for us
until we pay off the balance.

224
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,201
What do we do
about our upcoming events though?

225
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,871
Listen, if you need a campaign bus, I…

226
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,082
I know some folks
who'd be interesting in sponsoring.

227
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,751
Should I get them in touch with you?

228
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,012
[buses rumbling]

229
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,518
Miss Yeojin.

230
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,978
Um, where'd you get these buses?

231
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,397
They're buses that US troops discarded.

232
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,107
Oh yeah, they're great, right?

233
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,277
It's nice to meet you.

234
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,738
Oh, and I am Yoon Palbong.

235
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,495
[colonel] That's why
Kim Kwangmin introduced Yoon Palbong

236
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,746
to the Innovation Party.

237
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,040
Didn't you know about that?

238
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,168
I was unaware.

239
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,504
Hey.

240
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,966
I don't like Choo Intae.

241
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,050
I know.

242
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,554
But I still have to do this, don't I?

243
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,638
Yes.

244
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,473
Did you finish the book?

245
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
I almost had an aneurysm reading this,
you jerk.

246
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,062
[breathes nervously]

249
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,283
Father, these are some of San's friends.

250
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,203
Oh, sir… No, I… Sir, I, um…

251
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,080
Would you sign this?

252
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,166
That's done then.
Thank you for your hard work.

253
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,295
I said you shouldn't come here, didn't I?

254
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,089
Hey, hey.
I don't have a lot of time right now.

255
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,674
What if someone sees you in here?

256
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,217
Tell Kang Seongmin

257
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,888
that I am now Choo Intae's
campaign security officer.

258
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,723
Wow.

259
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,017
It's amazing how things work out
when you actually listen.

260
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,727
- [Palbong] Yes.
- And did you hide that book

261
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,811
that I gave you?

262
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,523
[Palbong] <i>Yes, I hid it very well
inside Choo Intae's office.</i>

263
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,192
If Choo goes down,
you'll deserve all the credit.

264
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,362
Can you do me a favor,
and tell Kang that I'm doing a good job?

265
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,990
All right, but why are you worrying
about that, huh?

266
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,951
Thank you.

[♪ mysterious tense music playing]

270
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,206
[Seongmin]
When will you kill Yoon Palbong?

271
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,541
The plan is in motion.

272
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,669
[Seongmin]
And why are these plans taking so long?

273
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,462
What if Minkyu finds out about it?

274
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,715
I wanted to ensure it's done in the safest
and most convincing way possible.

275
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,718
And I am telling you that
it would be safest to kill him quickly!

276
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,099
Seriously, Uncle, who else but you
is willing to listen to my nagging?

277
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,477
- I'll speed up the process.
- [Seongmin] All right.

278
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
Have you met with Cha Taemin?

279
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,694
Not yet.

280
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,824
You mean, you don't want Taemin doing it?

281
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,702
It's not that.

282
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,541
It's just that he's repenting
and keeping a low profile right now, so…

283
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,667
is it necessary?

284
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,878
Taemin tore my heart wide open.

285
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,255
He betrayed me.

286
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,924
During my greatest time of need,
Cha Taemin abandoned me!

287
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,050
He left me!

288
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,637
[Seongmin] If he wants my forgiveness,

289
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,348
tell him that no matter what,

290
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,684
he must do this.

You must resent me a lot.

I do not resent anyone.

298
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,287
If I did, I would've left already.

299
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,708
Yeah. I'm sure you would have.

I swear I didn't betray Kang!

318
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,908
Kang Seongmin's the one who betrayed us!

319
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,536
He's the one who manipulated
the Sineui Alliance!

320
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
You're right, he did.

321
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,291
All right? Of course I know that.

322
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,296
And yet Yoon Palbong deserves to die
for what he did.

There was an opportunity in Busan,

Kang Seongmin wouldn't be

I'll have to stop him,
and end his political career.

He has to be stopped before
he even gets close to being president.

00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,973
[vice minister] We must curb his rise.

355
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,433
And how do we do that?

356
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,730
You people aren't here to write reviews!

357
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,318
And the Local Government Act?

358
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,279
We'll start off by…
by holding a public hearing--

359
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,364
Public hearing? What?

360
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,782
[Minkyu] Do you all have time to waste?

361
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,116
Am I the only one concerned?

362
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,077
Get everyone's help on this.

363
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,537
Everyone. Military, civil servants.

364
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,459
Yes, yes.
I'll find out and get back to you.

365
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,795

366
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,967
- [member] They're all having a field day.
- [door closes]

367
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,344
They need to be threatened.

368
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,180
There's lots of opposition
within the party, sir.

369
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,932
The longer we take,
the more we have to lose.

370
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,184
[Seongmin] Steal it from under their noses
if we have to.

371
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,354
Go and see Assemblyman Pak.

372
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,732
National Assembly

373
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,152
You've seen the export price
Sanae Produce has requested, is that so?

374
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,532
Yes. They've requested flour
as the form of payment.

375
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,076
Flour.

376
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,746
- No objections?
- [assemblymen] No.

377
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,248
[assemblyman 1] All right then.
We'll leave it there.

378
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,459
[assemblyman 2] Well done today.

379
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,585
Jiwook?

380
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,214
[assemblyman 3]
Stop dozing off during meetings.

381
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,884
[yawns]

382
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Boring, isn't it?

383
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,060
All this about imports and payments.

384
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,937
Gosh, it really gives me a headache.

385
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,898
We need to get our Mister Pak
back to doing what he does best.

386
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,571
We need to get
the Local Government Act passed quickly.

387
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,740
Seems to be a lot of people opposed to it.

388
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,910
[member]
And that's exactly why we need your help.

389
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,914
What? Whatever for?

390
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,207
Our time's running out.

391
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,129
[friend 1] Hello.

392
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,380
[friend 2] It's been a while.

393
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,840
- [friend 1] It's been a long time.
- [friend 3] It's good to see you, man.

394
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,216
[friend 4] Let's head inside.

395
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,053
Boss. We're here.

396
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,431
- Hmm.
- [friend 1] How have you been? Good?

397
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,558
[Jiwook] Yeah, yeah. It's been a while.

398
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,101
How have you been spending your time?

399
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,436
[door slides close]

400
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,022
I left the police force
and I started a business for a while

401
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
but gave that up.

402
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,695
You all seem like
you're a little worse off now than before.

403
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,447
We're all barely surviving.

404
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,284
We'll take any job you've got.

405
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,501
[colonel] Why didn't you go
to the Innovation Party

406
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
when Choo Intae had
a high approval rating?

407
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,922
Why'd you take the chairman position

408
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,549
of the Democratic Party
Economic Policy Committee?

409
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,926
Because of Samsik?

410
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,932
[Doochill] Hey, look who it is.

411
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,522
Will you stop coming here
trying to win me over with stuff to eat?

412
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,398
Oh, I bought this for me.

413
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,234
You want some of it?

414
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,194
[sighs]
Why are you here?

415
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,863
Have you ever heard of
Sun Wooseok of the new faction?

416
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,074
[sighs]
Yes. I know who he is.

417
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,952
Right. Well, this Sun Wooseok,
cannot say the word "no" to me.

418
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,036
Why is that?

419
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,664
'Cause the guy has accepted
so many of my bribes.

420
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,748
[chuckles]

421
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,709
Anyway, if you join
the Democrats through Sun,

422
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,086
join their new faction,

423
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,797
I can make you
their Economic Policy Committee chair.

424
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
You'll be in charge of
pledges for the election.

425
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,802
This is the last time I'm coming to ask.
If you don't want it, tell me now.

426
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,227
A couple of radishes, some potatoes,
add some scallions, minced garlic,

427
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,604
some chili powder,
let it simmer and enjoy.

428
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,398
Nothing better on cold nights like these.

429
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,191
- [Kim San] Forget it.
- Please enjoy it.

430
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,404
They're also good grilled.

433
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,914
So, I read through the National
Reconstruction Plan of yours, huh?

434
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,417
You really think you got a shot?

435
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,585
Well, with large-scale loans
and investments--

436
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,587
There are so many in America
willing to invest.

437
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,463
And I personally know
a lot of these people.

438
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,007
They've been calling me about it non-stop.

439
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,425
[Kim San] We must push
for US economic agreement--

440
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,802
Yes, the economic agreement.
You know what that is, don't you?

441
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,929
You really think
I don't know what that is?

442
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,014
I'll explain it.

443
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,974
Oh, yeah. Go ahead, go ahead.

444
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,767
[Kim San] The Korean Government
needs to show interest

445
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,019
in attracting foreign capital.

446
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,272
Foreign capital has zero confidence
in Rhee Seungmin's government.

447
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,649
We need a new economic policy

448
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,444
if America's gonna have any faith in us.

449
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:56,948
Ah, so you're saying we do
what those Liberal Party jerks can't do?

450
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,576
That's it. That's exactly it!

451
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,453
You're finally understanding everything.

453

Oh, but wait.

454
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,500
In our party,
there's Yoon Bohyun's old faction

455
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,336
and Jang Min's new faction.

456
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm aware of that.

457
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,175
We need to make sure that these policies
are initiated by the new faction.

458
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,468
Yes, we've got to.

459
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,764
That way, those of us in the new faction
will support you.

540
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,189
[Doochill] He says he wants to be sure
to kill Yoon Palbong himself.

[Palbong] What did Kang Seongmin say?

546
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,039
[Doochill] I told you to stop coming here.

547
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,666
You told him
about the Innovation Party, right?

548

We can't be seen together ever again.

00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,836

550
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,088
That you did good.

551
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,010
You stay right next to Choo
and really embrace this spy role.

552
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,720
Did he mention having me killed?

553
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
What do you mean?

554
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,598
You're the key
to bringing down Choo Intae.

00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,183
Look at you, Yoon Palbong. Huh?

556
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,978
You helped someone become
an assemblyman and saved his life.

You've got a great mind.

Tell me. It stays between us.

Yoon Palbong has…
just joined the Innovation Party.

00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,207
[Seongmin] His reason?

590
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,252
He thought if he were next to Choo Intae,
he'd be safer.

591
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,503
[Seongmin] That's good.

We can kill Choo Intae while we're at it.

Sir, don't… don't say that.

I'm the one who chooses the target,

I'm joking.

Yeojin,

604
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,061
why does your dad want to become
the president?

605
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,771
Is it good to be president?

606
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,358
Well, he doesn't want to become president
because it's good, that's not it.

607
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,738
He just wants to create a world

608

where you can do or be anything
that you dream of when you grow up.

609

That's why he wants to do it.

He just hears what he wants to hear.

Choo Intae!

Innovation is the only way forward!

I will be with you until the very end!

[crowd cheering]

713
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,265
Please excuse me. Yeojin.

714
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:38,269
[Intae] We will win the election
and make lasting changes.

715
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,521
[indistinct crowd chatter]

716
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,358
- [sighs]
- Why are you here?

717
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,776
Sorry for intruding like this.

718
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,112
Can you please give me a moment?

719
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
We'll do this later.

720
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,120
[♪ somber music playing]

721
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,581
What is it?

722
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,002
I intend to do whatever it takes
to support Mister Choo Intae.

723
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,256
And being with the Democratic Party
won't change that.

724
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,175
Is that what you came here to say?

725
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,760
I admire and support Mister Choo Intae.

726
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,095
So can you go out there

727
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,348
and declare
that you're Choo Intae's son-in-law?

728
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,477
[Yeojin] Can you say
that you support the Innovation Party?

729
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,479
That you're done
with the Democratic Party?

730
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,441
Yes, of course.

731
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,068
Of course.

732
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,945
Yeojin.

733
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,240
I love you very much
and I'm sure you know that.

734
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,038
I have this dream.

735
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,248
What dream is that?

736
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,711
There's a version of South Korea…

737
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,297
that I want to create.

738
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,468
Except that's not a real dream.

739
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,596
That's hypocrisy.

740
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,184
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream.

741
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,270
[crowd cheering indistinctly]

742
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,023
[♪ somber music continues]

743
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,985
[Intae] Let's bring change.

744
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,865

Choo Intae!

745

Yeojin!

752
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,008
Yeojin!

753
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,428
[supporter 2] Why are you doing this?

754
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,513
[Kim San] Yeojin!

755
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,647
Yeojin!

756
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,359
