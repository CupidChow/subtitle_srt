183
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,865
[exhales deeply]
An Kichul, that brat…

184
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,911
I've known him since he was an infant,

185
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,913
but it took me this long
to figure him out.

186
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,086
He's even more of a cunning little snake
than his father was.

187
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,130
[groans]

188
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,550
[Yosub] That one…

189
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,303
he's not like his brothers.

190
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,305
He's young.

191
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,808
He has a gentle disposition.

192
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,227
He'll need your guidance.

193
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,063
[Doochill] <i>Not even his own father
could tell what he was thinking.</i>

194
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,858
[Yosub] Should we just trust Kang Seongmin
and leave it up to him?

195
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,944
No, we can't.

196
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,238
So…

197
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,408
what's the other option?

198
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,576
[Doochill] Well…

199
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,579
I have a great plan for us.

200
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,207
The Cheongwoo Federation will eventually
control the entire country.

201
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,626
[Yosub] So how do we do that?

202
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,755
We plan the establishment of a parliament,

203
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,843
and we buy off
the entire National Assembly.

204
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,637
[Doochill] <i>The whole time
I was going on and on about my plan,</i>

205
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,432
<i>I'm sure he was brutally mocking me
in his head.</i>

206
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,392
Would you please excuse us?

207
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,852
Sure.

208
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,567
[Doochill]
<i>I was thinking up these grand plans</i>

209
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,694
<i>when I couldn't even let go
of Kang Seongmin.</i>

210
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,491
[Seongmin] Minchul's dream, I can…

211
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,161
I can make it happen.

212
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,747
I will. Please.

213
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,831
You really…

214
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,792
didn't kill my son?

215
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,003
[Doochill] <i>Me and Kang Seongmin,</i>

216
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,089
<i>he must have written us both off as fools.</i>

217
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,926
Why did they kill my son?

218
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,511
I'll find that out, I will. I promise.

219
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,013
And I'll tell you.

220
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,807
Sir.

221
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,892
[sighs]

222
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,019
If the Federation casts me aside,

223
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,271
I have nowhere to go, sir, nowhere.

224
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,440
[Doochill] <i>He must have been
secretly laughing at us</i>

225
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,817
<i>groveling pathetically
in front of his father.</i>

226
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,235
You have my unwavering loyalty!

227
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,696
Please, just this once, help me out.

228
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,365
Just this once! Save me, please.

229
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,660
[Yosub] And how will you prove that?

230
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,870
[Seongmin] I'll do what's required of me.

231
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,246
What's required?

232
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,957
- [Seongmin] Yes, whatever it takes!
- [Doochill sighs]

233
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,418
[Doochill] <i>I should have been able
to detect it from the look on his face.</i>

234
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,089
<i>Why didn't I see it at the time?</i>

235
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>Why couldn't I see that</i>

236
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>An Kichul was a far more terrifying man
than Kang Seongmin ever was?</i>

237
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,224
The Development Bank
is giving us a loan to invest

238
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,810
in the industrial complex facilities,
and 30 percent

239
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,937
will be used to fund the campaign.

240
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,272
- [member 1] What? 30 percent?
- [indistinct clamor]

241
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,692
- That's out of the question.
- [member 2] That's utterly ridiculous.

242
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,776
[member 3] We cannot accept that.

243
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,947
Once I've become
the chair of the election campaign,

244
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,782
I will make sure

245
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,952
that our Cheongwoo Federation
takes control of the Liberal Party.

246
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,370
Then we can push for special laws

247
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,330
and see that the industrial complex
is completed.

248
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,873
Lend me your support,

249
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,625
and put your trust in me.

250
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,085
[Yosub] Now applaud!

251
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,256
[Doochill] <i>He stood on the sidelines
watching us and mocking us</i>

252
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>internally the entire time.</i>

253
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,637
Everyone dreams of having absolute power.

254
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,681
But…

255
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,977
if you have the power
to be Prime Minister after reform,

256
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,814
wouldn't you rather become president?

257
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,733
[Doochill] <i>Was Kim San ever a match</i>

258
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,527
<i>for a snake like An Kichul?</i>

259
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,948
If Choi Hanrim becomes our next president,

260
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,161
you can do all of it as soon as next week.

261
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,164
[Doochill] <i>He's so beguiling,
you won't even know you've been tricked.</i>

262
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,417
That's what you want, isn't it?

263
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,502
[Doochill] <i>Kim San…</i>

264
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,672
<i>is no match for someone like that.</i>

265
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,800
You're far better than Kang Seongmin is.

266
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,472
[Doochill] <i>But I'm sure Kichul recognized
Kim San for what he was.</i>

267
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,640
<i>He saw how useful San could be.</i>

268
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
[Doosik sighs]

269
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,148
Uncle Samsik wants to make
Kang Seongmin the Prime Minister.

270
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,067
Is there even a chance for reform?

271
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,985
I'm not sure to be honest.

272
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,820
Parliamentary reform is unfeasible.

273
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,697
I've told my father as much too.

274
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,949
[Doochill]
<i>And that is Kim San's greatest weakness.</i>

275
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,409
Is that what you want?

276
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,078
It's what my father wanted.

277
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,996
I didn't want it.

278
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,999
[Doochill] <i>He has a soft spot
for people who recognize his worth.</i>

279
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,836
So why did you want to meet me today?

280
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,256
Well, I was curious about Kim San.

281
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,637
Could you be more useful to me
than Kang Seongmin?

282
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,100
Why do you want to go through
all this hassle?

283
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,062
If you want to kill me, get it over with.

284
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,315
I'd prefer it that way too.

285
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,784
An Kichul…

286
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,703
Will he keep Kim San alive?

287
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,250
He's asked the Revolutionary Army.

288
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,130
So you've convinced General Choi Hanrim?

289
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,466
Yes.

290
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,803
What made him change his mind?

291
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,264
His mind didn't change.

292
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,641
It was my mind that changed.

293
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,521
The Reconstruction Bureau.

294
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,023
Have you given up on it?

295
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,483
No, we'll establish it.

296
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,486
I'll make the Reconstruction Bureau
on my own terms.

297
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,239
Through parliamentary reform
or a coup d'état, it doesn't matter.

298
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,740
You see…

299
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,912
I never trusted those politicians anyway.

300
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,124
This man looks familiar.

301
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,543
[Doochill] <i>You see, for Kim San,</i>

302
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,129
<i>it doesn't matter
which politician takes power</i>

303
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,674
<i>as long as he gets
his National Reconstruction Project.</i>

304
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,303
In our party,
there's Yoon Bohyun's old faction

305
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,096
and Jang Min's new faction.

306
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,472
I'm aware of that.

307
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,727
We need to make sure that these policies
are initiated by the new faction.

308
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,772
That way, those of us
in the new faction will support you.

309
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,566
[member] Let's head in
to vote on the amendment

310
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,234
to the Local Government Act!

311
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,571
[Doochill] <i>Well, there's that whole thing
about defending democracy and whatnot.</i>

312
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,780
Let us proceed.

313
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,158
[Doochill] <i>Kim San was never
actually interested in any of that.</i>

314
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,242
What do you think you're doing?

315
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,911
[assemblyman]
How dare you try to steal the vote?

316
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,995
[Seongmin] Just push through them.

317
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,413
Link arms, now! Link arms!

318
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,749
- Hey, hey, block them! Block them!
- This vote is invalid!

319
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,959
What are you doing? Let go of me.

320
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,128
I'm rejecting this fraudulent vote,
Kang Seongmin.

321
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,880
How dare you touch an assemblyman?

322
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,924
Well, you're no assemblyman.

323
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,175
You're just Choi Minkyu's lackey.

324
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,718
- Bastard!
- [grunts]

325
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,011
Oh, Mr. Kang!

326
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,471
We strongly condemn

327
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,806
the rushed passing of the bill.

328
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,935
You'll issue an apology to our

329
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,853
Chairman Kim San.

330
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,775
[Doochill] <i>And that is what differentiates
Kim San from Kang Seongmin.</i>

331
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,193
That's not necessary.

332
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,405
Everything you just said,
that will suffice.

333
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,908
[Sun] What?

334
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,328
- You're going to let it slide?
- Yes, and from time to time, we should.

335
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,038
It'll be fine.

336
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,209
April 3, 1960
Seoul, South Korea

337
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,464
The UN is ready to investigate
the election results.

338
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,133
I think they'll recommend a new election.

339
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,470
Do you think their recommendation
will make a difference?

340
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,347
It'll put the pressure on.

341
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,891
General, please.

342
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,269
I think we should wait a little longer.

343
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,064
You can achieve what you want
without going through with the coup.

344
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,944
If you continue to stall,
you'll lose your chance.

345
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,280
The political landscape needs to change.

346
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,659
Will brute force alone
accomplish anything?

347
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,787
[Hanrim sighs]

348
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,497
Do you think…

349
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,750
revolution happens by force of will?

350
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,799
Welcome.

351
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,968
[Hanmin] Thank you, sir.

352
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,433
55th Howitzer Regiment,
Captain Lee Sooil.

353
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,311

Okay, come in.

You're Colonel Baek Hyunseok

357
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,156
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Jeong Hanmin
of Capital Defense.

358
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,657
Thank you for coming, Colonel.

359
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,662
Where is General Choi Hanrim right now?

360
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,206
General Choi Hanrim is in a safe location.

361
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,376
[Hyunseok]
Are these really the General's orders?

362
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,463
Yes, I'm simply following
the General's directives.

363

- [reporter 1] No, nothing yet.

[Taemin] <i>My name's Cha Taemin.</i>

370
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,537
Ballot boxes were stolen
from opposition-led areas,

371
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,998
but we have recovered them all.

372
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,630
I wanted to meet you
and apologize in pers--

373

Come on, hurry.

00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,843
Yoon Palbong, Kim Kwangmin, Kim San.

376
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,012
Someone is behind them all.

377
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,807
The person who made my father a monster

378
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,060
is the one
who got me out of there just now.

379
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,022
The same person who got my father killed
accused him of being a spy,

380
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,943
and now they've begun turning San
into a monster.

00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,787
He called me this afternoon.

00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,331
Father, he tortured you

388
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,295

389
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,798
But this is what it means

391
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,474
I'm not quite sure where to start.

392
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,478
Pak Jiwook manipulated evidence
during the Japanese occupation.

393
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,564
He framed a lot of people.

394
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,441
Who arranged all this?

395
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,693
I'm sorry,
but I'm not able to help you there.

396

You know who it was though?

397
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,573
The police report stated that

398
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,159
Yoon Palbong was shot first that day.

399
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,247
The following shot that was fired
was aimed at him as well.

[Yeojin] <i>What do you think that means?</i>

402
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,627
The whole thing feels off,

403
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,297
and no one's covering it.

What about Mr. Kim?

411

- [villager] My baby!

- Please, that's my son!

Either Choi Hanrim has changed his mind--

527
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,314
Or Hanmin's exploiting General Choi.

528
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,399
Yes, that's right.

529
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,068
[Kim San]
<i>I'll meet you at the bakery later.</i>

530
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,461
General Choi's at the bunker.
I just took him over there.

531
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,089
- Has he made a decision?
- Yes.

532
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,716
[♪ suspenseful sting]

533
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,937
[Minkyu] Is he in here?

534
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,063
[member] Minister…

535
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,773
Hey!

536
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,317
Are you insane?

537
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,068
Are you here to apologize?

538
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,362
Apologize? Why would I?

539
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,615
Minister, I think
we should try to stay calm.

540
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,451
What do you mean "stay calm"?
We might be facing a reelection.

541
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,744
[Seongmin] It's all right.
Excuse us.

542
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,624
Have you checked the ballot boxes?

543
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,961
If you're so concerned,
maybe you should've done it yourself.

544
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,713
Go and talk to Samsik right now.

545
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,215
Okay.

546
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,054
We have to get rid of Samsik
once it's done.

547
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,097
Hopefully, you can handle that.

548
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,516
Uncle Samsik is someone
that we can depend on.

549
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,143
But he knows about everything!

550
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,687
God, your fucking whining
is giving me a headache.

551
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,777
I will be the only one
dealing with Samsik, all right?

552
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,071
You don't get to tell me
what to do with my guys.

553
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,032
This mess is all because of you,
after all.

554
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,701
Now quit your goddamn whining.

555
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,870
See you at Home Affairs tomorrow.

556
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,125
[door opens]

557
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,136
Where's General Choi?

558
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,763
The General's inside. Please follow me.

559
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,068
The 55th Howitzers, Captain Lee Sooil.

560
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,447
His father is the CEO of Samjin Textiles.

561
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,783
Samjin Textiles

562
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,703
is a subsidiary of Mr. An Yosub's company.

563
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,374
[Kim San] Eighth graduating class
of the Military Academy.

564
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,336
It's likely that An Kichul met with him
when he began planning the coup.

565
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,005
[sighs]

566
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,632
What about General Choi?
Do they know his location?

567
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,593
Manager Pak should be back soon.

568
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,732
He's not there?

569
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,151
What do you mean they took him?

570
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,445
He's saying soldiers came for him.

571
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,904
- [Doochill] All right.
- [handset clanks]

572
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,614
It had to be Hanmin.

573
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,284
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

574
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,952
All those troops
Jeong Hanmin is assembling

575
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,705
only amount to about 2,000 or 3,000 men.

576
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,166
What will you do
if the US troops make a move?

577
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,335
There won't be enough
to take on the US forces.

578
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,546
Yes. Thank you.

579
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,301
General Choi Hanrim has just arrived.

580
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,180
[Sooil]
What if Choi Hanrim changes his mind?

581
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,600
- What do we do if that happens, sir?
- Just move forward as planned.

582
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,978
I'll do what I can to stop the US troops.

583
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,484
Victory.

584
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,699
- Good luck.
- Sir.

585
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,994
[♪ suspenseful music continues]

586
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,041
But Hanmin couldn't have done this
all on his own.

587
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,794
Do you think
Kichul might've put him up to it then?

588
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,212
What did he say to you?

589
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,130
That he wanted to execute Seongmin.

590
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,174
That he'd kill him in a lawful manner.

591
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,803
- Following the Sineui Code?
- Yeah.

592
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,971
This means
that General Choi is also in danger.

593
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,056
Why would he be?

594
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,975
General Choi said he'd wait
for the UN investigators' report.

595
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,062
- An Kichul's not the type to wait around.
- [sighs]

596
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,564
If we're unable to stop An Kichul now…

597
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,026
[snickers]
…he'll probably have me killed.

598
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,737
Do you think he'd stop at killing you?

599
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,281
He'll try to kill you, me,
and Kang Seongmin.

600
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,616
When the coup d'état is over…

601
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,036
- he'll kill everybody.
- [door slides open]

602
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,249
Assemblyman.

603
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,334
[Doochill] You didn't call.

604
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,753
Did I hear that someone wants me dead?

605
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,258
What's this about a coup?

606
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,345
- [both sigh]
- An Kichul knows everything.

607
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,974
- About what?
- That you killed his older brother.

608
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,934
He knows what happened.

609
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,358
Mr. An Yosub too?

610
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,442
Yeah.

611
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,528
He knew about all of it.

612
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,698
[tuts]

613
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,371
And what was all that
about killing me lawfully?

614
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,291
- With the Sineui Alliance Code of--
- That's… That's not what I…

615
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,792
The Code of Conduct?

616
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,836
[Seongmin] We burned that.

617
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,923
[sighs]

618
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,886
Pak Jiwook held on to the original.

619
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,889
Pak Jiwook?

620
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,433
The original?

621
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,684
Yeah, that's right.

622
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,187
I've told you this time and time again.

623
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,480
That bastard Pak Jiwook.
That ex-Japanese cop.

624
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,609
- I told you to watch out for him.
- What about the ballot boxes?

625
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,153
Did you at least take care of them
like I told you?

626
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,406
The ballot boxes…
[sighs]

627
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,325
About the ballot boxes…

628
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,036
[sighs]

629
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,246
Cha Taemin took the boxes.

630
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,666
Why would Cha Taemin take them?

631
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,419
So he could tip off Aemin Daily,
which he's already done.

632
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,381
[glass clatters, shatters]

633
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,050
[Seongmin breathes heavily]

634
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,261
You didn't keep an eye on Pak Jiwook,
the ballot boxes were stolen,

635
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,138
and now
you're just standing around uselessly

636
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,848
after An Kichul said he'd kill me?

637
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm sorry.

638
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,353
What do you think will become of me
if this gets printed?

639
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,520
I don't know what to say.

640
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,439
You said you'd keep tabs on An Yosub.

641
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,982
[shouts]
What the hell have you been doing?

642
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,737
Why's all of this Uncle Samsik's fault?

643
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,408
- What?
- Whoever gave the order is to blame.

644
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,660
I don't get
why you're putting this all on him.

645
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,454
Uh, he has a tendency
to be a little too direct, sir.

646
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,039
- Please excuse--
- No, I'm not trying to be direct.

647
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,959
Albright.

648
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,087
Valedictorian.

649
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,338
The fuck do you know?

650
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,589
What's that?

651
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,299
[Seongmin] Don't act like you're innocent.

652
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,219
You're planning to push me aside
and take all the credit.

653
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,054
What? Thought I didn't know?

654
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,431
You always knew
the ballot boxes would be stolen.

655
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,100
Why didn't you do anything about it?

656
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,893
Don't be such a hypocrite.

657
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,813
- You and I are the same.
- I am nothing like you.

658
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,691
I poured my blood and sweat
into that scholarship.

659
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,443
I wasn't raised lavishly by parents
who sold out their country!

660
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,903
- Like yours.
- Raised lavishly?

661
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,322
What's gotten into you two?
You know better than this.

662
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,075
You think I was raised lavishly?
Uncle, you know very well that I wasn't.

663
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,535
I know. Of course I do, I know.

664
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,288
Assemblyman Kang Seongmin
has been through real hardship.

665
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,498
How much longer
are you going to clean up after him?

666
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,918
Clean up after me?
[laughs]

667
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,212

668
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,797
Hey.

669
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,968
Who do you think Uncle Samsik
has to thank for making it this far?

670
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,720
It's all thanks to the Kang family,
of course.

671
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,555
God, he treats you like a slave!

672
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,098
No, he's not a slave.

673
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,225
A slave is what we call people like you.

674
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,102
You're a slave the way you cling to Uncle

675
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,104
- and can't ever break free.
- Calm down. Now is not the time for this.

676
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,522
We need to stop An Kichul!

[Kim San sighs]

679
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,157
There must be something we can do.

680
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,867
Yeah, there is.

681
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,201
[Kim San] What is it?

682
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,663
[♪ tense music playing]

683
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,041
Martial law.

684
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,085
Martial law?

685
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,629
Declaring martial law would make it harder
to mobilize the troops.

686
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,882
It was the only way
we could stop the coup.

687
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,343
Democracy was stolen
along with ballot boxes

President…

694
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,688
you must declare martial law right away.

[♪ tense music continues]

696
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,943

General Choi.

699
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,324
Here's our chance. We can't back down now.

700
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,287
This would be the largest operation
since the war.

701
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,623
This isn't a drill.

702
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,793
Our country is an absolute mess, huh?

703
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,045
As soldiers, we can't stand by.

704
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,673
Let's show them.

705
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,261
As long as we all stick to the plan,

706
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,680
no one will get hurt.

707
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,100

708
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,229
Martial law.

709
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,732
Who was it?

710
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,401
It was my idea.

711
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,335
