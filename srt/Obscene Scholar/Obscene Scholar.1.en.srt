1
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,380
Damn this...

2
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,900
Damn this wretched world.

3
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,240
The harmony of yin and yang
is the law of nature.

4
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,900
And yet, how dare they try to kill me
just for sleeping with a woman?

5
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,040
What a wretched world this is.

6
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,320
Fidelity?

7
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,260
They keep concubines,

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,220
indulge in pleasure houses,
and revel in debauchery.

9
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,070
Yet, why am I the only one
treated like this?

10
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,510
My lord.

11
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,370
Please save me from this wretched world.

12
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:50,293
Please allow me
to live in a world of true freedom.

13
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,990
What is happening?

14
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,640
Where am I?

15
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,460
What on earth is that?

16
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,010
It looks like a carriage
but how is it moving without a horse?

17
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,870
Naughty Heaven

18
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,360
Oh my...

19
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,470
So it wasn't a dream after all?

20
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,670
Then where am I?

21
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,970
You finished unpacking already?

22
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,490
Of course.

23
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:27,603
But this isn't even your
first time breaking up with a guy.

24
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,980
What's with this 'breakup trip'?

25
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,710
It was really hard for me this time.

26
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
I guess I liked him a lot.

27
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,770
Yeah, right.

28
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,870
Then why did you sleep with other guys
while dating your ex?

29
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,970
You know I can’t sleep
without a guy next to me.

30
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,540
Isn't that the same for you?

31
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,710
Yeah, that's why I always stay single.

32
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,420
I wonder if there are
any guys around here for a hookup.

33
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,510
Why don’t we go find one?

34
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,200
I knew it.

35
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,220
You're no person for a 'breakup trip'.

36
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,783
Come on, let's go now.

37
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,560
I can really feel my stomach growling.

38
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,710
Seems like this isn’t a dream after all.

39
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,790
I can really feel my stomach growling.

40
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,000
Seems like this isn’t a dream after all.

41
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,980
Oh my...

42
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,540
A nobleman must maintain his honor.

43
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,930
Eating food scraps is beneath me.

44
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,850
This is utterly unacceptable!.

45
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,980
Oh my...

46
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,220
I knew it!

47
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,510
In a low season like this
and with families around,

48
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,333
it's impossible to find
guy to hook up with.

49
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,990
Why did you choose to come here?

50
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,405
I didn't know it would be this boring.

51
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,970
But honestly,
this place is way over the top.

52
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,330
- What should we do?
- We only have one choice.

53
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,230
Return to Seoul.

54
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,980
But I already paid for the pool villa.

55
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,480
It's your fault, not mine.

56
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,970
And also, who goes on a
'breakup trip' for four days?

57
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,715
That's how much I'm heartbroken.

58
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,640
Look at us now.

59
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,420
It’s just the two of us with no guys.

60
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,440
Wait, what's he doing there?

61
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,610
I think he's drunk, let's just go.

62
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,230
Please help me.

63
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,010
I think we should help him.

64
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,290
- He's not bad
- Are you sure?

65
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,070
Isn't he good looking?

66
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,670
Alright, charity once in a while isn't bad.

67
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,700
He's actually pretty hot.

68
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,490
Sir, are you alright?

69
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,280
What is the name of this food?

70
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
It kind of tastes like chicken.

71
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,000
You've never had fried chicken before?

72
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,250
By the way, what happened to you?

73
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,130
Well...

74
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,820
I was running away from someone
due to unavoidable circumstances.

75
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,110
But when I came to my senses,
I found myself here.

76
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,950
Can you tell me where I am?

77
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,140
Are you serious?

78
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,510
We're in Korea.

79
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,290
Wait, then...

80
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,590
Are you saying this isn’t Joseon?

81
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,170
Does that mean you're from Joseon?

82
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,330
That's right.

83
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,350
Then you came from the past?

84
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,580
You mean this is the future?

85
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,120
Did you really come from the past?

86
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,250
Is this something like
'My Love from the Star'?

87
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,540
What is this water?

88
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,100
It's really sweet and fizzy,
truly a delicacy.

89
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
And what's that over there?

90
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,070
I saw you taking this
water from that thing.

91
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,640
It's even blowing out cold air.

92
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,540
Look at this!

93
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,560
It's ice!

94
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,020
Truly amazing.

95
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,060
I think he's mentally ill.

96
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,670
Definitely not a normal person.

97
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,400
May I take a bath by any chance?

98
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,990
Sure.

99
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,030
Where should I...

100
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,830
There's a room at the end of the corridor.

101
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,560
It's a well!

102
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,890
Do people these days
build a well inside their homes?

103
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,780
That's right.

104
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,410
Go ahead and take a bath.

105
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,070
Alright.

106
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,150
What do we do now?

107
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,990
Don't worry.

108
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,940
He'll leave after getting some rest.

109
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,390
As you said, I think he's mentally ill.

110
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm kind of worried.

111
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,700
What if he really came from the past?

112
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,160
You should stop watching drama series.

113
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,350
Do you actually believe him?

114
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,400
But he seems fine on the outside.

115
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,050
Are you really just going to let him go?

116
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,940
Knock it off.

117
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,120
No matter how desperate,
eating odd things will only cause trouble.

118
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,790
But he's the only guy
that we found around here.

119
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,730
Let's just give it a go this once.

120
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,690
Hey there, young lady.

121
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,620
There's no water coming out of the well.

122
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,280
A well?

123
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,140
Did you take a bath with that water?

124
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,450
That's right.

125
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Isn't this a well?

126
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,320
From now on, use this to take a bath.

127
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,740
Young lady, hot water is coming out.

128
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,110
Did you see that?

129
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,000
Of course I did.

130
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,140
I didn’t know people in the
Joseon Dynasty had such a big size.

131
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,300
It's way beyond the average size.

132
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,023
Hey.

133
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,960
Didn't you say we should let him go?

134
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,300
Did I?

135
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:00,966
If there's someone who'd let him go
after seeing that huge thing,

136
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,630
that person must be insane.

137
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,360
That's right.

138
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,460
Cheers.

139
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:29,370
I slept with up to six Japanese women.

140
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,430
When the Imjin War broke out.

141
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,190
I had an affair with the
enemy general's wife.

142
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,470
Look here.

143
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,160
There are two nail marks.

144
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,140
She was so thrilled that she scratched me.

145
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,640
But the whole world calls me a scoundrel.

146
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,410
Do you know why I had an affair
with the enemy's wife?

147
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,840
It was a step toward a rebellion
that was ready to face death.

148
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,870
That's not it.

149
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,480
My fellows keep concubines
and indulge in pleasure houses.

150
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,540
Yet, they demand chastity from their wives.

151
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,620
The harmony of yin and yang
is the law of nature.

152
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,570
- Am I not right?
- You're right.

153
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,700
In today's world, that's nonsense.

154
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,590
Welcome to the world of freedom.

155
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,140
People these days do it whenever they want.

156
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,600
Is that true?

157
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,710
Of course.

158
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,460
Everyone does whatever they want.

159
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,750
Really?

160
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,020
Isn't this too quick?

161
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,510
Young lady, there's no need to rush.

162
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,390
Young lady, slow down.

163
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,780
Young lady.

164
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,210
It feels so good.

165
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,300
- Does it?
- Yeah.

166
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,620
I shall give my all to you today.

167
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,360
Young lady.

168
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,990
This thing is truly fascinating.

169
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,150
What an amazing world it is.

170
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,450
I never could have imagined this.

171
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,050
Wait, what is that?

172
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,010
A picture is moving.

173
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,150
How amazing it is.

174
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,640
But the painting is truly lascivious.

175
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,810
What kind of codex is this?

176
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,710
This world must truly be a paradise.

177
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,990
Thank you my lord.

178
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,140
Thank you for sending me to this paradise.

179
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,410
Excuse me, young lady.

180
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,380
I don't how I ended
up coming to this world.

181
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,530
But this is the world
that I always dreamed of.

182
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,990
Speaking of that,

183
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,160
what should I do to make a life here?

184
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,630
In today's world, money is everything.

185
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,420
Is that so?

186
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,160
I guess the importance of money
has never changed since the past.

187
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,160
How can I make money then?

188
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,590
Can't we discuss this later?

189
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,890
I want to do something else right now.

190
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,090
Come with me.

191
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,570
Harder, please.

192
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,463
- Harder?
- Yeah.

193
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,660
Harder.

194
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,240
Should I get on top now?

195
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,620
As you wish.

196
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,250
Get up.

197
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,510
It's so huge.

198
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,980
Sir, do you like it?

199
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,690
Young lady, how does it feel?

200
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,190
It's truly something else.

201
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,770
Do you think so?

202
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,140
Now...

203
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,020
I will show you my special move.

204
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,330
Young lady.

205
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,090
Are you ready?

206
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,820
Young lady.

207
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,220
Young lady.

208
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,890
I've been thinking about this world.

209
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,320
But I barely know anything about it.

210
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,900
I think I need to study it more.

211
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,530
Ask my friend about that.

212
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,190
Young lady.

213
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,310
I have a question.

214
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,100
Please wake up.

215
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,120
Hey...

216
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,540
Young lady.

217
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,410
Wake up.

218
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,190
Where have you been?

219
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,470
I like to do it right after I wake up.

220
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,420
Young lady, I'm not here for this.

221
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,850
It feels so good.

222
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,070
Isn't he beyond expectation?

223
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,850
He's so amazing.

224
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,230
I know.

225
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,740
Maybe his dad is the Hulk.

226
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,200
What do you mean?

227
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,500
Because he's such a hunk.

228
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,160
Might be.

229
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,990
Especially, his private
parts are extraordinary.

230
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,340
I agree with that.

231
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,830
A size like that is really rare.

232
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,170
But what should we do when we leave?

233
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,380
About what?

234
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,080
About him.

235
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,010
Let's just enjoy him to the fullest and
bid him farewell when we leave for Seoul.

236
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,820
Would that be okay?

237
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,620
He actually seems mentally ill.

238
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,770
Then take him to Seoul with you.

239
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,500
No way.

240
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,990
But isn't it a shame
to part ways like this?

241
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,890
That's why we have to
enjoy him to the fullest when we can.

242
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,000
I think so too.

243
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:46,040
Mister nobleman, aren't you hungry?

244
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,450
Hurry up and come eat.

245
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,110
Have a seat.

246
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,140
Sir, have a taste of this.

247
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,360
Sir, try this too.

248
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,790
It's really delicious.

249
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,820
By the way...

250
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,290
As I mentioned before.

251
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,530
I don't know how I ended up in this world.

252
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:26,210
But I have no idea
how to build a life here.

253
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,820
Could you two teach me how?

254
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,000
Sure, of course we should.

255
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,620
That's right.

256
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,410
What is that you want to know?

257
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,220
Sir.

258
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,120
Since I'm your teacher now,
I'll speak to you casually.

259
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,520
As you wish.

260
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,190
Do you know what's most important
in today's world?

261
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,840
It's money.

262
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,580
Money is everything in life.

263
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,320
She's right.

264
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,910
But why do you think
people are so obsessed with money?

265
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,620
The ultimate purpose
of money is to have sex.

266
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,870
Sex?

267
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,380
Didn't you know?

268
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,670
There was this man
who was the richest in this country.

269
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,190
But he once got humiliated
after getting caught inviting escort girls.

270
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,010
Don't you get it?

271
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,850
People's main purpose of
making money is to have sex.

272
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,740
What's your point?

273
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:37,270
So, you need a job that brings you
both joy and income.

274
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,460
Am I thinking what you're thinking?

275
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,770
What job satisfies both of those?

276
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,680
A host.

277
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,410
What is a host?

278
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:53,160
It's something like a courtesan.

279
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,870
But a male courtesan.

280
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,070
A male courtesan?

281
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,550
But I'm a nobleman with dignity.

282
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,560
Excuse me, we're in the 21st century.

283
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,840
Nobles don't exist anymore.

284
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,800
And also, with your size and skills,

285
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,140
you could become a
legendary host in history.

286
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,830
Is that true?

287
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,310
Of course.

288
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,440
Sure it is.

289
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,600
Then I shall try to become
the most remembered host in history.

290
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,510
Please excuse me for a moment.

291
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,380
I have somewhere to go.

292
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,420
I think he's really stupid.

293
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,390
- Was our joke too much?
- Don't worry.

294
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,130
We can say whatever
we want to a stupid man.

295
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,530
I'm the king of hosts.

296
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,220
I'm the king of this world.

297
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,870
I am the king!

298
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,060
I am the king, indeed!

299
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,060
Alright, then.

300
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,660
What do I have to do to become a host?

301
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,090
What should we do?

302
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,210
He's being so serious about this.

303
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,460
Don't worry.

304
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,300
It's good for us.

305
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,070
This is our chance to make the most of him.

306
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,820
Promise that you'll do whatever we say.

307
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,940
Then we'll teach you how to be a host.

308
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,280
Sure.

309
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,530
I'm prepared to do anything.

310
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,710
Is running errands like
this what a host does?

311
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,870
Isn’t this something only servants do?

312
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,360
Damn it.

313
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,560
But this treat is also a true delicacy.

314
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,240
Is this all you bought?

315
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,910
I think you could’ve bought more
with the money we gave you.

316
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,620
What are you talking about?

317
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,020
This was all I could buy with the money.

318
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,830
Forget it, let's drink now.

319
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:47,360
Sir, come here and pour some wine for me.

320
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,620
Did you forget what we said?

321
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:56,890
A host is like a courtesan.

322
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,390
So you have to do whatever we say.

323
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,960
This is all part of the learning process.

324
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,850
Fine.

325
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,600
I'll do it.

326
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,560
Don't disappoint us.

327
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,770
Just my luck!

328
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,220
Damn it.

329
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,480
Making a living is not easy,
both in the past and now.

330
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,240
Since I'm the subordinate,
I have no choice but listen to them.

331
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,640
Sir.

332
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,250
Come over here for a second.

333
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,340
Okay.

334
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,420
What's the matter?

335
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,700
I'll teach you how to do a massage.

336
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,530
A massage?

337
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,540
What is that?

338
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,760
Just think of it as a kind of therapy.

339
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,130
Do I really need to learn that?

340
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,960
Yes, of course.

341
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,230
A host has to know how to do a massage.

342
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,760
Come on in.

343
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,380
Do it with sincerity.

344
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,880
Get above me and do it properly.

345
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,870
That's it.

346
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,160
Do it slowly and gently,

347
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,150
but with a decent amount of pressure.

348
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,800
Am I doing it correctly?

349
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,280
Do it the way you think works.

350
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,200
But how?

351
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,980
Just do it the way you think is best.

352
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,570
A bit higher.

353
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,670
- Over here?
- Higher.

354
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,910
You mean, here?

355
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,160
That's it.

356
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,310
Sir.

357
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,310
What is it this time?

358
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,270
Come over here.

359
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,680
Sir, come to my room.

360
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,550
Sir.

361
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,700
Sir.

362
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,260
Sir.

363
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,960
Sir, come quickly.

364
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,400
- Hurry up.
- Sir.

365
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,900
Sir.

366
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,780
- Sir.
- Come quickly.

367
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,380
- Sir.
- Sir.

368
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,420
- Sir.
- Hurry up.

369
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,310
Sir, come quickly.

370
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,860
Sir.

371
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,980
Come in quickly.

372
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,560
I want to return to where I belong!

373
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,770
Are you asking for money?

374
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,720
I believe I should receive
a fair pay for all this hard work.

375
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,480
You're getting this wrong.

376
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,900
That's not how things work these days.

377
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,350
Sir.

378
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:25,260
Don't you know Passion pay?

379
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,000
What on earth is that?

380
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:34,700
Think about the effort and dedication we're
putting in to help you adapt to society.

381
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,440
Your effort is nothing
compared to the work we’re doing.

382
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:41,700
Even slaves in the
Joseon Dynasty got paid.

383
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:45,030
But now I'm working
and not even getting paid?

384
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,910
Sir, you're not in the
position to say that.

385
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,580
Frankly speaking, you're the one
who has to pay us the tuition.

386
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,190
And were we the only ones who enjoyed it?

387
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,530
Didn't you also enjoy it?

388
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,960
That's right, but...

389
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,120
He's really getting on my nerves.

390
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,810
Did you forget that we're your life savors?

391
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Do you think it's right
to ask us for money?

392
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,320
Sir.

393
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,420
If you think it's unfair, you may leave.

394
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:16,740
We won't hold you back.

395
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,250
Alright, then.

396
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,860
So, are you going to leave?

397
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:34,860
It seems like I was out
of my mind for a moment.

398
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,950
I'll just follow orders.

399
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,200
You made a wise choice.

400
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,620
Sir.

401
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:46,370
If you be a good student until we leave,

402
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:50,510
we'll give you a severance pay.

403
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,780
So stick with us until the end.

404
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,880
Do you get it?

405
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:57,870
Alright.

406
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,700
I appreciate it.

407
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,910
Excuse me.

408
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,350
Your meal is ready.

409
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,680
Not bad.

410
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,900
My body feels stiff.

411
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,760
Come to my room after washing the dishes.

412
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,380
Don't forget to come to me as well.

413
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,340
What fun things shall we do today?

414
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,820
Come in.

415
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,970
Are you ready?

416
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,930
Let's have some fun today.

417
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,650
Yes, that's it.

418
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,080
It feels so good.

419
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,550
I want it harder.

420
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,910
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

421
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,060
Yes, I like it.

422
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,910
You're leaving already?

423
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,420
It's a thief!

424
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,870
It's a thief!

425
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,580
He's running away with my wallet.

426
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,130
Stop right there!

427
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,380
It's a thief!

428
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,600
It's a thief!

429
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:16,670
Get him!

430
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,570
It's a thief!

431
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,390
Get him!

432
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:32,840
It's a thief!

433
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:35,100
Get him!

434
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,400
He stole my wallet.

435
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,120
It's a thief!

436
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,730
This can't be!

437
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,690
Thank you, my lord.

438
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,470
Oh, my lord!

439
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,920
1 year later

440
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:36,000
On a deep autumn night.

441
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,800
A disciple awoke in tears.

442
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:47,640
The master found this strange
and asked the disciple.

443
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,300
Did you have a nightmare?

444
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:55,240
No, master.

445
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,600
Did you have a sad dream?

446
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,990
No, master.

447
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,410
I had a sweet dream.

448
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,050
Then why are you crying so sorrowfully?

449
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,270
Because even though it was a sweet dream.

450
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:17,654
It was a dream that must never come true.

451
01:20:01,056 --> 01:20:03,072
