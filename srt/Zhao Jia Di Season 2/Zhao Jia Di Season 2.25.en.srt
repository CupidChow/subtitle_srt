192
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,950
She'll take a 15% stake.

193
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,520
Add Risheng and Jufeng to that,

194
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,430
and we've nearly
got the big sum sorted.

195
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,360
The rest depends on the auction.

196
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,160
I heard from Lan

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,430
that Zhu put his club into the auction.

198
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
He did this

199
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,280
because he wanted to help out Fan.

200
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,070
Lan said

201
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,670
we'll take out part of the shares

202
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,550
of Fanlong Mining.

203
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,760
Once the auction's done,

204
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,040
we'll give that to Zhu.

205
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,480
Over these past few days,

206
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
you've been running
between the office and the hospital.

207
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,070
You must be exhausted.

208
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
Honey,

209
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
just focus on

210
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,880
taking care of Grandpa.

211
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,880
Leave the rest to me.

212
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,760
Once Grandpa gets better,

213
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,950
and leaves the hospital,

214
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,040
everything else will be sorted out.

215
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,070
Mr. Wei,

216
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,040
are you really not coming?

217
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,870
We're all here already.

218
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,550
We all know what Mr. Xu and Zhou Zenan

219
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,480
are capable of.

220
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,680
I've also run the numbers
for Shen Yulan's side.

221
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,240
There's at least a five billion gap.

222
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,000
I just don't believe

223
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,310
they can gather that much money.

224
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,040
Mr. Wei, I think you should...

225
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,480
Hello?

226
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,720
Mr. Wei.

227
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,440
Is everything set up?

228
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,310
Great. Congratulations, Mr. Ma.

229
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,110
You've won our Lot 5.

230
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,920
Next up is Lot 6.

231
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,720
Lot 6 is on Donghu Road, Hang City.

232
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,830
It's Pengcheng Club
and its facilities.

233
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,280
The total area
is 1,132.92 square meters.

234
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,790
The starting bid is eighteen million.

Lot 6 is up for grabs.

237
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,310
Great location with easy access,

fully equipped amenities,

239
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,200
prime spot in the city.

240
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,550
It's definitely worth considering.

241
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,040
Alright, let's start the bidding.

242
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,480
I heard from Ji Jie

243
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,720
that you invested
in Jiadi's joint venture.

244
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,350
Eighteen million.

245
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,440

Alright, this gentleman

You always go big.

249
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,070
Just let the small ones go.

250
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,200
Eighteen million, once.

251
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,070
Anyone want to raise the bid?

252
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,000
Nineteen million.

253
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,550
Alright, Mr. Lin bids nineteen million.

254
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,200
Nineteen million, any higher offers?

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,480
Twenty million.

256
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,680
Ms. Pei bids twenty million.

257
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,440
Twenty million.

258
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,200
Anyone else want to jump in?

259
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Lin, want to go higher?

260
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,040
Is that all you've got?

261
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Why are you filming this?

262
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Well then,

263
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,390
twenty million, once.

264
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,760
Because you want it.

265
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,240
This club

266
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,830
means something, right?

267
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,830
Twenty million, twice.

268
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,070

I'll go for thirty million.

280
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,350
Alright, Ms. Pei bids thirty million.

281
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,870
Thirty million goes back to Ms. Pei.

282
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,070
Forty million.

283
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,310

284
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,760
Ms. Cai bids forty million again.

285
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960

Any higher offers?

294
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,390
Anyone else want to bid?

295
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,870
Why do I feel like

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,150
they're competing with each other?

297
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,760
Both Jufeng and Donglei have invested.

298
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,350
Alright, fifty million, first call.

299
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,870

Ms. Li, do you want to keep going?

304
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,790
Add another hundred thousand.

305
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,550
Alright, Ms. Li adds
one hundred thousand.

306
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,390
We're at 70,100,000.

307
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,630
Back to Ms. Li now.

308
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,870
Ms. Cai, would you like to raise again?

309
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,480

One hundred million?

316
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,920
Ms. Cai raises to one hundred million.

317
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,590
Ms. Cai, is that your final offer?

318
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,760
Add another hundred thousand.

319
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,720

Back to Ms. Li again.

00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,680
Honey,

323
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,680
I know this place

324
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
means a lot to you.

second call.

329
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,790
100,000,000, third call.

330
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,830
Sold.

331
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,040
Congratulations

332
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,440

333
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,550

00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,960
Alright, next

335
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,240
is our main auction event.

336
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,830
Do you remember

337
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,280
what I told you?

338
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,310
Yes.

339
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,150
Don't worry.

340
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,830
Go on in.

341
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,390
Alright, now we move to
the key part of our auction.

342
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,960
This is our Lot 10.

343
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,550
A 20% stake in Fanlong Mining Company.

344
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,720
The total value is 200 million.

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,350
The starting bid is 896 million.

346
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,110
Bidding is now open.

347
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,390
Zhu,

348
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,070
something's happened outside.

349
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,200
Honey, wait here for me.

350
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,790
Let me stress this one more time.

351
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,720
Fanlong Mining is caught up
in an equity dispute.

352
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,040
My client has already filed a lawsuit

353
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,590
and requested to freeze the shares.

354
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,070
The auction must be stopped.

355
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,720
Hello.

356
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,110
What's going on?

357
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,240
You're in charge
of Fanlong Mining, right?

358
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,390
Yes, that's me.

359
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,520
I'm the attorney
for Wanxiang Machinery Manufacturing.

360
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,350
In our previous joint project,

361
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,960
you pledged shares

362
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,070
to my client.

363
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,070
But the payment wasn't settled.

364
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,790
Here's a Notice of Dispute.

365
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,070
This can't be true.

366
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,550
I'm in charge of this project.

367
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,440
All payments were made.

368
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,790
That's my message to you.

369
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,790
Wait for the court.

370
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,550
Wait, don't leave yet.

371
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,830
Mr. Zhu, I'm so sorry.

372
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,040
We have to stop this auction.

373
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,240
We can't break the rules.

374
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,920
Didn't you get it?

375
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,790
He's just stalling for time.

376
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,920
We don't owe him anything.

377
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,070
Jiadi.

378
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,310
Zhu.

379
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,720
You two go to the court now.

380
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,830
Check the info there.

381
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,760
I'll figure something out here.

382
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,590
Heading over right now.

383
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,110
Let's go.

384
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,680
Sorry, everyone.

385
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,720
Due to some unexpected issues,

386
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,280
the auction is paused for now.

387
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,870
We really apologize for this.

388
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,760
There's still more to come.

389
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,200
Thanks for making time to be here.

390
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,350
Many of you present today

391
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,590
already know our situation.

392
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
After Fanlong Group and Xu Trading

393
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,390
left the Nanshan Chamber of Commerce,

394
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,390
we formed

395
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,680
a new joint venture.

396
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,200
It's a new alliance.

397
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,920
So far,

398
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,280
other companies that joined include

399
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Donglei Group,

400
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,830
Risheng Capital,

401
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,480
Jufeng Capital,

402
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,040
and Yinlong Fund.

403
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,350
I, Zhao Jiadi, came to Hang City alone.

404
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,150
At my toughest times,

405
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,440
they offered me help
in their own ways.

406
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,200
I've always believed

407
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,000
life is about loyalty and bonds.

408
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,790
Without all of you,

409
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,040
I wouldn't be who I am now.

410
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,040
The main purpose of this auction

411
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,830
is to bid
for the Kalpunia Mining District.

412
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,070
We're already close
to our target amount.

413
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Though Fanlong Mining's share auction

414
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,350
was forced to stop

415
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,630
by some bad actors,

416
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,590
it's okay.

417
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,480
It gives us a chance.

418
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,280
So, taking this opportunity,

419
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,310
I'd like to share something.

420
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,960
I'm willing to transfer
my joint venture,

421
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,720
giving up 15% of my stake,

422
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,150
starting at ten million.

423
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,680
And the mining operation rights

424
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,720
will be fully handed to Fanlong Group.

425
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,960
Ten million?

426
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,630
That's a great deal.

427
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,040
Guys, don't let him fool you.

428
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,480
Without Li Group,

429
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,960
he'd never get the mining rights.

430
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,920
Jinchao Company bids

431
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,590
thirty billion

432
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,680
for joining

433
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,440
the Kalpunia project.

434
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,310
Baliang.

435
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,520
Dongcao.

436
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,000
Also,

437
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,550
I'll add one billion in my own name

438
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,680
as a betrothal gift

439
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,200
from the Zhaos of Tang City
to the Lis of Jin City.

440
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,680
The police just sent word.

441
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,480
They said there's been progress.

442
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,830
Wei Jinghai won't get away this time.

443
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
That's good to hear.

444
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,150
Now that you're leaving,

445
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,630
someone's going to miss you.

446
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,070
Stop teasing.

447
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,480
As long as you two are happy.

448
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,350
Jiadi.

449
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm heading out now.

450
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,070
Let's talk investments later.

451
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,070
Sure.

452
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,040
Yanzhi.

453
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,480
Should we get going?

454
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,680
I'm waiting for you in Hai City.

455
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,110
Dongcao.

456
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,390
You must be tired from the trip.

457
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,440
I'm alright.

458
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,590
No rush to leave, right?

459
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,350
Let's grab a meal together later.

460
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,110
I'll properly introduce you two.

461
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,870
Dongcao's flight is this afternoon.

462
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,920
I kept giving you looks just now,

463
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,760
but you didn't notice me.

464
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,760
If you wait longer,
you'll miss your chance.

465
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,070
Why are you in such a rush?

466
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,000
I left my overseas project
halfway through

467
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
and rushed back home.

468
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,790
Let's just wait for next time.

469
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,630
We can meet up again when I come back.

470
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,350
Alright.

471
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,520
Baliang.

472
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,830
Can you give me a ride later?

473
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,240
Sure.

474
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,720
You don't mind
lending him to me, do you?

475
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,000
Of course, I don't mind.

476
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,960
Then hurry back soon.

477
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I'll wait here for you.

478
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Okay.

479
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,310
Let's go, Dongcao.

480
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,830
Just the two of you?

481
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,200
Boss.

482
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,720
Hey man.

483
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,200
Load the stuff from the trunk
onto the boat first.

484
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,150
I'll go pick someone up.

485
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,960
I'll come back tonight.

486
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,870
Boss, wait up.

487
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,440
We're not taking this job anymore.

488
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,230
They're checking

489
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,040
the route to the high seas hard.

490
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,400
Maybe wait a couple of days.

491
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,320
Nothing we can do.

492
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,590
It's out of our hands.

493
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,960
Are you quitting right now?

494
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Come on, don't back out now.

495
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,520
I've got the cash ready.

496
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,040
How about this, buddy,

497
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,110
I'll pay you triple.

498
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,550
Here's a down payment.

499
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,040
Take it all.

500
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,270
I'll bring the rest tonight.

501
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,040
So, how did it go?

502
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,550
All set.

503
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,440
Grab the luggage.

504
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,710
I read your article.

505
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,630
They called you the "Iron Lady".

506
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,190
Honestly, you really are impressive.

507
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,320
This project of yours

508
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,480
has got to be worth at least 10 billion.

509
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,070
That's an understatement.

510
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,270
Not really.

511
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,070
By the way,

512
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,590
once these problems are sorted,

513
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,000
will you stay at Fanlong Group?

514
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,590
Last time you called, you mentioned

515
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,110
wanting to try private equity.

516
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,480
We'll see.

517
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,110
Now there's a chance
to enter the mining site,

518
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,480
so I'm closer to helping Ke

519
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,320
get the mining rights back.

520
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,550
I'll still do private equity.

521
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,670
But I might not run things myself.

522
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Oh right, Dongcao.

523
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,670
I've got a wild idea brewing.

524
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,550
But I can't share it yet.

525
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,710
Once I have it all mapped out,

526
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,550
I'll fill you in.

527
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,920
Is this

528
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,320
for yourself?

529
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,960
Baliang, you've grown up.

530
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,270
And you've matured, too.

531
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,520
Baliang,

532
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,630
walk with me for a bit.

533
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,800
Sure.

534
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,880
Grandma used to say,

535
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,400
when two people are together,

536
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,800
one always gives a little more.

537
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,270
Life is a long journey,

538
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,440
but for someone you care about,

539
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,230
it's a blessing to give more.

540
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,150
She's a wonderful person.

541
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,670
Her style, looks, and personality.

542
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,630
You're a perfect match.

543
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,230
With her taking care of you,

544
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,400
I feel completely at ease.

545
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,550
Last time we talked,

546
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,360
you said, "Life plays tricks."

547
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,320
I've thought about that for a while.

548
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,630
If I could let go

549
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,150
of the Qi family, as easily as you did,

550
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,320
if the rift between our families

551
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,880
could've been solved sooner,

552
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,550
if Zhao Xin hadn't adopted me

553
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,880
and you wouldn't call me your sister,

554
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,590
if we met a bit later...

555
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,800
Do you think things
would end differently?

556
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,480
I was timid as a kid,

557
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
always crying over nothing.

558
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,040
It was always you by my side.

559
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,320
No one can replace that bond.

560
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,550
This bracelet

561
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,630
is a gift from Grandma to me.

562
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,270
You already know that.

563
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,270
But I've never told you

564
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,150
that when she handed it to me,

565
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,270
she said it was

566
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,630
a family heirloom of the Zhaos
for your future wife.

567
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,670
I've worn it for so many years.

568
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,000
It's full of my memories.

569
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,590
Now,

570
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,150
I'm giving it to you and Zhijin

571
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,880
as my blessing for you both.

572
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,710
It's a small gift, but heartfelt.

573
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,880
Don't let others say

574
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,440
the Zhao family
doesn't have tradition.

575
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,190
It's about time for me to go.

576
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,710
Fang and the others are right behind me.

577
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,550
You don't need to walk me out.

578
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,880
Dongcao.

579
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,960
This time,

580
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,150
can you watch me leave for once?

581
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,960
If we had never met,

582
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,400
then maybe we'd never fall in love.

583
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,190
If we had never knew each other,

584
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,520
then maybe we'd never miss each other.

585
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,400
If we had never met,

586
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,840
then maybe we'd never fall in love.

587
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,190
If we had never knew each other,

588
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,750
then maybe we'd never miss each other.

589
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,110
If we had never stayed together,

590
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,920
then maybe we'd owe each other nothing.

591
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,590
If we had never made mistakes together,

592
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,670
then maybe we'd never
let each other down.

593
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,270
Baliang,

594
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm leaving now.

595
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm going to find a good girl

596
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,400
and have a love that's wild and real,

597
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
one with promises that last forever.

598
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,320
That's what being young is about.

599
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,440
We should make the most of it.

600
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
As long as you're happy,

601
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,110
I'm happy.

602
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,590
Honestly, my dream is simple.

603
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,630
I just want to stay home peacefully

604
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,550
to take care of you

605
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,110
and look after Grandma.

606
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,480
Support each other in hardship,

607
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,920
and stay connected
even when paths diverge.
