Are you still

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,840
the proud young master
of Pengcheng Club?

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,320
I bought this car last year.

Well, my final offer

00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,320
on the way from the mining district.

384
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,800
I don't want to step in,

385
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,720
neither do I want to dig up the past.

386
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you worried

387
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,760
it'll implicate Hai?

388
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,680
Mingyi entrusted him to me.

389
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
If I failed to teach him,

390
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
how can I face Mingyi?

391
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,880
Listen.

392
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,440
Call Xu.

393
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,040
Let Longquan be

394
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,760
the commander-in-chief.

395
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's deal
with what's in front of us first.

396
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
As for old accounts,

397
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,280
we'll investigate slowly.

398
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,960
The Chen family

399
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,520
are also members of the NCC.

400
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,920
If anything happens to them,

401
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,760
it'll do none any good.

402
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,720
Handle it internally.

403
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080
Keep it quiet.

404
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,080
Yes, Mr. Li.

405
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
I'll take care of it.

406
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,080
How was that possible?

407
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,000
I was so naive.

408
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,120
In high school, a girl

409
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,800
asked me to tell her a joke

410
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,160
when she was upset.

411
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,640
I thought

412
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,520
and thought.

413
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,960
Then I told her:

414
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,840
One day,

415
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,560
a constant function
and an exponential function

416
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
were walking down the street.

417
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,200
From afar,
they saw a differential operator.

418
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
The constant function

419
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,320
panicked.

420
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,360
Why?

421
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,360
Because if the differential operator
differentiates me,

422
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
I'll be gone.

423
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Stop him.

424
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,440
Stop him.

425
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,320
Hurry.

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,480
He said...

427
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Zhu Hongzhi.

428
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
Feng sent us for the money.

429
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,280
Is it ready?

430
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,280
I don't know him.

431
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,120
Who is Feng?

432
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,360
Playing dumb, huh?

433
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,240
The men who came before me
must've shown mercy,

434
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,760
so you didn't suffer enough.

435
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
I owe money,

436
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,680
but I don't pay just anyone.

437
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,360
Fine.

438
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
Since you don't know Feng,

439
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,200
how about Mr. Jiao?

440
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,280
Hand over the money.

441
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
Don't make things hard for us.

442
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,760
I have the money.

443
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,040
Name your price.

444
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,760
It's been one month until today.

445
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,040
The interest

446
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,760
is 500,000.

447
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,440
The money's in the trunk.

448
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,760
I'll have her fetch it.

449
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Run once I make a move.

450
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
Find a safe place and call the police.

451
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm not Zhu Hongzhi.

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Give me your contact info.

453
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,360
I'll help you reach him.

454
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
What are you waiting for? Beat him.

455
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,760
Hello, 110?

456
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,920
I'm at the underground parking lot
of Riyue Plaza.

457
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,600
There's an assault and robbery here.

458
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,040
[Police]

459
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm aware of what happened.

460
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,240
Leave the rest to us.

461
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,960
Officer,

462
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,440
will my friend be okay?

463
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,720
He was involved in gambling.

464
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,520
It's hard to say right now.

465
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,800
But you're impressive.

466
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,200
There were so many guys,

467
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
yet you didn't get hurt.

468
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,920
Did you use to be trained?

469
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
I can fight a little.

470
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,880
I'll teach that brat a lesson today.

471
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Zhu,

472
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
Hongzhi's already suffered enough.

473
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,960
If you scold him now,

474
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
you'll only push him further away.

475
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,240
Are you Zhu Hongzhi's family?

476
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,880
Come with me.

477
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,680
Mr. Hero,

478
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,760
do you know you nearly
scared me to death?

479
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,120
This isn't even my greatest feat.

480
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,400
Is that a compliment?

481
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,120
Listen.

482
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Next time,

483
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,200
walk away from this.

484
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,080
If they want money,

485
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
just give it to them.

486
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,920
No need to be a hero.

487
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
What would I do

488
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
if something happened to you?

489
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
Dear.

490
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,600
I know.

491
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,080
I promise you.

492
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,480
Let's go.

493
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,480
Dear.

494
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,040
You go wait for me at Ms. Fang's place.

495
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,600
Go ahead.

496
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,720
Fan.

497
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,520
What did you say?

498
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,480
Say it again.

499
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,120
I've made arrangements.

500
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,520
No one inside

501
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,560
will talk.

502
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,160
What about Zhu Hongzhi?

503
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,520
Can you shut him up?

504
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,920
Don't worry.

505
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,400
Gambling and debt
are two different things.

506
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,040
He hasn't seen me before.

507
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,360
I'll deal with Zhao Jiadi right now.

508
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,160
Wait for me.

509
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,680
Stop.

510
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,800
You don't need

511
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,880
to deal with Zhao Jiadi.

512
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,760
Tell the smugglers

513
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,920
to stop all transactions

514
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,240
within a week.

515
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,240
Also,

516
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,840
tell your men

517
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,120
to stay quiet for now.

518
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,600
Don't make me worry.

519
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
Okay?

520
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm not good

521
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,640
at expressing myself.

522
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,800
My apology

523
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
is in the drink.

524
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,480
Fan,

525
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
it was my fault first.

526
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

527
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,280
This is to you.

528
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,240
Kid,

529
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
I've thought about it.

530
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
If you had told me everything
from the start,

531
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,920
I might not have agreed to meet you,

532
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
let alone trust you.

533
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,400
These past few days,
I've been thinking at home.

534
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Back then, you said,

535
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,120
"intentions and actions matter,
not backgrounds."

536
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
You were right.

537
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,040
But that day,

538
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
I failed to live up to it.

539
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,640
Today,

540
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,000
I wanted to clear the air.

541
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,680
Also, I want to tell you

542
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
that I'll still invest

543
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
in your company.

544
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,680
Fan,

545
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,680
I can handle the money.

546
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,840
You're in the NCC now,

547
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,880
and there's Li Group in your way.

548
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,200
I can't put you in a tough spot.

549
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,440
Kid,

550
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,760
what do you think

551
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,080
the chamber of commerce is?

552
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,760
A bunch of people
pooling money for business

553
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,920
or gathering resources
to fight over turf?

554
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,000
Let me tell you.

555
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,720
A real chamber of commerce

556
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,280
is gathering people

557
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,680
with a common dream

558
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,840
and making that dream bigger.

559
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,920
Kid,

560
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
what's your dream?

561
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,240
Hai,

562
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,800
have you decided?

563
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,720
Decided what?

564
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,560
Li Minxian wants Fan Longquan
as the commander-in-chief.

565
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,160
If I can't get authority,

566
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,520
Sang Ke won't listen to me.

567
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Right?

568
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Zhao Jiadi.

569
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,400
Once again, Zhao Jiadi

570
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,000
miraculously ruined my plan.

571
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,520
Lin,

572
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,600
tell me.

573
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,560
Do I have a choice?

574
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
Understood. I'll take care of it.

575
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,400
Hurry then.

576
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,040
Back in 1996,

577
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,520
I took a bunch of guys from my village

578
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,200
and got a carpentry job
with a construction boss.

579
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,640
It was 16 yuan a day per person.

580
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,360
After 20 days of work,

581
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,760
one brother got his arm

582
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,520
caught in a sawing machine.

583
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,360
I paid him 20,000.

584
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,760
But later I found out

585
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
that he'd done it on purpose.

586
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,760
His mother and child were both sick,

587
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
waiting for money to save their lives.

588
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
But one arm

589
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,080
could only cover surgery for one.

590
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,480
The whole family talked it over,

591
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,160
and they chose to save the child.

592
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,400
I helped him gather another 10,000 yuan.

593
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,200
He kowtowed to me three times.

594
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
He didn't take it.

595
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,560
His mother was already gone

596
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,680
to avoid burdening him.

597
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,120
That day, I told myself:

598
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,840
Fan Longquan,

599
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,480
you have to make it big.

600
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,680
You have to make sure your brothers

601
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,840
can live with dignity.

602
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,840
Kid,

603
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,720
you're a little naive deep down

604
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,720
just like me.

605
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,560
Honestly,

606
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
you're not really cut out for business.

607
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
But if you use

608
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,720
the naivety the right way,

609
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,560
you'll go farther than most.

610
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,880
Fan.

611
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,640
Jiadi,

612
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,240
do your best.

613
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,440
In Hang City,

614
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,640
you've got me.
