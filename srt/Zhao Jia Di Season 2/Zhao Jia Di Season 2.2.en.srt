[Episode 2]

3
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,830
Did you order the buildings blown up?

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,190
Come on, sit.

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,910
I thought it was Fu Fang's idea

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,150
to turn unfinished buildings
into commercial district.

7
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,830
Zhao Sanjin, why are you doing this?

8
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,710
It's good you're thinking

9
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,350
about the guys below.

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,070
That shows you're kindhearted.

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,590
But don't forget

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,670
that we're in business,

13
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,430
not charity.

14
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,670
I put you in the chairman's seat

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,070
so you could lead everyone
to make money,

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,230
not throw it away.

17
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,710
You've delegated power for years.

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,270
Do you really know
company's situation?

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,270
Your so-called brothers
and loyal followers

20
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,270
are always forming cliques.

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,990
The employees underneath them
are full of complaints.

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,350
If those who really work
can't benefit,

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,990
over time,

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,110
we will lose staff's trust.

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,430
And Jinhai will completely rot.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,310
I built Jinhai from scratch.

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,230
Of course, I know that.

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,830
Do you think your little favors

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,150
are enough to win people over?

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,790
Kid, listen to me.

31
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,950
Running a company

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,030
and managing people

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,590
is 70% like raising a dog

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,790
and 30% like training a hawk.

35
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
Zhao Sanjin,

36
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,190
you've even found a way
to justify exploitation?

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,990
If that's true,

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,310
those people should thank you
for giving them slave chances,

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,270
right?

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,950
Don't get mad at me.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,790
If you're really capable,

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,830
go prove it.

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,590
The fact that I dare hand Jinhai
over to you

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,470
shows I have the confidence
to stay in control.

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,230
Jinhai is my blood and sweat.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,790
I won't let you mess it up.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,070
Everything has pros and cons.

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,670
What I want

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,710
is not harmony.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,030
I want profit.

51
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,550
Do you understand?

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,870
Do you know why Grandpa

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,030
never thought much of you?

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,390
Just causes much support

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
while unjust ones
have little.

56
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,950
You can stand by and watch

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,510
how you lose people's support.

Jiadi.

60
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,830
Take a break.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,950
Come and sit here.

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,510
Are you here to lobby for Zhao Xin?

63
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,430
Things between you two

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,950
should be handled yourselves.

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,230
I'm just bored

66
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,190
and want to play chess,

67
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,190
but no one plays with me.

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,830
Have a round?

69
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,510
I just can't calm my mind lately.

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,830
They say

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,630
we should keep calm in times of crisis.

72
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,870
It seems I've still got a ways to go.

73
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,550
The road is long and winding.

74
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,190
Some people dedicate
their whole lives to it,

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,830
yet you want
to get it all figured out already?

76
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,910
You're still too young and naive.

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,550
Please don't tease me now.

78
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,870
There's an old saying.

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,590
Those with small fortunes settle.

80
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,270
But I think that's wrong.

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,670
More like a small fortune brings security.

82
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,200
In such a big house,

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,640
there are a few people in it,

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,310
but they want so many things.

85
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,270
Mr. Huang,

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,670
do you think he and his people see me

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,750
as some kind of fool?

88
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,910
Before Qu Yuan
threw himself into the river,

89
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,590
he said that death was unavoidable

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,910
and he'd stop cherishing his body.

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,670
Before Zilu

92
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,790
met his end, he said

93
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,430
that a gentleman would not lose
his dignity even after death.

94
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,750
If you're a fool,

95
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,790
I guess they were both fools.

96
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,950
Baliang,

97
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,590
whatever you do,

98
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,950
and whoever you become,

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,750
there will always be some

100
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,910
who see you as a fool.

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,310
But it's those fools

102
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,270
who form the backbone

103
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,870
of a family and a country.

104
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,230
Your father, to outsiders,

105
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,430
seems like a tough man.

106
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,910
But your grandfather
never respected him.

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,750
Why?

108
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,870
Because he lacked compassion.

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,670
He let profit and desire

110
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,630
cloud his eyes.

111
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,190
And in doing so,

112
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,710
he lost his backbone.

113
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,470
If that's what it means to be clever,

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,830
then I'd rather

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,990
see you work hard to be a fool.

116
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,670
It's Ke.

117
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,950
Pick it up.

118
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,710
I heard you came back last week.

119
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,630
Why only call me now?

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,230
I just took over my dad's company.

121
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,630

It's on me.

124
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,750
It's my way to comfort you.

125
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,150
No problem.

126
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,270
Then I won't bring money.

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,210
You'll pay for the meal.

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,550
You're staying with your dad now, right?

129
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,750
Bao told me you two made peace.

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,150
Well,

131
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,670
it's complicated.

132
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,310
Let's talk about it after we meet.

133
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,750
Go wash your face,

134
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,110
and shave that scruffy beard,

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,270
so I can kiss your cheek when we meet.

136
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,190
Get lost.

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,390

Yange, you're out of school, right?

139
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,110
Dengke is back.

140
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,230
When did he get back?

141
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,110
I've missed him like crazy.

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,710
Yange, I've missed you.

Buying you
something good tonight, okay?

144
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,070
Did you hear that?

145
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,270
It's rare for Dengke to treat us.

146
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,630
We gotta make him pay
for something fancy.

147
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,910
Sounds good.

148
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,350
Where are you?

149
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,110
Okay, wait for me.

150
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,630
Where are we heading?

151
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,710
The internet cafe
we used to stay overnight at.

152
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,510
That kid is playing games there.

153
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,950
Good for him.

154
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,350
I miss the days in school.

155
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,630
I wish I could do it all over again.

156
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,790
What could you have done then?

157
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,990
Get dumped all over again?

158
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,790
I'll smack you.

159
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,110
Oh, I forgot to ask you.

160
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,790
Is your hair okay?

161
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,430
No one at the company said anything?

162
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,470
Don't be so uptight.

163
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,590
No one abroad cares about that.

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,110
It's work that matters.

165
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,070
When we pick up Yange, let me drive.

166
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,430
Using my car to practice?

167
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,430
Do you have a license?

168
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,430
Of course.

169
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,990
You're as shameless as ever.

170
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,350
If you keep doing this,
you won't make it.

171
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,830
I know.

172
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,030
Slow down.

173
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,070
No, you gotta get closer
to the white car.

174
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,590
I know. Stop talking.

175
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,950
Turn it all the way.

176
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,430
I know.

177
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,630
Are you okay?

178
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,110
I'm fine. Let's go check.

179
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,470
- Sorry.
- Can you drive?

180
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,150
Are you insane?

181

You're the insane one!

You're stealing parking spot here.

183

Oh, we're all schoolmates here.

184

You're the top student
who was always working.

185

We're graduated,

186
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,430
yet you still latch
onto Wu family, huh?

188
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,950
last time, I didn't get to hit you.

189
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,190
What a pity.

190
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,350
How about today?

191
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,590
Let's have a round?

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,910
Wu Dengke,

193
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,770
your family's company
is going under, right?

194
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,230
It makes sense.

195
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,670
You're hanging out
with a loser like him.

196
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,870
No wonder it's going bankrupt.

197
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,710
Screw you.

198
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,990
You're really asking for it.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,830
Yange.

200
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,790
Come back. Don't be rash.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,990
You got hit once
and still haven't learned?

202
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,510
So pathetic.

203
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,350
You have such a poor memory.

204
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,310
Sweetheart,

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,070
come to see old classmate.

206
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,270
I know what you did for her

207
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,470
back then.

208
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,590
You took notes for her,

209
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,270
brought milk,

210
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,100
and wrote love letters.

211
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,430
The day you saved up
to buy her that ring,

212
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,470
I was right upstairs at her place.

213
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,870
Xie Si cried her eyes out.

214
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,030
"Zikang,"

215
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,070
"I have no one to rely on now."

216
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,230
You were

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,830
like a lap dog to me,

218
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,870
waiting downstairs.

219
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,390
So tell me. Who's pathetic now?

220
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,150
Du...

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,470
I don't know if I'm pathetic.

222
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,830
But I know I can live with myself.

223
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,310
This is nuts.

224
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,510
Zikang.

225
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,790
Our parents are waiting inside.

226
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,270
Let's go in.

227
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,070
Kid,

228
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,950
here's a word of advice.

229
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,990
Next time you fall for someone,

230
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,390
look in the mirror and see

231
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,830
if you're worthy.

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,430
Let's go.

233
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,760
Wait.

234
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,550
I'll take your advice.

235
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,950
But you smashed my friend's car.
How are we settling that?

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,070
Several thousand should suffice.

237
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,190
I'll pay for that.

238
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,070
Here's ten thousand.

239
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,150
A little bonus for you.

240
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,590
Jiadi.

241
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,510
Yange, take it.

242
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,710
This guy's giving us a gift.

243
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,430
Thanks.

244
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,150
Zikang,

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,150
why are you so slow?

246
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,150
What happened?

247
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,190
Nothing.

248
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,430
Chairman Zhao,

249
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,950
we met at the last project meeting.

250
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,190
I'm Du Ping.

251
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,230
Do you remember me?

252
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,030
Dad...

253
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,990
Did my son

254
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,190
cause you any trouble?

255
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,990
No.

256
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,590
He just hit my friend's car.

257
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,630
It's been taken care of.

258
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,190
Then go get it fixed.

259
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,430
No need.

260
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,670
We're not eating here.

261
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,510
Let's go.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,790
Mr. Zhao,

263
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,630
our partnership...

264
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,590
What partnership?

265
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,870
I...

266
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,030
No one's gonna bully you
at school anymore.

267
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,990
I want out.

268
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,990
Do you understand?

269
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,550
Sorry for the long wait.

270
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,190
It's okay. I just got here.

271
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,470
Well.

272
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,710
Shall we go grab a bite?

273
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,510
What shall we eat?

274
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,310
Whatever you like.

275
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,830
Hop in.

276
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,870
You asked me out today

277
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,310
just to tell me

278
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,590
that Jinhai

279
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,670
shouldn't enter
the overseas mining market, right?

280
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,510
Our group has been
in Kalpunia for six years.

281
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,330
We've got
all the local connections covered.

282
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,230
No matter what you guys try,

283
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,550
you're just throwing eggs at a rock.

284
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,110
Why waste everyone's time?

285
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,230
Three months ago,
there was an internal military coup.

286
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,910
Even the governor's been replaced.

287
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,270
Your connections

288
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,430
are useless now, right?

289
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,190
The trunk may have fallen,

290
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,230
but the roots are still there.

291
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,630
We can be rivals at home,

292
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,870
but since we're going abroad,

293
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,750
shouldn't we be a bit more united?

294
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,590
Of course.

295
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,190
But when it comes
to the upcoming summit talks,

296
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,630
we need to be clear

297
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,390
about who's taking the lead.

298
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,870
Jinhai hasn't even entered
the mining area gate,

299
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,750
and you want

300
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,070
to call the shots?

301
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,310
You don't get to decide who's in charge.

302
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,070
Neither do I.

303
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,830
My boss is going,

304
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,070
so I'm just here

305
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,430
to get things done.

306
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,710
In the future,

307
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,830
don't contact me again

308
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,670
for something so pointless.

309
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,760
[Wei Jinghai,
General Manager of Li Group]

310
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,110
Mr. Fu,

311
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,150
pardon me for speaking out of turn.

312
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,070
The chairman is always targeting you,

313
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,790
and the former chairman
never step in.

314
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,030
You're so loyal to Jinhai.

315
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,150
Even I feel it's unfair to you.

316
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,670
That explosion Zhao Xin set off

317
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,750
was just to calm the rest of us down.

318
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,150
If he wanted to block the reform,

319
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,750
Zhao Jiadi would've long been finished.

320
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,590
Two tigers fight,

321
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,150
but the rope has to be in his hands,

322
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,030
so Jinhai will be safe.

323
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,390
No way.

324
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,390
The former chairman is using his son?

325
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,190
You're right.

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,670
We're just doing our jobs.

327
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,630
What I said just now is from Mr. Li.

328
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,590
I'm only passing the message along.

329
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,870
But meeting you in person

330
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,030
is my own choice.

331
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,310
Mr. Fu,

332
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,230
Jinhai isn't your only option

333
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,710
in this world.

334
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,430
If you run into any trouble,

335
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,990
just come to me.

336
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,550
There's a lot

337
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,510
I can decide on my own.

338
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,910
Here's my private number.

339
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,430
Please take it.

340
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,350
Remember what I said.

341
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,110
Anything.

342
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,470
Stop just guarding with your eyes.

343
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,910
You...

344
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,430
Hustling for rebounds?

345
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,470
You...

346
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,790
Try acting like a man, okay?

347
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,710
Last one.

348
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,350
Mine! Mine!

349
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,870
Why did you stop defending?

350
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,630
7:0.

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,270
Don't tell anyone
I taught you how to play.

352
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,750
You...

353
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,430
With skills like that,
how can you ask me to play?

354
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,630
Try again in 20 years.

355
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,870
I'm tired.

356
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm getting old.

357
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,550
Time to retire.

358
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,830
Have you ever played a real match?

359
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,710
I just

360
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,830
saw you on the sidelines.

361
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,590
You look sentimental.

362
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,070
What now?

363
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,030
You cried at dinner.

364
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,990
Isn't that enough?

365
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,230
I didn't cry.

366
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,950
As for Xie Si, I've moved on long ago.

367
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,390
I'm just feeling nostalgic.

368
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,150
How nice to be in school.

369
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,430
Things were so carefree back then.

370
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,430
You're right.

371
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,110
School days were the best.

372
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,190
When my dad got hospitalized,

373
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,110
I realized I had to grow up

374
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,910
and take care of the family.

375
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,550
But it's hard.

376
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,390
Baliang, why's it so hard to be a man?

377
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,470
That's easy.

378
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,790
Get reincarnated as a woman next time.

379
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,910
I'll graciously take you in.

380
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,390
Get lost.

381
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,070
You look so bad.
Still want me?

382
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,670
Tell me.

383
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,710
What do you want?

384
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,070
Want? What could I want?

385
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,550
Can't I just invite you

386
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,190
for food and drinks?

387
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,830
Sure.

388
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,550
Then I'm leaving.

389
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,310
How'd you know I had something to say?

390
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,110
How do I know?

391
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,070
We've known each other
since we were in diapers.

392
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,670
Tell me now.

393
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,510
I...

394
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,430
haven't figured out how to say it yet.

395
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,590
I know

396
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,150
you're not in full control

397
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,990
of Jinhai right now.

398
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,710
I don't want to make things
harder for you.

399
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,310
Fine. Yange.

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,470
Back when I was studying abroad,
I switched to business school.

401
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,750
Then I met a genius.

402
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,750
He didn't have much money

403
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,590
but always roped us into investing.

404
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,310
Have you heard of Kalpunia?

405
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,830
He insisted on putting serious money

406
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,910
in developing a district there.

407
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,430
Everyone thought he was a fraud.

408
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,110
But I, dumb as I was, went in.

409
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,190
There's a rich, high-quality
mineral vein under that land.

410
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,310
The survey just came in.

411
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,390
Now, I'm sitting on a gold mine.

412
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,870
Isn't that great news?

413
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,950
But I've got no money to develop it.

414
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,910
Actually,

415
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,110
my dad's company

416
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,710
has been going downhill.

417
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,790
It doesn't have much money left.

418
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,110
At first, I thought

419
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,990
just the mining wouldn't cost much.

420
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,310
Maybe bits here and there work.

421
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,070
But the deeper I looked into it,

422
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,950
the more I realized

423
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,830
that exploitation is the cheap part.

424
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,150
Pipelines, roads, docks and so on came one

425
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,750
after another.

426
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,710
They all cost money.

427
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,750
And I...

428
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,470
Did you try the bank?

429
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,350
I did.

430
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,830
But I don't meet the loan conditions.

431
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,710
Banks don't care about long-term gains.

432
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,590
No point painting them a pretty picture.

433
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,310
I could raise funds,

434
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,710
but as you know, financial institutions
want something more.

435
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,510
I don't want

436
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,510
to lose control of this.

437
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,110
Come on, drink up.

438
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,310
So, I'll be blunt with you.

439
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,830
Go ahead.

440
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,750
I've thought it through.

441
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,510
Your family

442
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,790
has money,

443
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,830
and we're brothers.

444
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,430
I know your family.

445
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,950
We trust each other.

446
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,070
But don't feel pressured.

447
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,990
The exact terms and conditions

448
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,990
are negotiable.

449
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,590
When it comes to profit,

450
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,750
Jinhai can take the meat.

451
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,670
We're happy with soup.

452
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,030
All I want

453
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,990
is to do something solid

454
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,550
and show my dad I can do this.

455
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,110
You're always pretending to be serious.

456
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,710
Alright.

457
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,590
Bring me the documents tomorrow.

458
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,390
I'll take them to the meeting.

459
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,390
It's a solid project.

460
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,430
Nothing's wrong with it.

461
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,910
As for the profit,

462
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,790
as long as Jinhai gets a proper share,

463
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,670
you can have the rest.

464
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,030
What are you staring at?

465
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,520
Cheers.

466
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,470
Thanks.

467
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,110
Don't forget
to bring files tomorrow.

468
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,510
For Mr. Wu's project,

469
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,790
it was equity pledges
in the first place, right?

470
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,950
Why has it become an equity investment?

471
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,870
That was his idea.

472
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,430
Their development contract

473
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,190
has a time limit.

474
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,310
He's worried the Administration

475
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,590
might cancel it.

476
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,670
Besides, it's less risky

477
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,550
for Jinhai.

478
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,110
Have both sides' legal teams
checked it?

479
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,110
Yes.

480
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,190
I shouldn't get too involved
in this project,

481
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,910
so you handle the details.

482
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,390
Put everything on the table,

483
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,430
and lay out the pros and cons.

484
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,230
Don't worry.

485
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,350
So, we've gone through

486
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,190
the early stages now.

487
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,110
You don't need
to follow up anymore, right?

488
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,750
The following steps won't be hard.

489
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,870
Newcomers should be given a chance.

490
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,270
Besides, I don't want to wear you out.

491
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,950
There are future projects after all.

492
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,510
Ms. He, go and call him.

493
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,320
Sure.

494
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,830
Good morning, Mr. Zhao.

495
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,630
Morning.

496
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,790
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning.

497
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,030
We were just about to call you.

498
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,030
These eggs were boiled

499
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,550
with cordyceps,

500
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,990
reishi, angelica,

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,230
and fleeceflower root.

502
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,190
I remember we had this

503
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,830
in Hang City ten years ago, right?

504
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,910
Ke sent it.

505
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,990
Ingredients aren't rare,

506
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,430
but it's the thought that counts.

507
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,790
Dongcao.

508
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,430
How is

509
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,790
Jiadi's deal with him going?

510
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,070
It's going through the process.

511
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,230
It should be close

512
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,150
to signing contract.

513
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,790
I don't think friends and business

514
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,670
should mix.

515
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,870
All Jiadi thinks about
is helping a friend.

516
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,750
He's never thought about his family.

517
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,190
Sanjin,

518
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,110
Jiadi is taking over
the branch's power...

519
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,910
Just eat.

520
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,470
No business talk at the table.

521
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,630
Did you hear?

522
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,350
HQ took back the power from the branch.

523
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,070
Zhao Dabiao
and Xu Zhenhong's companies are fine.

524
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,470
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

525
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,710
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

526
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,430
No way. Isn't Mr. Huang

527
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,870
of the North Branch related
to the Zhao family?

528
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,510
You don't know the full story.

529
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,110
The former chairman's wife

530
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,910
is not the chairman's biological mother.

531
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,150
She's got a son of her own.

532
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,030
Actually, no formal actions
have been taken.

533
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,270
The chairman's just doing an audit.

534
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,630
An audit?

535
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,470
So, publicly,

536
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,230
he's targeting his family,

537
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,030
but in reality...

538
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,230
I was wondering why Guo Ning's team

539
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,430
has been in and out like ghosts.

540
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,430
They must be helping the chairman.

541
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,070
Mr. Zhao...Zhao...

542
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,310
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mr. Zhao.

543
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,670
Since you enjoy gossiping,

544
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,110
come and chat in my office.

545
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,750
How big is the actual deficit?

546
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,750
Based on a rough estimate,

547
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,950
it's less

548
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,510
than 200 million.

549
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,030
What?

550
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,550
I told you

551
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,630
to dial it back.

552
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,790
We had no choice.

553
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,230
Mr. Fu, we've got a lot of people
to take care of.

554
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,910
Last month, you said we'd give some
to the shareholders...

555
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,710
We finished checking
the branch's ledgers.

556
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,190
Compared with headquarters' ledgers,

557
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,070
there's about a 60 million discrepancy.

558
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,430
Continue to track the funds.

559
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,390
Now I need to know

But they stopped me

574
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,510
and said it involved company secrets

575
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,350
and we'd need authorization
from the former chairman.

sooner or later.

They brought up some clauses

622

as a business.

talk to your brother,
