00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,430
Mr. Fan only sees me

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,590
as someone he respects, nothing more.

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,910
There's no real bond or trust yet.

6
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,710
I need to help him out first.

7
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,910
He should see

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,750
what kind of person I am,

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,950
and what I can actually do.

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,990
Then I'll come clean with him.

11
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,630
I know the NCC sticks together,

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,790
and Li Group is always in the mix.

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,710
But for now, there's no real chance

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,790
to meet Wei Jinghai.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,870
Still, I think
I should test his attitude.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,590
Actually, I can offer you a chance.

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,350
I came to Hang City

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,190
to handle some old disputes.

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,750
The person who asked to meet with me

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,270
is the head of the Chen Family.

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,150
Chen Zhuhe.

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,350
Wei Jinghai will probably be there too.

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,870
I can take you there.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,390
But I don't think you should go.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,790
You're just not like them.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,030
And for you right now,

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,190
Wei Jinghai is way too dangerous.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,430
Getting close to him

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,630
won't do you any good.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,830
I mentioned you to him before,

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,470
so he might recognize you.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,790
Yanzhi,

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,430
have some fruit.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,590
Thank you.

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,830
You're welcome.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,390
Thank you.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,270
My pleasure.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,390
Ms. Cai.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,030
Wei Jinghai and I have no business ties.

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,190
Even if Jinhai and Li Group have issues,

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,310
that was from the last generation.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,670
Here's how I see it.

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,590
Wei Jinghai made it this far,

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,110
so he must be pretty sharp.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,790
If he values old ties,

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,270
I'm okay with that.

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,470
Even if we don't end up

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,670
working together with the NCC,

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,830
I can accept that outcome.

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,630
But if he's just in it for profit,

51
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,350
then things get simpler.

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,670
We just lay our cards on the table

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,630
and play it straight.

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,790
Jiadi, I'm not here
to talk you out of it,

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,550
but I need you to know the risks.

56
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,510
I don't know much

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,070
about the NCC.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,230
But let's say,

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,830
the partnership
between Wei Jinghai and Fan Longquan

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,390
isn't what you think it is,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,870
and Wei Jinghai knows who you are.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,590
He might use it against you.

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,750
So what will you do?

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,830
Ms. Cai.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,390
You give me too much credit.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,750
I'm just a newbie to them.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,030
He's the General Manager at Li Group,

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
and I'm just an intern
waiting to go full-time.

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,670
Why would he bother coming after me?

70
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,910
It doesn't make sense.

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,910
That'd be a real loss of face.

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,710
Besides,

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,030
being Zhao Xin's son

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,470
is like I'm carrying

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,950
around a ticking time bomb.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,990
Honestly, I'm curious
to see how they react.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,430
If they don't care about the truth,

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,310
and just shift all their anger

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,750
at Zhao Xin onto me,

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,830
let them be.

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,430
Ms. Cai.

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,870
Honestly, I respect Fan.

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,430
He has this drive about him.

84
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,830
It's exactly what I wish I had.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,630
If things are bound to fall apart,

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,550
I'd rather it happens sooner.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,150
It's better than
waiting until feelings grow,

88
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,110
and then it hits even harder.

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,150
Alright then.

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,310
You've grown up.

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,910
You're not that Zhao Jiadi anymore,

92
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,430
the one who wanted to jump in the river
after a breakup.

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,790
Ms. Cai, you're teasing me.

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,190
That wasn't just about a breakup.

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,230
Everything just happened all at once.

96
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,470
Alright, fine.

97
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,470
The meeting's set for tomorrow.

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,990
That's pretty much
walking into the lion's den.

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,430
Aren't you scared?

100
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,950
Of course not.

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,990
Mr. Zhang, that's all I remember.

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,710
I've told you everything.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,630
Zhao Jiadi

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,230
knows himself pretty well.

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,590
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

106
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,830
Thanks.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,790
Alright, go ahead.

108
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,070
Okay.

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,470
I'm heading out.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,080
Start the car.

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,110
Let's go see Hai.

112

Boss.

114
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,550
Tell them to carry everything inside.

115
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,230
Got it.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,870
Be careful with those.

117
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,670
Don't break anything.

118
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,030
Hurry and bring them in.

119
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,270
My dear sis,

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,470
don't you want to give your brother

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,390
a real hug.

122
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,190
We haven't seen each other in months.

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,270
Even the way you greet me has changed.

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,390
Fangfei.

125
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,430
I'm back. Where's Xin?

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,710
He's in the study. Go on.

127
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,790
Then I'll head up.

128
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,070
Ruiyang.

129
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,670
Make sure you grab this chance.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,990
Don't let Xin down.

131
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,670
Don't worry, Fangfei.

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,510
I'll earn you and Yange

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,070
a bright future.

134

[The ninth of Yonghe era, Ji Shanyin]

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,430
That's enough practice.

136
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,110
Buying one is easier.

137
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,430
Buy me another batch tomorrow.

138
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,670
Come in.

139
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,950
Xin.

140
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,710
Ruiyang, you're back.

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,110
I came back

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,230
as soon as you called.

143
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,230
Thanks for your hard work.

144
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,790
It's what I should do.

145
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,070
Come on, have a seat.

146
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,630
After you, please.

147
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,670
Come, sit down.

148
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,190
Xin,

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,310
you were exactly right.

150
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,830
There is something off with Fu Fang.

151
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,150
When I got to the mining site,

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,830
that Sang Ke guy came over.

153
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,270
Ruiyang,

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,670
let's not talk about this today.

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,230
The Nanshan Chamber of Commerce
wants to expand.

156
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,430
What do you think about that?

157
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,390
To be honest, Xin,

158
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,830
the moment I heard the news,

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,110
I started thinking about it.

160
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,790
They entered the mining site early.

161
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,030
In terms of time and equipment,

162
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,470
we really can't compete.

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,670
Plus,

164
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,190
the mining project

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,070
is directly tied to Jinhai's cash flow.

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,830
I think our top priority

167
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,270
is to get our mining up and running.

168
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,390
We need to expedite delivery.

169
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,630
So,

170
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,270
we need a shortcut.

171
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,990
A shortcut?

172
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,230
Yeah, using the NCC's route.

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,190
Xin,

174
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,190
Fan Longquan's logistics hub
is less than

175
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,790
5 km north of our mining site.

176
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,710
Past that is NCC's power station.

177
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,830
To the northwest is Li Group's dock.

178
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,590
We just need to fix up

179
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,790
the road to the logistics hub,

180
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,070
then we can link up with the NCC.

181
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,710
We can move goods out fast.

182
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,870
If they want to expand,

183
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,790
they'll need to upgrade their gear.

184
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,830
We could cover those costs.

185
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,390
Plus,

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,590
the south side already has water access.

187
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,110
It's a win-win for everyone.

188
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,470
Let's just team up.

189
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,390
You've thought this through, huh?

190
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,350
Business is always changing.

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,430
Nothing stays the same forever.

192
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,590
When it comes to interests,

193
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,870
there are no lasting enemies.

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,070
Alright, since you're so sure,

195
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,430
then you handle it.

196
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,390
Go take a trip to Hang City,

197
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,190
and talk through a contract with them.

198
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,070
Whether it's Li Group,

199
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,390
or Fanlong Group,

200
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,630
it doesn't matter.

201
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,590
A bunch of Johns and James.

202
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,390
It's just a business deal.

203
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,350
Let's put it in writing.

204
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,030
Xin, I...

205
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,230
You can do this.

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,110
Be confident.

207
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,750
What is it?

208
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,830
Anything else?

209
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,030
Um...

210
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,110
I'll head out now.

211
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,150
Xin.

212
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,670
Don't worry.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,310
About this matter,

214
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,110
I'll do my best.

215
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,150
Have a good night.

216
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,310
Boss,

217
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,550
are you really giving this
to Huang Ruiyang?

218
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,990
Aren't you afraid he'll mess it up?

219
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,790
It's about

220
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,310
using the right people,

221
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,030
not just numbers.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,390
As long as you pick the right people,

223
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,270
your goal just falls into place.

224
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,510
That Wei

225
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,070
set up such a huge game for me,

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,990
just to force me to give in to him.

227
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,030
But since he took the wrong path,

228
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,270
I'll just stir up
Hang City's waters myself.

229
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,510
Let Li see for himself,

230
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,150
the Nanshan Chamber of Commerce

231
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,910
is no longer what it used to be.

232
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,310
I'll personally take back

233
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,990
what belongs to Wu Dengke,

234
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,470
and return them to him.

235
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,190
With the way you are now,

236
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,390
and your friend too,

237
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,230
you're in no place
to challenge Zhao Xin.

238
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,110
Jinhai has always had one rival,

239
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,870
the Li Group.

240
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,390
All companies running in Kalpunia

241
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,070
formed an alliance

242
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,310
named
the Nanshan Chamber of Commerce.

243
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,790
The chamber's total share adds up

244
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,150
to about 70% of the old mining site.

245
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,710
The chairman is the real owner
of Li Group.

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,710
His name is Li Minxian.

247
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,030
I came to Hang City

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,150
to deal with some old disputes.

249
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,150
Wei Jinghai will probably show up too.

250
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,390
I can take you there.

251
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,390
But honestly,
I don't think you should go.

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,750
You and them aren't on the same side.

253
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,830
Plus, for you right now,

254
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,910
Wei Jinghai is just too dangerous.

255
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,870
Mr. Wei.

256
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,310
Hello, Mr. Wei.

257
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,620
[Fenghong Club]

258
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,350
Ms. Cai, we meet again.

259
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,830
Mr. Chen, have a seat.

260
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,670
So, what's on your mind?

261
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,190
Let's get straight to the point.

262
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,990
No rush.

263
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,070
Have some tea first.

264
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,830
Ms. Cai, I'll be direct.

265
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,870
I invited you here,

266
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,470
hoping you'd do me a favor

267
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,510
and help smooth things over

268
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,670
with Mr. Chen.

269
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,670
Let me be clear about this.

270
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,350
I'm not someone who likes to owe favors.

271
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,630
I don't need anyone
to do me a favor either.

272
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,030
Cai Yanzhi,

273
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,630
aren't you being a bit...

274
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,190
Mr. Chen.

275
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,910
Li Group and the Chen family
have worked together for years.

276
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,110
I know

277
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,950
what Mr. Chen is dealing with.

278
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,270
Those 150 tons of goods

279
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,390
mean a lot to Mr. Chen.

280
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,790
If you want to take legal action,

281
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,670
it involves
collecting evidence abroad,

282
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,870
which is time-consuming and tiring.

283
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,310
So, my suggestion to both of you is

284
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,430
settling on an amount privately,

285
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,390
and you both make a compromise.

286
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,190
Mr. Wei, I don't get it.

287
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,350
The goods weren't lost on my end,

288
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,190
so why should I pay for this?

289
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Cai Yanzhi,

290
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,270
aren't you just twisting the facts?

291
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,030
You were the one who shipped the goods.

292
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,870
Your team opened the container.

293
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,270
If they weren't lost with you,

294
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,150
then where did they go?

295
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,030
I've already seen your delivery records.

296
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,990
It's all just worthless slag and rubble,

297
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,710
so honestly, I'm curious,

298
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,950
who would pay seventy or eighty grand

299
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,190
just to ship back a pile of junk?

300
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,390
But what I'm even more curious about is

301
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,590
that Chen Zhuhe lost the shipment,

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,630
yet you're in such a hurry
to step up. Why?

303
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,550
Ms. Cai, to be honest,

304
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,750
I became sworn brothers
with Mr. Chen first.

305
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,470
Your issue happened after that.

306
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,790
So, since my friend's in trouble,

307
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,070
shouldn't I step up?

308
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,630
If it's my share to pay,

309
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,030
I'll pay for it without question.

310
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,870
If it's not on me,

311
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,150
I won't chip in a single cent.

312
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,080
Ms. Cai,

313
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,470
I asked to work with you at the dock,

314
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,630
but you turned me down.

315
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,070
This time, I hope you'll do me a favor,

316
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,270
but again, you refused.

317
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,550
I am Wei Jinghai,

318
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,190
the CEO of Li Group.

319
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,030
Maybe I'm not that important,

320
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,510
but Ms. Cai,

321
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,590
you rely on the NCC for work

322
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,710
at the mining district in Kalpunia.

323
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,110
Everyone knows

324
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,390
that we have close ties with Jinhai.

325
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,270
But you openly

326
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,550
keep Zhao Xin's son by your side.

327
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,030
I'd like to ask
on behalf of President Li,

328
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,870
what exactly are you trying to do?

329
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,990
Ms. Cai means

330
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,990
there's something off
about the missing goods.

331
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,550
Let's wait until we get the facts.

332
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,590
As for what we're hiding,

333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,350
we just haven't had the chance
to explain.

334
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,990
Mr. Wei,

335
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,230
I've been in Hang City for a while now.

336
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,470
I've heard a bit
about the NCC's history with Jinhai,

337
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,390
so I know the story.

338
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,790
I came here today,

339
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,670
hoping to get help from the NCC

340
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,230
and take on Jinhai together.

341
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,390
You mean

342
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,470
you want to

343
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,750
take on

344
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,670
your own father.

345
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,190
Why should I trust you?

346
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,590
Jinhai went into Kalpunia

347
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,830
and took my friend's mine.

348
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,790
I want to get it back from Zhao Xin,

349
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,790
and return it to its rightful owner.

350
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,150
Mr. Wei, you don't believe me.

351
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,950
I do.

352
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,750
I just didn't expect

353
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,310
Zhao Xin's son

354
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,390
to stand up for a friend

355
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,430
and go against his own father.

356
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,030
What a loving family.

357
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,310
By the way,

358
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,230
I have nothing against Jinhai.

359
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,270
You need to work with the NCC now.

360
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,470
That's fine.

361
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,230
What do you offer in return?

362
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,190
I'm embarrassed to say.

363
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,990
Right now, I don't have much to offer.

364
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,510
But Mr. Wei, you can name your terms.

365
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,790
I'll see if I can make it happen.

366
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,190
Ms. Cai,

367
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,910
he probably can't.

368
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,990
But you can.

369
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,390
I remember, back then, for him,

370
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,230
you gave away an entire jade market

371
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,390
to Chen Hongxiong.

372
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,550
I can't settle for less than he got.

373
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,630
Mr. Wei,

374
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,430
this is my business.

375
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,750
It has nothing to do with her.

376
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,470
Hear that?

377
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,830
How are you suddenly an outsider?

378
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,280
Ms. Cai,

379
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,150
looks like that stone you picked up

380
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,750
isn't so special after all.

381
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,950
Zhao Jiadi,

382
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,790
you want to stand up for your friend.

383
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,830
We all know

384
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,430
the best way is to stay close
to Zhao Xin.

385
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,350
But you didn't do that.

386
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,110
Are you thinking of giving in

387
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,950
to Zhao Xin?

388
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,590
Why not choose me?

389
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,070
Let's get to know each other first.

390
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,150
Maybe one day when I'm in a good mood,

391
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,710
I'll help you out.

392
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,310
What do you think?

393
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,470
Mr. Wei,

394
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,870
if you feel we're not equals,

395
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,590
I won't push it.

396
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,470
But here's a piece of advice for you.

397
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,910
For this NCC project,

398
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,230
knowing Zhao Xin as I do,

399
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,110
I don't think he'd just give in

400
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,190
like you expect.

401
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,150
Are you saying

402
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,630
I'm not capable enough?

403
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,830
That's not what I mean.

404
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,350
I just want you to know

405
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,590
we share the same goal.

406
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,510
Even if we can't be friends,

407
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,350
there's no need to be enemies.

408
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,630
Mr. Wei,

409
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,830
looks like we won't reach a deal today.

410
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,310
Why don't we both think it over?

411
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,070
I'll take my leave for now.

412
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,950
Jiadi,

413
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,270
let's go.

414
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,630
Wei Jinghai,

415
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,550
what does that mean?

416
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,390
Zhao Jiadi,

417
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,590
it's a small world, huh?

418
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,550
Do we know each other?

419
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,190
That's putting it mildly.

420
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,590
My buddy got detained

421
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,790
because of you.

422
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,310
Mr. Jiao.

423
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,030
Things have to be settled today.

424
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,430
Or no one

425
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,390
is walking away from here.

426
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,430
Who do you think you are?

427
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,990
Mr. Jiao,

428
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,430
if we actually fight,

429
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,350
whoever wins,

430
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,390
it won't just be these guys
going to prison.

431
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,710
It's just a fight,

432
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,590
and you called the cops?

433
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,630
I'm honestly impressed.

434
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,590
Coward.

435
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:38,990
Yeah,

436
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,870
I am a coward.

437
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,110
Mr. Jiao,

438
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,310
let it go.

439
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,870
Do me a favor.

440
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,830
Zhao Jiadi.

441
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,190
I'll remember you.

442
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,790
Let's talk
when you have something to offer.

443
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,910
Thanks.

444
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,030
I'm heading back to the office.

445
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,990
Go to the hospital.

446
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,030
I'm fine.

447
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,830
You've met him now.

448
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,390
What's your next move?

449
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,790
Wei Jinghai is neither

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,190
of those two types I mentioned.

451
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,350
After meeting today,

452
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,390
I have two questions.

453
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,640
First,

454
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,470
just like you said,

455
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,670
why did the Chen family go so far

456
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,430
to bring over things
that aren't worth much?

457
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,550
When you were talking just now,

458
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,390
Wei Jinghai kept watching your face.

459
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,550
It's like he was testing you.

460
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,550
Second, about Mr. Jiao,

461
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,070
he clearly isn't running
a legit business.

462
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,590
But Wei Jinghai seems
pretty close to him.

463
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,830
It's not clear what their relationship

464
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,430
really is.

465
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,590
There's definitely more going on here.

466
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,470
Ms. Cai.

467
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,190
Can you do me a favor?

468
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,590
Go ahead.

469
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,830
Find out more about Mr. Jiao.

470
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,070
At least we should know
what we're up against.

471
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,950
Alright.

472
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,110
Boss,

473
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,150
we want to go sea fishing.

474
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,470
The kind you do at night.

475
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,550
There's no sea around here.

476
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,830
Try asking somewhere else.

477
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,550
Friends from all over have come.

478
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,550
Guests are arriving from everywhere.

479
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,190
I know how things work.

480
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,680
Young man,

481
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,510
I have no idea where you heard that.

482
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,790
But listen,

483
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,270
things are pretty wild here at night.

484
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,990
It's not the place for you.

485
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,670
So, head out.

486
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,830
Hey man,

487
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,310
sounds a bit like
you're looking down on us.

488
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,190
You know Pengcheng Club, right?

489
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,430
My family owns that place.

490
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,990
All the big names go there.

491
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,670
You really think

492
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,310
I can't pay up?

493
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,870
Alright then.

494
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,470
Fan Longquan is looking for Zhao Jiadi.

495
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,590
He really knows how to read people.

496
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,830
Should I keep watching
those futures trades...

497
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,310
Do you think

498
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,070
we'll lose?

499
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,230
No way that's happening.

500
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,590
Business is like a battlefield.

501
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,430
If you want to play the good guy,

502
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,870
you have to outsmart the bad ones.

503
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,910
Zhao Jiadi just isn't up to it.

504
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,670
So for us right now...

505
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,950
The most important thing

506
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,590
is still the joint expansion.

507
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,110
Sang Ke keeps pushing us.

508
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,110
The gap just keeps getting bigger.

509
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,990
Dragging this out won't help.

510
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,750
But at this moment,
someone is making trouble.

511
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,470
Should I

512
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,030
take some cash from the casino first?

513
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,470
Even if the casino funds

514
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,870
get laundered,

515
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,110
it won't solve much.

516
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,310
I asked you to check
Fan Longquan's company,

517
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,910
see if there's anyone we can use.

518
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,030
Any progress on that?

519
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,510
I'm on it.

520
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,350
So...

521
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,870
we just let go of Zhao Jiadi like that.

522
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,430
Zhao Jiadi is just a piece on the board.

523
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,590
He isn't even qualified
to play against me yet.

524
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,710
But he's an active piece,
not just for show.

525
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,590
Figure out

526
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,830
how to use him.

527
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,150
In a bit, you get off at the front.

528
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,510
Don't forget about

529
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,350
what I told you to do.

530
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,590
Relax, I won't.

531
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,630
That's all I know so far.

532
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,310
Well,

533
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,190
should we go to the meeting first,

534
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,350
or should we meet Mr. Fan first?

535
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,310
I can set it up for you.

536
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,710
Jiadi,

537
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,670
let me give you some advice about this.

538
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,150
Don't rush things just yet.

539
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,750
Our department has close ties

540
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,110
with the bosses from the NCC.

541
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,390
Now President Li
is thinking of retiring.

542
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,230
Mr. Fan, the one you know,

543
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,350
and Mr. Wei from Mr. Li's side

544
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,630
are competing with each other.

545
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,750
At a time like this,

546
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,310
there are too many
personal factors involved.

547
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,350
It's not the right moment for us

548
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,680
to get involved.

549
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,190
Mr. Jin,

550
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,190
I think it's doable.

551
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,830
Our project with the Lis at Risheng

552
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,910
was something Jufeng didn't even want.

553
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,990
I've said it before,

554
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,750
there's no point trading favors here.

555
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,750
Now that we have this chance,

556
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,710
I think it's great.

557
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,590
This is just business.

558
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,790
Let's not complicate it
with personal stuff.

559
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,990
Mr. Fan specifically mentioned Jiadi,

560
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,670
which isn't even your department's job.

561
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,110
Besides,

562
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,830
when the time comes, you take the lead

563
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,350
and use Mr. Zhang's connections.

564
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,790
They'll definitely shut it down
in the meeting.

565
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,510
If anything else comes up,
we'll handle it then.

566
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,030
Alright, you're impressive.

567
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,950
I'll back you at the meeting.

568
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,910
Alright.

569
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,750
I'm heading out now.

570
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,630
Jiadi, come with me
to see the client tomorrow.

571
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,350
Don't forget.

572
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,910
It's almost overdue.

573
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,400
No big deal.

574
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,150
Boss, I'll set up a meeting
with Mr. Fan first.

575
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,910
You should meet him.

576
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,710
Alright.

577
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,830
Okay, I'll head downstairs.

578
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,550
Wait a second.

579
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,950
I have something for you.

580
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,390
Take it.

581
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,990
Suit.

582
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,390
First impressions matter.

583
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,630
Don't embarrass yourself.

584
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,190
Boss.

585
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,870
No need to thank me.

586
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,550
Submit your expenses. Get to work.

587
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,140
[Pengcheng Club]

588
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,350
You can head back now.

589
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,110
See? This spot too.

590
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,190
Security should cover this area.

591
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,030
[Mingde Building]
Have a seat.

592
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,230
Mr. Wei.

593
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,150
You may go now.

594
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,110
Mr. Xu and the others have arrived.

595
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,430
Let me take you in.

596
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,950
Are you Fan's colleague,

597
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,550
Zhu Fengping?

598
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,190
Nice to meet you.

599
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,710
This way, please.

600
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

601
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,990
There was traffic on the way.

602
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,950
I'm really sorry about that.

603
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,830
Uncle Xu, Fan.

604
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,710
Mr. Xu,

605
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,790
let's get started.

606
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,430
Alright.

607
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,750
The reason I called everyone here today

608
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,270
is pretty simple.

609
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,750
It's about the joint venture shares.

610
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,030
We've discussed this for a long time.

611
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,950
Today, we need to settle it.

612
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,430
The value of the mining rights
for this land

613
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,190
is currently set at 12 billion.

614
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,910
The government gave us three months

615
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,150
to make the payment.

616
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,870
Everyone,

617
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,350
just do what you can.

618
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,830
If you have any requests,

619
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,550
please bring them up now.

620
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,710
Mr. Xu, I don't think
it has to be this complicated.

621
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,950
Why not just do it like before?

622
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,110
The Li family's strength

623
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,270
is clear to everyone here.

624
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,710
Now the scale's even bigger.

625
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,910
If they take the lead,

626
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,030
we'd all feel more secure.

627
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,750
Mr. Qian, you owe your job to the Lis,

628
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,430
so you shouldn't have a say.

629
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,670
Mr. Xu, let me be honest.

630
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,510
When Mr. Li was around,

631
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,790
things were different.

632
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,710
But now,

633
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,430
the Li family is managed by Mr. Wei.

634
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,150
For all those construction
and operation projects,

635
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,870
if he's the one in charge,

636
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,670
I can't accept that.

637
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,190
Mr. Zhou,

638
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,750
no need to raise your voice like that.

639
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,030
About the construction of Port No. 2,

640
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,990
I've explained it to you before.

641
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,390
I know you're not happy about this.

642
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,390
I get where you're coming from.

643
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,830
But business is business.

644
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,110
So, I hope

645
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,590
we can keep feelings out of it.

646
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,950
Uncle Xu,

647
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,710
for twelve billion,

648
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,070
Li Group

649
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,150
will take 40 percent.

650
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,790
That 40 percent shares,

651
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,430
plus management rights,

652
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,230
are what I want.
