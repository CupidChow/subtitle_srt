[Episode 14]

3
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,790
I've just renovated the pipes here.

4
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,870
It cost a lot of money.

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,990
It's been hard on me.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,110
I still have loans to pay.

7
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,070
We didn't make up that compensation.

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,990
There's a standard for it.

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,030
Otherwise, why would the others agree?

10
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,030
What the others agree to

11
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,150
has nothing to do with us.

12
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,590
My boss is talking to you.

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,950
Put your leg down.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,390
Put it down.

15
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,430
Fine, I'll put it down.

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,390
Why are you shouting?

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,030
You're Mr. Liu, right?

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,550
Relocation is a big deal.

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,230
My relatives insist on coming along.

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,590
They're from the countryside.

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,990
They have no sense of manners.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,870
Please excuse them.

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,990
Alright, sit down.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,230
No need to be so intense.

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,590
Ms. Fang, cook something for them.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,470
Mr. Liu, let's talk business.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,230
The compensation you're offering

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,510
is based on the multiplication
of the demolished building's area

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,030
and the total of the replacement cost

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,470
of the building
that's been calculated with a new price,

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,590
the new housing price
per square meter in the same area,

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,950
and the price subsidy, right?

33
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,710
Right?

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,550
Put your leg down.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,990
Sorry, I forgot.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,870
Relax.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,510
You can drink and talk.

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,310
Drink and talk.

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,630
This building is commercial property.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,870
You can't talk to my sister about it
like it's a regular store.

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,190
That's unreasonable.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,590
Whether it's reasonable or not,

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,190
it's all written here.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,470
Take a look yourself.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,070
The businesses upstairs
are all wholesale.

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,030
The building may seem shabby,

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,270
but there are a lot of orders.

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,270
Let me put it this way.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,550
You could treat this building

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,870
as a commercial city.

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,590
To relocate a commercial shop,
you should compensate three times.

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,190
You need to offer
three times the amount.

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,550
There will be

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,630
almost a million more.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,790
What? Almost a million?

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,030
You were insisting

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,350
that no one could sign it

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,910
unless we sign it first.

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,030
But if they knew
they could get so much more...

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,670
Mr. Liu, calculate it.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,230
How much would you have to pay

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,590
for the merchants on one floor?

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,590
Wait.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,870
How are you calculating this?

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,470
Why do I have to pay more?

66
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,790
We're not even done.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,070
Let's put aside

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,230
the loss from shutdowns

69
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,310
or compensation for employees

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,390
in this contract.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,590
Let's talk about this.

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,190
You bought this land

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,190
because you saw its potential
for appreciation, right?

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,430
Yes.

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,590
Mr. Liu,

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,870
let's not beat around the bush.

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,510
I've looked at the city's
comprehensive transportation plan.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,470
Once the entire area is completed,

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,590
this location

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,070
will be the core part connecting
two business districts.

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,190
You're holding
onto such a valuable land,

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,350
but you're offering this price
to my sister.

83
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,150
That's just not fair.

84
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,670
How about this?

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,550
I'll go back and talk to my boss.

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,990
I didn't take

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,390
your situation into consideration.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,830
Mr. Liu,

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,910
I'm trying

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,830
to make this deal happen.

91
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,470
Sure.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,870
How about this?

93
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,590
I'll give you my number.

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,470
Who can make the final decision?

95
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,590
I'll talk to them directly.

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,470
Good.

97
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,950
I won't have to relay messages.

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,750
Alright.

99
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,630
Mr. Liu, business is business.

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,470
I can see you're an honest man.

101
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,830
If I've offended you in any way earlier,

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,070
please don't take it to heart.

103
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,590
I'll drink this first.

104
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,190
Cheers.

105
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,630
I'll drink with you.

106
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,950
Today, we met here

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,790
because of fate.

108
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,190
As they say,

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,430
a drink during a meeting

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,670
can settle old grudges.

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,150
Let's enjoy ourselves here.

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,270
This meal

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,950
is on me.

114
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,990
Alright.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,270
Come on, sit down.

116
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,830
Here comes the food.

117
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,150
These are our signature wine

118
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,030
and specialty dishes.

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,190
Harmony brings wealth.

120
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,790
Mr. Liu...

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,790
No, no.

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,630

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,150
I think you and my boss

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,190
might get along.

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,430
If there's a chance,
I'll introduce you two.

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,470
Sure.

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,990
I'll drink to that.

128
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,390
No, no, no.

129

No, no.

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,030
Alright. Honest man.

131
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,030
I'll drink with you.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,310
Bro,

133
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,990
which team are you in?

134
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,750
What?

135
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,070
What team?

136
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,190
It's not that formal.

137
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,190
That won't do.

138
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,630
How do you find work then?

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,110
How about this?

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,750

141

146
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,150
This has nothing to do with me.

147
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,590
My brothers stood up for me.

148
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,190
How would I know?

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,670
Besides, my brothers
are still being detained.

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,390
Who should I turn to?

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,190
They deserve it.

152
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,790
If I knew it was you behind this,

153
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,590
I'd have reported you to the police.

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,230
Look.

155
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,510
It hurts.

156
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,310
You've hurt me.

157
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,630
Could you massage it for me?

158
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,190
It really hurts.

159
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,070
Enough, stop pretending.

163

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,350
I'm not trying to scare you.

170
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,150
You know how many enemies

171
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,390
Zhao Xin has.

172
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,110

185

193
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,950
Mingjian.

194
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,030
What's up?

195
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,190
Mr. Lin is looking for you.

196
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,360
Alright.

197
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,230
Boss,

198
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,310
receiving clients isn't my job.

199
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,510
You know

200
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,110
I'm not good at dealing with strangers.

201
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,350
They specifically asked for you.

202
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,230
What can I do?

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,470
Everyone has known about the futures.

204
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,910
You'll get a lot of work like this.

205
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,150
Does this count as a promotion for me?

206
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,390
Will I get more salary?

207
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,510
Isn't the bonus enough for you?

208
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,430
What are you doing?

209
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,630
Go back to work.

210
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,710
Hello, Miss Pei.

211
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,590
This is Zhao Jiadi.

212
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,390
Hello.

213
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,510
Nice to meet you.

214
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,150
I hope we'll get along.

215
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,510
Hello, Miss Pei.

216
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,230
Miss Pei,

217
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,190
Risheng Capital

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,630
offers a 1+N service model

219
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,990
for high-net-worth clients like you.

220
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,350
What we focus on is service.

221
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,150
We never push products
like other companies.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,590
We also tailor wealth management plans

223
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,990
to suit your personal needs,

224
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,350
just like you selected Zhao

225
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,830
as your exclusive broker.

226
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,350
This is
one of our personalized services.

227
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,150
Manager Lin,

228
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,390
I noticed your brochure says

229
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,430
you can provide home visits

230
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,670
based on the client's schedule.

231
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,270
Yes.

232
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,470
Understanding the client

233
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,230
and placing clients
at the center of everything

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,670
is our top priority.

235
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,070
So, Manager Lin,

236
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,350
could you let Zhao talk to me alone?

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,960
Sure.

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Boss,

239
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,790
I only know how to trade,

240
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,310
not how to receive clients.

241
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,550
What if I offend her?

242
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,350
It's alright.

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,710
I know your performance.

244
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,390
Talent

245
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,470
always has a bit of a temper.

246
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,670
But I only care about results.

247
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,870
Whether the process is pleasant

248
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,230
doesn't matter.

249
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,950
Weren't you trained for this?

250
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,870
You can do this.

251
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,590
Miss Pei, I'll leave you to it.

252
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,910
Tell me.

253
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,710
What are you up to this time?

254
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,630
Mr. Zhao,

255
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,110
how can you be so ungrateful?

256
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,310
I came here today to give you money.

257
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,830
You don't have to appreciate it,

258
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,510
but why the long face?

259
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,950
I think we need to keep our distance.

260
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,150
People should learn from their mistakes.

261
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,910
I can't fall again

262
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,990
after stumbling once,

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,550
right?

264
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,190
If I told you

265
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,270
that I was just passing by last time,

266
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,430
you wouldn't believe me,

267
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,230
would you?

268
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,870
What do you think?

269
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,470
Fine, that was my fault.

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,390
I promise

271
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,950
it won't happen again.

272
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,550
I swear.

273
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,950
Besides, I'm here to make amends.

274
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,950
Do you know how much money
I brought this time?

275
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,110
So many people are begging me,

276
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,230
yet you're acting like this.

277
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,840
Alright.

278
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,750
I'll switch to someone else.

279
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,350
I'll talk to the company.

280
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,390
Zhao Jiadi,

281
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,150
I've signed a contract.

282
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,310
Are you trying
to make your boss breach it?

283
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,710
Now, that's more like it.

284
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,110
I don't know

285
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,390
about those bonds

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,870
and stocks they mentioned.

287
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,070
But I have one principle:

288
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,790
You must

289
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,670
be the one to manage it.

290
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,510
Zhao Jiadi,

291
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,110
this is my phone number and address.

292
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,990
Please take care of me from now on.

293
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,950
I really like his handwriting.

294
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,310
Curb anger.

295
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,470
You do need to curb your anger.

296
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,390
Boss.

297
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,190
Mr. Huang.

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,470
That Wu guy has started working
on his recuperation.

299
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,470
The doctor says full recovery
shouldn't be a problem.

300
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,390
Did he accept the money?

301
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,070
No.

302
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,350
Well.

303
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,190
Find two good caretakers

304
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,710
and send them to the hospital.

305
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,950
Take good care of him.

306
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,430
No matter how much it costs,

307
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,190
we'll cover it.

308
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,750
Got it.

309
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,550
Boss,

310
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,470
the 150 tons of goods before
have been delivered.

311
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,190
The Chens' warehouse
has been checked out.

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,390
Just handle it however you need to.

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,390
Yes.

314
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,880
Wait.

315
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,030
Take this

316
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,910
and send it together.

317
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,960
Go on.

318
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,840
Alright.

319
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,390
Mr. Wei.

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,270
[Curb Anger]
Last night at the warehouse,

321
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,550
the gatekeeper was there,

322
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,630
and that fool got drunk.

323
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,390
He didn't see who delivered the goods.

324
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,950
Are we sure it's the same batch
as last time?

325
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,630
The receipts are there.

326
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,990
But Mr. Wei,

327
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,390
the rest

328
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,230
is just worthless slag.

329
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,070
Your 50 tons of amber rough stones

330
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,470
aren't there.

331
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,710
Aren't there?

332
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,630
It's fine.

333
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,710
Go ahead and rest.

334
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,710
Alright.

335
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,750
How much longer should I wait
after registration?

336
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,870
I've been waiting for an hour.

337
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,870
Everyone, please be patient.

338
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,190
There are many clients today.

339
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,230
Please fill out
the registration form later.

340
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,750
Please have some water and wait.

341
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,990
You'll definitely be seen today.

342
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,270
Miss,

343
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,190
this isn't an individual investment.

344
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,950
Besides,

345
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,030
my funds are substantial.

346
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,390
[Ma Xiaotiao]
Can you help me skip the line?

347
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,270
I'll treat you to a meal.

348
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,590
Sorry, sir.

349
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,230
Clients without an appointment

350
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,390
should queue up over there.

351
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,870
About this celebration banquet,

352
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,070
I've repeatedly emphasized

353
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,790
that the company is never built
by one person

354
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,390
or one department.

355
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,310
Our success today is entirely

356
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,950
due to the leadership's wise management

357
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,470
and the collective effort of everyone.

358
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,470
So,

359
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,950
the celebration

360
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,750
and client appreciation event

361
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,590
will be combined

362
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,710
so that our peers can see

363
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,390
how Risheng Capital

364
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,510
is not the same as before.

365
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,510
Forget 5 billion...

366
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,150
Boss,

367
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,030
this speech has been going on
for two hours.

368
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,750
Do you used to have meetings like this?

369
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,070
You've seen the situation today.

370
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,950
Be content with what you have.

371
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,950
These are department heads.

372
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,110
Just being able to attend
is a privilege.

373
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,110
We can make a big impact
with this deal...

374
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,070
By the way,

375
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,350
which department

376
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,070
is handling
the overseas mining business?

377
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,030
Mr. Jin's Asset Management Department.

378
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,950
They're working on it.

379
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,110
Go expand clients

380
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,670
and fund channels.

381
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,350
Each department

382
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,190
has targets.

383
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,350
The ones who meet the targets

384
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,750
will get cash bonuses

385
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,550
as usual.

386
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,350
What a bunch of fools.

387
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,470
How can they propose such a plan?

388
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,950
It's worse
than anything I did in school.

389
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,950
Calm down, sis.

390
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,270
They're just a bit demoralized.

391
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,630
Demoralized?

392
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,190
They're giving up completely.

393
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,550
Listen.

394
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,110
Go pull up the client list for me.

395
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,310
I'll personally talk to them.

396
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,350
Sis,

397
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,350
I have an idea.

398
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,630
Do you want to hear it?

399
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,750
Do you know Honghu Global?

400
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,470
The famous Huang family

401
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,390
from Singapore.

402
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,110
A few days ago,

403
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,990
I overheard my dad talking on the phone

404
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,750
that their old man is getting old

405
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,830
and wants to return and retire.

406
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,230
He's been back

407
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,630
for over a month already.

408
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,990
How is that possible?

409
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,270
How can there be no news

410
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,470
about a big shot like him coming back?

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,750
My dad even sent a visiting card.

412
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,110
Besides, I heard

413
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,390
that Mr. Huang

414
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,150
suffered a lot as a shipman

415
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,310
in his younger days.

416
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,710
He's an unpretentious man.

417
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,270
Now, the international shipping trade

418
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,670
is managed by his eldest son.

419
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,870
As for his other businesses,

420
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,870
we don't know.

421
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,790
But

422
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,710
I don't think Mr. Huang's return

423
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,550
is just for retirement.

424
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,070
We don't care what he's back for.

425
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,230
As long as it's related
to investment, finance,

426
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,670
or wealth management,

427
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,870
it's part of our company's business.

428
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,150
You're still short of money

429
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,310
for your bet with your grandpa, right?

430
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,230
As long as we can convince

431
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,150
Mr. Huang to invest in our company,

432
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,630
this matter will be settled.

433
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,870
Good.

434
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Meeting adjourned.

435
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,670
Boss,

436
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,230
does that mean

437
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,590
we can go out and meet clients

438
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,830
this month

439
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,230
without coming to the office?

440
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,230
As long as you bring results,

441
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,230
go wherever you want.

442
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,430
Lin,

443
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,550
I need to ask you something.

444
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,470
Does what you said last time

445
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,310
still count?

446
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,950
What did I say?

447
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,750
Hello, Zhao Jiadi.

448
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,510
We met in the cafeteria.

449
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,910
Wait.

450
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,030
What do you mean?

451
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,750
Last time,
he volunteered in the cafeteria.

452
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,430
You said

453
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,950
I could have him.

454
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,270
Don't you remember?

455
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,030
No, I don't.

456
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,350
I knew you wouldn't let him go.

457
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,070
Seriously,

458
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,390
I need him for two days.

459
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,190
Not two days.

460
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,070
Just half a day.

461
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,590
I'll return him after I'm done.

462
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,990
What's the business?

463
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,430
We've got a connection

464
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,630
with a big shot.

465
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,470
He's interested in equity investment.

466
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,870
Normally, we wouldn't have a chance.

467
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,230
But we want to give it a try.

468
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,510
When we were chatting,
we mentioned futures,

469
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,070
and I brought up Zhao.

470
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,630
He was really interested

471
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,350
and asked if he could meet him.

472
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,990
So, there's a chance, right?

473
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,230
We just need to borrow him
to make a good impression.

474
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,630
That's all.

475
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,750
Got it.

476
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,150
If the deal goes through,

477
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,390
we want half of the performance.

478
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,710
Lin,

479
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,510
you're too harsh.

480
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,550
We've been doing all the work,

481
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,790
and you want half of the performance

482
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,550
because of Zhao alone?

483
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,430
That's not fair.

484
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,350
Then we'll take 40%.

485
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,510
It can't be any less.

486
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:35,950
Let's go.

487
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,590
Lin,

488
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,870
I feel like 30% is more appropriate.

489
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,790
What do you think?

490
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,550
Jin, I'm also in a tough spot.

491
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,910
Are you sure this intern is Zhao Jiadi?

492
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,190
Zhao Jiadi is about
to be made permanent.

493
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,230
He's now our fund manager's assistant,

494
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,390
but a lot of people are asking for him,

495
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,550
so you might need to wait.

496
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,750
Should I get you
one of his business cards?

497
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,350
Thanks.

498
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,110
The products you recommended are great,

499
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,710
but I still need to discuss them
with the big boss.

500
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,110
Mr. Ma, let's stay in touch.

501
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,750
Take care.

502
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,310
Thank you.

503
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,390
Will you need my favors

504
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,990
in the company

505
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,550
in the future?

506
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,750
If not,

507
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,470
I'll give you 40%.

508
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,270
Zhao Jiadi.

509
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,030
Ma Xiaotiao.

510
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,350
What are you doing here?

511
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,190
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

512
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,190
When did you come to Hang City?

513
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,910
You didn't even tell me.

514
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,910
Four years of university went to waste.

515
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,990
I just settled in.

516
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,310
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

517
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,950
Boss,

518
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,190
the intern from Risheng

519
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,590
is Zhao Jiadi.

520
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,390
Should I bring my men...?

521
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,510
Figure out what he wants to do first.

522
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,150
Don't act rashly.

523
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,310
I'm just curious.

524
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,230
What would it be like if you realized

525
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,110
you've found the wrong opponent?

526
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,710
What do you mean?

527
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,350
To you, Zhao Jiadi

528
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,630
is worthless like these stones

529
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,350
on the ground.

530
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,470
But what do you think will happen

531
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,070
if you pick him up?

532
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,310
The return of Chen Zhuhe's goods

533
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,310
was a wake-up call for Wei Jinghai.

534
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,790
By mixing the valuable
amber rough stones

535
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,670
with crushed stone and slag

536
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,510
and smuggling them through customs,

537
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,550
he could make a pretty profit.

538
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,950
This was also Wei Jinghai's way

539
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,670
of paying tribute
to the local bigwig, Sang Ke,

540
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,310
in the Kalpunia mining district.

541
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,790
It was

542
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,110
the loss of this batch of goods

543
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,150
that forced Wei Jinghai

544
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,670
to embezzle the money
to deal with futures.

545
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,590
At first, he thought

546
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,830
the lost goods were a test from Sang Ke
trying to extort money.

547
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,230
But now, it seems

548
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,590
there's someone else behind it.

549
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,910
At this time,

550
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,870
Zhao Jiadi happened to show up
in Hang City.

551
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,710
Besides, he's at Risheng,

552
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,550
the company
that's profited from futures.

553
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,710
What is Zhao Jiadi's goal?

554
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,670
Is the mastermind

555
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,910
behind everything Zhao Xin?

556
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,870
Maybe

557
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,830
Zhao Jiadi and Zhao Xin's falling out

558
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,270
is just an act.

559
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,640
[Mutton Soup]

560
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,990
I know you love this.

561
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,470
This is the most authentic place
in Hang City.

562
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,150
How well you know me.

563
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,630
I've been craving this for so long.

564
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,390
Thanks, ma'am.

565
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,230
Have a try.

566
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,990
I remember you said

567
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,150
you were going home.

568
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,750
Why did you suddenly come

569
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,710
and work in Hang City?

570
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,190
Plans don't always work out.

571
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,910
What about you? How's it going?

572
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,070
It's the same as before.

573
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,670
I sometimes help my parents

574
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,150
with business in Nan City.

575
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,110
It's quite busy.

576
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,880
By the way,

577
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,030
you need clients

578
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,230
for your performance, right?

579
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,230
I'll ask around for you,

580
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,110
but I'm not sure about the level.

581
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,750
Is this still our playboy?

582
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,150
I used to be clueless,

583
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,630
always thinking

584
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,390
it was my right to spend
my parents' money.

585
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,750
But after stepping into society,

586
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,990
I realized their business isn't easy.

587
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,270
They're constantly putting on a smile,

588
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,390
but in the end,
they don't even make money.

589
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,350
I can't really do anything.

590
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,550
I just try to share the burden.

591
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,590
Do you still keep in touch
with Shen Han and Li Feng?

592
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,910
What are they doing?

593
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,110
We contact each other occasionally.

594
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,470
Shen Han took the civil service exam
for Hai City last year,

595
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,270
but he missed it by a few points.

596
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,270
Li Feng resigned earlier this year,

597
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,350
and I haven't heard from him since.

598
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,790
Time really flies, doesn't it?

599
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,550
Yeah, it does.

600
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,870
I just remember

601
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,670
that the day we graduated,

602
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,190
Shen and I lost our girlfriends.

603
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,590
The four of us cried like fools.

604
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,390
I remember.

605
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,910
Shen said back then

606
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,150
he'd make something of himself.

607
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,550
I still remember you said

608
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,670
that women could be replaced,

609
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,910
but brothers were for life.

610
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,750
Where do you live now?

611
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,150
My family has two houses in Hang City.

612
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,470
If you're not used to it,

613
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,150
you can move in with me.

614
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,550
That sounds more like Ma Xiaotiao.

615
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,270
You really got me all sentimental there.

616
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,390
It's the reality.

617
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,590
My place is pretty close to the company.

618
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,030
It's nice.

619
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,510
Well, I'll come visit you then.

620
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,630
Make sure to leave me

621
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,190
a spot on the sofa.

622
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,510
You can have my bed.

623
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,950
Hello?

624
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,510
Ma'am, another bowl of soup.

625
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,510
Not this afternoon.

626
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,470
I ran into a buddy.

627
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,830
You guys are all there?

628
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,950
Okay.

629
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,190
I'll bring my buddy along then.

630
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,030
Send me the location.

631
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,590
My friends

632
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,350
are from good families.

633
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,190
If you get along with them,

634
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,790
your business won't be a big deal.

635
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,150
I won't go.

636
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,950
You go.

637
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,630
You know me.

638
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,310
I'm shy around strangers.

639
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,390
Come on.

640
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,110
They just spend money recklessly,

641
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,990
but with you, they'll make money.

642
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,950
They'd love that.

643
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,710
Besides,

644
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,790
they're more reliable
than our suppliers.

645
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,990
I can talk them into this.

646
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,030
I'm really not going.

647
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,750
Zhao Jiadi,

648
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,470
we haven't seen each other for years.

649
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,350
This is the first time I'm inviting you,

650
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,670
yet you're turning me down?

651
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,950
Fine, I'll go.

652
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,750
Is that okay?

653
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,710
That's better.

654
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,190
Ma'am,

655
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,750
two bottles of beer.

656
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,670
Bro,

657
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,070
the Legal Department
has given their opinion.

658
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,670
Nothing's wrong with our process,
quote, and property nature

659
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,990
[Zhu Fengping, Fanlong Group]
for the relocation.

660
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,470
No need to negotiate with them.

661
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,830
Boss, I was wrong.

662
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,710
I didn't know this,

663
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,110
so that kid fooled me.

664
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,870
Actors?

665
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,750
I can't believe he came up with that.

666
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,830
Zhu,

667
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,910
go push the joint venture plan

668
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,070
for the mining district.

669
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,310
I'll head over now.

670
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,950
Alright.

671
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,470
Boss.

672
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,950
Boss.

673
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,070
I can't do this.

674
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,630
Why not let me go back to driving?

675
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,310
I haven't accomplished anything,

676
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,590
and I've brought you all this trouble.

677
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,710
What's that kid's name again?

678
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,990
His name is Zhao Laodi.

679
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,270
No.

680
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,990
It's Zhao...

681
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,990
Zhao Jiedi.

682
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,030
Right, Zhao Jiedi.

683
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,510
They mentioned

684
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,470
a finance company intern the other day.

685
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,910
He also has a name like that.

686
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,430
No way.

687
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,590
Let's find out.

688
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,390
He wanted to meet me, right?

689
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,190
That's right.

690
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,510
There are tens of thousands of Zhaos
in our village.

691
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,230
Besides the Zhaos,

692
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,310
the rest are Shangs and Lius.

693
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,910
There are so many people here?

694
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,430
Naming must be tricky then.

695
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,590
Wouldn't they get mixed up?

696
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,670
Of course, they would.

697
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,670
I heard from my great-grandfather

698
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,510
that if you stood
at the village entrance

699
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,270
and shouted Zhao Jianjun,

700
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,870
a bunch of people would come out,

701
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,790
just like herding sheep.

702
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,470
It was so lively.

703
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,230
Later, they'd be careful with naming.

704
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,550
Take my uncle's name as an example.

705
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,070
It was chosen from the Kangxi Dictionary

706
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,510
by my great-grandfather.

707
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,830
Your great-grandfather
was quite cultured.

708
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,910
Yes, he was.

709
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,310
It's almost done, right?

710
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,750
Ms. Fang, let me try it first.

711
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,710
It's delicious.

712
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,550
You make everything taste good.

713
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,190
Nonsense.

714
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,510
I haven't even added garlic yet.

715
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,710
You have no idea.

716
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,270
Since I took over my parents' business,

717
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,550
I haven't had time to come.

718
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,910
I'm not bragging here.

719
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,110
I used to win all the time, bro.

720
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,270
I was known as Mr. Winner.

721
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,310
This is Zhao Jiadi,

722
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,670
my college roommate.

723
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,990
We're all friends here.

724
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,590
Dao, He.

725
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,190
Hello, hello.

726
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,110
Remember the nickname now.

727
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,270
I'll dig up their secrets later.

728
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,950
Ma Xiaotiao.

729
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,110
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

730
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,990
Zhu Hongzhi,

731
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,110
why are you everywhere?

732
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,110
What?

733
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,910
Did you call for backup?

734
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,110
Stop fooling around.

735
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,790
If you're saying that,

736
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,990
he's got to take a few rounds.

737
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,590
I'm taking down this weakling.

738
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,070
Fine.

739
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,390
Today,

740
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,550
whoever wins,

741
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,070
I'll drink with them

742
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,950
until we're drunk.

743
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,630
How is she?

744
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,430
Quite cool, right?

745
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,300
[Tong Xia]

746
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,590
She looks like one of my old friends.

747
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,990
You have to come for two rounds.

748
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,830
Go to hell.

749
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,150
Don't take Zhu Hongzhi seriously.

750
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,110
He's just like this.

751
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,390
We don't even like him.

752
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,350
He's always for show.

753
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,910
It's okay.

754
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,390
- Where's the wine?
- Let's drink!

755
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,830
Stop drinking.

756
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,470
Alright, enough, stop.

757
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,030
Let's have some fun!

758
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,110
Raise your hands!

759
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,910
Miss, another bottle!

760
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,790
Great, another bottle.

761
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,190
Stop drinking.

762
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,910
Of course.

763
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,310
This guy was a big shot back in school.

764
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,950
Let's put aside his modeling skills.

765
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,870
His academic report for stocks

766
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,190
was just

767
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,870
stunning.

768
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,070
Don't believe his nonsense.

769
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,430
Ma Xiaotiao loves to exaggerate.

770
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,990
I'm not exaggerating.

771
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,750
When we were about to graduate,

772
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,030
our teacher asked you
to stay at school, right?

773
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,190
And you won an award

774
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,910
in some trading competition, right?

775
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,710
Yeah.

776
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,110
That was just luck.

777
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,430
We're all friends here.

778
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,350
No need to be modest.

779
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,310
Jiadi,

780
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,830
can I go to your company

781
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,830
and ask you to be my broker?

782
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,390
I don't ask for much.

783
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,790
I just want to make some pocket money.

784
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,590
Give us a hand.

785
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,510
Take us under your wing.

786
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,190
Hold on, hold on.

787
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,270
Let's get this straight first.

788
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,190
Jiadi will be your fund manager,

789
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,030
but I'll be his manager.

790
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,230
Everything has to go through me.

791
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,230
Stop, stop.

792
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,030
Guys, listen to me.

793
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,110
Stocks

794
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,110
and funds

795
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,750
are risky investments.

796
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,710
When you are there,
take an evaluation first.

797
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,910
Don't rush into anything.

798
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,430
Think it through
before you make any decisions.

799
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,190
I won't rush. My money isn't much.

800
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,510
Even if you lose it all,

801
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,590
I can bear it.

802
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,230
Let's just do it.

803
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,550
What did I just say?

804
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,990
Well?

805
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,710
How about we talk at another place?

806
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,550
Sure.

807
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,550
I'm happy today.

808
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,070
It'll be on me.

809
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,710
- Another place.
- Let's go.

810
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,110
Ma Xiaotiao,

811
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,870
it's too late. I'm heading back.

812
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,950
Nonsense.

813
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,950
Let's go.

814
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,590
You kept switching places.

815
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,430
This is the third place today.

816
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,070
It's like our last day alive.

817
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,510
It's been so long.

818
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,550
Shouldn't we make the most
of this reunion?

819
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,830
You're trying to wear me out.

820
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,190
Who am I doing this for?

821
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,670
Let go. Do you hear me?

822
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,150
Tong Xia, wake up.

823
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,870
Who are you?

824
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,350
Who sent you here?

825
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,950
Tong Xia!

826
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,190
If you don't let go,
I'll call the police!

827
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,230
It's none of your business. Get lost.

828
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,350
Tong Xia!

829
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,110
Xiaotiao,

830
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,910
give me the car keys.

831
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,270
You drive.

832
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,630
Why's the convertible open?

833
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,950
I don't know. Stop asking questions.

834
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,750
I can have another bottle.

835
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,950
Another bottle.

836
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,910
Miss, don't rush.

837
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,750
We'll drink slowly when we get there.

838
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,390
Who are you?

839
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,830
Well, Jiadi.

840
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,710
Boss,

841
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,510
hurry up.

842
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,110
Who are you?

843
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,990
Don't move!

844
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,950
Ow, ow.

845
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,990
Are you okay?

846
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,030
Zhu,

847
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,830
I warned you a long time ago.

848
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,910
Compared to my buddy,

849
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,990
- you're the weakling.
- Tong Xia.

850
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,950
Get lost!

851
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,950
Tong Xia.

852
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,750
Are you okay?

853
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,950
Wake up. Come on, come here.

854
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,670
Thanks.

855
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,590
What's your name?

856
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,470
Why not give me your number?

857
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,270
We'll treat you to a meal.

858
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,750
No need.

859
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,630
Take care next time.

860
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,630
Don't drink so much.

861
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,270
Good for you.

862
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,190
I was still shaken up,

863
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,350
and you acted like a hero.

864
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,830
Miss.

His name is Zhao Jiadi.

866
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,630
Jiadi means the first place.

867

Feel free to write a thank you letter.

868
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,430
Come on, get in.

Xiaotiao,

872
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,310
I really can't go.

873
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,270
It's too late.

874
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,950
How about this?

875
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,470
Have the guys come
to my company another day.

876
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,310
We can also change places.

877
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,270
I'll treat them to a meal.

878
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,950
Fine, that'll work.

Sir,

881
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,630
just leave me here.

Get in the car.
