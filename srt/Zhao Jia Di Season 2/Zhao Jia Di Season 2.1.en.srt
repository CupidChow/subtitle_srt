00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,190
From the looks of it,

195
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,830
they probably reconciled.

196
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,390
Aren't you worried at all?

197
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,910
Worried about what?

198
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,470
Yange?

199
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,590
I can give him

200
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,550
everything he wants,

201
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,830
but outsiders can't.

202
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,030
What are you smiling about?

203
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,150
You're not an outsider.

204
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,190
Dongcao,

205
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,590
there's been a lot going on lately.

206
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,390
So I didn't tell you

207
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,470
once unfinished buildings
are handled,

208
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,670
I plan to overhaul Jinhai.

209
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,390
Don't be too radical.

210
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,510
Dad meant

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,830
that Jinhai's old rivals

212
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,670
might take action.

213
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,310
Okay, I'm done. I'll leave now.

214
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,870
Don't forget to wear the new suit
I bought for you.

215
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,070
Stop wearing the same outfit.

216
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:35,760

219
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,710
someone's here to see you.

220

[Chen Hongxiong]

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,830
Hongxiong.

222
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,910
You've lost weight.

223
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,630
Give you three minutes.

224
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,830
Don't bother me again.

225
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,830
Don't be like this.

226
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,590
We share a master.

227
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,590
For the sake

228
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,950
of Nalan Changsheng,

229
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,110
we shouldn't be so distant.

230
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,630
Two minutes and fifty cents.

232
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,030
wants to acquire
the Chen family's business.

233
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,630
Without you,

234
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,430
the Chen family is weak.

235
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,270
Is there anything you need me to do?

236
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,670
Just say it.

237
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,470
I'm not interested.

He's walking toward us.

242

Senior,

243
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,710
let's team up.

244

With you?

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,310
Yeah, team up with me.

247
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,990
You don't deserve it.

Latched onto the Li family,

249
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,350
so you think you're a big deal?

250
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,950
I've moved on

251
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,030
from my hatred of Zhao Xin.

252
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,390
But you're still stuck there.

253
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,150
Does Zhao Xin know your true identity?

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,590
One day,

255
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,910
I'll let them know

256
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,710
who I am.

257
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,510
I'm just curious.

258
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,350
Tell me.

259
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,710
What would it be like

260
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,230
if one day you realized

261
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,830
you've found the wrong opponent?

262
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,070
What do you mean?

263
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,230
Three minutes are up.

Report.

I know many of you here

266

are dissatisfied with me.

267
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,950
I dropped in here as the chairman

268
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,910

and spent half your life

at Jinhai.

272
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,870
What's reason for that?

273

Mr. Li,

274
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,070

to land this deal.

280
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,470
Director Shen,

281
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,590
I checked your department's
performance review.

282
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,030
You had six people recommended
for promotion,

283
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,790
but you only gave yourself two.

284
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,590
Is this your conscience speaking?

285
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,910
You must know how many tricks

286
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,110
you've used at Jinhai

287
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,470
and how many benefits

288
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,950
you've pocketed.

289
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,030
I'll give you time

290
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,790
to clean up your mess.

291
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,110
After the branch's financial power
is back,

292
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,470
if I find any more tricks,

293
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,990
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

294
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,310
Of course, that's for later.

295
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,670
I've called you here today

296
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,710
for one reason only.

297
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,470

for our employees' welfare,

Well.

304
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,430
I'll state first.

305
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,830
I'm in favor.

[Fu Fang, Finance VP of Jinhai Group]
for group's interests,

the best option

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,030
would be to build a commercial district.

312
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,550
But today,

313
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,950
you've said it like this.

314
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,270
If we keep pretending

315
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,550
to be confused,

316
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,190
we'd be unwise.

You're so pretty.

323

Mr. Zhao,

324
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,390
if you plan
to reform the company,

325
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,630
to build residences for employees,

326
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,310
and give welfare to the team.

327
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,990
Honestly, we have no objection.

328
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,710
What we're worried about

329
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,550
is that during the reform,

330
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,670
we might lose

331
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,070
our positions.

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,590

334
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,150
the achievements we had...

335
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,350
Forget about it.

336
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,750
But he personally promised

337
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,150
that if we work hard at Jinhai,

338
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,110
we'll prosper for life.

339
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,990
I don't know

340
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,110
if that promise

341
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,390
still holds

what Zhao Xin said.

345
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,070
I'll ask him later.

346
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,350
But what I need to know now is

347
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,870
whether you agree to convert

348
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,590
unfinished buildings

349
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,510

This matter

351
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,390
can wait until you've asked

352
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,230
the former chairman.

353
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,590

Didn't you ask me
to find that architect?

356

It's done.

357
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,590
Right.

How about this?

Let him meet me
at construction site today.

360
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,030
It's better to do it sooner than later.

361
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,920
Okay.

362
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,870
I'll arrange it.

363
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,230
Mr. Fu,

364
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,270
you're back.

Everyone's waiting for your decision.

366

Just relax.

That kid is in his father's control.

368
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,430
Go back now.

369
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,710
Alright, let's go.

370
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,110
What are you honking for?

371
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,550
What are you doing?

372
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,550
What are you doing?

373
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,270
Open the door.

374
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,550
Open the door?

375
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,390
What do you want?

376
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,390
Construction site is secured.

377
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,390
No one's allowed in.

378
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,350
Don't you recognize me?

379
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,350
No.

Mr. Zhao.

383
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,310
Enough.

384
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,750
That doesn't matter here.

385
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,190
Didn't you hear me? It's secured.

386
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,310
I don't think you get it.

387
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,350
Uncle.

388
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,630
I''ll hit you.

389
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,830
Sorry.

390
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,390
I'd like to see Captain Li.

391
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,630
Please tell him my name is Zhao Jiadi.

392
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,510
Zhao Jiadi?

393
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,270
Alright, I'll go tell him.

394
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,710
Wait here.

395
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,510
You two keep an eye here.

396
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,710
Don't let them in.

397
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,920
[Huang Ruiyang, General Manager
of Jinhai Group North Branch]

398
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,230
What's meant to come will come.

399
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,390
Captain.

400
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,040
Captain, you're practicing
calligraphy again.

401
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,230
Wukui.

402
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,750
Is everything ready?

403
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,920
No.

404
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
A few people at the door

405
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,910
insisted on coming in.

406
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,070
And claimed one of them was Mr. Zhao.

407
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,110
His name is...

408
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,830
Zhao Jiadi.

409
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,190
Zhao Jiadi?

410
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,030
I stopped him.

411
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,670
Wouldn't let in.

412
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,030
You fool.

413
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,150
That's the chairman!

414
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,590
The chairman?

415
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,270
What are they here for?

416
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,990
I don't know.

417
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,990
How many people?

418
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,880
Three.

419
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,550
Grab the hats.

420
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,110
You're such a fool.

421
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,310
We're doomed.

422
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,950
Three people.
I'm such a fool.

423
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,710
We're doomed.

424
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,150
Mr. Zhao.

425
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,590
Thank you.

426
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,670
Mr. Zhao.

427
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,600
Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu.

428
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,790
Mr. Zhao, please.

429
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,460
This way, please.

430
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,400
Mr. Liu, please.

431
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,270
Mr. Zhao, I'm sorry.

432
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,350
Captain,

433
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,950
they say

434
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,310
a man stays a boy forever.

435
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,150
Is Mr. Zhao's here

436
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,670
for a drama?

437
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,830
Nonsense.

438
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,030
Go check if Mr. Huang's in need of help.

439
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,590
Chairman Zhao's here.

440
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,230
Go now.

441
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,110
The location here is great.

442
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,830
In a few years, once the area develops,

443
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,990
it'll be a prime spot
for a commercial district.

444
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,270
I know.

445
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,950
I've seen the city government's
new planning documents.

446
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,430
Then why keep building residences?

447
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,110
It's close to the Jinhai headquarters.

448
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,350
Some things

449
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,950
can't be measured with money.

450
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,910
I bought this land

451
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,310
for those employees

452
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,950
who can't afford a home.

453
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,950
Living in a big city,

454
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,950
all they think about
is setting down roots

455
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,660
and owning a home.

456
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,470
Once they have a stable place
to eat and sleep,

457
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,650
their hearts will be at peace.

458
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,710
I've thought of the name.

459
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,510
It'll be called Jinhai Homes.

460
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,510
You'll build buildings

461
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,590
for your employees?

462
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,870
We'll rent them at the price
of affordable housing.

463
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,550
And after working
for a certain number of years,

464
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,770
we'll transfer property rights.

465
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,870
It's a kind of indirect incentive.

466
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,030
Entrepreneurs may draw up big plans,

467
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,950
but in the end,

468
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,230
they're still trying
to realize their own ideals.

469
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,830
I can't change this essence,

470
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,750
but at least turning
employees' dreams into homes

471
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,230
is something I can do.

472
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,700
I've been in the industry for decades.

473
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,230
I've met a lot of people,

474
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,510
but I've never seen a boss

475
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,670
like him.

476
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,390
I'm not a boss.

477
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,840
At most,

478
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,680
I'm just a rich kid

479
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,270
not wanting
to live off his inheritance.

480
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,350
I haven't even squandered.

481
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,550
Mr. Liu,

482
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,110
this part was already completed.

483
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,390
If there are no issues with it,

484
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,550
let's try not to change it.

485
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,310
Please base your design
on this foundation.

486
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,270
I'm more concerned about the details.

487
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,790
How can I put it?

488
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,350
Let's try to make it

489
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,470
feel a bit like a home.

490
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,390
Alright, don't worry.

491
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,470
I'll personally work on this plan.

492
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,510
I'll make sure you're satisfied.

493
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,430
Move faster.

494
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,870
Come over. Come on.

495
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,350
Straighten it.
Be careful. Straighten it.

496
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,560
[Leadership's Hard Work]
Good.

497
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,190
[Visible to All]
Straighten it.

498
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,430
[Work Dawn to Dusk]
Over there too.

499
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,350
Okay. Raise this side.

500
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:42,990
Come on.

501
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,670
Captain Li.

502
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,750
What are you doing?

503
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,910
The chairman is here.

504
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,070
Everyone, let's welcome him.

505
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,590
Stop.

506
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,670
A bit of kindness

507
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,470
warms my heart.

508
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,270
Your wisdom and bravery

509
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,110
have conquered the world.

510
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,830
Welcome, welcome.

511
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,990
We welcome you here.

512
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,510
Didn't I tell you not to do this?

513
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,430
Mr. Zhao,

514
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,030
it's rare for you to come here.

515
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,550
Everyone is so excited to see you.

516
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,030
This project is about to begin.

517
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,230
Could you have

518
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,790
a ribbon-cutting ceremony for us?

519
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,710
It can help boost our spirits.

520
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,070
Please give a speech.

521
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,190
Come on.

522
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,830
Mr. Zhao, come on.

523
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,470
Mr. Zhao.

524
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,630
Mr. Zhao, come on.

525
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,430
Give a speech.

526
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,230
Give us a speech.

527
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,070
Welcome, welcome.

528
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,230
Alright.

529
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,550
I didn't prepare anything.

530
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,470
I'll just say what's on my mind.

531
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,830
Before Jinhai took over
unfinished building project,

532
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,070
it had a lot of issues,

533
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,230
and you were stuck here.

534
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,790
Sorry about that.

535
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,230
I can promise

536
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,790
that such things will never happen

537
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,470
under Jinhai's leadership.

538
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,790
I value this project a lot.

539
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,270
To be honest,

540
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,990
there are some
personal feelings involved.

541
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,310
And these feelings

542
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,230
will be shown
through the bricks and tiles

543
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,310
in your hands.

544
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,350
Please build it as if you're building

545
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,590
your own home.

546
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,110
Alright.

547
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,830
I wish you good luck as you begin.

548
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,270
- Great.
- Great.

549
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,150
Jiadi.

550
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,350
I really didn't expect you

551
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,110
to be here today.

552
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,430
Why are you here?

553
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,910
Nothing.

554
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,390
I'm here helping Xin

555
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,630
with something.

556
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,510
I heard everything you said earlier.

557
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,430
It really moved me.

558
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,550
You said

559
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,670
there are your personal feelings

560
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,910
in these buildings.

561
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,870
That's a shame.

562
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,270
Explain it.

563
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,790
I said...

564
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,310
Captain Li,

565
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,790
is everything ready?

566
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,070
Yes.

567
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,710
Let's begin.

568
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,550
Alright.

569
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,190
Come on.

570
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,710
Site Clearance Confirmation
for points 1, 3, and 5.

571
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,830
Point 1 is confirmed.
