4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,160
Everything's arranged. Don't worry.

5
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
If you put it that way,

6
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
then I might have a rough idea.

7
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,320
No wonder they're transporting

8
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
all those worthless slag and stones.

9
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,280
Kalpunia is rich in resources.

10
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
If they're making such a big move,

11
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,040
it's probably more than just smuggling.

12
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
It's a pity, though.

13
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,720
Right now, we can only trace Chen Zhuhe

14
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
but not catch Wei Jinghai.

15
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Mr. Jiao.

16
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
The one I mentioned today.

17
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
I think he might be a clue.

18
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,960
Smuggling, gambling,
and loan-sharking...

19
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,520
If we connect them together,

20
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,240
their interests behind the scenes

21
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,560
aren't that hard to guess.

22
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,160
If there's really

23
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
that much illegal income,

24
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,040
Wei Jinghai wouldn't be stupid enough

25
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,160
to keep it in his own accounts.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,960
Does Uncle Li know about what you found?

27
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,360
Handle it internally.

28
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,240
Keep it quiet.

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
These are his exact words.

30
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
After all these years,

31
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Li still doesn't get me.

32
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,560
He thinks he can hold me down

33
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,720
with just the title
of commander-in-chief.

34
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,600
He underestimates me.

35
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
Fan,

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,240
you're out in the open,

37
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,200
but Wei Jinghai is hiding in the dark.

38
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Uncle Li probably doesn't want you...

39
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,960
Forget this trouble.

40
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,320
Are you free tomorrow?

41
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,360
Come over for a meal.

42
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,000
My wife has been asking
about meeting you

43
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,240
several times.

44
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
What's going on?

45
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,240
There's a traffic accident.

46
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,760
My phone's dead.

47
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,560
Can you call the police?

48
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,800
Hold on.

49
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,840
Contact the family now.

50
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,200
I remember Jiadi said

51
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
Bao didn't know how to cook before.

52
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
Now he's gotten pretty good.

53
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
You must have taught him, right?

54
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
I didn't teach him.

55
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,600
He secretly learned
while working for me.

56
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,880
Having Bao around
must've made things easier, huh?

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
No. He's been more trouble than help.

58
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,600
You know.

59
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,160
I really envy how romantic
Jiadi is with you.

60
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
He even gives you flowers.

61
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,480
You should teach Bao

62
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
to do that too.

63
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,080
Does Bao need that?

64
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,800
Last time, he confessed to you

65
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
right in front of us.

66
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,240
Who wouldn't be charmed by that?

67
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,680
Yeah, that was pretty good.

68
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
It's done.

69
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,040
Aunt, try my tomato and egg stir-fry.

70
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,360
Bao, not bad.

71
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
Who do you think taught me?

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
It tastes great.

73
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,840
Right?

74
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,560
It still feels better calling you Aunt.

75
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,040
If you're calling her Aunt,

76
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,000
then what should I call her?

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll call you Sister.

78
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
You're her sister,

79
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
and she's my aunt.

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,880
Let's separate this.

81
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,400

82
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400

It's a bit salty.

Yes, I am.

a serious car accident.

to Hang City Sci-Tech Hospital.

and he's out of danger.

110
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
So, can we check on him now?

111
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,640
Yes.

112
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,800
But his condition

113

is still unstable.

114
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400

00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,800
We're both in Hang City anyway.

380
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,360
We can see each other anytime.

381
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,400
No need to be so sentimental.

382
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,600
Here's a gift for you.

383
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,440
Think of it

384
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,280
as a farewell present.

385
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,040
My master gave me this
when I first entered the industry.

386
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,640
Now it's yours.

387
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,160
Boss,

388
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,640
you gave me a pen

389
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,800
and a suit

390
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,360
and taught me so much,

391
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,400
but I haven't even done much for you.

392
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Tanle will be coming
to Hang City in a few days.

393
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
If you're free,

394
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
give me some advice.

395
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,800
Sure,

396
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,440
but I'm not very good at chasing girls.

397
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,360
I'm afraid my advice will be useless.

398
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,480
Are you showing off to me now?

399
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,440
Take your stuff and get out of here.

400
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,320
Boss.

401
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,960
Thank you.

402
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,240
I mean it.

403
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm leaving now.

Jiadi.

405
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,040
You are the most impressive intern

406
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,120
I've ever had.

407
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,320
I believe in you.

408
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
Whatever you do,

This is such a big company.

412
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
Of course, we need someone
who knows English.

413
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,360
There might be self-taught geniuses
out there,

414
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,920
but that might not be you.

415
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,760
After all, nobody pays for the unknown.

416
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,960
It's not about having confidence in me

417
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,320
but about having confidence
in objective facts.

00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,920

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,920
I'll work hard.

You can join the team,

424
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
but let's be clear.

425
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,400
You should follow orders.

426
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,400
You can't act on your own.

427
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,600
Instead of focusing on fixing it,

428
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,360
you're all busy dumping the blame
on Mr. Lin.

429
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,000
In this incident,

430
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,120
you're the one most at fault.

431

we have to load up on it.
