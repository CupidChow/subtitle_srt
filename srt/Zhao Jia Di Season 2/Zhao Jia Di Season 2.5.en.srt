00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,840
If you want to help Wu Dengke,

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,000
I suggest you go to Hang City.

5
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,200
The land Zhao Xin took

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,630
hasn't been surveyed.

7
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,630
Once he really gets it developed,

8
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,470
what the mining will become

9
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,270
is hard to say.

10
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,270
The reason I want you to go to Hang City

11
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,590
is that main enterprises

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
of the NCC of Commerce are over there,

13
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,360
including infrastructure and shipping.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,430
You'll have a place there.

15
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

16
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you think you can move freely

17
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,040
because you're Zhao Xin's son?

18
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,680
Even if you've broken ties
with Zhao Xin,

19
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,630
you're still related by blood.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,630
Those people down south

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,950
have hated Zhao Xin for a long time.

22
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,400
Going to Hang City

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,110
could be walking into the lion's den.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Ms. Cai,

25
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,750
thank you.

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,150
I won't reveal my identity.

27
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,880
There's no need.

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,630
There's a man you should watch out for.

29
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,400
Wei Jinghai,
General Manager of Li Group.

30
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,240
He's a hard one to figure out.

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,040
However, someone named Fan Longquan

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
in the NCC

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,150
has an excellent reputation.

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,240
You can reach out
if you have the chance.

35
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,310
The entire NCC isn't friendly

36
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,200
toward Zhao Xin.

37
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,950
Be careful.

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,750
Qingdi didn't get along
with Zhao Xin either.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,680
But once, he came back and told me

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
Zhao Xin went to
his trap-laden banquet alone.

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,750
From his expression, I could tell

42
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,560
he admired him.

43
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,910
Later on,

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,240
I met that old gentleman
at the foot of Mount Wutai

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,750
and shared half a cup of Hupao tea.

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,520
Jiadi,

47
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,790
you once stood at the top.

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
Even if you've fallen,

49
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,310
you're willing to start over
and taste all that life offers.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,750
Maybe it's a good thing.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,430
Qingdi left behind a diary.

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,910
I'll lend it to you.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,790
I hope you can be like him.

54
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,910
Ms. Cai, there's only one Yang Qingdi

55
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,000
and only one Zhao Jiadi.

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
I believe that.

57
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,950
Hang City.

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,360
Nanshan Chamber of Commerce.

59
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,590
Yang Qingdi.

60
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,560
Li Minxian.

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,270
Uncle,

62
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,040
you just gave me so much information.

63
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,630
I just took a nap,

64
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,040
and everything changed.

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,150
Wait.

66
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,630
The main point
of what you just said

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,270
is the 100,000 yuan.

68
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,240
I can't even spend it.

69
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,310
I have to return it.

70
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,630
Why?

71
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,040
Come on.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,430
She was so straightforward.

73
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,520
You can't chicken out.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,590
How do you know it's a "she"?

75
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,950
What if it's a crusty man
with stinky feet?

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,200
Even if it is,

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,630
if he gave me 100,000 yuan,

78
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,430
I'd still...

79
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,750
No.

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,310
Wait, Uncle.

81
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,270
Haven't you two known each other
for seven years?

82
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,240
You've never met?

83
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,470
No.

84
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,240
Then it's definitely a girl.

85
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,110
Bao,

86
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,110
do I still have some of that tea?

87
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,400
Yeah.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,750
Good, find me two cakes.

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,910
I'm going to visit
old school principal today.

90
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,860
I can't show up empty-handed.

91
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,590
Got it.

92
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,200
I'll get them
when I'm done.

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Uncle,

94
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,430
just now,

95
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,910
the old school principal you've said.

96
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,400
You mean the guy
with a wildflower speech?

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,310
Well, please tell him

98
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,630
his speech is so good

99
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,840
that has made a big impact

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
on my life.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,790
I never thought

102
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,560
you'd say the word "life".

103
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,430
I gotta grow sometime, right?

104
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,680
Uncle,

105
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,200
were you mocking me just now?

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,750
You even know the word "mocking" now.

107
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,950
Nice.

108
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,880
Uncle.

109
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you saying, Uncle?

110
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,400
What are you saying?

111
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm gonna splash you.

112
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,590
That's a foul.

113
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Hei, put some inside.

114
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,310
Sir,

115
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,110
we're not open yet.

116
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,200
Can you come back later?

117
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,560
It's fine. I'm just looking around.

118
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,950
Is your store

119
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,720
up for transfer?

120
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,680
I haven't heard anything
from boss about that.

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,270
Sorry.

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,910
When

123
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,080
do you normally open?

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
We open at 7 p.m..

125
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,000
Then I'll come back later.

126
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Mi,

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
bring me a bottle of champagne.

128
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,430
Got it.

129
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,240
Hurry up, hurry.

130
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,680
What's up, Bao?

131
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,720
Sir.

132
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,000
Sorry for the trip in vain.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
This is for you.

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,950
My treat.

135
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,080
No need.

136
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,840
It's just a bottle of wine.

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,470
You're welcome to come back.

138
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,270
Thanks.

139
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,000
Drop by anytime when you're free.

140
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,000
Zhao,

141
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,950
the fact you came to visit me

142
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,200
shows

143
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,110
I didn't teach you in vain.

144
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,200
If it weren't for your guidance,

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,680
I wouldn't have this perspective today.

146
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,200
You came to seek advice

147
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,240
[Jiang Zongxiang, retired principal]
from me.

148
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,590
Well, I think

149
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,720
you should make use of your strengths

150
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,240
and dive into the financial sector.

151
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,560
Knowledge

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,630
needs to be tested in practice.

153
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,430
That's right.

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,400
Actually, I've chosen a destination.

155
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,110
I want to go to Hang City.

156
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,750
For finance, Hai City

157
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,880
and Hang City are top choices.

158
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,560
Are you planning
to start your own business

159
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
or join a company?

160
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,590
After what happened at Jinhai,

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,790
I'm not planning
to start a business for now.

162
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,630
Here's my think.

163
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,400
I wanna gain management experience
from others.

164
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,520
Jufeng and Risheng in Hang City

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,080
are well-known financial firms.

166
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,080
They're considered leaders
in the industry.

167
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,790
I looked at their job postings.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,470
The bar is quite high.

169
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,110
I might not even get in.

170
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,560
So, I've been looking
at other companies too.

171
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,080
Young man,

172
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,590
are you belittling our school

173
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,310
right in front of me?

174
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,680
No, I didn't mean it that way.

175
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,360
I wouldn't dare.

176
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,150
By the way, I remember Risheng has

177
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,950
a recommendation system, right?

178
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,270
Yes.

179
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
I may be retired,

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,630
but I still have some standing

181
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,470
in the industry.

182
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,150
If you're willing,

183
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,110
I can write you a recommendation letter.

184
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
But whether you pass the interview

185
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,590
will be up to you.

186
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,240
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,520
Mr. Jiang,

188
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,110
if you do write me a recommendation,

189
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,720
could you leave out my past at Jinhai?

190
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,150
Why?

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,240
Are you afraid
they'll know your background?

192
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,910
It's not that I'm afraid.

193
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,150
I just want to rely on my own ability.

194
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,270
Good.

195
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,750
There are

196
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,720
many paths in life.

197
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,950
Each one

198
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,270
has its own boundaries.

199
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,520
You've stuck to your boundary

200
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,630
and left Jinhai.

201
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,200
That decision alone

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
means you're on the right path.

203
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,200
People say there are three things
to see in life.

204
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,310
First, keep vision far.

205
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,290
Second, keep heart broad.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
Third, keep mind detached.

207
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,560
In these few words

208
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,720
lies deep meaning.

209
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,240
Many stand at the foot of a mountain

210
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,240
and let the mountain

211
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
block their view.

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,840
So,

213
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,000
they take the mountain
as their entire world.

214
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,590
Just learning to keep vision far

215
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
can take half a lifetime of detours.

216
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,590
Let me give you a gift too.

217
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,520
Think of it as paying you back
for the tea.

218
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,150
Sure.

219
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,840
This is for you.

220
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,200
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

221
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,840
[Way and Virtue]

222
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,880
Way and virtue.

223
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,680
Grandpa, I'm back.

224
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,520
My granddaughter's home.

225
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,790
Let me introduce you.

226
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,520
- Okay.
- Let's go.

227
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,590
You're back.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
We have a guest.

229
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,360
Yes, my favorite student,

230
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,790
Zhao Jiadi, came to visit me.

231
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,520
Come on, let me introduce you.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,720
My granddaughter,

233
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,000
Jiang Tanle.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,520
She also teaches at our school.

235
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,430
[Jiang Tanle]
She's a teacher at our school.

236
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
Tanle means having fun in playing Go.

237
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
What do you think?

238
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,840
Not bad, right?

239
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,040
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

240
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,310
You two should know each other.

241
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,150
You probably taught

242
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,110
their freshman English class.

243
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,720
I don't just know him.

244
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,790
I've heard all about him.

245
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,910
I heard there was a student

246
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,080
who attended every class

247
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,590
except English.

248
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,310
What happened?

249
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,950
After our talk,

250
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,150
you still didn't go to class?

251
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,000
I did.

252
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,270
Maybe Ms. Jiang forgot me.

253
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,910
I went for the exam.

254
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,590
Lost daily points,

255
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,720
but I didn't fail.

256
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,880
I saw his paper.

257
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,270
He did quite well.

258
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,360
Grandpa, you two keep chatting.

259
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,910
I'll go cook.

260
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,470
Mr. Jiang, you get some rest.

261
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,910
I'll head out.

262
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,590
No way.

263
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,840
You have to stay for dinner.

264
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,790
I was even thinking

265
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,080
of playing a few rounds with you.

266
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,200
Always losing to you

267
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,430
is getting a bit embarrassing.

268
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,040
Grandpa,

269
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,110
with your skills, you still lose to him?

270
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
You don't know this.

271
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,000
In my opinion,

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
Zhao's skills

273
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
are on par with Lin Peng's.

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,310
We're talking about Go.

275
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,630
Why bring him up?

276
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,400
Come on, Zhao.

277
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,430
Move that table over here.

278
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,470
Okay.

279
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
Get a stool.

280
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,520
Let's agree on this first.

281
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,150
You're better than me,

282
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,720
so I can make five moves first.

283
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,680
No problem.

284
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,200
Then I won't hold back.

285
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,560
I'll take black and start first.

286
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,080
Okay.

287
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,910
Chen, the fruit is on me.

288
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,910
After the renovation,

289
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,360
your turnover's not bad.

290
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,240
It's thanks to our regulars.

291
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,470
Enjoy, bro.
Call me if you need anything.

292
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,910
That kid

293
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,000
is exactly like me when I was young.

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,310
I was at this bar too.

295
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,680
I wondered why you insisted

296
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,150
on buying this bar.

297
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,200
You bought it for the memories.

298
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,310
I bought it for good luck.

299
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Shui's here.

300
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,950
Long time no see.

301
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,400
Go and have a drink.

302
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,830
Hello?

303
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,830
Hello, Uncle.

304
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,830
Hello, Bao.

305
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,560
I forgot my keys.

306
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,560
Send me your address.

307
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,510
No need.
I'll check which bus I can take.

308
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,510
All right.

309
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Sir, hi.

310
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,150
I live upstairs.

311
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,880
Can I leave this with you

312
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
for a while?

313
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,080
I'll come back for it later.

314
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Sure, just put it there.

315
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
Please take care of it.

316
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,950
By the way,

317
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,150
can you help me check

318
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,310
which bus goes to this address?

319
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,670
There are no more buses at this hour.

320
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,670
Do you have a map of Hai City?

321
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,510
I suppose so.

322
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,310
Hang on a second.

323
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,440
There was no time this morning

324
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,560
so I forgot to ask.

325
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,670
Are you still in Hai City
after graduation?

326
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,150
I have some business
to take care of there.

327
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,830
If you're around,

328
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,040
do you want to meet up?

329
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,150
Don't get me wrong.

330
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
I have a project
I wanna discuss with you in person.

331
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,760
I just saw your message.
I'm in Hai City.

332
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,350
We can meet. I'll send you my number.

333
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,510
I do have the map. Here it is.

334
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,470
Thanks.

335
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,080
Wei Jinghai

336
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,240
contacted me again

337
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,120
and said he wanted you

338
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,880
to meet Cai Yanzhi.

339
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,400
No.

340
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,470
Nalan Changsheng

341
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,670
and Wei Mingyi

342
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,120
are like half a benefactor to me.

343
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,670
It's only out of respect for them

344
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,120
that I let people call me by my name.

345
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,560
But I really don't like Wei Jinghai.

346
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,920
Wei Mingyi was a kind man,

347
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,630
but he was unlucky.

348
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,630
His son is nothing like him.

349
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
He's always going on

350
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,600
about getting revenge.

351
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
His head

352
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,040
is full of schemes.

353
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,880
You didn't reply for so long.

354
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,280
I thought you didn't want to see me.

355
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,880
I'm already in Hai City.

356
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,310
I happen to be free now,

357
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,670
but I can't promise later.

358
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay.

359
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,190
I can't refuse the favor.

360
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,190
I'm heading to M Bar.

361
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll send you the address.

362
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,120
Sure.

363
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,120
Just a heads-up.

364
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,040
I'm not good-looking,

365
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,510
so don't expect too much.

366
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,310
It's fine. We're about the same.

367
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,830
Bro, they're arguing over there.

368
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,400
Grab a bottle from the bar.

369
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,040
Got it.

370
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,400
Wei Jinghai said

371
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,600
Zhao Xin has gotten a share in the mining.

372
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,240
He claims he can make Zhao Xin
lose everything.

373
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,720
The grudge between me and Zhao Xin

374
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,760
is between the two of us.

375
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,400
He can't help with that.

376
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,240
If he comes to you again,

377
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,920
just say a few polite words.

378
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,920
I don't want to get involved.

379
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,760
Got it?

380
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Why are you so unreasonable?

381
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,920
You little punk.

382
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,920
They started being unreasonable!

383
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,510
Come on, sit down.

384
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,720
Please sit down.

385
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,950
Come on, sit down.

386
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,630
You must be the big shot, right?

387
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,080
Please calm down.

388
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,080
Please don't

389
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,990
hold it against them for my sake, okay?

390
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,080
You're just a waiter.

391
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,720
Why should I listen to you?

392
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,600
Get lost.

393
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,280
Or I'll trash your bar.

394
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,040
Sorry for speaking out of turn.

395
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,120
I'm just a waiter.
I mean nothing to you,

396
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,830
right?

397
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,600
Sir, we're here to have fun,

398
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,280
so we have to enjoy ourselves, right?

399
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,510
This wine

400
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,760
is on me.

401
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,760
Let me toast to you, okay?

402
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,040
I'll stop when you want me to.

403
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,120
Giving me wine?

404
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,240
Do you think I'm short on wine?

405
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,630
Do you think I'm short on wine

406
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,990
or money?

407
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,240
I see.

408
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,310
You want to stand up for them, huh?

409
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
Fine.

410
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,150
Here.

411
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,630
See this?

412
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,080
Drink all this wine,

413
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,630
and we'll call it even.

414
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,150
- Pour the wine.
- Pour it!

415
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,990
Fill it up.

416
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,670
Drink all of it.

417
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,240
Pour it.

418
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,920
Hurry. Pour the wine.

419
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,120
Pour it.

420
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,240
Be quick.

421
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,080
Drink every drop of the wine
on the table,

422
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,920
and I'll let it go.

423
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,150
Pour the wine. Drink up.

424
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,040
Bao.

425
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,240
Buddy.

426
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,120
That's enough.

427
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,040
Don't go too far.

428
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,510
Is this too far?

429
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,310
Is this too far?

430
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,600
Sir,

431
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll drink.

432
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,760
Is that okay?

433
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,080
Drink it.

434
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,280
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

435
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,920
Did you hear that?

436
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,440
He's drinking voluntarily.

437
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,400
I didn't force him.

438
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,830
Got it?

439
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll be back soon and drink.

440
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,670
Is that okay?

441
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,630
Sit.

442
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,950
Uncle.

443
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,240
Go away.

444
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,350
- What are you doing?
- What are you looking at?

445
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Uncle,

446
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,400
this is my job.

447
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,600
I have to drink.

448
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,950
Wait for me here.

449
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,150
I'll go get your keys.

450
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,600
- Drink up.
- Drink.

451
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,120
Come on, drink.

452
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,510
Drink. Drink. Come on.

453
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,280
Keep going. Don't stop. Drink.

454
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,440
Drink. Drink.

455
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,400
Come on, drink.

456
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,510
Aren't you good at drinking?

457
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,830
Don't you want to drink?

458
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,920
Come on, drink.

459
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,790
- Come on.
- Drink.

460
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,990
- Drink.
- Drink.

461
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,120
Come on, drink.

462
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,310
Good.

463
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,120
- Good.
- Good.

464
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,600
Don't stop.

465
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,040
Drink.

466
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,950
Drink up. I'll help you out.

467
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,630
Let me help you.

468
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,670
Come on.

469
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,190
I'll drink for him.

470
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,040
Another one.

471
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,120
Another one who can drink.

472
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
You upset me earlier.

473
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,720
You're drinking for him, right? Fine.

474
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
You drink this.

475
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,280
- Drink.
- If you're going to drink, drink this.

476
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,600
Let me give you some advice.

477
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,440
A man should live with dignity.

478
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,880
Don't hurt others' dignity.

479
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,400
You're lecturing me now?

480
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,880
You want dignity?

481
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,510
Fine.

482
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,670
I'll give you that dignity.

483
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,510
Get him.

484
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,400
Who?

485
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,630
Bro.

486
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,310
Come on.

487
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,790
Do you want to smoke?

488
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,240
Boss,

489
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,240
that's Chen Fusheng.

490
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,240
People

491
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,990
don't get to choose their background.

492
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
When you're under someone,

493
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,560
you've got to treat yourself
like a human.

494
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,790
When you're above someone,

495
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,990
you've got to treat others like humans.

496
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,040
Don't you agree?

497
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,240
These young men

498
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,790
are my friends.

499
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,240
So, I'd appreciate it

500
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,950
if you could let them go

501
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,560
for my sake.

502
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,990
Is that okay?

503
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,150
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,350
Chen.

505
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,280
Sit here.

506
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,400
Thanks.

507
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,280
I'm Zhao Jiadi.

508
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,640
Chen Fusheng.

509
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,440
I don't smoke.

510
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,350
You can keep that for now.

511
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,600
We'll meet again

512
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,550
sometime.

513
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,890
Just give me
something else in return.

514
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,760
[You have 6 missed calls.]
Oh no.

515
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,030
I forgot about her.

516
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,320
Sorry, sorry.

517
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,300
My friend was hospitalized last night.

518
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,760
I didn't mean to stand you up.

519
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,550
Hello?

520
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,870
Hello?

521
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,510
Hello?

522
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,830
Hello?

523
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,830
Hello?

524
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,760
Did you get my message?

525
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,480
Sorry about yesterday.

526
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,960
It was kind of sudden with my friend.

527
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,440
I didn't get to tell you earlier.

528
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,920
Is he doing better now?

529
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,440
Your friend?

530
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,350
Didn't you say he's in the hospital?

531
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,390
Luckily, we got him here in time.

532
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,100
He got his stomach pumped
and got an IV.

533
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,280
Now he's snoring,

534
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,510
strong as ever.

535
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,350
The doctor said he's fine.

536
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
I waited for you for hours yesterday.

537
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,670
I thought maybe you didn't wait for me

538
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,550
and went in first,

539
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,870
so you couldn't hear your phone ringing.

540
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,550
Why didn't you come and find me?

541
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,710
If you'd come to find me,

542
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,190
you'd have seen me drinking

543
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,000
with a group of beauties.

544
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,160
I don't believe it.

545
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,990
Maybe you can fool the young girls.

546
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,510
So, you're not young anymore?

547
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,080
Sorry about that, ma'am.

548
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm hanging up.

549
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,190
Just kidding.

550
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,990
Do you have time today?

551
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,830
I want to make it up to you

552
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,760
and talk about the project
you mentioned.

553
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,160
What?

554
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,920
No project means no apology?

555
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,550
That's nonsense.

556
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,710
How about I treat you to dinner?

557
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,870
But I have to warn you.

558
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,030
I'm a bit broke lately.

559
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,600
I'll pay, but you'll have to settle

560
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,640
for anything.

561
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,480
Meet at 5 p.m..
Send me the address.

562
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,710
Alright, I'll get there early this time.

563
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,990
I'll wait even if it's raining knives
from the sky.

564
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,480
If you don't come, I won't leave.

565
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,230
Hello?

566
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,480
Waiting for a long time?

567
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,710
I'm almost there.

568
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,760
It's only been two hours.

569
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,320
Didn't we agree on 5 p.m.?

570
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,830
I've been watching the time.

571
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,480
Just kidding.

572
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,670
There's quite a crowd now.

573
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,160
Do you want me to pick something up

574
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,640
to help you recognize me?

575
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,030
Just in case I don't look
like what you expected.

576
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,350
At least you'll be prepared.

577
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,960
No need. Just act like a normal person.

578
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,350
If I can still recognize you,

579
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,990
I deserve a reward.

580
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,600
Sure.

581
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,830
I'll just sell
a variable annuity product this year.

582
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,990
No charge for you.

583
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,280
It's settled.

584
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,320
What if I recognize you first?

585
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,120
We can decide after you recognize me.

586
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,710
Bye. See you later.

587
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,080
Alright.

588
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,230
You guys were way too rough.

589
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,190
So?

590
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,350
Have you thought it through?

591
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,870
Mr. Wei,

592
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,350
this has nothing to do with me.

593
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,440
I've worked for you for years.

594
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,510
You know me.

595
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,760
Even if I had ten times the guts,

596
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,160
I wouldn't dare steal your goods.

597
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,600
I know.

598
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,870
But you messed up

599
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,990
my plan with Zhao Xin.

600
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,190
Who's responsible

601
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,440
for that?

602
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,560
No, no.

603
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,320
Bro...

604
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,830
Who's responsible for that?

605
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,600
Come on.

606
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,320
Bro, please let me go.

607
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
Hold onto it.

608
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,440
Both hands. Come on.

609
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,830
Hold tight.

610
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,990
Bro,

611
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,350
just give me one more chance.

612
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,230
I swear I'll never betray you.

613
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,640
Please let me go.

614
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,080
Bro...

615
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,670
Bro,

616
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,830
I would never betray you.

617
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,480
Bro.

618
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,280
I swear I wouldn't.

619
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,280
Bro.

620
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,390
Bro.

621
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,390
Bro.

622
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,320
Bro, listen to me.

623
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,120
I won't betray you.

624
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,280
Zhuhe,

625
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,280
who owns your life?

626
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
You.

627
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,350
Just kidding.

628
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,800
What are you doing?

629
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,350
In a few days,

630
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,800
another shipment's coming in.

631
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,120
I need you to personally oversee it.

632
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,350
Think about it.

633
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,230
This is a big deal.

634
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,760
Of course, I have to test you.

635
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,960
Don't you agree?

636
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,390
Understood.

637
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,350
After checking the goods,

638
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,190
you'll need to stay on the high seas
for a while

639
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,320
to wait for my message.

640
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,830
Okay.

641
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,760
You might be out there for a long time.

642
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,320
Get ready for that.

643
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,870
Alright?

644
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,390
Open your mouth.

645
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,830
It's almost time.

646
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,990
Also,

647
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,800
get him a pair of pants.

648
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,510
Did you get in touch?

649
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,800
She said she's got something to do.

650
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,960
Let's go.

651
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,080
Young man,

652
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,030
I've seen you wandering around
for a while.

653
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,080
How about a sausage?

654
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,160
Alright, give me two.

655
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,030
Sure.

656
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,670
The money's here.

657
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,670
Sure.

658
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,440
- Here.
- Thanks.

659
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,080
Blooming Flowers?

660
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,280
Ma'am, ten sausages to go,

661
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,030
please.

662
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,830
Sure.

663
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,160
Here.

664
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,390
