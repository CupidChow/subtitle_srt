00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,950
Why do you have time to do this today?

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,000
Jinghai.

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,680
I just got back from Hai City.

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Grandpa asked

8
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,950
why you didn't come back with me.

9
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,310
I covered for you.

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,270
He's gone to meditate.

11
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,840
Why's he still so worried?

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,910
He's just concerned about you.

13
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,400
Look at this.

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,950
For me?

15
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,310
You came all this way

16
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,470
just to show me this, right?

17
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,950
This is a research report

18
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,110
from one of the company's partners.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,750
It's public,
but not many people know about it.

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,560
Take a look first.

21
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,240
Crude oil?

22
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,270
The economy's not doing well lately,

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,560
so it's only natural that capital

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,310
flows into commodities.

25
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,270
I've read this report.

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
It's quite rigorous.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
Go through it

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
when you have time.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,150
Which institution is it from?

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,270
I don't recognize the name.

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,270
That's not important.

32
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,150
Look at who's the investor.

33
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,750
I'll run a background check later.

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,910
But this type of product

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,720
isn't available
on the domestic futures market.

36
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,270
If we go overseas,
we'll need to apply for quotas.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,630
Crude oil prices are so volatile.

38
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,430
Without enough quota,

39
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,840
there's no point in doing it.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,200
Well.

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,720
What if we team up
with other financial firms?

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,470
We can raise more capital

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,680
and lower the risk.

44
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,590
Otherwise,
with the current financial market,

45
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,840
when are you going
to hit your 10-billion goal?

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,360
How do you know about that?

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Grandpa told you?

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Told me what?

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,470
I made a bet with him.

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,470
I only have an associate degree.

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,270
Luckily, I joined the industry early.

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
I started a year
before Lin Peng and the others.

84
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,040
They got promoted faster,

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
and I didn't like it at first.

86
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,680
But over time, I realized

87
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,560
having real knowledge in your head

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,470

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,720
Whatever it is, just tell me.

192
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,910
I'll take care of it.

193
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,950
How about this?

194
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,160
Just come and work at my company.

195
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,270
I'll offer you a high salary.

196
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,910
Didn't we agree

197
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,990
we'd treat each other as equals?

198
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,200
If you become my boss,

199
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,670
how am I supposed
to treat you to a meal?

200
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
Just treat me the same as always.

201
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,200
Then it's a deal.

202
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,440
We mustn't go back on our word.

203
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,550
No problem.
I've got something to do tonight,

204
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,760
so I'll talk to you later.

205

Call me anytime if you have questions.

206
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,350
Farmer, you're getting fancy.

207
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,590
I can even hear

208
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,910
English words from you.

209
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,310
Alright,

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,350
I'm hanging up. Bye.

Okay, bye.

212

Hey, sweetie.

213
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,310
Sir,

214
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,480
two pancakes and two servings of congee.

215
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,760
Here's the money.

216
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,440
I'll pick them up later.

217
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,350
Sir, how much is it?

218
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,270
Sixty.

219
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,440
Sir,

220
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,310
are they ready?

221
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,120
Yeah.

222
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,990
Here you go.

223
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,870
Thanks.

224
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,840
You're welcome.

225
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,950
Bao, breakfast.

226
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,550
Uncle, I don't get it.

227
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,350
Why do clothes

228
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,230
never dry here?

229
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,120
Feel this.

230
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,870
If you need them soon,

231
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,910
try using a hair dryer.

232
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,630
Good idea.

233
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,950
I've got

234
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,040
all your school supplies.

235
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,520
Use them wisely.

236
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,350
They weren't cheap.

238
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,840
I can use her kitchen

239
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,870
when the resto isn't busy.

240
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,720
Okay.

241
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,760
Uncle,

242
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
are you busy this afternoon?

243
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,230
I've got half a day off.

244
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,040
Let's go out for a walk.

245
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,950
I can't today.

246
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,310
I still need to finish the conclusion

247
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,440
of my research report.

248
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,080
Uncle, you're amazing.

249

Your job feels
like you're still at school.

250
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm going back.

251
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,990
Your congee.

252
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,080
I don't like congee.

253
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,950

harder for you.

is this your first time here?

290
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,310
Yes.

291

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,200
You must be Mr. Zhao.

Well.

304
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,630
I came here
because I had an appointment.

305
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,310
May I ask...

306
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,080
Zhao Jiadi.

307
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm the tea salesgirl.

Do we know each other?

309
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,520
Of course.

310
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,840
Or why would you have picked me?

311
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,990
The wind hits the window,
waking me from a dream,

312
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,950
and I saw Luoshen
[*Luoshen: Goddess of the Luo River]

314

318
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,840
I just picked it randomly.

319
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,080
It was an accident.

You know her.

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,270
during your stay in Hang City.

333
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,310
But I can't tell you

who that is.

335
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,630
Then I won't ask.

But please tell her.

not just because of my friend.

341
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,040
You've only just arrived in Hang City.

342
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,630
You don't know about the local ways.

343
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,310
Whether you're on a mission

344
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,440
or starting a business,

345
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,910

00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
I want you to be my sworn brother.

00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,120
What do you think?

350
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,440
Do you know who I am?

351
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,350
I can tell

352
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,200
you don't know much about me.

353
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
I've grown up

354
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,230
in a house full of sisters.

355
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,400
They all pampered me to death.

356
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,270
I got tired of it

357
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,720
so I ran away.

358
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,480
I've just got a weak look

359
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,310
so everyone feels sorry for me

360
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,590
and wants to take care of me.

361
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,080
I appreciate your kindness,

362
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,590
but I don't want to be
your sworn brother.

363
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,080
People's actions depend
on where they're from.

364
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,040
The people from the north
are used to being lone wolves,

365
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,270
yet those from the south are
like a pack of lions.

366

In Hang City,

367
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,230
there are all kinds of people.

368
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,230
Over time,

369
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,080
everyone gets used to sticking together.

370
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,840
In business,

371
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,240
people help each other,

372
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,440
and things get done.

373
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,950
Going solo

374
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,480
won't work.

375
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I've been in Hang City for a while now.

376
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,910
I've got all the connections and funds.

377
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,590
If you stick with me,

378
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,480
you won't lose out.

379
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,990
You're with the NCC, right?

380
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
You know it?

381
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,310
There are lots
of chambers of commerce here.

382
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,080
When it comes to local influence,

383
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,030
there's no doubt

384
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,310
the NCC is the No. 1.

385
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,240
You're lucky.

386
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,710
Most of its members are my clients.

387
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,670
If you want to meet them,

388
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,560
I can make the introductions.

389
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,910
Ms. Pei,

390
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,880
you're thinking too highly of me.

391
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,030
I'm just a small fry,

392
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
a newbie here.

393
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,520
I don't have much to offer.

394
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,590
Just getting into my current company

395
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,840
was tough enough for me.

396
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,670
With my situation,

397
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,840
what could I offer

398
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,710
to those big shots in exchange?

399
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Besides, I have a loose tongue.

400
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
I might

401
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
mess things up.

402
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,880
If you introduce me,

403
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,560
your plan might backfire.

404
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,560
It won't be worth it.

405
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,350
Chilan Bridge, right?

406
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,880
Ms. Pei, I appreciate the gesture,

407
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,630
but I've got work to do today,

408
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,670
so I can't be out too long.

409
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,950
If I don't finish my work,

410
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,160
I might lose my job.

411
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,310
Ms. Pei,

412
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,630
I didn't know what was going on,

413
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
so I didn't bring you a gift.

414
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,670
Sorry about that.

415
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,200
Please express my gratitude

416
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,760
to the person who wants

417
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,880
to take care of me.

418
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,480
If you don't mind, I'll leave.

419
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,520
Zhao Jiadi,

420
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,270
if you leave now,

421
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
don't regret it later.

422
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,840
I won't.

423
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,390
Good for you, Zhao Jiadi.

424
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,480
How unappreciative.

425
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,710
Breaking news.

426
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,670
According to the latest economic data
released by the U.S.,

427
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,480
the effects of the subprime crisis

428
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,560
have not been significantly alleviated.

429
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,630
The uncertainty in the U.S. economy

430
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,760
has caused frequent fluctuations
in international oil prices.

431
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,670
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission plans

432
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,670
to introduce new regulations

433
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,760
this month to curb market manipulation

434
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,440
in crude oil futures.

435
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
The U.S. President
also announced recently

436
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,440
that Wall Street
will face tighter regulations.

437
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
This move could trigger...

438
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,590
Hai, Jinhai's people
are in the mining district.

439
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,560
Sang Ke said
he could watch Zhao Xin for us,

440
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,030
but the money

441
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,630
needed to be paid upfront.

442
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,270
The rise in oil prices

443
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,080
is seen as a sign
of global economic recovery.

444
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,480
Many are optimistic about the market.

445
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,630
Next, let's look at the detailed news.

446
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,080
Have the traders arrived?

447
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
Yes, they're calibrating the equipment.

448
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,560
The money is in place.

449
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,160
However,

450
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,270
don't respond yet.

451
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,760
Keep him waiting for a few days.

452
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,670
Hai,

453
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,240
didn't you say

454
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,950
Mr. Li might come back early?

455
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,350
With so much money moving around,

456
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,240
will it...?

457
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
The research institute also believes

458
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,950
crude oil prices will keep rising.

459
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,880
I'll be only gone for a week.

460
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,840
There shouldn't be
any major fluctuations.

461
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,160
When you're monitoring,
don't be too hasty.

462
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,200
Don't rush into anything

463
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,270
because of a slight change.

464
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,440
Boss,

465
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,840
I was thinking the same way,

466
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,350
but

467
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,710
Manager Li has proposed

468
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,480
the warnings and stop-loss.

469
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,160
Maybe you should talk to her.

470
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,670
Come in.

471
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,910
Ms. Li.

472
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,270
We were just talking
about warnings and stop-loss,

473
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,120
and here you are.

474
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,030
You go back to work.

475
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,440
I'll talk with Ms. Li.

476
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,310
Alright, understood.

477
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,480
Call me if you need anything.

478
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,800
Got it.

479
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,670
Ms. Li, I'll leave you to it

480
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,480
and get back to work.

481
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,080
I heard

482
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,520
your department has taken

483
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,240
all the company's blankets.

484
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,270
How enthusiastic.

485
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,030
This wasn't my idea.

486
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,270
The guys noticed

487
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,080
a chance to practice offshore,

488
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,880
so they're scrambling to work overtime.

489
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,440
When I went to monitor last night,

490
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,910
the office was full of military cots.

491
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,950
I couldn't even move.

492
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,880
About setting the warnings
and stop-loss,

493
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,310
do you guys want to discuss it again?

494
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,630
Because the overall trend
is really good.

495
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
There's still a lot of room
for oil prices to rise

496
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,560
to get back to where they were
before last year.

497
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,630
Maybe we shouldn't
close positions so easily.

498
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,480
We could hold another seminar,

499
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,630
but

500
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,480
any adjustments will have to wait
until you return.

501
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,910
The ChiNext Board forum alone
will keep you busy.

502
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,520
I won't be at ease

503
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,670
if no one's keeping an eye
on things here.

504
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,120
How could no one be watching?

505
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,080
Wang's here.

506
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,350
You can't let him be too idle.

507
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,480
Since he got shares in the company,

508
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,710
he's been slacking off.

509
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,120
If I were like him,

510
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,440
I'd just retire already.

511
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,670
Why bother working?

512
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,480
Are there any interns involved

513
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,880
in this trade?

514
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,350
You mean Zhao Jiadi?

515
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,990
I think the kid's sharp

516
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,080
and very sensitive.

517
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,590
His personality

518
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,760
also complements Ming Gu's.

519
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,120
Maybe we could bring him in.

520
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,800
Interns should be doing

521
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,840
what they're supposed to do.

522
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,590
It's time for lunch.

523
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,030
Let's go eat.

524
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,310
This is good.

525
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,310
I can sleep here.

526
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,390
Who'd dare hit me with that clip?

527
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,670
I'm not complaining,

528
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,120
but I clean for you once a day.

529
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,670
Always clean for you.

530
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,950
And it's always a mess the next day.

531
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,520
It's true

532
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,990
almost no one comes here,

533
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,480
but you're still here.

534
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,880
It has to be a place for humans,

535
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,910
right?

536
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,440
The trash cans are here

537
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,910
for you to throw trash.

538
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,520
Look at you.

539
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,800
You throw trash everywhere.

540
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Only the three cans are clean.

541
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,440
People might think
you're collecting things.

542
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,310
Stop nagging.

543
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,240
Aren't you getting bored?

544
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,240
Don't you have anything better to do?

545
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,520
Didn't you say
you'd work with crude oil?

546
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,120
Go talk to your supervisor.

547
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,270
Why are you here bothering me?

548
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,120
I'd love to join
the crude oil project team.

549
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,950
It's such a good opportunity
to practice.

550
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,480
But I can't bring myself to ask.

551
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,240
You don't know. I was...

552
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
I don't want to hear.

553
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,440
If you don't want to try,
then just accept it.

554
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Don't think or fight, okay?

555
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,670
You didn't even try,

556
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,840
yet you're whining here.

557
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,710
What?

558
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,560
Are you waiting for someone
to give it to you?

559
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,630
What a coward.

560
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,080
Every company has a quota.

561
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,440
Two foreign exchange firms
didn't make the cut,

562
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,200
and Jufeng just gave them each

563
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,880
a quota of 200 million.

564
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,670
Jufeng started the whole thing.

565
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,200
Now it's making them

566
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,560
seem like the leader.

567
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,270
Everyone's sticking together

568
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,760
to increase the overall capital.

569
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,710
The profit depends
on each company's abilities.

570
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,350
I've heard

571
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,080
the Li Girl

572
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
might be young,

573
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,240
but she's got some skills.

574
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,270
In such a big group,

575
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,840
she's their only successor.

576
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,950
Anyone would want to nurture her.

577
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,840
That's true. Okay.

578
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,840
You guys eat.

579
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,440
I've got some things upstairs to handle.

580
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,200
I'll leave now.

581
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,520
Jiadi,

582
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,560
come and eat with us.

583
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,390
Hello, Ms. Li.

584
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,880
Hello, Mr. Lin.

585
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,390
Have a seat.

586
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,710
It's my first time seeing you
in the cafeteria.

587
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,080
I heard from Yu Kai

588
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,350
that you and Song Mingjian
compete every day.

589
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,390
Song Mingjian is good at this.

590
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm not really on his level.

591
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,910
You two chat.

592
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,240
I have something this afternoon.
I'll head out.

593
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,240
Mr. Lin.

594
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,120
I'd like to join
the crude oil project team.

595
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,480
You're an intern.

596
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,630
You should do what an intern
is supposed to do.

597
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,710
What?

598
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,840
Are you not happy with the assignment?

599
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,840
No.

600
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,990
The team leader's arrangements
are great.

601
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,760
I've learned a lot.

602
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,440
I've finished the tasks from you,

603
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
including the extra tasks.

604
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,910
I submitted them this morning.

605
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,270
So, I just want

606
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,560
a chance to gain more experience.

607
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,590
Primary product analysis

608
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,240
covers a lot of categories.

609
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,240
You're saying you've done all of them?

610
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,950
Fine.

611
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,950
Let me ask you.

612
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,910
What was the soybean production
in 2004?

613
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,520
The production was 189 million tons.

614
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
The consumption was 191 million tons.

615
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,520
The shortfall was 1.9 million tons.

616
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,910
In the first half of the year,

617
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,080
China's soybean market

618
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,990
was hit by sustained short-selling attack
from international funds.

619
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,710
The soybean price rose before falling.

620
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,760
What about the iron ore in 2005?

621
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,910
In 2005, global pig iron production
was 780 million tons.

622
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,910
Its consumption
reached 1.25 billion tons.

623
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,310
China imported 275 million tons,

624
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,390
accounting for 43%
of global seaborne trade,

625
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,520
making it the world's top importer.

626
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,710
And the three major mining companies...

627
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,590
What about

628
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,080
crude oil prices

629
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
in September 2002?

630
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,200
In September 2002,

631
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,760
as the international benchmark,
the London Brent Crude Oil

632
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,390
went up by 17 cents per barrel,

633
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,760
reaching 28.55 dollars.

634
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,160
New York crude futures

635
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,880
went up by 8 cents per barrel,

636
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,710
reaching 29.58 dollars.

637
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,590
In 2003, due to localized war,

638
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,160
the international crude oil price

639
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,560
was over 40 dollars per barrel.

640
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,520
Before the subprime crisis last year,

641
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,350
the peak was 147.50 dollars per barrel.

642
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,670
The 2001 crude oil data in the archives

643
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,520
had a few errors.

644
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,800
I've corrected them.

645
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,880
Also,

646
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,910
I added notes

647
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,390
to some pre-2001 crude oil analyses.

648
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,480
Lin,

649
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,520
your intern is so amazing.

650
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,480
You're not leaving us a chance.

651
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,670
If you're jealous, take him.

652
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,990
You said it.

653
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,480
I'll submit a report
to the higher-ups tomorrow.

654
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,520
Mr. Lin,

655
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
if you approve of me
joining the crude oil project team,

656
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,910
I'll work hard

657
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,710
without neglecting my current duties.

658
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,800
You can join the team,

659
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,800
but let's be clear.

660
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,670
You should follow orders.

661
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,950
You can't act on your own.

662
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,030
Or I'll kick you out of Risheng.

663
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,800
Understood.

664
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,440
Mr. Lin,

665
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,200
actually, I think we should

666
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,630
try the domestic market this year.

667
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,800
Our economy is recovering faster
than others.

668
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,440
With institutional support,

669
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,710
if nothing goes wrong,

670
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,630
this year's domestic futures
will be very lucrative.
