[Yunhai Hot Spring Club]

4
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,270
Mr. Liu,

5
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,030
business is business.

6
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,390
What's this for?

7
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,270
Negotiation.

8
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,070
We should all be upfront.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,790
Don't you agree?

10
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,310
No problem.

11
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,070
But since I'm here,

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,470
let my friend go back.

13
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,070
You don't need to worry about that.

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,510
Those two friends of yours

15
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,630
are taken good care of.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,030
Once we settle things,

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,670
you can all leave together.

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,550
Just wait here.

19
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,190
Sir, here's your locker key.

20
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,910
The boss is waiting for you inside.

21
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,270
You're Mr. Fan, right?

22
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,710
Before I met Manager Liu last time,

23
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,990
I looked up info on the developer.

24
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,910
You're as impressive

25
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,030
as they say.

26
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,990
Zhao Jiadi,

27
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,430
you scared Liu Xin

28
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,630
just to get to me.

29
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,270
Yes.

30
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,950
I wanted to
give you some advice.

31
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,790
When I traded watermelons
for steel,

32
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,790
you weren't even born yet.

33
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,550
Giving me advice?

34
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,230
I really can't stand schemers.

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,070
What do you actually want from me?

36
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,390
Trying to

37
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,030
clear a path for yourself?

38
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,430
Being wealthy isn't
about your bank account,

39
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,510
and status isn't just about your title.

40
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,790
I don't depend on you for anything

41
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,030
and I'm not asking you for money.

42
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,110
Why would I try to block your way?

43
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,990
Zhao, listen up.

44
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,350
Who gave you the nerve
to talk to Mr. Fan like that?

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,550
I don't have the nerve.

46
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,710
And I don't need it.

47
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,790
I just speak what I believe is right.

48
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,430
Mr. Fan,

49
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,590
I haven't seen
your commercial district plan,

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,030
but I can guess the general idea.

51
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,670
Let me be upfront.

52
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,190
The building where Ms. Fang
runs her noodle shop

53
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,470
isn't right for clothing stores.

54
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,950
It should be for food spots.

55
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,870
For companies to grow, skills matter,

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,670
but adapting
to a diverse world does too.

57
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,550
Looking at the trend,

58
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,430
e-commerce is really taking off

59
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,310
and clothing businesses
will feel it first.

60
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,230
The Internet is growing faster
than we imagine.

61
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,070
The new commercial city
is being built.

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,070
The focus has to be on dining spots.

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,870
Also, on entertainment and services.

64
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,430
Young people think differently now.

65
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,270
Once the subway's done,

66
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,830
the two business areas will connect,

67
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,670
and lots of young folks

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,070
will live nearby.

69
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,030
So leading with restaurants

70
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,030
is the real path to growth.

71
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,550
Mr. Fan,

72
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,070
I've said what I wanted to say.

73
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,870
If I crossed a line,

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,870
let me offer you a toast.

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,470
Take a seat.

76
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,590
Jiadi,

77
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,670
you work in finance, right?

78
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,190
Yeah.

79
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,350
With your skills,

80
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,190
why not head to Hai City?

81
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,270
But you ended up
coming to Hang City.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,830
I came to Hang City to help someone.

83
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,230
And honestly, to help myself too.

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,710
So you're saying,

85
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,790
Hang City means a lot to you.

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,630
Yeah, it does.

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,190
I've heard your advice.

88
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,910
Whether I take it or not,

89
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,110
that's my call.

90
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,550
You make a good point,

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,710
but you're not selfless.

92
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,510
To put it bluntly,

93
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,270
you're hoping to save a spot

94
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,310
for your friend who's opening a resto.

95
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,110
Am I right?

96
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,710
I can accept all the conditions

97
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,630
from your friend's store,

98
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,910
without arguing.

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,470
But I have one condition.

100
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,430
Go ahead.

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,830
I just said it.

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,510
I can't stand people who play games.

103
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,310
I hate it when people
try to outsmart me.

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,710
I want you out of Hang City tonight.

105
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,070
If you don't,

106
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,270
I can't promise
nothing will happen to you.

107
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,030
Are my friends okay?

108
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,550
That depends on you.

109
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,950
No problem.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,110
Mr. Fan, please make sure
they get home safe.

111
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,870
I'll leave today.

112
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,310
You agreed so easily.

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,150
Maybe your goal

114
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,670
isn't that important to you.

115
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,870
That's my business.

116
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,510
I don't owe anyone an explanation.

117
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,390
But Mr. Fan,

118
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,190
I need you to know this.

119
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,670
My friends are my bottom line.

120
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,190
No one gets to touch them.

121
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,990
As for the path,

122
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,870
if it works, I just go for it.

123
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,070
If not, I'll find another way.

124
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,510
There's always a way out.

125
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,190
Alright.

126
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,550
Good.

127
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,310
Loyal, brave, and proud.

128
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,270
I like that.

129
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,510
Boss,

130
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,750
I told you,

131
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,070
he really gets your vibe.

132
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,870
Don't worry.

133
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,150
Ms. Fang and the others
are upstairs getting massages.

134
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,510
I'm looking after them well.

135
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,950
Nothing's going on.

136
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,870
Call everyone down from upstairs.

137
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,830
Let's have a meal together.

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,150
Want me to give you a quick rub?

139
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,830
Maybe a back rub.

140
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,870
My acting's as good as yours, right?

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,670
It is.

142
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,470
Everyone's in bathrobes now.

143
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,350
I'll change into one too.

144
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,950
Just joining the fun with my people.

145
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,190
Used the wrong word there.

146
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,550
Uncle,

147
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,710
you should try it later too.

148
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,310
That massage was amazing.

149
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,870
You sure had a good time.

150
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,030
You had no idea

151
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,110
how nervous I was down there.

152
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,430
I honestly didn't think much of it.

153
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,910
Mr. Liu explained it well.

154
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,670
I can vouch for that.

155
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,470
This was all my boss's idea.

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,270
There's no way I'd think that up.

157
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,470
Mr. Fan.

158
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,070
The kitchen's got limited ingredients.

159
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,270
So I whipped up a few dishes.
Please try them.

160
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,910
This one looks pretty good.

161
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,590
The fish

162
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,990
was soaked in ginger juice, right?

163
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,430
Yeah.

164
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,350
Because cooking wine

165
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,510
takes away the freshness,

166
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,510
and I can't get used to vinegar.

167
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,030
Boss Fan,

168
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,110
you're amazing.

169
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,870
You just tasted it and knew everything.

170
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,430
I begged for ages
to get this secret recipe.

171
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,670
Well, it's not really a secret recipe.

172
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,710
You guys don't know,

173
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,630
my boss's wife cooks at home.

174
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,510
Her cooking

175
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,430
is amazing.

176
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,270
Just the smell

177
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,350
makes my mouth water.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,310
I've been with Mr. Fan for years.

179
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,630
Except for work dinners,

180
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,870
I've never seen him eat out.

181
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,190
No wonder.

182
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,670
Mr. Fan doesn't want to
run a restaurant.

183
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,870
With such great food at home,

184
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,470
nothing outside can compare.

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,350
Don't listen to him.

186
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,110
Fang.

187
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:55,870
Shang Bao.

188
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,750
Let's all have a seat.

189
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,710
Let's eat together, everyone.

190
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,430
Come on, sit.

191
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,670
Good food needs good wine.

192
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,470
Have a little of this.

193
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,830
Thank you.

194
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,390
It's made from pure grains, no headache.

195
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,550
Jiadi,

196
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,710
I caught what you said just now.

197
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,070
You were hinting at me, right?

198
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,590
Am I right?

199
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,310
Don't worry.

200
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,950
I always keep my word.

201
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,110
Fang,

202
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,270
about your resto,

203
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,550
I'll have someone touch base
with you later.

204
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,710
As for us,

205
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,150
we're not moving anymore.

206
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,150
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

207
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,990
Thanks.

208
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,510
Let's toast to you.

209
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,030
Yeah, toast to you.

210
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,470
I'll join you for a toast.

211
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,910
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

212
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,350
Thank you.

213
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,670
Thanks, Fan.

214
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,110
Nobody does it better than my boss.

215
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,510
Eat more. After, we can go soak again.

216
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,710
Later, I'll give you both a massage.

217
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,910
I'll give you two a massage.

218
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,550
Let me give a massage to you two.

219
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,550
Jiadi,

220
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,550
the favor you asked for your friend

221
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,710
can be considered done.

222
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,750
Does that mean

223
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,070
you owe me a favor now?

224
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,030
Of course.

225
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,390
Mr. Fan,

226
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,710
I'm not an expert in business deals,

227
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,870
but finance is my thing.

228
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,830
If you ever need anything,

229
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,870
just let me know.

230
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,110
Actually, I have a project now.

231
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,750
I'm thinking of a joint venture.

232
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,670
I want to

233
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,950
take over
the joint venture's management.

234
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,310
But I'm short on liquidity.

235
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,190
So I want to ask Risheng

236
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,670
for the funding.

237
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,790
Is it a real estate project?

238
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,390
Given Risheng's profile,

239
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,910
we might not do real estate financing.

240
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,070
You'll need to talk to a bank.

241
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,510
No,

242
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,910
it's a mining company.

243
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,070
It's over in Kalpunia.

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,590
You can look into it

245
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,470
when you get a chance.

246
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,550
I heard

247
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,030
that the NCC

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,990
worked with Risheng years ago.

249
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,230
Boss Fan,

250
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,390
I can't follow all this,

251
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,790
but

252
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,430
I always thought real estate was great.

253
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,470
Skyscrapers and everything.

254
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,190
But just hearing "mining company"

255
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,950
makes me tired.

256
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,030
Come off it.

257
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,750
He's joking.

258
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,310
To this day,

259
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,870
I earn every penny through hard work.

260
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,310
I've always felt

261
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,630
you only get

262
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,270
what you can handle.

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,310
But things are different now.

264
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,070
I've got more people on my team.

265
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,390
I have to think about them too.

266
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,910
I can't just

267
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,470
enjoy everything alone,

268
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,990
while the rest work hard for me.

269
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,310
Fan,

270
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,110
good drinks are easy to find,

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,870
but true friends are rare.

272
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,950
If you trust me,

273
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,350
let me handle the financing.

274
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,230
No matter how it goes,

275
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,390
I'll give you an answer.

276
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,470
Eat more, okay?

277
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,910
After this, I have to head to the mine.

278
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,950
Try the dish I made.

279
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,830
Here, have some of Fang's fish.

280
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,150
Xu Ziqi,

281
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,430
if you're not upstairs,

282
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,710
I'll deal with you.

283
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,270
Mr. Huang.

284
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,620
[Huang Hu,
Chairman of Honghu Global Group]

285
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,630
And you are?

286
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,030
Hello.

287
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,190
I'm Li Zhijin.

288
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,670
When I was abroad,

289
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,790
I attended one of your talks.

290
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,350
But I'm sure you don't remember.

291
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,870
You're Minxian's granddaughter.

292
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,750
I know, I know.

293
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,790
I just met your grandpa not long ago.

294
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,470
I saw your photo at your place.

295
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,310
He talks about you

296
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,310
all the time.

297
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,990
Miss,

298
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,790
please have a seat.

299
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,630
I didn't plan
to use my grandpa's name.

300
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,110
I didn't except

301
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,310
you two know each other.

302
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,790
My family is originally from Hang City.

303
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,430
I go way back with your grandfather.

304
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,070
We met

305
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,390
long before you were born.

306
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,830
It's just that these years,

307
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,510
I've been living overseas.

308
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,310
So we didn't keep in touch much.

309
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,630
Miss,

310
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,430
what brings you here?

311
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,190
Honestly, my plan was

312
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,310
to pretend we ran into each other
by chance.

313
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,790
See if we could maybe work together.

314
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,190
But now, with my grandpa in the mix,

315
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,030
I can't do it that way.

316
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,150
Your grandpa

317
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,150
wants you back at Li Group.

318
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,190
If that happens,

319
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,030
there's a chance

320
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,790
we could start doing business together.

321
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,790
Mr. Huang.

322
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,110
Are you planning to go back
after this visit?

323
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,590
As people age,

324
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,470
they just want to return home.

325
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,270
My wife

326
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,510
always wished

327
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,790
to go back to where we started.

328
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,110
It was me

329
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,070
who held us back.

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,870
I know you run a business.

331
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,430
I can guess why you wanted to see me.

332
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,910
But honestly,

333
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,030
at my age,

334
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,830
money's not

335
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,710
what I care about anymore.

336
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,630
A company is easy to build,

337
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,870
but talents are hard to find.

338
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,830
You...

339
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,030
I came back,

340
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,670
trying to gather

341
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,390
the overseas investors
I have connections with,

342
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,870
to set up a foundation together.

343
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,310
It'll focus on local development.

344
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,470
I get it now.

345
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,630
So what you're looking for

346
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,270
isn't a company like Jufeng,

347
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,430
but someone reliable,

348
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,310
or a trustworthy team,

349
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,790
to help manage the foundation for you.

350
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,630
Exactly.

351
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,110
Mr. Huang, I know just the right person.

352
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,310
Really?

353
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,390
I'm confident about this.

354
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,190
He checks every box you have.

355
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,630
When do you have time?

356
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,390
I'd like you

357
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,230
to meet him.

358
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,750
Sure.

359
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,230
A meeting's not the problem,

360
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,630
but honestly,

361
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,070
there's someone else too.

362
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,070
Ms. Deng.

363
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,350
Is it ready?

364
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,990
Yes.

365
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Here you go.

366
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,190
Alright.

367
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,750
Hope your business booms.

368
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,670
Thanks.

369
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,150
Hey, Mr. Farmer,

370
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,230
didn't you ask me for work before?

371
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,150
I've got something now.

372
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,110
It's a big job.

373
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,790
What is it?

374
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,110
But it might take some time.

375
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,030
Just tell me straight.

376
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,190
When are you free this week?

377
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,550
I'll set it up for you.

378
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,190
He has someone in mind too.

379
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,630
If you're late, you might miss out.

380
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,710
Then maybe just let it go.

381
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,830
You can't force...

382
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,630
Mr. Farmer,

383
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,670
were you genuinely

384
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,030
asking for my help?

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,430
Of course.

386
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,230
We have to meet.

387
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,350
Thursday won't work.

388
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,350
I already have plans.

389
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,390
Tomorrow or Friday is fine.

390
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,030
You pick.

391
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,190
He seems busy tomorrow.

392
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,630
The day after tomorrow morning works.

393
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,030
Or let's tentatively set for Friday.

394
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,990
I'll see if I can set it up.

395
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,710
As for my side,

396
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,990
I'll prepare some info for you.

397
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,910
Take it home and read it carefully.

398
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,990
Make sure to read it.

399
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,790
Alright?

400
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,910
Got it.

401
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,470
197-6 Huasheng Road.

402
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Hey.

403
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,630
If you just walk in like that,

404
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,030
I swear I'll start shouting

405
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,630
that Zhao Jiadi abandoned his family,

406
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,510
and left everyone behind.

407
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,110
Miss Pei,

408
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,710
did I do something to upset you?

409
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,110
If I did, just tell me,

410
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,270
and I'll apologize right away.

411
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,910
Wasn't it right here

412
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,510
they hit you last time?

413
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,910
Broker Zhao,

414
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,950
your job today is to keep me company.

415
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,190
Once I'm in a good mood,

416
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,910
I'll tell you

417
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,710
about my investment preferences,

418
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,150
and what I expect,

419
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,750
and all that stuff.

420
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,910
Anyway, your boss said,

421
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,910
"Customers come first."

422
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,070
I need to drop something off.

423
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,670
We're pretty much done here, right?

424
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,630
I'll leave your stuff in the car and go.

425
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,950
No way.

426
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,630
I still haven't bought enough.

427
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,630
Let's try another mall instead.

428
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,830
I want to check out that bracelet.

429
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,950
I'm not like you, all rich and free.

430
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,230
I can't waste my time here.

431
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,830
Maybe find someone else
to hang out with.

432
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,190
Zhao Jiadi,

433
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,390
you came to Hang City
for a reason, right?

434
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,510
You'd better tell me now.

435
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,750
I might even help you plan things.

436
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,590
Otherwise, if something happens to you,

437
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,990
I won't be able to help at all.

438
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,630
Just be straight with me.

439
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,310
What could even happen to me?

440
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,590
So, you're curious now?

441
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,070
Start the car.

442
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,710
Why did you used to

443
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,830
ignore talks about the NCC?

444
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,030
Now you can't stop asking about it.

445
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,870
So in the Li Group,

446
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,110
is the real leader Wei Jinghai,

447
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,030
or Li Minxian?

448
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,710
Honestly, I'm not sure about that.

449
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,310
But Mr. Li

450
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,030
has been out of the spotlight for years.

451
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,710
He only shows up

452
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,990
when it's really important.

453
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,190
I've only seen him once or twice myself.

454
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,150
Wei Jinghai.

455
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,950
What kind of person is he?

456
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,950
Zhao Jiadi,

457
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,230
I don't want to talk about it with you.

458
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,830
As for Mr. Wei,

459
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,830
I haven't met him much.

460
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,830
But I've heard plenty about him.

461
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,830
His relationship
with the Lis is complicated.

462
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,390
He's pretty much Mr. Li's foster son.

463
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,790
How do I describe him...

464
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,870
He always thinks before he speaks,

465
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,390
never leaves any loose ends.

466
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,390
He's pretty mysterious.

467
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,030
Isn't there another heir
to the Li Group?

468
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,430
Chairman Li's granddaughter.

469
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,630
So what's her role in the Li...

470
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,190
Zhao Jiadi,

471
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,590
when you're with me,

472
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,630
don't talk about other girls.

473
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,910
I'm home.

474
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,590
Alright.

475
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,830
Okay, I'm heading out.

476
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,110
I've got so much stuff here.

477
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,710
Are you going to help?

478
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,590
Fine.

479
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,990
Wait a sec.

480
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,230
Don't worry.

481
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,750
Let me pop the front trunk.

482
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,310
I won't bite, relax.

483
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,030
It's open now.

484
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,750
Right here.

485
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,230
Go knock on the door.

486
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,990
There's a nanny inside.

487
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,630
Sit wherever you like.

488
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,510
Where did you run off to, silly girl?

489
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,430
Ms. Cai.

490
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,710
Zhao Jiadi.

491
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,150
Ji Jie.

492
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,870
Yanzhi.

493
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,230
What brings you two here?

494
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,230
We're here to check on you.

495
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,870
You must be Zhao Jiadi.

496
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,550
Yanzhi's mentioned you before.

497
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,910
I'm Ji Jie.

498
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,230
We're all close friends.

499
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,990
Hey there.

500
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,750
Hi, Ji Jie.

501
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,710
Let's just keep it another way.

502
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,470
Hi, Ms. Ji.

503
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,110
Ms. Cai.

504
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,870
Why didn't you tell me
you came to Hang City?

505
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,830
I could've picked you up.

506
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,590
It's fine. I know you're busy.

507
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,470
Have you lost some weight?

508
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,110
You look great, though.

509
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,270
They're all grown adults.

510
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,510
No need for you to pick me up.

511
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,870
Miss Pei is our company's client.

512
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,750
I didn't know you two knew each other.

513
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,870
If I had,
I'd have taken better care of her.

514
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,830
Jiadi.

515
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,550
Where's the lingerie I bought today?

516
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,270
I didn't see it anywhere.

517
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,870
Did you leave it in the car?

518
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,110
Luoshen

519
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,070
has got a bit of a temper.

520
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,910
Don't take it to heart.

521
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,350
Got it.

522
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,870
Oh right, Ms. Cai.

523
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,670
I actually wanted to talk to you.

524
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,270
Should we go somewhere else?

525
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,350
Sure.

526
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,190
No way.

527
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,270
My place is huge.

528
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,070
But there's nowhere for you two to talk?

529
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,790
There's the living room, bedroom, study.

530
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,270
Pick any room you like.

531
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,910
Ji Jie.

532
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,030
Let's head out together.

533
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,350
Leave this house to them.

534
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,150
Let them have a proper talk here.

535
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,150
Ms. Cai.

536
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,750
Did I say something wrong?

537
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,990
She...

538
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,270
She just needs to vent a bit.

539
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,790
Looks like my grandma was right.

540
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,190
The prettier a woman is,

541
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,150
the more complicated it gets.

542
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,790
Let's go.

543
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,590
Hold on.

544
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,910
Are you saying

545
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,030
I'm not pretty enough?

546
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,070
Ms. Cai.

547
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,030
Please, don't be like this.

548
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,230
Come here.

549
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,710
Pei.

550
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,630
Pei Luoshen.

551
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,510
You're not a kid anymore.

552
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,310
Why should I?

553
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,190
Why is she always in the center?

554
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,830
It's always Cai Yanzhi, no matter what.

555
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,110
Why does she get Yang Qingdi?

556
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,150
All those years she had

557
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,550
is more than most get in a lifetime.

558
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,310
I just want that kind of love too.

559
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,510
Every day,

560
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,190
she always looks so cold.

561
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,030
Didn't she already say it?

562
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,710
Yang Qingdi has her whole heart now.

563
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,870
There's no space left for Zhao Jiadi.

564
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,950
So what was she doing just now?

565
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,030
She kept looking at Zhao Jiadi.

566
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,470
What kind of look was that?

567
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,910
Ji Jie, can you be the judge here?

568
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,390
Silly you,

569
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,390
you've never had a tough time.

570
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,630
We've all spoiled you way too much.

571
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,950
All these years,

572
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,830
you've competed
with Yanzhi for everything.

573
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,990
Whatever she likes, you like too.

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,870
Luckily, Yanzhi never held it
against you.

575
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,030
Besides,

576
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,270
you're sweet and lovable.

577
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,550
If it were someone else,

578
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,190
you two would've split ages ago.

579
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,150
I knew you were on her side.

580
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,270
Someone said this before.

581
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,470
She doesn't love a specific person.

582
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,190
She's in love with

583
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,790
the idea of love itself.

584
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,710
As long as someone makes her happy,

585
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,710
she'll like whoever that is.

586
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,430
What,

587
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,790
are you getting serious

588
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,550
about Zhao Jiadi?

589
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,630
No way.

590
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,710
He's just some clueless boy,

591
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,630
always getting on my nerves,

592
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,710
no social skills,

593
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,950
no manners,

594
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,070
and always pretending to be proper.

595
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,270
Even after getting beaten up,

596
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,510
he still tries to help others.

597
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,110
Why would I like...

598
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,230
You don't see many like him though.

599
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,630
Right?

600
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,430
I heard Fan Longquan
asked you to help with funding.

601
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,710
Yeah.

602
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,190
I've sorted out the info on Risheng.

603
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,630
If I get anything wrong,

604
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,430
just let me know.

605
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,750
Kalpunia covers 738 square kilometers.

606
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,510
It's rich in mineral resources,

607
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,990
copper, iron, aluminum,
zinc, gold, lead, and nickel,

608
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,910
even diamond and rare earth minerals.

609
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,670
But what they mine the most

610
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,310
is bauxite.

611
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,830
The Nanshan Chamber of Commerce

612
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,230
is located
in the northern part of Kalpunia.

613
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,790
What they produce

614
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,790
is also bauxite.

615
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,550
But Ke's mining district

616
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,030
is in the south.

617
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,390
Over there,

618
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,990
they just found a huge iron ore deposit.

619
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,430
That means

620
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,830
when Jinhai first stepped in,

621
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,790
they weren't competing
with the NCC.

622
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,190
But now,

623
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,870
the area Mr. Fan wants to expand into

624
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,230
just happens to be between both sides.

625
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,510
The resource there

626
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,710
is also iron ore.

627
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,830
On the NCC's side,

628
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,230
they've got workers,
hydropower, transport, stockyard,

629
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,230
and all the facilities they need.

630
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,230
If they switch to iron ore,

631
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,630
they just need to
update their equipment,

632
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,310
and find a mining plant.

633
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,390
Then, they can start anytime.

634
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,910
But it's different for Jinhai.

635
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,030
They have to
start everything from scratch.

636
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,910
Zhao Xin might not even
have finished building yet,

637
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,910
when the NCC is already shipping out.

638
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,990
Same supply.

639
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,550
Same origin.

640
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,630
But Zhao Xin will lose on time.

641
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,030
I heard Jinhai already started

642
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,590
the initial construction work.

643
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,590
And the investment's pretty big.

644
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,190
So, looking at it this way,

645
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,430
there's not much chance to win.

646
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,550
I used to think getting the mine

647
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,830
back for Ke from Jinhai

648
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,550
would take at least fifteen years.

649
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,270
But now, I think there's a shot.

650
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,070
Though

651
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,070
I haven't figured out exactly how,

652
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,710
I'll need to use the NCC.

653
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,910
If I can get shares
in the joint venture,

654
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,110
everything gets way easier.

655
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,470
That's a tough challenge,

656
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,710
not much easier than facing Jinhai.

657
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,390
I know.

658
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,950
But I have to give it a shot.

659
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,230
Will you come clean with Fan Longquan?

660
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,430
Yeah,

661
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,190
but not right now.

662
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,110
Ms. Cai.

663
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,670
I'm not that selfless.

664
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,910
I do care about Ke's situation.

665
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,270
Mr. Fan only sees me

666
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,630
as someone he respects, nothing more.

667
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,790
There's no real bond or trust yet.

668
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,430
I need to help him out first.

669
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,750
He should see

670
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,630
what kind of person I am,

671
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,830
and what I can actually do.

672
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,830
Then I'll come clean with him.

673
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,390
I know the NCC sticks together,

674
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,710
and Li Group is always in the mix.

675
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,590
But for now, there's no real chance

676
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,630
to meet Wei Jinghai.

677
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,750
Still, I think
I should test his attitude.

678
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,510
Actually, I can offer you a chance.
