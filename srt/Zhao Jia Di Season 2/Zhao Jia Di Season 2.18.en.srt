00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,040
I know.

194
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
Grandpa meeting you now

195
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,920
is hoping you'll recommend someone

196
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
to take my place, right?

197
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,720
Maybe I should take a cab back.

198
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,600
Uncle Wang,

199
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,360
I'm not trying
to make things hard for you.

200
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,960
But

201
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,720
I can't have Grandpa pressuring me

202
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
just because of one word from you.

203
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
Jufeng is my life's work.

204
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,640
At the very least, I should meet

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
whoever you and Grandpa pick.

206
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,560
There is someone,

207
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,720
but whether it works is up to you guys.

208
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,640
Uncle Wang,

209
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,920
how about we make a bet?

210
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,440
I'll prepare some questions.

211
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,160
I'll meet the person you recommend.

212
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,800
If they're truly outstanding,

213
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,040
they'll have no trouble answering them.

214
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,560
But if they can't answer them,

215
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,480
you'll have to tell Grandpa

216
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,400
they can't do this.

217
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
Well...

218
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
You don't even trust your own man?

219
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,440
No, it's not that.

220
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
Alright, then it's settled.

221
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,240
What? It's settled?

222
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,920
What?

223
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,360
Wait. Say that again.

224
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,000
Did I not hear it clearly
or did I not understand it?

225
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,160
Wang.

226
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Wang.

227
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,640
Wang.

228
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,160
Are you feeling guilty toward me?

229
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,560
Do you know where we are?

230
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
This is Risheng.

231
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,000
Where are you going to recommend me to?

232
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,960
Are you still helping Fan Longquan?

233
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,320
Yes.

234
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
Are you meeting the person
who can help Fan Longquan?

235
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,960
What?

236
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,360
If you are, stop talking nonsense.

237
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
Come with me to meet someone

238
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,160
and answer a few questions.

239
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,160
If it goes smoothly,

240
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
I'll take you to meet Li Minxian.

241
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,320
Dress properly when we go.

242
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,560
Sis,

243
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
are you really going back to Li Group?

244
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,880
If you leave,
what will happen to Jufeng?

245
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,200
What about me, sis?

246
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
Sis, say something.

247
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,960
Think about it.

248
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,800
Now, Mr. Li is in Li Group,

249
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,200
and my dad keeps an eye on me at home.

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
How am I supposed to survive, sis?

251
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,520
I need to interview someone.

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,160
Go tell the Research Department
to prepare a set of questions

253
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,960
that are hard to answer.

254
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,760
Got it.

255
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,720
Just wait, sis.

256
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,560
I'll get it done for you.

257
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,200
Wait for me.

258
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
Farmer,

259
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,160
when will you come and ask me?

260

[Li Residence]

261
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,560
Mr. Li,

262
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,960
Mr. Fan Longquan is here.

263
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Let him in.

264
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,360
Come in, please.

265
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,160
You hardly visit,

266
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,840
and when you do,
you just stand there like a door god?

267
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
I'll just say a few words,

268
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,960
and then I'll leave.

269
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,560
Still as stubborn as ever.

270
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,000
You don't even greet me?

271
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,960
Boss.

272
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
Say it then.

273
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,040
You said you'd let everyone

274
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,320
vote for a commander-in-chief

275
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,360
and you'd take a look at our assets.

276
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,400
You've got what you wanted.

277
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
This is all I have.

278
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,720
I came today to ask you one thing.

279
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,680
Do you intend to be in charge

280
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
of the joint expansion?

281
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Yes.

282
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,040
Good.

283
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,040
When I had nothing,

284
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
you helped me out.

285
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,560
I will remember

286
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,600
your kindness forever.

287
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,240
So, I'll listen

288
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,040
to whatever you say.

289
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,440
But don't forget this:

290
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,160
What makes me fight

291
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,560
is never the money.

292
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Boss,

293
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,120
let me remind you:

294
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Don't steer the ship off course.

295
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,600
Do you think I don't know

296
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
what's in your heart?

297
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,600
I'll give you an explanation.

Are you done?

299
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,920
Yes.

300
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,560
Can you sit for a while?

301
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,840
Here.

302
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
How's the family?

303
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,960
Good.

304
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,760
Lan

305
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
wants to have a second child.

306

We're still thinking about it.

bring Lan and the kid over to visit.

Got it.

312
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Oh, right.

313
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
One more thing.

314
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,200
I have a younger friend.

315
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,960
He's a good kid.

316
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,320
I'd like to bring him into the NCC.

317
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,320
The one who's helping you with funding?

318
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,680
You knew him?

319
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,440
You're not the only one
who speaks highly of him.

320
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,680
Even now,

321
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,800
Zhao Jiadi is still full of doubts.

322
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,160
How could Wang Qihan know Li Minxian?

323
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,920
Why would Wang recommend him to Li?

324
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,120
Isn't Fan competing

325
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,360
with the Li family?

326
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,680
If they really meet,

327
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,760
can he still fight for Fan Longquan?

328
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,960
If he wants to join the NCC,

329
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,720
Li Minxian is clearly the most helpful.

330
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,920
But everything Fan Longquan has done

331
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
has made Zhao determined

332
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,080
that he'd never betray him.

333
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
Judging by Wei Jinghai's reaction
last time,

334
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,520
their grudges with Jinhai

335
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,200
must be old history.

336
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,120
Should Zhao reveal his true identity?

337
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,240
What would the consequences be?

338
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,440
What about tomorrow's interview?

339
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,720

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,360
Zhao is not a great surname.

383
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,720
It means craving for others' things.

384
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,880
There's an information gap.

385
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
I'll explain later.

386
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Ms. Li,

387
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
are we still doing

388
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,720
the interview?

389
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,280
Of course.

390
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,040
I have many questions for you.

391
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,040
Are you ready?

392
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
Yes.

393
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,160
There might not be enough time.

394
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,800
We'll start with something simple.

395
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,960
Sure.

396
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,280
Grandpa says to Ming,

397
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,320
"My age this year"

398
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,640
"is seven times yours."

399
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,320
"After a few years,
it will be six times yours."

400
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,080
"Some years later,"

401
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,920
"it'll be five times,"

402
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,120
"four times,"

403
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
"three times,"

404
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,160
"and twice."

405
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,880
So,

406
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
how old are Grandpa

407
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,840
and Ming this year?

408
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Ming is ten years old.

409
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,280
Grandpa is 70.

410
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,320
What's 18 to the 7th power?

411
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,040
612,220,032.

412
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,680
In which battle did Xiang Yu...?

413
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,680
Battle of Julu.

414
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,320
One must not be arrogant...

415
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Mr. Xu Beihong.

416
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,760
I missed you.

417
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,080
Hai,

418
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,320
Manager Gu sent over
the department files

419
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,360
we asked for.

420
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,720
If nothing's wrong with it,

421
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
I'll take them to Ms. Li.

422
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,600
Go ahead.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,560
Okay.

424
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
What's wrong, Hai?

425
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,240
I'll deliver them myself.

426
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,560
Get the car.

427
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,120
Got it.

428
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
I didn't see it myself,

429
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,680
but folks in the room say

430
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
that Ms. Li suddenly hugged that guy.

431
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,720
Oh, my god, I can't even imagine.

432
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
Was he handsome?

433
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,640
I...

434
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,960
Hello, Mr. Wei.

435
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I didn't see it either.

436
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,360
Here. Candy time.

437
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,080
Give me one.

438
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,600
Calm down.

439
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,560
Everyone will get it.

440
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,320
Here. Hey.

441
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,000
Ziqi,

442
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,120
what will his position be?

443
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,760
What else?

444
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,880
He'll be Ms. Li's boyfriend.

445
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,000
Congrats. Congrats.

446
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,360
No need to snatch it.

447
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
Here you go.

448
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,240
Hey, come on.

449
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,240
You'll all get it.

450
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,240
Okay.

451
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,360
Jinghai.

452
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,200
What's going on?

453
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm handing out candy.

454
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,440
Where's Zhijin?

455
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,120
Zhijin...

456
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,080
[Fei's Restaurant]

457
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
Bao.

458
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,080
It's okay with me,

459
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,280
but Tongtong is still young,

460
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,320
so I...

461
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,920
That's an excuse.

462
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,400
You either like me

463
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
or you don't.

464
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
No need for those excuses.

465
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Bao,

466
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,600
I've been married before.

467
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,200
My ex...

468
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,160
So what if you've been married?

469
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
You've been married before.

470
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,960
So what?

471
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,880
If you tripped and fell once,

472
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,080
would you never walk again?

473
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,240
If you're just looking for fun,

474
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
just say it.

475
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,400
I can handle it.

476
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,120
Bao,

477
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,720
I'm 33.

478
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
What do I have for fun?

479
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,960
I, Shang Bao,

480
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
swear to heaven...

481
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Bao.

482
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,200
Uncle.

483
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,520
Good.

484
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,960
You don't have to hide it.

485
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,840
Every time you heard about Ms. Fang,

486
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,400
you'd giggle like a fool.

487
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,240
Ms. Fang,

488
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,040
let me officially introduce you.

489
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
This is my girlfriend,

490
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,080
Li Zhijin.

491
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,240
Bao, Ms. Fang,

492
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,120
thank you for looking after Jiadi.

493
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,760
He's always saying

494
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,320
this place feels like home,

495
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,240
so he brought me here to meet family.

496
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,480
Then today,

497
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,160
I've got something to announce too.

498
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
Fang Fei,

499
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,160
let me finish what I was saying.

500
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
I, Shang Bao,

501
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
swear to heaven:

502
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
If I'm not serious about you,

503
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,760
you can chop me up
and feed me to animals.

504
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,000
Remember this.
I'll be punished if I lie.

505
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,920
I like you.

506
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,000
Then go

507
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,480
and take care of Jiadi
and his girlfriend.

508
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,120
I'll make something for you to eat.

509
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,720
Why are you standing there?

510
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,280
Go.

511
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,200
Go on, go.

512
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,640
Hurry, hurry.

513
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,240
I want that too.

514
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,520
What do you mean?

515
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,120
You didn't even say anything

516
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,640
in front of everyone today.

517
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,600
Make it up to me.

518
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,080
Right here?

519
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,520
How am I supposed to make it up here?

520
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Then let's go stand
in the middle of the road,

521
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,400
and you can shout.

522
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,000
No need for new things.

523
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,960
Just shout what Bao just did.

524
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,160
Let's go.

525
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,640
I'll make it up to you a different way.

526
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,000
What?

527
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,040
Didn't you have a dream once?

528
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I'll make that dream come true.

529
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,320
Heaven and earth will be our witness.

530
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
It'll be even more romantic.
