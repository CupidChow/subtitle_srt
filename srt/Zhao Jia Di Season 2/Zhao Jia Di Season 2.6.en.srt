00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,240
I recognized you first.

4
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,040
I win.

5
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't forget the reward you promised me.

6
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,950
Sorry about that.

7
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,400
It's fine.

8
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,310
I was getting hungry anyway.

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
Let me treat you to something tasty.

10
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,270
Thanks, sir.

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,200
If you usually eat fancy stuff,

12
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,880
you need some
down-to-earth food like this.

13
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,000
Otherwise, it's easy to lose touch
with real life.

14
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,110
I didn't get a chance to ask.

15
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,950
What's your name?

16
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,270
Names don't matter.

17
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,520
They're just social labels.

18
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm right in front of you.

19
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,310
Alright, let's introduce ourselves.

20
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,400
Hi, Farmer from Tang City.

21
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm Blooming Flowers.

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,110
Hi, Blooming Flowers.

23
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm Farmer from Tang City.

24
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,910
There are some people

25
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,840
whose presence brings real joy

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,110
from the moment you see them.

27
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,400
Even the air around them

28
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,950
feels full of life.

29
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,910
In the seven years of mental
and emotional connection

30
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,360
they shared,

31
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,680
two lonely souls

32
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,310
grew deeply curious about each other.

33
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,270
And maybe, only much later

34
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,520
would they realize

35
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,720
that curiosity

36
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,150
was already love.

37
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,470
If I'd known

38
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,750
you weren't some gross dude,

39
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,790
I'd have video-called you long ago.

40
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,590
It depends if I'd have picked up.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
Do you have a girlfriend?

42
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,520
Wrong question.

43
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,080
You should ask

44
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,680
how many I have.

45
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,080
Alright. How many do you have?

46
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,200
Let me count.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,590
Give me ten minutes.

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,400
Seriously,

49
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,560
I'll return that 100,000 yuan
to you later.

50
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,680
I'll solve my own problems.

51
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,750
What kind of man takes

52
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,880
a woman's money?

53
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
"Those who did not ever cry
throughout the endless nights" (German)

54
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,000
"would never realize
the essence of life." (German)

55
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,720
"There is one path in the world
that none can walk but you." (German)

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,360
"Where does it lead?
Don't ask, just walk." (German)

57
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,000
Those were quotes
I posted in the group chat.

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,110
You missed a few words

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,310
and recited it kind of clumsily.

60
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,720
But why did you bother remembering it?

61
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
I admire it.

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,560
You've challenged people
so many times in the chat

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,790
and never lost once.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,470
Your settlement statements
are always flawless.

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,430
So, treat this 100,000 yuan

66
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,110
as my investment in you.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,240
Besides,

68
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,270
a man with no money in his pocket
can't hold his head high.

69
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,310
Think of it as a loan,

70
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,720
or some money you keep for me.

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,840
Anyway,

72
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,240
when things get tough,

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
you'll look at your bank balance

74
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,270
and won't get scared.

75
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,150
Classic rich girl.

76
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,910
Alright.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,080
Next time we meet,

78
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,150
I'm charging.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,910
50 to run errands,
and 100 to carry bags.

80
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,150
Extras cost extra.

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,520
You must be dreaming.

82
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,360
Hei, slow down.

83
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,310
Don't break it.

84
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,150
Bao,

85
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,240
I've got good news.

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,720
I drove the boss somewhere yesterday

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,680
and overheard him on the phone.

88
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,560
He said

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
someone wanted to buy our bar.

90
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,470
That guy who stood up for you before.

91
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,590
Chen.

92
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,360
Listen.

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
He and the boss seemed to have agreed.

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,360
He was so happy and gave me 200 yuan.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How's that good news?

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,880
Come on, Bao.

97
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,040
I heard

98
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,790
Chen is a big shot.

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,470
He seemed to like you.

100
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,560
Maybe you'll get promoted.

101
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,470
When you make it big, don't forget me.

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,430
It's not even close to a sure thing.

103
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,310
Besides,
I might not even keep working here.

104
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,080
Bao, you're really going
to follow Uncle Zhao to Hang City?

105
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,520
We'll talk later.

106
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,040
Help Hei move that stuff first.

107
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,310
- Hurry up.
- Got it.

108
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
Uncle, did you meet her?

109
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,590
Did it go well?

110
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,840
So full.

111
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,040
I've still got time.

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,150
How about walking around?

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,200
My friend...

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,560
The one who was hospitalized last night

115
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,430
just asked me what you look like.

116
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,040
What did you say?

117
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,590
Plato once said

118
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,110
that value inner beauty

119
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,790
more than outer beauty.

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,110
I've criticized him for this.

121
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,110
What's that supposed to mean?

122
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,590
Are you saying I'm not good-looking?

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,470
That's what Plato said,

124
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,720
not me.

125
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,520
Is your friend working there?

126
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,150
Why not go hang out with him?

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,840
Hang out with him?

128
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,150
Sure.

129
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,470
Have you ever been to a nightclub?

130
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,560
Mr. Farmer,

131
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,270
I'll make my nightclub debut with you.

132
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,400
That's a big responsibility.

133
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,790
Are you scared now?

134
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,270
Please come in.

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,520
You haven't told me

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,430
what I look like.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,430
A stunning beauty.

138
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,080
Uncle,

139
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,310
go sit at the bar.

140
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,310
Drinks are on me.

141
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,880
Sure.

142
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,520
Le.

143
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,590
These are my friends.

144
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,040
Show them what you got.

145
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,910
Alright.

146
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,000
How about two specials?

147
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,750
No problem.

148
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,910
Sure.

149
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
Uncle, enjoy here.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
I'll get back to work.

151
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,560
- Sure.
- OK.

152
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,040
Hello?

153
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
Hello, Qiang?

154
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,590
I'm Sen.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,790
Sen.

156
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,470
Well.

157
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,200
The kid from last time is here again.

158
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,150
Good.

159
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,000
OK. Sure.

160
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,470
I'll save your booth.

161
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,950
Looks good.

162
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,630
Enjoy.

163
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
How is it?

164
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,840
It tastes good.

165
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,110
Take it easy.

166
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,150
Don't get drunk.

167
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,270
You're here for me, right?

168
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,150
Sen,

169
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,840
maybe we should let it go.

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,110
This is for Chen Fusheng.

171
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,150
It's not embarrassing.

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
What's that supposed to mean, Qiang?

173
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,040
Yeah.

174
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,910
What are you thinking?

175
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,560
What do you mean?

176
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,720
I asked around.

177
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,270
Those two have nothing to do

178
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,400
with Chen Fusheng.

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,790
Even if Chen Fusheng is some big shot,

180
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,680
he's gotta lie low around Hai City.

181
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,000
That day we showed him some respect,

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240
so he thinks he's something? Let's go.

183
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
I really envy them.

184
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,720
Living like this is so fun.

185
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,080
How is it?

186
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,590
How is your first time at a nightclub?

187
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,470
So much fun.

188
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,430
I'm about to leave.

189
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,000
Wait for me at the bar.

190
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,150
I'll hit the restroom

191
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,200
and then take you home.

192
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,720
Okay.

193
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,080
Do you wanna see a magic trick?

194
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,560
Sure.

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,790
Still showing off your stunts?

196
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,400
Sis, where's my uncle?

197
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,240
You call me "sis"

198
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,950
and him "uncle"?

199
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,240
That's confusing.

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,790
Our families are connected.

201
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,470
I've always called him that.

202
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,840
Shall I call you "aunt"?

203
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,240
Go away.

204
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,590
He's in the restroom.

205
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,950
Thanks for the treat tonight.

206
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,750
If you ever visit Hang City,

207
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,040
let me know.

208
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I'll be your host.

209
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,560
You live in Hang City?

210
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,590
Yeah.

211
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,360
What a coincidence.

212
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
My uncle's heading there soon.

213
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,840
Really?

214
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,630
Yeah.

215
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,470
Sis.

216
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
Bao, something's up.

217
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,790
Those guys from the other day are back.

218
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,840
Take my sister somewhere else.

219
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,040
I'll handle the rest.

220
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,680
Got it.

221
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,150
Come with me, sis.

222
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,040
Sir,

223
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,000
let me get you a private room.

224
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,080
Where's the guy
who drank for you last time?

225
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,520
You're here for drinks, right?

226
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
If you're here to have fun,

227
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
I'll take care of you.

228
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,680
But if it's something else...

229
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,360
Though it's a small bar,

230
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,040
we've been open for a while.

231
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
Of course, I'm here for fun.

232
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,470
You got a rule here, right?

233
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,630
Ten times compensation
for fake products?

234
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,400
We do.

235
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,000
Then bring me ten bottles of X.O..

236
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
Are you deaf?

237
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,310
My boss said it.

238
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,560
Didn't you hear it?

239
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,630
Please.

240
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,910
Open them.

241
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,270
I've opened all your wine.

242
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,360
Come on.

243
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,430
Cheers.

244
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,200
There are so many people.

245
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,040
Something's wrong on Bao's side.

246
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,430
It doesn't taste right.

247
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,400
Is it fake?

248
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,910
If you don't think it's real,

249
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,950
report us to the Administration.

250
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,790
Why don't you try it yourself?

251
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,150
Wait here.

252
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,720
We were just looking for you.

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,990
Came to help your buddy out?

254
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,720
Tell me. What do you want?

255
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,080
Fine.

256
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,120
The wine is fake.

257
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,040
Your rule is ten times compensation

258
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,790
for fake products.

259
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,310
One bottle is 6,000.

260
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Ten bottles are 60,000.

261
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,280
Ten times

262
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,790
will be 600,000.

263
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,150
Pay up.

264
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,120
Pay it.

265
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,440
You don't have money?

266
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,240
Alright then.

267
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,350
Kneel and kowtow to me,

268
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,920
and I'll give him

269
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,830
a discount.

270
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,080
- Kowtow.
- Kowtow.

271
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,440
- Kowtow to him.
- Kowtow.

272
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,080
- Kowtow.
- Kowtow.

273
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,280
Bao,

274
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,510
quit this job.

275
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,920
Sure, I'll quit.

276
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,510
You just want to give us a hard time.

277
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,720
No problem.

278
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,950
Let's take this somewhere else.

279
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,830
Somewhere else?

280
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,670
I came to drink.

281
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,880
I haven't had my drink yet.

282
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
Why should I leave?

283
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,880
This wine

284
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
isn't fake.

285
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,830
Little girl,

286
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
this has nothing to do with you.

287
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,240
Just leave.

288
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,310
You can't ask for money like this.

289
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,510
With so many people,

290
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,990
this counts as organized behavior.

291
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,470
Do you know

292
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,280
what that's called?

293
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,280
It's called extortion and blackmail.

294
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,440
Different charges

295
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,950
have different outcomes.

296
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,600
Lucky for you.

297
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,920
I'm in a great mood tonight

298
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,280
and haven't done having fun.

299
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,600
How about this?

300
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Let's have a drinking contest.

301
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,080
If you win,

302
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,790
I'll give you the money.

303
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,150
If I win,

304
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
you settle the bill

305
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,190
and pay

306
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,120
for everyone here

307
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,150
tonight.

308
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,080
Great!

309
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,150
Shut up!

310
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
They're paying.

311
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,920
Do you dare?

312
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,950
You'll pay?

313
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,920
It's 600,000.

314
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,560
Can you afford that?

315
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,080
Is that supposed to be a lot?

316
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,040
I'm giving you an excuse to leave.
Just take it.

317
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
You've got something to do, right?

318
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,510
Let me call a cab for you.

319
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,630
People like him aren't worth it.

320
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,600
Exactly, that's why

321
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I don't want you
wasting your time with him.

322
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,790
You've got all this time.

323
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,240
Might as well chat with me.

324
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,990
What are you two doing?

325
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,670
Are we here to listen

326
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,080
to you flirt with each other?

327
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,760
What else? Do we need to ask you

328
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
for permission to chat?

329
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,990
Do you know who I am?

330
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,040
Do you want me to call your parents

331
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,950
and ask how they raised you like this?

332
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,990
Get him.

333
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,760
- Sen.
- Bro.

334
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,790
Bro, are you okay?

335
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,510
You leave. Don't get hurt.

336
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,120
It's so late.

337
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,760
I'm sorry to trouble you.

338
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,790
It's okay.

339
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,510
Alright.

340
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,120
If there's nothing else,

341
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,880
we're leaving.

342
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,950
Remember.

343
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,470
Next time something like this happens,

344
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,630
call the police right away.

345
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,630
Okay, okay.

346
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,400
Officer,

347
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,510
when can my friends

348
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,510
be released?

349
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,190
They're involved in a fight

350
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,470
and need to be questioned.

351
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,790
I'm not sure about the time.

352
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,080
[Xu Ziqi]
Then we'll leave. Goodbye.

353
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,830
Alright, take care.

354
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,120
Still watching?

355
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,560
This is your first meeting,

356
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,950
and it's already this intense.

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,830
So?

358
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,470
Did you find out that idiot's name?

359
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,040
If not,

360
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,470
I can help you find out.

361
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,760
I hope he's not one of those
always getting detained.

362
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,400
Go away.

363
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,830
When did my business
become your concern?

364
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,630
Let's go.

365
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,510
Let's go eat.

366
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,280
Mr. Farmer,

367
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,240
I'll leave now.

368
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,510
Look forward to seeing you again
in Hang City.

369
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,440
Tanle, you're back.

370
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,720
Tanle,

371
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,120
did you give Lin Peng

372
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,040
the recommendation letter for Jiadi?

373
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,080
I found an ancient Go manual.

374
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,470
Let Lin Peng come over
to study it for me next time.

375
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,670
Grandpa.

376
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,920
Why are you back so early?

377
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,470
I need to talk to you.

378
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,120
I want to dance.

379
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,920

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,250
[Experience matters.]
[Newbie getting crushed.]

569
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,560
[Newbie, why stop?]
[Maybe ran away.]

570
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,580
[Did he run? Why is it so quiet?]

571

[Just admit your defeat.]
[A sour loser.]

572

[Still a newbie.]
[I'm a newbie too.]

573
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,040
[Is the newbie still here?
I think he has potential]

574
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,830
- What?
- What happened?

575
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,830
Did the white player
make the right move?

576
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,470

577
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,830

Is this your friend?

579
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,670
That's amazing.
This move is a counterattack.

580
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,790
A diagonal extension.

581
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,200
[Way and Virtue]

582
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,240
Why did the black player
suddenly change his style?

583
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,990
It seems like a violent approach.

584
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,470
A violent approach?

585
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,790
Think of it as a fight.

586
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,040
The black player wants
to slash his opponent.

587
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,440
Now, who's winning?

588
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,560
The black side is ahead by 80 points.

589
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,830
The black player is leading.

590
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,950
Master, the black player
has the upper hand,

591
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,240
but the white player
keeps sacrificing pieces.

592
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,190
Isn't he just giving away pieces?

593
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,120
Those who always win
don't start a fight;

594
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,190
those who always fail will win.

595
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,040
In Go,
victory comes from non-contention.

596
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,560
Remember that,

597
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,350
Jiadi.

598
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,440
I'll remember it.

599
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,880
I lost.

600
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,150
What happened?

601
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,230
The white player

602
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
has won.

603
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,190
Didn't you just say

604
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,870
the black player had the advantage?

605
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,670
Yes.

606
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,160
How did that happen?

607
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,920
The newbie

608
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,160
saved the whole game with one move.

609
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,190
No.

610
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,990
The black player only seemed
to have the upper hand.

611
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,320
In reality, he lost with his 56th move.

612
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,440
The white player sacrificed pieces

613
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,440
because he didn't care

614
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
about losing those pieces.

615
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,760
He had already planned

616
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,830
the whole game in their mind

617
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,640
and set a trap,

618
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,440
waiting for the black player
to jump into it.

619
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,120
This man

620
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,480
is really something.

621
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,510
Master,

622
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,230
do you recognize the style

623
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,710
of the white player?

624
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,320

[The Unknown: That's me.]

Incredible.

629
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,870
But isn't that just a legend?

630
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,160
Didn't he disappear for a long time?

631
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,480
Yes, he's been gone for a long time.

632
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,440
Incredible.

633
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,160
