00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,470
Boss, they're here.

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,270
Clothes, clothes.

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,430
Flowers, flowers.

6
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,830
Handsome.

7
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,350
What are you doing?

8
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,470
You're dressed like a waiter.

9
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,070
Can you be a bit more creative?

10
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,150
I'm not trying to chase you.

11
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,310
Then what are you doing?

12
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,110
This is a deposit.

13
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,830
Du.

14
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,910
I'll take all your tea for next quarter.

15
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,150
Go place the order at the shop.

16
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,270
Why are you blocking my front door?

17
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,030
I'm afraid you will refuse,

18
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,510
so I'm telling you directly.

19
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,470
It's more reliable.

20
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,230
Wait a second.

21
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,750
A few days ago, was there a guy

22
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,270
who embarrassed you?

23
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,270
Tell me his name.

24
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,710
I'll teach him a lesson.

25
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,830
My business

26
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,550
doesn't need your concern.

27
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,480
Boss,

28
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,870
the money...

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,470
Take it to the shop.

30
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,510
Got it.

31
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,870
Boss.

32
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,590
Boss.

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,110
Let's go.

34
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,470
Record the data.

35
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,040
Boss,

36
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,910
it's rebounded.

37
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,750
It probably won't change for a while.

38
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,990
It will keep rising.

39
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,390
Keep going long.

40
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,950
Got it.

41
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,110
Jiadi,

42
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,390
it only dipped for a moment,

43
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,270
and you caught it so precisely.

44
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,350
Impressive, impressive.

45
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,950
Jiadi,

46
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,030
was that shake just now

47
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,910
a tug-of-war between bulls and bears?

48
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,590
Yes.

49
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,550
The conclusion is right,

50
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,750
but it's not just based on the shake.

51
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,150
If what Mr. Lin said is true,

52
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,470
shouldn't the bulls know too?

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,670
Why not just sell short?

54
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,430
How to explain this?

55
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,230
The bulls and bears we're talking about

56
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,030
are the big institutions
with large capital.

57
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,950
When they enter the market,

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,590
they usually lay the groundwork
several months in advance.

59
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,510
If the bulls want
to turn futures profits

60
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,190
into real money,

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,950
they have to trim and close positions.

62
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,150
But the process

63
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,150
can't be too obvious,

64
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,350
or they'll attract attention.

65
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,110
Their closing of positions

66
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,310
can directly affect crude oil prices.

67
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,350
So next, the bulls will stick together

68
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,670
to push the price up unilaterally.

69
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,350
Stick together?

70
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,030
To put it plainly,

71
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,430
the bulls
will keep driving up the price,

72
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,110
forcing the bears out

73
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,310
while attracting more capital.

74
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,630
Only with enough people taking over

75
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,030
can they cash out and leave.

76
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,030
Zhao Jiadi.

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,350
I'll go report to Wang.

78
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,510
Here...

79
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,630
Got it.

80
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:28,140
[No honking]

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,190
You're dressed up.

82
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,510
Uncle, I'm ready.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,390
I haven't moved around in a long time.

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,590
If you hadn't brought it up,

85
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,110
I wouldn't have the mood for it.

86
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,270
Come on.

87
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,270
I'm getting old.

88
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,990
Let's keep it friendly.

89
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,110
Why don't you use the Bagua sword?

90
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,350
They're short, not good for this.

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,710
Beat me first.

92
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,790
Alright.

93
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,070
Let's go.

94
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,270
This is called
the Eight Chopping Knives technique.

95
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,190
It's a weapon of Yongchun.

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,910
It counters your sword.

97
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,190
Again.

98
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,270
Uncle.

99
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,030
I lost.

100
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,750
Let's have tea.

101
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,310
Alright.

102
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,710
Hiding the knife

103
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,710
[Ningcui Garden]
is not to catch the opponent off guard

104
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,750
but to conceal one's edge.

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,630
I'll remember

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,590
your lessons.

107
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,670
By the way,

108
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,950
do you know He came to see me?

109
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,110
Manager He came to me.

110
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,950
He said

111
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,190
his mother was seriously ill

112
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,230
and he wanted to go home
to take care of her.

113
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,550
So, I don't think I should...

114
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,110
How about this?

115
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,390
Have the company give him some money.

116
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,070
Alright.

117
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,150
I'll make sure it's done.

118
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,550
How's the joint expansion going?

119
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,630
The talks with the mining district
are almost done.

120
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,990
I'm about to find Uncle Xu,

121
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,150
gather everyone,

122
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,550
and prepare for a resolution.

123
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,750
My granddaughter

124
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,950
is messing with futures now.

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,830
Do you know about it?

126
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,750
Yes.

127
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,310
I don't know how it's going.

128
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,030
When you have time, go check on her.

129
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,950
Alright.

130
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,510
That little girl,

131
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,310
always going against me.

132
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,150
She even made a bet with me.

133
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,950
Zhijin is still young.

134
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,230
You should give her some time

135
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,150
to grow.

136
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,430
Still young?

137
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,430
Uncle,

138
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,110
if you don't have other instructions,

139
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,110
I'll head back to the company.

140
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,950
Have some tea before you go.

141
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,390
I have a meeting coming up.

142
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,070
Go ahead.

143
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,310
Mr. Li,

144
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,510
that kid almost went
for the kill just now.

145
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,390
He's young and hot-blooded.

146
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,710
It might be because I said
a few more words.

147
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,950
As for He Jing,

148
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,830
send someone to give him something

149
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,150
in my name.

150
00:11:59,480 --> 00:11:59,990
Alright.

151
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,350
Come on.

152
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,550
If you can't sit still,
let's just go home.

153
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,150
Stop torturing those reports.

154
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,670
Who says I can't sit still?

155
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,190
I'm working.

156
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,070
Do you know how much money
I made these days?

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,710
Still, you can't burn yourself out.

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,830
You were never like this before.

159
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,110
Xu Ziqi,

160
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,870
let me ask you something.

161
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,910
If a woman

162
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,750
keeps asking you out,

163
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,310
how do you guys see it?

164
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,440
I think

165
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,150
the moment you ask this question,

166
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,150
you've already lost.

167
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,710
Between a man and a woman,

168
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,910
it's about who controls the rhythm,

169
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,670
not about who makes

170
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,470
the first move.

171
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,390
You've seen players, right?

172
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,630
Every single one of them
is a master of rhythm.

173
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,510
What you should be thinking is

174
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,670
whether you want to meet him

175
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,030
and whether you'll be happy to see him.

176
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,310
You haven't even held his hand

177
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,190
yet you've thought
about your kids fetching soy sauce.

178
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,510
The more you care, the less they care.

179
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,320
Right?

180
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,230
Wow, I didn't realize

181
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,950
all your talent went into this.

182
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,150
Of course,
I'm the little prince of nightclubs.

183
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,790
If you're so good,

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,390
how come you don't have a girlfriend?

185
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,510
This is passing through a sea of flowers

186
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,550
without taking a single leaf.

187
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,190
I'll give you three seconds

188
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
to disappear from my sight right now.

189
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,840
Come on.

190
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,350
We were just having a nice talk.

191
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
How can you...

192
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,600
One.

193
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,560
I...

194
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,080
Three.

195
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,150
Alright.

196
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,590
I'm going.

197
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,550
I'm leaving right now.

198
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,270
You rest.

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,030
I'm leaving.

200
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,470
Oh, right, sis.

201
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,150
Your current rhythm

202
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,190
is pretty great.

203
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,070
Bye, Jiadi.

204
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,110
See you.

205
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,430
Hello.

206
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,110
Question.

207
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,750
Grandpa says to Ming,

208
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,110
"My age this year is seven times yours."

209
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,150
"After a few years,
it will be six times yours."

210
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,550
"Some years later,"

211
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,630
"it'll be five times, four times,
three times, and twice."

212
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,270
So, how old are Grandpa

213
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,470
and Ming this year?

214
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,670
Testing me?

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,710
Alright.

216
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,710
Multiples of seven under 100.

217
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,350
42.

218
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,190
49.

219
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,750
Eight plus X

220
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,670
and times six. It equals 56.

221
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,990
Ming is ten years old.

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,870
Grandpa is 70.

223
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,550
Then what's 18 to the 7th power?

224
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,710
612,220,032.

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,550
In which battle did Xiang Yu
break the cauldrons and sink the boats

226
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,470
to defeat the Qin army?

227
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,470
Battle of Julu.

228
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,950
"One must not be arrogant"

229
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,230
"and must have backbone."

230
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,910
Whose motto is that?

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,150
Mr. Xu Beihong.

232
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,550
Did you miss me?

233
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,430
Blooming Flowers.

234
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,790
I get it now.

235
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,070
You're testing my reaction speed.

236
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,150
No.

237
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,350
I just wanted to ask

238
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,590
what you're doing.

239
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,670
Why aren't you done yet?

240
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm pretending

241
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,190
to be Superman saving the world.

242
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,150
Then, great hero,

243
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,230
please save me first.

244
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,710
I just had my fortune told.

245
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,750
The master says

246
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,590
I'm missing earth in my five elements,

247
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,510
so I have to be around you more.

248
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,390
Otherwise, bad luck is coming my way.

249
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,310
That's easy.

250
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,750
I'll dig some dirt,

251
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,710
put it in a bottle,

252
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,870
and personally deliver it to you.

253
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,990
Farmer.

254
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,910
Alright, I'll stop joking.

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,790
How about this weekend?

256
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,270
Let's meet this weekend.

257
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,990
I have something to ask you.

258
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,710
I knew you wouldn't meet me
without a reason.

259
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,350
Alright then.

260
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,150
See you this weekend.

261
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,390
Be there or be square.

262
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,230
Sure.

263
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,790
I'm hanging up now.

264
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,350
Let's talk this weekend.

265
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,510
Why are you still here?

266
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,350
Didn't Mr. Lin tell you
to go home and rest?

267
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,950
You've been working nonstop for days.

268
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,110
I sorted out the recent data,

269
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,350
planning to run one more calculation.

270
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,870
Go home and do it.

271
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,350
There's no room left
at the office anyway.

272
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,830
Your home is close anyway.

273
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,670
You don't have to sleep,

274
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,830
but you can take a shower.

275
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,910
Bro,

276
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,510
we've been watching for days.

277
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,230
Maybe he's not here.

278
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,750
Is this the wrong place?

279
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,630
What?

280
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,710
You don't believe I can handle women?

281
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,870
Ms. Pei said it herself to Ci.

282
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,110
It can't be wrong.

283
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,990
Zhao Jiadi is so bold,

284
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,830
making moves on Ms. Pei.

285
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,910
I think he's asking for it.

286
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,030
If I...

287
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,310
Bro,

288
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,150
look.

289
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,150
Isn't that him?

290
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,590
Looks like it.

291
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,110
Follow him.

292
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,500
[Switzerland]

293
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,630
The scenery is so beautiful.

294
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,590
I can hardly bear to disturb it.

295
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,670
Long time no see.

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,790
Long time no see.

297
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,110
How's the teacher?

298
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,350
Pretty good.

299
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,270
I didn't expect you

300
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,550
to go to Weiduo.

301
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,990
I thought you'd go back home
to help the teacher.

302
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,790
My dad doesn't want
to start a business yet.

303
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,950
What happened in Jinhai

304
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,430
really hurt him.

305
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,230
Even so,

306
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,350
he never said anything bad
about Uncle Zhao.

307
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,070
They have different philosophies.

308
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,350
There's no right or wrong.

309
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,550
Aren't you working on desalination?

310
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,790
What made you suddenly think
of doing crude oil futures?

311
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,230
I've prepared 2 billion.

312
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,950
To avoid losing too badly,

313
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,950
I need to know Weiduo's action time.

314
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,150
You're crazy.

315
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,550
This isn't your style.

316
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,230
Styles can change.

317
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,910
My original intention stays the same.

318
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,110
Dongcao,

319
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,190
all these years,

320
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,950
in my heart...

321
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,350
You don't have to be open

322
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,950
about everything.

323
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,590
We're both the type
to walk down the same path to the end.

324
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,830
You may not believe
what I'm about to say,

325
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,550
but I understand

326
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,350
everything you do.

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,390
Boss,

328
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,230
did you receive the calculations?

329
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,510
Something's wrong with the prices
of nearby and forward contracts.

330
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,270
I think we can have a pilot position.

331
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,510
No need.

332
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,590
I'll go back after dinner.

333
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,670
Okay.

334
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,910
Uncle, what are you doing?

335
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,670
You scared me.

336
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,910
After a few days,

337
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,030
you've learned many things.

338
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,550
You can cook

339
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,270
and wash clothes now.

340
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,470
When I went to take a shower,

341
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,710
I saw a pair of women's slippers

342
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,270
outside the bathroom door.

343
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,910
What's going on?

344
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,510
Those were given to me
when I bought something.

345
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,910
They gave away women's slippers
with purchases?

346
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,030
Uncle.

347
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,550
Tell me the truth.

348
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,110
Is there something going on?

349
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,910
Wait until I finish this call.

350
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:51,910
Hello.

351
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,870
Hai,

352
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,510
I got news from abroad.

353
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,590
They'll act tonight.

354
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,390
I've prepared some food for everyone.

355
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,550
Come over and have a bite
when you're free.

356
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,990
This is too much.

357
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,470
Thank you, Ms. Li.

358
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,190
What's the price now?

359
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,230
76.51 dollars.

360
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,950
All the institutions think it's bullish.

361
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,590
I'm full of question marks right now.

362
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,910
What are we waiting for exactly?

363
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,950
Jiadi says it's a news battle
between the bulls and bears.

364
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,830
No need to focus on that.

365
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,350
That's easy to say.

366
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,510
If it weren't for you,

367
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,430
we wouldn't have had to work so hard.

368
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,630
This isn't how short-term trading works.

369
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,830
This is the situation, Baliang.

370
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,830
When you're ready,

371
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,710
let me know anytime.

372
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,350
Okay.

373
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,430
Understood.

374
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,070
Uncle,

375
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,990
dinner will be ready soon.

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,670
You can eat first.

377
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,510
I have to go out.

378
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,870
What's the rush?

379
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,670
Where are you going?

380
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,230
You're not eating?

381
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,230
Boss,

382
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,990
Jiadi's been working for days.

383
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,710
Let me handle it today.

384
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,430
Master.

385
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,430
Hello.

386
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,430
Boss.

387
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,510
Listen to me.

388
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,190
I'll be there...

389
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,510
Hello?

390
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,110
Zhao Jiadi?

391
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,230
Hurry up and go.

392
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,550
They're hitting someone.

393
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:40,920
Boss,

394
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,310
something's going on.

395
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,830
The Lindsey oil refinery went on strike.

396
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,070
76.832.

397
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Ms. Li,

398
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,110
the oil refinery went on strike.

399
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,910
Supply is reduced.

400
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,190
Add to our long positions.

401
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,710
Beat him.

402
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,030
Don't move.

403
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,510
Lin Peng,

404
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,630
whether there's an anomaly or not,

405
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,870
the market is already very clear.

406
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,270
Selling short is like suicide.

407
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,230
Let's still do the diesel fuel hedge.

408
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,830
I verified his calculation.

409
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,790
Let's wait.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,150
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

411
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,990
Boss,

412
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,830
there's a pullback.

413
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,470
77.4.

414
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,670
77.2.

415
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,430
Have a pilot position for short orders.

416
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,750
Okay.

417
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,830
Ms. Li,

418
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,710
could this be a small pullback
in an uptrend?

419
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,270
Should we follow?

420
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,790
Continue going long.

421
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,470
77.532.

422
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,030
Mr. Wei,

423
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:43,940
we...

424
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,270
How much unrealized gain do we have?

425
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,510
Roughly speaking,

426
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,230
at least 250 million.

427
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,030
Hold the positions.

428
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,030
Understood.

429
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,590
Buddy, don't move.

430
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,310
It's just a beating.

431
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,430
We're just telling you

432
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,590
don't mess with women
you shouldn't mess with.

433
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,270
Understand?

434
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,600
What?

435
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,150
When Du asked me for photos,

436
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,470
I felt something was wrong.

437
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,190
After thinking it over,

438
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,750
I decided to let you know.

439
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:26,910
Ms. Pei,

440
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,190
please don't be mad.

441
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,430
You...

442
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,910
Boss,

443
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,750
it's gone up again.

444
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,590
77.8.

445
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,870
Li Qian.

446
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,470
The stop-loss line needs to be adjusted.

447
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,630
At this rate,

448
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,190
it will keep rising.

449
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,910
But now...

450
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,670
I know.

451
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,510
Alright, leave him here.

452
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,550
Let him learn his lesson.

Zhao Jiadi!

489
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,110
My phone's broken.

490
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,470
Can I borrow your phone?

491
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,430
I need to make a call.

492
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,270
Dongcao,

493
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,470
I've got something going on here.

494
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,110
It'll take time to explain it to them.

495
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,350
Can you help me stall?

496
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,310
I'll give you a signal.

497
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,390
Alright. Don't worry.

498
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,070
Dongcao,

499
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,790
you know

500
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,710
about Weiduo's situation.

501
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,590
We still need to wait.

502
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,550
You also know my funds.

503
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,510
Put everything in.

504
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,550
They won't have the peak they want.

505
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,190
I want to sell short now.

506
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,310
Dongcao...

507
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,790
Ms. Li, it's still going up.

508
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,670
Should we add more?

509
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,510
What an ingrate.

510
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,390
Lin Peng.

511
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,230
The unrealized loss
is already quite a lot

512
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,190
at the pilot position.

513
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,110
Can we stop being so stubborn?

514
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,550
Trading has its principles.

515
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,710
Once the direction is set,

516
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,790
it can't change.

517
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,390
I know,

518
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,030
but our funds can't be used this way.

519
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,950
We have to follow the market.

520
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,190
Let's wait for the bears' signal.

521
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,790
We can't wait anymore.

522
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,990
Jiadi,

523
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,830
what's wrong?

524
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,750
Boss,

525
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,110
Lindsey oil refinery went on strike
due to layoffs.

526
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,030
It seems bullish,

527
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,030
but it will actually trigger

528
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,070
the debt crisis we mentioned before.

529
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,150
Now, it's not just

530
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,270
about spot traders losing money.

531
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,350
We have to load up on it.

532
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,270
Is the news accurate?

533
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,590
Absolutely accurate.

534
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:32,990
Jiadi,

535
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,670
100 million dollars of speculative funds

536
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,710
will only affect about 1.6%.

537
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,830
Risheng doesn't have...

538
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,350
Manager Li,

539
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,750
the so-called trend

540
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,150
is the process
of one side's constant defeat.

541
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,310
The greater the ability
to follow the big trend,

542
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,710
the less ability one has
to predict when it will end.

543
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,550
If we keep waiting,

544
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,750
the speed
at which the long positions are closed

545
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,510
will leave us no time to react.

546
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,750
A crash can happen in an instant.

547
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,790
But...

548
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,390
Let's stop hesitating.

549
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,510
Let's do it this way.

550
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,710
If something goes wrong,
I'll take the fall.

551
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,470
Ms. Li,

552
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,070
it's already passed 79.

553
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,150
We're discussing whether to add more.

554
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,190
Don't add it.

555
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,950
Sell some and take a profit.

556
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,470
79.21.

557
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,150
79.25.

558
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,190
Mr. Wei,

559
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,030
you've predicted everything.

560
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,190
Chen.

561
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,070
What did you see up there?

562
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,310
Money.

563
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,510
It's greed.

564
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,910
The retail traders see money up there,

565
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,510
so they flock in.

566
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,510
The main players see money
in the retail traders,

567
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,470
so they wait to harvest.

568
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,070
The bears see money in the bulls,

569
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,230
so they're waiting

570
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,550
for the right moment.

571
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,470
Let me tell you.

572
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,870
The development of the whole world

573
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,310
is built on greed.

574
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,910
Greed

575
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,510
is the most wonderful

576
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,510
driving force

577
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,790
of human progress.

578
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,350
It's expected to rise to 80 today.

579
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,510
Alright.

580
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,030
Alright, Dongcao.

581
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,590
I've finished arranging things here.

582
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,710
Alright.

583
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,550
Thanks, boss.

584
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,150
I had someone take your clothes
to be washed.

585
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,430
Does this fit?

586
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,390
Don't frown all the time.

587
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,150
It makes you look older.

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,430
Here, pick one.

589
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,470
What for?

590
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,590
Pick one.

591
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,390
Let's compare.

592
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,750
Boring.

593
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,120
Really?

594
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,590
Mr. Ming used to play this all the time.

595
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,310
He always won.

596
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,430
At first, I couldn't figure it out,

597
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,950
but later I found out

598
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,470
he was marking the back of the cards.

599
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,830
Actually, futures trading is the same.

600
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,630
You can't just look at the cards.

601
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,150
You need to stand behind the dealer.

602
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,790
Boss,

603
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,550
we will definitely win.

604
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,390
Zhao Jiadi,

605
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,190
when you came for the interview,

606
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,590
I knew

607
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,750
you weren't an ordinary intern.

608
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,670
Now, I understand.

609
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,910
You're not a kid
from an ordinary family.

610
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,110
It's dropped.

611
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,230
It's fallen.

612
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,110
79.13 dollars.

613
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,630
77.5.

614
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,430
77.7.

615
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,030
77.2.

616
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,190
Hai,

617
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,350
something's wrong.

618
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,470
The market's crashing.

619
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,550
