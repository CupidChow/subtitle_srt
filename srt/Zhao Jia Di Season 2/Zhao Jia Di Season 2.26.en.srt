20
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,280
Honestly, I've always

No tomatoes.

40
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,680

41
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,120
No idea.

42
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,510
Just give it to me straight.

Meanwhile, you just walked away.

If you ever did one thing

fair and square,

54

maybe I wouldn't look down on you.

You know,

you're in no place to judge me.

57
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,790
Did you call the police?

58
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,360
Yeah, I did.

59
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,870
Zhao Jiadi,

60
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,240
do you know

61
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,870
what I hate most about you?

62
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,670
You're always like this,

63
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,550
acting like you know it all,

64
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,000
pretending to be so righteous.

65
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,200
But honestly, it's all nonsense.

66
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,320
You've planned everything out

67
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,790
just...

68
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,870
for your own gain.

69
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,600

71

Let me think about it.

193
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,830
Alright.

194
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,760
Send your info to my assistant later,

195
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,830
I'll check it out when I have time.

196
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,830
Zhao Jiadi!

197
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,200
Get up!

198
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,720
Since when did you have an assistant?

199
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,310
Why didn't I know about this?

200
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,110
Ow, that hurts.

201
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,000
Male assistant.

202
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,630
Mr. Zhao.

203
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,000
What do you think of me
as your assistant?

204
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,870
Weren't you coming next week?

205
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,520
I showed up today.

206
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,870
Heard you're starting a business.

207
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,040
I couldn't just sit around.

208
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,310
So I'm here to check in with you.

209
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,200
Come on.

210
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,240
Let me introduce you.

211
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,590
This is my wife,

212
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,280
Li Zhijin.

213
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,960
And this is my good friend,

214
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,830
Wu Dengke.

215
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,760
Hello.

216
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,790
Your wife is really beautiful.

217
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Call her Zhijin.

218
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,680
Zhijin.

219
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,350
Zhijin, can I ask you something?

220
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,760
What made you interested in him?

221
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,350
Why are you always teasing me?

222
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,630
Sweetheart, can you book a restaurant?

223
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,240
Let's have dinner together tonight.

224
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,960
Sure.

225
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,830
Let me help with your luggage.

226
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,680
Come on, let's go, Mrs. Zhao.

227
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,830
- Call her Zhijin.
- Let's go.

228
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,350
That's a big show you put on.

229
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,350
Nanshan Chamber of Commerce
took a big hit.

230
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,680
Fan Longquan passed away so young.

231
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,110
Li Minxian just recovered
from a major illness.

232
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,040
Are you still planning to fight them?

233
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
Who's trying to fight them?

234
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,520
This mining site is huge.

235
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,390
Even if I have a big appetite,

236
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,830
eating it all alone

237
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,200
would make me suffer.

238
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,590
You've really changed your tune.

239
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,790
When it comes to business,
partners are important.

240
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,920
That old guy sent an invitation.

241
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
He said he wanted to talk.

242
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,150
Then let's just talk.

243
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,630
So where's the meeting spot?

244
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,520
Tang City? He doesn't want to come.

245
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,920
And I don't really want to
go to Hang City.

246
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,110
So we decided to meet halfway.

247
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,200
It's been ages since I saw that guy.

248
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,590
Not sure if he's changed

249
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,390
his temper by now.

250
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,390
When it comes to temper,

251
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,870
yours is even stronger than his.

252
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,350
Have you ever thought about

253
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,590
meeting Baliang?

254
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,520
Why would I bother seeing him?

255
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,070
In the invitation,

256
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,920
he even highlighted
"live-in son-in-law".

257
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,440
Like he thinks he's won or something.

258
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,150
Uncle, let me be honest with you.

259
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,550
About this engagement,

260
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
I won't agree to this.

261
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,720
Will you or won't you?

262
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,480
That's not really up to you.

263
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,350
With a dad like you, who'd blame him?

264
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,350
Maybe Baliang

265
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,830
still resents you deep down.

266
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,830
A Zhao family kid

267
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,550
either lives standing tall
or dies kneeling.

268
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,240
If he doesn't struggle a bit

269
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,390
and step outside his comfort zone,

270
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,440
does he really deserve
to be called a man?

271
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,110
About our Go game,

272
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,000
I won.

273
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,480
It's the gambling game you started,

274
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
so you'd better remember the rules.

275
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,310
Who says so?

276
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,350
We just met up.

277
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,440
Nothing has been decided.

278
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,310
No one knows who'll win yet.

279
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,150
Watch yourself.

280
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,070
"General Guan Yu lost Jingzhou

281
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,680
due to negligence."

282
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,440
How about this, Uncle,

283
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,760
let's make another bet.

284
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,800
[Reflection]

285
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
[Observation, Knowledge,
Sincerity, Reflection]

286
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,520
Next up,

287
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,040
write in semi-cursive script.

288
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,960
Just write down,

289
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,150
"There's no reason

290
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
beyond balance.

291
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,830
There's nothing to truly learn

292
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,280
without respect."

293
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,240
This takes real effort.

294
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,200
Can you write in cursive script?

295
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,440
Sure.

296
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,150
Then write down,

297
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,790
"The whole army
wants him to risk his life.

298
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,200
The people want him to value his life.

299
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,550
Without risking his life,
chaos can't be stopped.

300
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,200
If there's no renewal,
chaos is easy to start."

301
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,200
The brush moves smoothly.

302
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
Such flamboyant calligraphy.

303
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,720
Beautiful handwriting.

304
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,630
It's making my hands itch to try.

305
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,200
Come on.

306
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,920
Let me give it a shot too.

307
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,110
Alright.

308
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,000
In one's life,

309
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,830
it's all just emptiness.

310
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,390
Some people

311
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,040
chase after fame and gain,

312
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,960
always scheming against each other

313
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,310
just to leave something

314
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,680
in the history.

315
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,350
But what can we really leave behind?

316
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,680
If you're after profit,

317
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,830
think about what's good for all.

318
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,870
If you're after a name,

319
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,350
aim for a legacy that lasts.

320
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,200
In this regard,

321
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,790
I'm not as open-minded as Longquan.

322
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Jiadi,

323
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,310
you're heading to Hai City for talks.

324
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,830
You'll be representing the NCC.

325
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,150
Whatever grudges

326
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,590
there were,

327
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,760
work comes first.

328
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,000
Understood.

329
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,440
Good.

330
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,830
I want to take a break.

331
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,720
Jiadi,

332
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,550
have a seat.

333
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,630
Just now,

334
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,350
something

335
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,790
popped into my mind.

336
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,680
Go on.

337
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,200
But saying it out loud

338
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
sounds a bit odd.

339
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,760
You know,

340
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,150
everyone has their own path.

341
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,680
Someday,

342
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,280
when you're a parent,

343
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,630
maybe

344
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,390
you'll see things differently

345
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,350
and understand Zhao Xin more.

346
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,110
Back then,

347
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,590
only you would know

348
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,040
how you really felt inside.

349
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,920
Grandpa,

350
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,440
it's time for your medicine.

351
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,520
Come on, help me escape.

352
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,720
No.

353
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,680
Come on, hurry up.

354
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,790
Why are you

355
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,040
acting like a kid?

356
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,200
Still scared of the medicine's bitter?

357
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm already better.

358
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,070
I don't need it anymore.

359
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,350
That's not how it works.

360
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,040
Just have a bite.

361
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,280
That's hot.

362
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,480
Set it down for now.

363
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,960
We did agree on that.

364
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,150
You have to drink it later.

365
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah, I'll drink in a bit.

366
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,000
Grandpa, I wanted to ask you something.

367
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,200
Isn't Jiadi going to Hai City?

368
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,590
I want to go with him.

369
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,240
Why would you go?

370
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,550
Who's watching the company?

371
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,440
It's good to rest sometimes.

372
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,000
Besides, we agreed on this.

373
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,070
I'm just filling in.

374
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,040
You need to

375
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,680
find a new manager.

376
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,110
Why should I look?

377
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,680
Isn't he good?

378
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,790
Come on, don't back out now.

379
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
