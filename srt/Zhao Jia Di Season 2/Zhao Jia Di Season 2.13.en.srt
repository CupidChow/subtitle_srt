About 70 million dollars.

With the current exchange rate,

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,750
it should be a profit
of over 500 million.

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,790
I told you it would come out.

193
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,230
Bao.

194
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,710
- Later...
- Uncle.

195
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,190
Ms. Fang.

196
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,590
Bao said you have something

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,510
to celebrate.

198
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,790
I don't have anything to give you,

199
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,070
so I came to cook you a meal.

200
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,070
Alright, then I'm in for a treat.

201
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,110
Thanks, Ms. Fang.

202
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,910
I'll go drop off my bag
and come back to help.

203
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,550
Uncle, have you finished your work?

204
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,510
Yes.

205
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,390
Think about what you want.

206
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,950
When my bonus comes,
I'll buy it for you.

207
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,990
I don't really want anything.

208
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,350
You've been quite diligent lately.

209
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,430
When we moved in,
there was a big footprint.

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,990
Where did it go?

211
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,910
I couldn't make it go away.

212
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,590
It's Ms. Fang's work.

213
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,510
Ms. Fang is like a magician.

214
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,310
She dipped a towel in white vinegar

215
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,270
and just wiped it like this,

216
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,350
and it was gone.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,910
And this, and this.

218
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,870
Look.

219
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,590
Look at this.

220
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,510
Look at the fridge.

221
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,110
There used to be a big crack, right?

222
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,550
Do you know what Ms. Fang used
to fix it?

223
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,350
What?

224
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,190
Toothpaste.

225
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,870
She just wiped it, and it's gone.

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,310
Alright, Bao.

227
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,350
Where did you put the pepper we bought?

228
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,990
I know.

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,670
I'll get it.

230
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,150
I'll wash my hands and come help.

231
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,270
Alright.

232
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,750
This place will be relocated?

233
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,510
They say they're building
a commercial city.

234
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,910
Other merchants have agreed,

235
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,950
but I don't want to move.

236
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,750
Is it because of price?

237
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,350
The price is indeed low.

238
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,510
Not long ago,

239
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,870
my shop was doing well,

240
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,470
so I renovated the gas and drainage.

241
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,670
But they don't recognize that.

242
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,590
The main issue is

243
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,990
that Tongtong needs to go to school,

244
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,790
and there are regular customers here.

245
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,910
I also have a house.

246
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,830
I'm still paying the mortgage.

247
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,550
I really can't handle this.

248
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,990
So, have you talked to them?

249
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,070
What did they say?

250
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,110
Don't mention it.

251
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,390
The developers

252
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,590
come every few days,

253
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,310
but they never talk about anything.

254
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,670
They just ask
if we've made up our minds.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,070
Ms. Fang doesn't want to sign,

256
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,710
so they sit down to eat

257
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,870
and act polite

258
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,990
but never talk about the issue.

259
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,910
Besides, those people

260
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,990
all look so fierce.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,310
When they sit in my resto...

262
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,510
They don't look like good people.

263
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,990
Anyway, this has got out.

264
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,950
It's already affecting my business
with regular customers.

265
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,110
They've been telling other merchants

266
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,630
that if I don't sign,

267
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,670
this deal will fall through.

268
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,710
Now, other merchants

269
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,070
are coming to cause trouble for me.

270
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,870
Oh, no.

271
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,510
There's still water in the pot.

272
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,470
Bao, I'll go.

273
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,910
Don't move. Sit down.

274
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,910
You should talk to Uncle.

275
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,710
You two talk.

276
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,190
Actually, I've accepted it

277
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,470
since it's gotten to this point.

278
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,070
A couple of days ago,
I went to check out the shop.

279
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,190
The price for a good location

280
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,470
is ridiculously high.

281
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,910
When do they usually come by?

282
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,310
They definitely come on weekends.

283
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,750
Then I'll go this weekend

284
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,510
and talk to them.

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Uncle,

286
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,150
I've been waiting for you to say that.

287
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,950
Bao.

288
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:28,950
Don't worry.

289
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,390
Don't worry.

290
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,110
Bao's trouble is my trouble.

291
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,710
My uncle is great.

292
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,510
Don't worry.

293
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,110
Give me a garlic clove.

294
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,110
Really. Rest assured.

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,070
I disagree.

296
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,870
Grandpa, I'll be upfront.

297
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,030
I don't want to get involved
with the NCC.

298
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,910
I don't have such big ambitions.

299
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,190
I just want to live my life
the way I want.

300
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,550
The way you want?

301
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,470
I've been too accommodating
to your wishes.

302
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,430
The road is right in front of you now.

303
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,110
You choose.

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,710
I won't.

305
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,150
I still have time

306
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,470
for our bet.

307
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,910
In the last month,

308
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,910
if I come up with a plan,

309
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,590
you'll have to accept it.

310
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,590
Am I still your grandpa?

311
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,710
Are you still a Li?

312
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,190
Will you take over the family business?

313
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,470
I'm full.

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,390
What are you going to do?

315
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,950
To become a nun in a temple.

316
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,870
Come back here.

317
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,470
Uncle,

318
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,710
eat some fruit.

319
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,710
Did Ms. Fang buy it?

320
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,190
What do you think of her?

321
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,270
She's really nice.

322
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,270
Really nice? Why are you smiling?

323
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,470
I'm not smiling.

324
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,950
Uncle,

325
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,870
your phone is broken?

326
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,950
Just get a new one.

327
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,870
It's not worth much.

328
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,550
This one was a gift from Dongcao.

329
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,590
Grandma was still around back then.

330
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,790
Hello?

331
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,590
Hello, Farmer.

332
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,150
I need some help.

333
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,070
Come out and have a drink with me.

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,590
Where are you?

335
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,670
At the snack street near Yang Village.

336
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,390
Alright, wait for me
at the street corner.

337
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,510
My phone's broken.

338
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,270
I can't read the text messages.

339
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,470
Call me if you need anything.

340
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,390
Okay.

341
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,350
Be good. Don't run around.

342
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,470
I'll be there in half an hour.

343
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,110
Okay.

344
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,350
I have to go out.

345
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,110
What's the rush?

346
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,550
Always rushing around.

347
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,710
Ms. Fang's fruit is really delicious.

348
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,230
It's almost time for the three-year bet.

349
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,390
If your performance
doesn't meet the standard,

350
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,110
come back

351
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,550
and take over the family business.

352
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,750
The way you want?

353
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,510
I've been too accommodating
to your wishes.

354
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,590
The road is right in front of you now.

355
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,750
You choose.

356
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,750
Am I still your grandpa?

357
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,950
Are you still a Li?

358
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,510
Will you take over the family business?

359
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,910
Names don't matter.

360
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,270
They're just social labels.

361
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,750
I'm right in front of you.

362
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,550
Do you sell umbrellas here?

363
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,110
They're on the rack in the back.

364
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,590
Thank you.

365
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,150
Sir,

366
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,870
is there any other faster road?

367
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,590
No, this is the only way.

368
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,070
Sir, I'll get off here.

378
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:49,740
♪The world is big,
but it doesn't matter to us♪

379
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,350
Aren't you supposed to be
at the street corner?

380
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,670
You didn't even bring an umbrella.

381
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,390
Why didn't you call me?

382
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,190
I thought of a good place.

383
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,590
Right.

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,550
What's the model?

385
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,150
I don't know.

386
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,390
I'll take a photo and send it to you.

387
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,750
Okay, bye.

388
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,990
Why haven't you asked me

389
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,670
to get another one?

390
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,750
It must be a gift
from an important person.

391
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,990
What's there to ask?

392
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,910
Everyone has something from the past
they can't let go of.

393
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,870
I can understand and accept it.

394
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,110
You can really hold your liquor.

395
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,350
This old wine has a strong aftertaste.

396
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,150
I was born with a tolerance for alcohol.

397
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,270
I've never lost to anyone in drinking.

398
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,150
You don't believe it?

399
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,710
Then let's have a try.

400
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,550
If we have a drinking match,

401
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,550
it'll be easy for both of us to lose.

402
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,990
Someone has to stay sober

403
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,310
to carry the other one back.

404
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,590
Sir, another pot of wine, please.

405
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,270
Coming.

406
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,870
Blooming Flowers,

407
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,870
you brought this upon yourself.

408
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,190
Here's your wine.

409
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

410
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,870
Please enjoy.

411
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,990
When I was little,

412
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,070
I loved competing with boys.

413
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,470
My family used to live
in a big compound.

414
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,750
I used to climb flagpoles and fight.

415
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,110
Then you must've changed a lot.

416
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,310
Obviously,

417
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,110
you are

418
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,350
a well-educated noble lady

419
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,590
from a wealthy family.

420
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,510
If this were ancient times,

421
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,070
you'd be of royal or noble blood.

422
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,270
What about you?

423
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,590
Me?

424
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,590
A country bumpkin

425
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,590
with nobody to care for me.

426
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,950
I'd be a coachman who saddles the horse
for the young lady.

427
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,790
Did you say you have something
to ask me?

428
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,470
I had something
about foreign exchange to ask you,

429
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,510
but it's been sorted.

430
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,110
Oh, right.

431
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,950
Here's your 100,000 yuan.

432
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,320
[Bank of Communications]

433
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,990
I've added a little interest.

434
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,510
I made some money
on short-term trading recently.

435
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,950
What do you mean?

436
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,470
You want to repay the favor

437
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,870
with a little interest?

438
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,510
Let me tell you.

439
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,270
No way.

440
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,070
I won't ask

441
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,150
why you came here.

442
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,710
But you're new here alone.

443
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,950
If you run into trouble,

444
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,670
just remember

445
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,190
you've got a friend here

446
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,710
who can lend you 100,000 yuan

447
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,190
anytime, anywhere.

448
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,990
Then you won't be worried.

449
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,190
What about you?

450
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,670
How's work lately?

451
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,750
Is there

452
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,070
anything I can help with?

453
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,310
Don't mention it.

454
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,470
I've made a bet with someone

455
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,110
to get 3 billion

456
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,670
within a month.

457
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,390
How about that?

458
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,390
Can you help with that?

459
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,590
Sure.

460
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,510
We can rob a bank together.

461
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,270
Or you can check out which criminal law
you find interesting.

462
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,270
Farmer,

463
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,870
if one day I can't help

464
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,270
but ask you your name,

465
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,670
your family, and your background,

466
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,390
you must not tell me.

467
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,510
Why?

468
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,550
My family has strict rules.

469
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,950
A lot of things are beyond my control.

470
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,790
The kindness of being raised
is greater than anything.

471
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,310
Maybe later,

472
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,510
gradually,

473
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,830
my life

474
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,350
won't belong to me anymore.

475
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,150
So this little bit of mystery about you

476
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,070
is something I want to keep for myself.

477
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,470
What are you saying?

478
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,870
It sounds like a farewell speech.

479
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,230
It's not that serious.

480
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,910
It's not serious to you,

481
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,110
but it's pretty dangerous

482
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,070
to me.

483
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,990
I don't want to start something

484
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,710
that leads nowhere.

485
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,670
I don't want to get hurt.

486
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,390
I don't want to lose.

487
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,790
Then promise me one thing.

488
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,190
If one day,

489
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,270
I ask you your name,

490
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,270
your family, and your background,

491
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,350
you have to tell me.

492
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,070
Because by then,

493
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,590
I'll be ready to wade

494
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,990
through this mess with you.

495
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,950
As for your phone parts,

496
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,790
I'll contact you once they arrive.

497
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,110
It can definitely be fixed.

498
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,110
Don't worry.

499
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,750
You drove here, right?

500
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,030
You just drank.

501
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,750
Get someone to pick you up.

502
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,430
How about I take you home?

503
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,270
No need.

504
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,550
I'll take a taxi later.

505
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,150
I'll walk you to the car.

506
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,790
It's dark.

507
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,910
Just hold my hand for a while.

508
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,910
Fine clothes can be hidden at night.

509
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,190
Gold can be hidden in plain sleeves.

510
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,350
Love starts without a reason.

511
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,870
Only sincerity is what matters.

512
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,230
Yes, Uncle Xu.

513
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,870
About this matter,

514
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,990
this is what I think.

515
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,070
The mining joint venture

516
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,190
has to be pushed forward.

517
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,910
As for whether Zhijin will return
to the group,

518
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,910
it's our family's business.

519
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,630
What do you think?

520
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,110
I understand.

521
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,430
Uncle Xu, I'm almost there.

522
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,790
Let's talk when we meet.

523
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,430
Okay.

524
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,590
Alright, Uncle Xu.

525
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,590
Drive faster.

526
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:55,990
Sure.

527
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,670
You were right.

528
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,830
It'll still be Wei

529
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,950
to represent Li Group.

530
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,750
That kid must have
something fishy going on.

531
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,310
Before, when Zhao Xin entered the mine,

532
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,870
there was news about it.

533
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,990
Sang Ke and his gang

534
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,710
risk their lives for money,

535
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,030
but Wei Jinghai can control them,

536
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,870
why?

537
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,510
After all, Mr. Li raised him.

538
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,790
He has mercy

539
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,270
on him.

540
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,320
[Fan Longquan]

541
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,910
If Li can't even figure this out,

542
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,470
then he should step down.

543
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,710
Do you really want to be
the commander-in-chief?

544
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,630
Everyone, Uncle Xu is here.

545
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,710
Come on, please sit inside.

546
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,350
Mr. Wei,

547
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,350
this is Mr. Fan's seat.

548
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,150
I know.

549
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,550
Please come in.

550
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,470
Hello, Mr. Xu. Hello, Mr. Fan.

551
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,110
Uncle Xu.

552
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,190
Hello, Mr. Xu.

553
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,910
Fan.

554
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,710
Alright, sit down, everyone.

555
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,630
Mr. Fan, let me introduce you.

556
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,470
This is the chairman of Sanhua Group,

557
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,030
Mr. Zhang.

558
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,030
You can be in touch more in the future.

559
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,750
Mr. Zhang, nice to meet you.

560
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,230
Looking forward to more cooperation.

561
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,150
Looking forward to it.

562
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,030
Let's stay in touch.

563
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,150
Desires can never be satisfied.

564
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,870
Today, Wei Jinghai wants to win.

565
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,270
He wants to gain people's trust.

566
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,830
But he never expected Fan Longquan

567
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,590
to treat him like this.

568
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,670
Those who have changed, come here.

569
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,110
Hurry, hurry, come in.

570
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,950
These instant noodles

571
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,110
can even be prepared with cold water.

572
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,790
Are you all extras here?

573
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,710
Do you know? Tomorrow...

574
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,390
Is there anyone in charge?

575
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,510
I'm in charge.

576
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,230
I'm the one in charge.

577
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,190
It's me.

578
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,310
Stop fooling around. I'm in charge.

579
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,350
Tell the boss

580
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,910
that I'll make sure to take care

581
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,590
of the demolition and relocation.

582
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,110
Bro, why is the boss mad at me?

583
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,110
Didn't he ask us

584
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,150
to treat people politely

585
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,110
and not to cause any trouble?

586
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,270
I've always been offering a smile.

587
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,710
I...

588
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,510
Darn it. They're all bullying me.

589
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,070
Ms. Fang.

590
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,950
Ms. Fang.

591
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,190
This isn't right.

592
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,590
Ms. Fang.

593
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,990
Bao,

594
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,510
did Jiadi say he'd come today?

595
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,510
He left early this morning

596
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,550
and said we should wait here.

597
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,230
Ms. Fang,

598
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,710
don't worry.

599
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,830
My uncle always fulfills his promises.

600
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,390
He's probably off consulting

601
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,310
some top-tier lawyer.

602
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,470
Didn't we ask a lawyer before?

603
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,150
Well...

604
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,750
Who's looking for a lawyer?

605
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,270
Hurry up. Help Bao with that.

606
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,790
Got it.

607
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,590
Help them mop there.

608
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,790
Ms. Fang,

609
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,430
our paperwork is all done.

610
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,630
It's compliant with the law.

611
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,190
Even if we end up in court,

612
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,990
it'll only be a matter of time.

613
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,110
I don't want

614
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,550
to drag this out any longer.

615
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,630
So, give us a straight answer.

616
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,110
How much more do you want?

617
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,110
As long as it's reasonable,

618
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,750
we'll sign the contract today.

619
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,510
Button your shirt.

620
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,590
Director, are we heading to the set?

621
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,550
Yes. By the way,

622
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,910
let me explain it again.

623
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,110
This is covert filming today.

624
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,150
There are no visible cameras.

625
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,670
We want that real, on-the-spot feel.

626
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,910
An art film?

627
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,510
That's tough.

628
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,590
Is there extra money?

629
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,830
No problem.

630
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,950
As long as you act well,

631
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,750
I'll pay double.

632
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,190
Thanks for being open with us.

633
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,230
Do we have a script?

634
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,350
We need it to rehearse.

635
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,110
Right, right.

636
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,830
There's no script,

637
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,790
but you've watched films
from Hong Kong, China, right?

638
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,710
Yeah.

639
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,110
Just act like that.

640
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,110
Bring the intensity.

641
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,360
Okay.

642
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,910
We'll show you what we've got.

644
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,630
Please take a look.

645
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,550
Ms. Fang,

646
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,350
I've been very clear with you.

647
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,390
I know your situation.

648
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,910
You've already been taken care of.

649
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,430
With such a small area,

650
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,750
you have only three people,
including the kid.

651
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,710
How do you want me to calculate this?

652
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,110
Boss, please.

653
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,990
I've just renovated

654
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,950
the pipes here.

655
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,110
It cost a lot of money.

656
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,110
It's been hard on me.

657
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,350
I still have loans to pay.

658
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,310
We didn't make up that compensation.

659
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,190
There's a standard for it.

660
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,150
Otherwise, why would the others agree?

661
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,430
What the others agree to

662
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,910
