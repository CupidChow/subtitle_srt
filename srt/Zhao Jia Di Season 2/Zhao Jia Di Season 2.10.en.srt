00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,800
[Li Residence]

4
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,120
[Li Minxian,]
Stop making that face.

5
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,830
[Chairman of Li Group]
I wouldn't do this to just anyone.

6
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,760
Uncle, you've been glowing

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,160
since you got back from your meditation.

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,870
Too many tasty things
will make you sick.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,190
Too much happiness may lead to trouble.

10
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,830
When your qi is off,

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,630
your body will always show it.

12
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,310
Don't be impatient.

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,800
Move around a bit.

14
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,590
How's that?

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
Much better.

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,160
Have some tea.

17
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,550
This morning,

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
your Uncle Xu came.

19
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,270
We talked a bit

20
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,950
about the NCC elections.

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,190
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

22
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,720
I...

23
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,760
I don't really have any.

24
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,120
If you've decided to step down,

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,510
I won't object.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Think about it.

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,510
If it's about seniority or connections,

28
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,310
I can't compare with Fan.

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,550
If it's about relationships
and capability,

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,910
Zhijin is the best choice.

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,160
So,

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
uncle,

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm already happy

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,360
that you even thought of me.

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,550
I'm glad

36
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,160
that you think that way.

37
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,160
It means I didn't teach you for nothing.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,760
I've spoiled Zhijin

39
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,310
since she was young.

40
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,550
Luckily,

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,550
your two complement each other.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,760
You should help each other
in the future.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,910
Understood.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,160
After my return this time,

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,230
I heard a lot of gossip

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,910
that you went to Tang City

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
and stirred up quite a mess.

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
Uncle, I...

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
I'm getting old.

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,190
I've seen too many truths and lies.

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,950
I don't want to hear

52
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,510
or handle

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,310
some things.

54
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,000
But the NCC

55
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,360
is my life's work.

56
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,400
If anyone tries to use it

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,590
to settle personal scores,

58
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,040
I will step in.

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,400
You've been with me since you were 12.

60
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,590
To me,

61
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,480
you're family.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
The Li family

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,550
may seem light,

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,760
but it carries weight.

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,400
If you want to be a leader,

66
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,550
reputation and favor alone

67
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,630
won't be enough.

68
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,360
What matters is

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,950
integrity

70
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,910
and fairness.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,270
Fairness

72
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,160
is the most important.

73
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,360
Understood.

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,950
A good name

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,830
isn't something you can buy.

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,870
Uncle,

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,510
I'll remember

78
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,360
everything you said.

79
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,310
Hai.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,910
Hai?

81
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,310
Gather all the executives

82
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,360
here now.

83
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,160
Idle gossip brings trouble.

84
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,000
If it's not your business, don't meddle.

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Well said.

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,000
Too much gossip

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,760
leads to trouble.

88
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
Why is everyone still standing?

89
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,800
Please sit.

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,680
Everyone here

91
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,550
is the backbone of Li Group.

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I've been too busy

93
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,080
to show enough appreciation.

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,830
Actually,

95
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,400
rewards should've come earlier.

96
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,400
As people say,

97
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
a rich man

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
who doesn't stir things up

99
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,590
stays rich his whole life,

100
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,760
and a poor man
who doesn't stir things up

101
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,870
stays poor forever.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,270
So in life,

103
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
you either accept fate

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,760
or fight it.

105
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,000
But it's also true

106
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,400
that wealth lies in strategy,
not hard labor,

107
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,000
and profit lies in timing, not toil.

108
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,190
Sometimes, following the right people

109
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,190
matters more

110
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,000
than doing the right thing.

111
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,160
That's all. You can leave.

112
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,550
There's a spy among us

113
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,760
planted by the old man.

114
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,510
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,000
I didn't notice.

116
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,630
You're sorry?

117
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
By the time you noticed,

118
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,310
he would've already known

119
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,950
about our smuggling

120
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,590
and embezzling.

121
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Hai,

122
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,680
what should I...?

123
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,830
Right now, don't do anything.

124
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
They'll turn on each other.

125
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I contacted

126
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,160
the insider overseas.

127
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,800
He said today's news is a gift.

128
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,800
When it's released,

129
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,230
he'll give us a signal to go long.

130
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,830
So, we have

131
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
to plug the hole in the funds

132
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,160
as soon as possible.

133
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,360
As you know,

134
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Li Minxian

135
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
won't be easy to deal with.

136
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,720
Guys,

137
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,590
do you know how much commission
he's made?

138
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,830
How much?

139
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,550
Give it to me.

140
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,510
He has to pay

141
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,800
for night snacks tonight.

142
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,080
Bro.

143
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,950
Stop staring at me.

144
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,630
When Jiadi is back,

145
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,440
let him count his.

146
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
Let's compare today's numbers.

147
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,000
You're definitely paying tonight.

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's get back to work.

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,760
Night snacks are on you.

150
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,040
You'll be my boss.

151
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,550
Don't forget it.

152
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,360
Let's get back to work.

153
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,000
Bro.

154
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,630
Xue,

155
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,270
do you remember this?

156
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,590
Yeah, this one.

157
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,160
This one?

158
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,680
This is not good.

159
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,000
Yours is better.

160
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,550
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

161
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,270
It only started climbing these days.

162
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,000
I didn't expect it either.

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,190
Hurry. You need to add some too.

164
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,040
No.

165
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,310
Master.

166
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,270
Jiadi.

167
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,550
Yu Kai.

168
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,800
You guys are working overtime too?

169
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Ms. Li wants us to learn more.

170
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,190
It's called overtime,

171
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,950
but we're just using your crude oil case

172
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,360
to learn about risk limits.

173
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,760
Here.

174
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,590
I heard about you.

175
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,080
You're pretty impressive.

176
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,550
You just joined the team,

177
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,360
and the company already increased
your fund quota.

178
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,040
That's because I had experience before.

179
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,950
Besides,

180
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,950
even with this quota,

181
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,830
I can't do much with it.

182
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,830
It's still a lot of money.

183
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,040
You should teach me when you have time.

184
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,160
No problem.

185
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,080
I'm just in a hurry to watch the market.

186
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,830
We'll talk another day.

187
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,630
Alright.

188
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,830
Good luck.

189
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,400
Good luck.

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,190
Alright.

191
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,550
Got it.

192
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,550
Don't worry, boss.

193
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,800
Okay. Sure.

194
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,680
Sure.

195
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,080
Master.

196
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,400
What did you just say?

197
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,270
Master,

198
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,800
thank you for this month.

199
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
If it weren't for you,

200
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,190
I wouldn't have improved this quickly.

201
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm glad you know that.

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,480
You're calling me Master.

203
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,440
I have to teach you.

204
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes.

205
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,400
Master.

206
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,040
You've seen my simulated trading,

207
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,000
and I've been following

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,270
the crude oil project too.

209
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,590
Master,

210
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,120
can I try

211
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,550
real trading once?

212
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,190
Master,

213
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,440
just once.

214
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,950
Mr. Ming.

215
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,270
Jiadi,

216
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,630
you're just in time.

217
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,870
Here's the thing.

218
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,550
Mingjian wants to gain

219
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,230
more real trading experience.

220
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,590
You're experienced,

221
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,550
so I trust you.

222
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,950
I'd like you

223
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,080
to have him sit beside you

224
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,800
and teach him a bit.

225
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,870
No problem,

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
but I have nothing to teach him.

227
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
Mingjian is smart.

228
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,800
We can gain
practical experience together.

229
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,190
The market has been

230
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,680
a bit volatile these days,

231
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,400
but overall, it's on an upward trend.

232
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,480
It's nothing difficult.

233
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,360
When it's stable,

234
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,400
let him try using your account.

235
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,400
Thanks, Master.

236
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,400
Gu,

237
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,200
it's against the rules.

238
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,400
Newcomers

239
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,040
need to experience things.

240
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,910
You can't do everything on your own.

241
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,230
Help each other out.

242
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,310
Master.

243
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,720
Thanks, Master.

244
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,310
Everyone, pay attention.

245
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,040
The boss has given orders.

246
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,670
Keep an eye on the news

247
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,550
and watch the movements
of long and short positions.

248
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,480
Got it.

249
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't worry, Gu.

250
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Gu, with our performance,

251
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,800
you'll be promoted soon.

252
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,800
Don't forget to treat us to a meal.

253
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,840
Yeah.

254
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,230
It's not a big deal.

255
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,440
No problem.

256
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,080
Mr. Ming,

257
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,910
about the trading...

258
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,230
It's almost time.

259
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,630
Get back to work.

260
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,040
Go to work.

261
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,670
I'll leave you to it.

262
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,440
The long night is starting again.

263
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,040
Jiadi.

264
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,040
Did you buy Red Bull?

265
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,310
Yeah.

266
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,270
Give me one.

267
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,670
Here.

268
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,720
Thanks.

269
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,990
We were just saying

270
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,840
that when Gu gets promoted,

271
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,910
you'll be next.

272
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,590
Yeah.

273
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,270
I think so too.

274
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,670
Stop talking nonsense.

275
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm still an intern.

276
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,160
With your skills,

277
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,230
it's only a matter of time.

278
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,400
It's just a matter of time.

279
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,670
Don't be so modest.

280
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,870
Stop fooling around. Let's work.

281
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,840
You're being modest.

282
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,560
[Li Residence]

283
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Zhijin,

284
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,630
you're finally home.

285
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,440
Look at the time.

286
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,630
Come on.

287
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,990
You're a girl.

288
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,440
You could've done anything.

289
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,910
Why choose finance?

290
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Did you forget

291
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,670
all the family rules?

292
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,200
Little brat.

293
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,520
Today, I'm not going to talk about this.

294
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,910
It's almost time

295
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,590
for the three-year bet.

296
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,630
If your performance
doesn't meet the standard,

297
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,720
come back
and take over the family business.

298
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,230
Grandpa,

299
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,670
Wei's been doing fine.

300
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,230
What's the rush?

301
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,990
I haven't played enough yet.

302
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
You can play,

303
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,840
but get married first.

304
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,720
Grandpa,

305
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,440
I've told you so many times

306
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,590
that marriage can't be forced.

307
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
Besides,

308
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,630
you're so mighty

309
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,990
that you can live for 500 years.

310
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
Just give me more time.

311
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,840
I promise I'll find a good husband

312
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,990
to take good care of you.

313
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,670
When I was at the temple days ago,

314
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,230
I looked at the fruit on the tree.

315
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,950
It ripened

316
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,270
and fell off.

317
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,910
In this life,

318
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,480
I worry about you the most.

319
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,520
We have

320
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,720
a big family business.

321
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,590
If something happens to me,

322
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,630
those distant relatives will rush in

323
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,670
to split the business up.

324
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
What will you do then?

325
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,910
Silly girl.

326
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,230
I have just one requirement
for your marriage.

327
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,080
He must marry into our family.

328
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
I promise.

329
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,230
Within two months,

330
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,670
I'll find myself

331
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,800
the perfect husband.

332
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,990
Fine.

333
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,590
Don't try to fool me.

334
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,990
Don't bring some random guy back

335
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,910
from the streets.

336
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,400
I wouldn't do that.

337
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,840
The man I choose

338
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,630
will surely meet your expectations.

339
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,520
You'll bring him home in two months?

340
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,990
I'm not lying to you.

341
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,840
Here.

342
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,040
You've got comfortable, right?

343
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,990
Do you have a target now?

344
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Tell me.

345
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,590
It's a secret.

346
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,590
Sorry, I was too busy today

347
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,720
to let you have a try.

348
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,230
Why are you apologizing?

349
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,630
I'm not even on your team.

350
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,440
You're not to blame.

351
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,120
It might look stable now,

352
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,840
but it's actually a great time
to observe the market.

353
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,990
If you get the right info,

354
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,760
you can anticipate the trend

355
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,040
and plan your strategy.

356
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,800
Things are fairly stable,

357
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,760
but the more stable it looks,

358
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,200
the more closely you have to watch.

359
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,670
A turning point could come at any time.

360
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,910
We have to catch it...

361
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,910
Jiadi.

362
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,520
Mr. Ming.

363
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,120
Master.

364
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,870
Come and have a smoke with me.

365
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,910
I need to watch the market.

366
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,400
It's so late.

367
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,120
The trend is pretty much set.

368
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,230
Song,

369
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
keep an eye on it for him.

370
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,630
Jiadi,

371
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,590
let's go.

372
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,840
Let's go. Come and chat with me.

373
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,870
I haven't been up here in a while.

374
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,230
It feels great.

375
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,800
Have one.

376
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,630
Gu, I don't smoke.

377
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,670
Some fresh air is nice too.

378
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,840
You can talk frankly with me.

379
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,310
You and Lin Peng seem different,

380
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,230
but you're actually alike.

381
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,310
You both are talented, steady,

382
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,400
adorable,

383
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,310
and lucky.

384
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,310
But people around you

385
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,120
feel a lot of pressure.

386
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,080
Life isn't just

387
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,270
a month or two,

388
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,670
or even a year or two.

389
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,950
Over time,

390
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
people just can't keep up.

391
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,910
Gradually,

392
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,520
they give up.

393
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,870
Like I did.

394
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,990
Do you remember I told you

395
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,200
I didn't think much of Lin Peng

396
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,480
when he just came?

397
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,040
Sit.

398
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,950
Even now, I still don't.

399
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,950
But fate is fate.

400
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,440
He's a genius.

401
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,310
I can't compete with him.

402
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,230
I've accepted that.

403
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,870
Sometimes I wonder

404
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,520
if I'd just fought a little harder

405
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,670
for that chance,

406
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,950
flattered

407
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,080
the boss more,

408
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,760
or read

409
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,160
a few more books,

410
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,080
maybe I'd have made it too.

411
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,350
Now, when I see Song Mingjian,

412
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,400
I see my younger self.

413
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,630
Do you get what I'm saying?

414
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,840
When I was a kid, I had poor health.

415
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,630
My grandpa made me

416
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,990
hike into the mountains to gather herbs.

417
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,310
It was 40 kilometers back and forth

418
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,230
for five years.

419
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,990
Then I studied Go.

420
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,400
Every mistake meant a smack on the hand.

421
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,670
That went on for five years too.

422
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,160
In middle school,

423
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,200
I got into philosophy and math.

424
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,990
To read the original texts,

425
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,670
I taught myself German and Russian.

426
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,160
I couldn't understand anything,

427
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,870
so I had to look up

428
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,120
every single word

429
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,230
and memorize them one by one.

430
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,040
When I first learned trading,

431
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,520
I practiced opening
and closing positions 300 times a day.

432
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,720
So, Mr. Ming,

433
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,120
compared to those young prodigies,

434
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,400
I'm not a genius.

435
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm happy to share my experience

436
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,120
with Song Mingjian,

437
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,200
but I don't have the authority
to let him trade.

438
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,670
Neither do you.

439
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,590
Nothing's gonna happen.

440
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,630
Let's close for the night.

441
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,120
I wanna get some sleep.

442
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,630
Xu.

443
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,990
Are you watching the news?

444
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,200
Any updates?

445
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,670
Same stuff.

446
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,670
Barclays predicts that the highest
crude oil trend this year will be 76.

447
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,440
And the USD exchange rates...

448
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,720
What's going on?

449
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,670
A cruise ship exploded
off the coast of Malacca.

450
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
It's going up.

451
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,310
The news just said it.

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,440

464
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,630
Just trade!

465
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,720

466
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,350

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,990

Hurry, hurry.

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,040
Buy it now.

Hurry, everyone.

477
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,040
Click faster, bro.

478
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,840
We're almost at the closing session.

479
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,630
Gu,

480
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
we should head back.

481
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,630
Jiadi,

482
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
don't tell Mr. Lin

483
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,800
about tonight.

484
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,760
It's passed 72, guys.

485
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,270
We can just trade.

486
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,350
I missed it.

487
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,670
Bid over the market.

488
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,910
We're up at least 8% today.

489
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,550
Luckily, I have a lot of money left.

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,200

00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,910

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,670
Undo it, undo it.

498
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
It's still going up.

499
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,520
Undo it.

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,440
Undo it.

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,670
Undo it.

502
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,120
Undo it.

503
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,440
Undo it.

guys.

507
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,120
Ms. Li, something's wrong
with the account.

508
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,400
There's large reverse trading.

509
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,950
Once this project is done,

510
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,400
I can help you suggest
a permanent position.

511
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,520
Don't worry. It's fine.

512
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,350
I need to go back
to the trading room now.

513
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,520
Zhao Jiadi.

514
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,720
Ms. Li.

515
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,840
Manager Li.

516
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,590
What's going on?

517
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,350
Zhao Jiadi,

518
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
how dare you leave the trading room?

519
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,230
Where have you been?

520
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,520
Song Mingjian,

521
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,230
please repeat what happened.

522
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,950
Why didn't you refuse

523
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,990
when Ming Gu asked you?

524
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,630
I was misled by my experience

525
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,200
and didn't foresee the unexpected event.

526
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,350
Your trade parameters
were set incorrectly.

527
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,630
You didn't follow the company's rules

528
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,760
and didn't fill in the stop-loss amount.

529
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,270
I stopped trading when I left.

530
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,670
I'm used to filling it in when I trade.

531
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,840
Before Zhao Jiadi left,

532
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,040
did he clearly tell you

533
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,630
not to use his account?

534
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,270
You're a senior employee.

535
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,080
Why did you seriously violate the rules

536
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,160
even though you knew them?

537
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,270
I didn't let Song Mingjian
make any trades.

538
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,840
I just asked Zhao Jiadi to teach him.

539
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,590
Song Mingjian asked me many times.

540
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,040
I just couldn't refuse.

541
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,400
You're the team leader.

542
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
You left your post

543
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
during a trade.

544
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,480
I... Well...

545
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,950
This has never

546
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,400
happened before.

547
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,440
You don't have the ability
to handle emergencies.

548
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,200
So why did you take action yourself?

549
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,160
Song Mingjian was jealous of Zhao Jiadi.

550
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
He misled me.

551
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,590
I thought Song Mingjian did well

552
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,800
in simulated trading,

553
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,200
so I thought about having him

554
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,910
assist Zhao Jiadi.

555
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,840
In this incident, what responsibility

556
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,990
do you think you should bear?

557
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,910
First,

558
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,080
when the team leader asked me
to violate the rules,

559
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,350
I didn't immediately refuse.

560
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,720
Second, I wasn't attentive enough
to my colleagues

561
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,990
and didn't consider
Song Mingjian's feelings.

562
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,040
Actually, if I'd agreed to let him trade

563
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,160
when the market opened,

564
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,440
none of this would have happened.

565
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,590
I'm willing to accept
the company's punishment.

566
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,520
As Song Mingjian's temporary supervisor,

567
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,440
I want to share
the responsibility with him.

568
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
You want to share it?

569
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,270
With what?

570
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,590
The market trend is still ongoing.

571
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,480
Give me a little time.

572
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,440
I can turn the loss into a profit.

573
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,870
You're young

574
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,440
but bold.

575
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,230
Boss.

576
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,400
We've figured out what happened.

577
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,400
Since the loss amount is significant,

578
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,270
the company needs to have
a senior meeting.

579
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
You can go back

580
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,720
and wait for a notice.

581
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,040
Jiadi.

582
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,590
Zhao Jiadi.

583
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,550
This was my mistake.

584
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,080
I take full responsibility.

585
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,040
It has nothing to do with you.

586
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Thank you for your kindness.

587
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,040
Mr. Ming,

588
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,200
there's one thing you got wrong.

589
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,520
Song Mingjian

590
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,630
is nothing like you.

591
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,230
Mr. Wei.

592
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,400
You're amazing.

593
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,400
The oil price really went up.

594
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,400
Everyone is thrilled.

595
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,160
Director, stay steady.

596
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,270
This is just the beginning.

597
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,760
Bro.

598
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,160
I need a favor.

599
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,480
Can you let me in

600
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,670
on that futures trade?

601
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,670
I'll send you the money.

602
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,870
Futures?

603
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,990
I guess it's not impossible.

604
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,400
Bro,

605
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,550
just tell me what you need.

606
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,590
But the profit-sharing ratio

607
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,720
for spot trading now is...

608
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,950
You decide.

609
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,760
You're so powerful.

610
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,310
From now on, I'll follow you

611
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,200
to make money.

612
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,400
Alright.

613
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,840
I've got something important to do.

614
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,870
We'll talk later. That's it.

615
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,950
Hello?

616
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,910
He hung up on me.

617
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,230
Mr. Wei.

618
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,400
Here's the trading analysis report.

619
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,350
I need to head back for a meeting.

620
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,270
Call me if I'm needed.

621
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,760
Alright.

622
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,800
You don't have the ability
to handle emergencies.

623
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,230
So why did you take action yourself?

624
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,080
Song Mingjian asked me many times.

625
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,550
I just asked Zhao Jiadi to teach him.

626
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,870
In this incident, what responsibility

627
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,040
do you think you should bear?

628
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,200
Zhao Jiadi,

629
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,400
how dare you leave the trading room?

630
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,670
Where have you been?

631
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,160
You and Lin Peng seem different,

632
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,990
but you're actually alike.

633
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,910
You both are talented, steady,

634
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,080
adorable,

635
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,870
and lucky.

636
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,400
But people around you

637
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,990
feel a lot of pressure.

638
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,870
Why didn't you refuse

639
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,040
when Ming Gu asked you?

640
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,720
Newcomers need to experience things.

641
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,990
You can't do everything on your own.

642
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,160
Help each other out.

643
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,760
You once stood at the top.

644
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Even if you've fallen,

645
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,200
you're willing to start over
and taste all that life offers.

646
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,310
Maybe it's a good thing.

647
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,030
Qingdi left behind a diary.

648
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,800
I'll lend it to you.

649
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,030
I've always felt my greatest luck

650
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,910
was not taking my studies seriously.

651
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,080
I was able to stand out

652
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,030
in different circles

653
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,760
because many talented men

654
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,710
were stifled by books

655
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,390
in their youth.

656
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,800
I used to think

657
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,270
my lousy fate

658
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,350
owed me too much.

659
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,480
I thought that taking a crooked path,

660
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,240
a shady route,

661
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,200
was the only way to get ahead.

662
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,560
Recently,

663
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,270
I've finally realized

664
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,670
it was I who owed too much to others.

665
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,240
Do you remember

666
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,800
the distant look you gave me

667
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,520
at the elevator door?

668
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,880
Can you stop looking at me

669
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,310
like that in the future?

670
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,390
Ke said

671
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,800
you're still brothers.

672
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,120
Some debts are too much to be repaid,

673
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,390
and some debts can never be repaid

674
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,030
because it's too late.

675
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,440
If we take them down,

676
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,840
then we can transfer their equipment

677
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,240
at a depreciated cost.

678
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,710
Ms. Qi?

679
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,990
Let's take a 15-minute break.

680
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,880
We'll continue later.

681
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,800
Break for 15 minutes.

682
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,640
[From: Baliang
Dongcao, are you busy?]

683
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,800
Dongcao.

684
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,080
Yes?

685
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm dealing with crude oil futures.

686
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,670
I need some first-hand
international market information,

687
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,840
especially
about international fluid capital.

688
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,800
You have a wide network.

689
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,630
Can you help me...?

690
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,760
No problem.

691
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,240
Routine news is simple.

692
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,120
I'll handle the rest.

693
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,080
Baliang,

694
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,880
I'll confirm it asap

695
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,240
and send it to your email.

696
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,440
Dongcao.

697
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,160
How have you been?

698
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,240
How's the new company going?

699
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,270
It's going well.

700
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,910
Just too busy.

701
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
I bought a company in Hong Kong, China.

702
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,990
It's like a backdoor listing.

703
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,310
I still want to continue

704
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,840
with the desalination project

705
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,710
we worked on before.

706
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,910
You'll surely succeed.

707
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I always thought

708
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
you'd become

709
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
a powerful business leader.

710
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,880
But back then, at Jinhai...

711
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,800
But it was too exhausting.

712
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,200
You were right before.

713
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,520
Being hands-on in everything

714
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,590
is bound to cause problems.

715
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,950
I should learn

716
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,200
to trust others

717
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,310
and take a short break for myself.

718
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,590
Sometimes...

719
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,270
Dongcao,

720
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,310
When I knew about Ke,

722
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,390
my mind was chaotic.

723
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,480
Some things I said weren't aimed at you.

724
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,590
They were directed at me.

725
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,840
I thought it through later.

726
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,800
But...

727
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:12,840
I understand.

728
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,390
The closer we are,

729
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,710
the more likely we are to be affected.

730
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,440
Baliang,

731
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm willing to share your emotions.

732
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,800
That was the only thing I could do

733
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,270
to help you at the time.

734
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,480
Let's stop here.

735
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,480
I need to help arrange
the materials for you.

736
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,880
Once I'm done with this,

737
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,200
I'll go to Hang City to visit you.

738
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,950
