I'll try again.

193
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,110
The old fisherman,

194
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,630
with a single rod,

195
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,190
stays near the cliff

196
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,590
by the bay.

197
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,030
His boat drifts freely...

198
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,710
Mo, Mo.

199
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,470
Stop singing.

200
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,110
I lost this round.

201
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,950
The wine on this board

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,910
is all yours.

203
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,550
It's mine then.

204
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,150
I don't think it's enough.

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,990
Hold on.

206
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,150
We agreed.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,390
One drink for two lines of verse

208
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,550
about Tiao River.

209
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,150
If you can't recite one,

210
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,990
you drink

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,990
three times the amount.

212
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,910
Fine, fine.

213
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,510
Send word to the hermit, Fan Shubao:

214
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,150
When will the mist part
to grant us a glimpse?

215
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,150
Thatched halls may be found
throughout the land,

216
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,230
but none reflect
like the mystical mountain on the lake.

217
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,150
Good poem.

218
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,470
Good, good.

219
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,510
In a room smaller
than a boat on a creek,

220
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,030
the breeze fills in,
bringing in the autumn.

221
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,790
Dust grows in the steamer,
with insects in the pot.

222
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,590
Yet I only focus on chanting poems,
swaying back and forth.

223
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,150
Swaying back and forth.

224
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,110
Good, good.

225
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,310
You can really hold your liquor.

226
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,270
Do you admit defeat?

227
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,350
Mo,

228
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,310
let me think a bit more.

229
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,990
In the morning,
I steer the boat to fish.

230
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,950
After the rain,
I hike alone with a cane.

231
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,110
Inspired by Du Fu from a long time ago,

232
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,190
I threw myself into seclusion
at an old age.

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,310
Mo,

234
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,790
he's my guest.

235
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,470
His poem counts

236
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,230
as mine.

237
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,710
I'll drink.

238
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,150
Young man, come here.

239
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,950
Come here.

240
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,710
There are still seven pieces left

241
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,950
on the board.

242
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,310
If you can't recite poems,

243
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,390
all the 21 drinks

244
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,350
will be yours.

245
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,430
How about it?

246
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,350
Do you dare?

247
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,350
Mo, what are you doing?

248
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,510
Who reigns over the clouds
and mountains nearby?

249
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,150
The smoke from several homes rises
side by side.

250
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,550
Why must the woodcutter
by the roadside still ask?

251
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,070
The morning market now is no longer
as thriving as in the Qin Dynasty.

252
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,150
Good.

253
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,230
Drink.

254
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,590
Good, good.

255
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,510
I invite neighbors
in the south for a drink.

256
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,550
Together we drink,
as the hills stretch on.

257
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,630
Good, good.

258
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,550
Wonderful.

259
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,510
In the wind, distant howls echo.

260
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,750
In the deep snow, I dwell in peace.

261
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,350
Good.

262
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,070
Good, good.

263
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,230
Another drink.

264
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,710
To leave a legacy behind,

265
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,790
I indulge myself
while roaming the southeast.

266
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,590
Impressive. Good, good.

267
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,590
Impressive. Impressive.

268
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,190
Drink.

269
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,750
Mr. Huang,

270
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,590
let me drink this one for you.

271
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,150
You'll drink for me?

272
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,350
Good, good.

273
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,350
Heroes have emerged young.

274
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,710
Good, good.

275
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,750
Give it to me.

276
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,750
When you build this thatched house,

277
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,550
it means your shadow
will forever linger.

278
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,190
Good.

279
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,360
Good.

280
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,190
Amazing.

281
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,230
What does your flesh possess?

282
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,950
Where do life and death rest?

283
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,870
Good. Good.

284
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,430
A true scholar radiates wisdom.

285
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,350
Good. Good.

286
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,950
He reminisces about the Tang recluse,

287
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,510
who also once sought purity.

288
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,230
Under the white clouds,

289
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,710
he built a humble abode.

290
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,230
Good. Amazing.

291
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,150
Wonderful.

292
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,550
I concede defeat.

293
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,550
You flatter me.

294
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,590
Zhao,

295
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,950
we meet again.

296
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,910
Mr. Huang.

297
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,350
Jiadi, I told you...

298
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,150
Mr. Huang.

299
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,910
Mr. Jin,

300
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,430
we were supposed to meet Mr. Huang?

301
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,510
Yes, yes.

302
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,150
You wait here a moment.

303
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,630
I'll have a private chat with my guests.

304
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,230
Go ahead.

305
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,750
Come on.

306
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,470
This way, please, Mr. Huang.

307
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,200
Let's go.

308
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,270
Let's go sit inside.

309
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,910
This kid is truly promising.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,590
Yes, yes.

311
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,190
Promising indeed.

312
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,990
Come on, let's continue our game.

313
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,720
Mr. Li.

314
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,510
That's the situation.

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,670
I'm here only as a friend

316
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,150
to let you know.

317
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,590
You'll make the final decision.

318
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,430
We won't take up

319
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,350
more of your time.

320
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,200
You're busy.

321
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,390
I won't keep you.

322
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,430
Please stay.

323
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,990
Uncle Xu, take care.

324
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,550
I won't walk you out then.

325
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,950
Grandpa,

326
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,110
should we investigate

327
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,630
what Uncle Xu said?

328
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,750
It's like we're
taking advantage of them.

329
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,150
Silly child,

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,270
we can't just do

331
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,350
whatever people tell us to do.

332
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,150
Doing business

333
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,950
isn't that simple.

334
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,990
Where do profits come from?

335
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,790
From unfairness.

336
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,270
For some people,

337
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,430
even if you offer them huge benefits,

338
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,590
they'd still think it's unfair.

339
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,150
We have

340
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,390
a huge family business.

341
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,750
We can't just starve ourselves

342
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,790
for the sake of a good reputation.

343
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,110
But you always say reputation matters.

344
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,750
This is different.

345
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,710
We can't be so rigid.

346
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,910
We have to be flexible.

347
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,790
They're electing a president, right?

348
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,430
Let them fight over it first.

349
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,830
When it gets out of hand,

350
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,990
I'll step in.

351
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,150
I'm going to get some sleep.

352
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,310
Zhijin,

353
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,910
your grandpa

354
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,710
is paving the way for you.

355
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,550
Time waits for no one.

356
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,950
Green skirts can't withstand the chill.

357
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,750
Without realizing it,

358
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,630
I've grown old.

359
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,110
But now that I'm back,

360
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,150
I still want to contribute

361
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,510
and do some charity work.

362
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,750
We really have a connection.

363
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,110
I'm lucky to meet you again.

364
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,750
I'd like you to be

365
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,230
the secretary-general of my foundation

366
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,390
and help me manage everything.

367
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,350
Mr. Huang,

368
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,950
I'm really grateful

369
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,550
for your plan to cultivate me.

370
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,990
But I already have my own plans.

371
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,590
You want to start your own business?

372
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,310
That's right.

373
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,910
I want to open a private equity firm.

374
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,550
But the specific plan
isn't finalized yet.

375
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,590
Having your own ideas is good.

376
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,390
Mr. Huang,

377
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,150
once your foundation is set up,

378
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,590
will it engage
in any commercial investments?

379
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,350
Probably not.

380
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,710
In business,

381
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,710
once you open the door to one,

382
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,390
there will be a second.

383
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,230
If everyone comes knocking,

384
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,030
my peaceful days

385
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,550
will be over.

386
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,750
The green wine is prepared,

387
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,030
with a lively flame in a small stove.

388
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,000
Mr. Huang,

389
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,950
I can be your little drinking buddy.

390
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,750
Sure.

391
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,070
Cheers.

392
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,270
Good morning.

393
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,550
Good morning.

394
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,790
Sleepyhead.

395
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,710
The sun's almost up.

396
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,590
Open your curtains

397
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,750
and look at the beautiful sunshine.

398
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,350
A wonderful day is about to start.

399
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,790
I was long awake.

400
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,590
Not sure who's the real sleepyhead here.

401
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,310
Do you know

402
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,550
what I dreamed about last night?

403
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,560
Don't tell me

404
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,110
it was about me.

405
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,630
Ugh, don't flatter yourself.

406
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,350
I dreamed

407
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,750
that we went hiking.

408
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,590
At first, it was daytime.

409
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,590
But as we walked, it got dark.

410
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,150
And then you suddenly disappeared.

411
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,710
I started looking for you.

412
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,470
I kept looking

413
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,710
until the sun came up,

414
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,710
and I still couldn't find you.

415
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,190
Farmer,

416
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,470
do you know

417
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,150
how beautiful the sunrise
on the mountaintop was?

418
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,430
That's easy.

419
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,310
Pick a day,

420
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,910
and I'll take you
to make your dream come true.

421
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,110
You're up to no good.

422
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,430
Tell me.

423
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,470
Are you planning to sell me off

424
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,550
on the mountain?

425
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,350
What happened with the person

426
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,710
you said you were going to meet?

427
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,150
Don't ask. No luck.

428
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,310
He already has plans.

429
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,230
I even prepared a gift for that.

430
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,750
Thank you for making the effort.

431
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,590
Glad you know that.

432
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,990
Zhijin, breakfast's ready.

433
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,590
Alright, I'm hanging up.

434
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,630
I need to get up, wash,

435
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,790
change clothes, and dine.

436
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,950
Okay.

437
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,830
Bye.

438
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,910
I heard about Longquan.

439
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,030
He has a problem with you,

440
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,590
so solve it.

441
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,350
I know.

442
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,790
But they want control.

443
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,750
Uncle,

444
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,790
with Uncle Xu at the NCC,

445
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,590
everything's not entirely up to me.

446
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,830
If Fan manages

447
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,990
to raise the money,

448
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,630
I'm worried there will be conflicts.

449
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,430
Maybe...

450
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,070
Maybe you could give

451
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,150
the boss of Risheng a call?

452
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,950
You should eat too.

453
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,360
Eat.

454
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,110
Grandpa, morning.

455
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,790
A rare guest.

456
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,230
You haven't come back
for a meal for so long,

457
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,550
and Grandpa was starting to feel sad.

458
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,910
But I'm back now.

459
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,910
I've been swamped with work.

460
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,070
But

461
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,950
once you return to the group,

462
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,470
I'll have more free time.

463
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,830
That won't happen soon.

464
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,110
There are so many employees
at my company.

465
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,390
I have to be responsible for them.

466
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,190
I can't just leave them like that.

467
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,110
Right, Grandpa?

468
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,630
For your company,

469
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,830
find a professional manager.

470
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,310
If you don't have anyone in mind,

471
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,630
I'll help you find someone.

472
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,470
Get Zhijin a proper position

473
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,390
in the group.

474
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,030
You'll still be in charge.

475
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,550
Okay, Uncle.

476
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,870
Eat.

477
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,620
[When will you come?]

478
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,030
You still act like a child

479
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,030
and hide when you're upset.

480
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,030
Jinghai.

481
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,070
What's wrong?

482
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,630
What's your wish?

483
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,630
Maybe I can help you make it come true.

484
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,830
I know Grandpa's intentions.

485
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,270
But honestly,

486
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,910
I really don't want to take over.

487
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,670
Ever since I was little,
I've watched the adults

488
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,510
rushing around for profit.

489
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,120
At first,

490
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,150
they said it was for survival.

491
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,110
Later, they said it was for the family.

492
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,550
The term "family"

493
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,550
feels like a shackle.

494
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,470
It wasn't enough to trap my dad.

495
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,350
They want to trap me too.

496
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,910
I don't want that kind of life.

497
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,350
But you know

498
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,950
what Grandpa is like.

499
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,790
I just don't know

500
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,950
how to make him accept it.

501
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,150
Zhijin,

502
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,350
I

503
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,750
have an idea.

504
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,310
It's not feasible?

505
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,110
That's just how it is.

506
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,310
Think about how to explain it
to Mr. Fan.

507
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,750
Mr. Wang...

508
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,030
For mining companies, asset valuation

509
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,750
usually gets discounted by 40% to 60%.

510
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,910
Even if we calculate at 60%,

511
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,630
it's still less than 700 million.

512
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,510
They want to raise 1.5 billion.

513
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,710
It's just not feasible.

514
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,870
There's the real estate project
as collateral, right?

515
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,910
Look here.

516
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,310
This is in a high-tech zone.

517
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,030
Both the location
and planning are great.

518
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,910
Once the construction is done,

519
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,310
sales can start in six months at most.

520
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,870
And this one.

521
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,390
An 8,000 square meter clubhouse.

522
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,030
The annual profit alone...

523
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,750
We get what you're saying.

524
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,230
But right now...

525
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,950
Lin Peng,

526
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,750
you can leave us for now.

527
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,950
If I wanted to block you
with the project,

528
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,510
just the fundraising timeline alone

529
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,910
would be enough to shut you down.

530
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,030
I've thought about that too.

531
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,910
Let me be honest with you.

532
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,710
Fan Longquan's matter

533
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,950
is beyond my capability.

534
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,310
I can't help with that,

535
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,310
neither can you.

536
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,910
Is it the Li family...?

537
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,750
The company can pay

538
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,030
for your gifts to Mr. Fan.

539
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,790
You should find a chance

540
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,030
to apologize.

541
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,590
There's a long road ahead.

542
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,110
No need to rush things now.

543
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,630
Wang,

544
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,590
do you know why I wanted

545
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,070
to work on Mr. Fan's project?

546
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,750
Fanlong Mining

547
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,830
isn't a big corporation.

548
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,310
At first, I was puzzled too.

549
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,150
He also has
a real estate company, right?

550
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,950
With opportunity and momentum,

551
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,710
if he wanted to make profits,

552
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,230
the company should've taken off already.

553
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,870
It wasn't until later

554
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,990
when I read their annual report

555
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,830
that I understood.

556
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,790
Wang,

557
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,430
do you know how much he spends each year

558
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,470
on employee benefits?

559
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,350
That's right.

560
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,070
When we do projects,

561
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,630
we look at profit and risk.

562
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,310
But if all financial institutions

563
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,310
only chase after the top-tier companies,

564
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,830
then who's going to support

565
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,830
honest, hardworking businesses

566
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,630
like his?

567
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,630
I just don't get it.

568
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,590
Why would we turn away

569
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,750
an entrepreneur

570
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,870
who genuinely wants to do something?

571
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,590
It's good you're thinking

572
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,350
about the guys below.

573
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,230
But don't forget this:

574
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,550
We're in business,

575
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,350
not charity.

576
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,390
Your personal feelings?

577
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,310
That's a shame.

578
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,630
Did you try the bank?

579
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,430
I did.

580
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,590
But I don't meet

581
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,030
the loan conditions.

582
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,190
Banks don't care

583
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,670
about long-term gains.

584
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,590
Boss.

585
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,630
The first client I approached

586
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,550
was a businessman
who had a huge business.

587
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,630
He liked to play Go too.

588
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,630
That day,

589
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,230
we played five games.

590
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,790
To please him,

591
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,550
I deliberately lost three games.

592
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,470
At the time, I thought I was clever

593
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,590
to plan the whole thing so carefully.

594
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,790
But the deal still fell through.

595
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,390
Later, the boss called me personally.

596
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,190
He asked me,

597
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,710
"You clearly could've won"

598
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,670
"those games."

599
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,590
"Why did you lose?"

600
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,670
I felt so wronged.

601
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,790
I was a newcomer.

602
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,270
I did everything

603
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,110
I could

604
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,550
and I should

605
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,830
to make him happy.

606
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,190
Why didn't it work?

607
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,030
But then he said something

608
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,190
that left me speechless.

609
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,190
He told me my Go skills are decent,

610
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,190
but in terms of the way of Go,

611
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,870
I haven't even started to get it.

612
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,590
Playing Go is about life.

613
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,390
Doing business

614
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,870
is also about life.

615
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,230
These sentences have been like a mirror

616
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,750
for me all these years,

617
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,550
constantly reminding me.

618
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,390
Until the day of the interview,

619
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,590
when you said in front of everyone

620
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,710
that I disappointed you,

621
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,950
I felt like

622
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,830
that mirror appeared again.

623
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,990
These are

624
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,750
the resources
I've gathered over the years.

625
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,030
There are large, medium,
and small enterprises,

626
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,910
as well as banks,

627
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,870
trust firms,

628
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,990
and other financial companies.

629
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,830
Jiadi,

630
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,150
if one path doesn't work,

631
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,150
try another.

632
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,270
Ms. Li.

633
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,790
Jiadi.

634
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,390
Hello.

635
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,470
I've brought you

636
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,670
the financing proposal
for Fanlong Group.

637
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,470
Please have a look.

638
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,350
The NCC's power station is located

639
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,910
right at the center
of the mining district.

640
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,030
Hello.

♪Unarmed, he says nothing♪

642
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,110
Fanlong Group's financing plan
is divided into four phases.

643
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,830
Yes, it's me.

♪Full of passion, he's never changed♪

645

I have other matters to attend to.

647
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,750
Mr. Wang, about the proposal...

Sorry.

652
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,710
I'm not interested

653
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,510
in your project.

Mr. Li,

657
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,550
let me explain again.

658
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,990
Our main advantages

659
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,190
are concentrated in three areas:

660
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,070
manpower, water and electricity...

661
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,550
Boss,

662
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,550
I've visited every company on the list.

663
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,950
We recovered about 60% of the money.

664
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,870
But for Le's debt,

665
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,830
I don't think there's much hope.

666
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,150
Le borrowed that money

667
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,150
five years ago, right?

668
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,350
What's his situation?

669
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,750
Ping,

670
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,350
I went to see him.

671
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,070
He's really struggling.

672
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,150
He even sold his house.

673
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,190
Seeing him like that,

674
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,350
I didn't say anything.

675
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,390
But he chased after me, asking

676
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,350
if the boss needed the money.

677
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,750
He said he'd find a way.

678
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,830
Burn Le's

679
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,070
IOU.

680
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,270
Burn it?

681
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,470
Tell him

682
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,790
not to worry about the money.

683
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,390
If he dares to mess around,

684
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,150
I'll break his legs.

685
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,750
Got it.

686
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,550
We can't use the real estate funds.

687
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,430
We're already short on cash.

688
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,750
Bro,

689
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,070
I'm worried

690
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,950
that if we keep dragging this out,

691
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,790
the company might collapse later.

692
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,190
Boss, maybe we should just let it go.

693
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,230
It's not worth it

694
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,190
to clash with the Li family.

695
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,590
Yeah, boss.

696
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,550
A fly may be small,

697
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,590
but it's still meat.

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,990
What are you guys talking about?

699
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,990
