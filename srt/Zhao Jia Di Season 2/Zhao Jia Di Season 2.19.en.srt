00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Hai,

4
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,040
I'll take two guys with me.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,640
Let's handle that rascal.

6
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,160
Make him disappear.

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,640
Miss Li just got confused for a bit.

8
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
If she knew how you felt,

9
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,080
she'd definitely choose you.

10
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
But since that Zhao guy

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,000
is asking for trouble...

12
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,280
Lin,

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,240
how long have you been with me?

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,040
Eight or nine years.

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,840
That's not a short time.

16
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,240
Are you feeling sorry for me?

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,400
Sorry.

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,520
Turn right up ahead.

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
I'm going home tonight.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Okay.

21
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Hai.

22
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,080
Hey, Mr. Farmer.

23
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,240
Did you finish the materials I gave you?

24
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
Any problems with the calculations?

25
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
The rest?

26
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,600
That's confidential.

27
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
I can't show you.

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,240
Unless...

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Are you done with your stuff
in Hai City?

30
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
When are you coming to Hang City?

31
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,520
What?

32
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,840
You came to Hang City
and didn't tell me?

33
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,680
What do you need to sort out?

34
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you here on a mission

35
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
or looking for a place or a job?

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
Whatever it is, just tell me.

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
I'll take care of it.

38
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,160
How about this?

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
Just come and work at my company.

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,440
I'll offer you a high salary.

41
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Mom,

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,400
xiangchun is all sold out today.

43
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,120
I'll make it for you another day.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,320
Let's have this for now.

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,960
Farmer, you're getting fancy.

46
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,280
I can even hear English words from you.

47
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Bye.

48
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
I honestly didn't expect this.

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,600
Ever since you came to Hang City,

50
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
so much has happened.

51
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I still find it hard to believe too.

52
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,600
Everything has been surprising.

53
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
Have you and your friend

54
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
made up yet?

55
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,280
But I want to finish what I started.

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
For both him and myself,

57
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
it's some kind of closure.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,360
I haven't been too involved
in the company.

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,560
And when it comes to
your dad and Jinhai,

60
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,840
grandpa never talked much about that.

61
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
But I think

62
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
even if they had issues,

63
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
it's probably all in the past.

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,440
Still, it's hard to say.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,960
I know what Zhao Xin is like.

66
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,440
But there's one thing for sure.

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,320
He'd never do anything crazy.

68
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
You make my grandpa sound like

69
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,560
he's petty.

70
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Anyway,

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,640
you just meet him as usual.

72
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,600
Let Grandpa get to know you.

73
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,640
Then I'll slowly ease things in.

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
My grandpa, honestly,

75
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,600
he's all bark, soft at heart,

76
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,480
and he actually values family.

77
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Oh right,

78
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,920
are you going to Jufeng?

79
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
If I go to Jufeng, where do you go?

80
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,640
I had dinner with Fan recently.

81
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,840
He said something

82
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,160
that really moved me.

83
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,640
He stepped into that position,

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,360
but he still admitted his shortcomings

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
in front of everyone.

86
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,440
I haven't done anything for him yet,

87
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,320
but he already trusted me.

88
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,840
I told him I wanted to start a business.

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
He said he's willing to fund me.

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,760
So honestly, deep down,

91
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,960
I've already made up my mind.

92
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,440
Once I meet your grandpa,

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
I'll explain everything to him.

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,160
I'd love to invest in you too.

95
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
Keep the benefits in the family.

96
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,880
Silly girl,

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,640
how could I take your money?

98
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,600
I want to earn it myself

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
and walk into your family with pride.

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,240
It's really beautiful.

101
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,560
Let's go.

102
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
Is it like what you dreamed of?

103
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,720
Even better.

104
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,480
You weren't in my dreams.

105
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,560
I kept thinking about it

106
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
and this is perfect
as our token of love.

107
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,560
It's real and meaningful.

108
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Darling,

109
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,240
the money I made in Hang City

110
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,040
is all in here.

111
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,960
From now on, I'll put

112
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
any money I earn in it,

113
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,560
and you'll handle it.

114
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
That's how you show your feelings?

115
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,720
You're not romantic at all.

116
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,400
Didn't you say
Heaven and Earth as our witness?

117
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Li Zhijin!

118
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760

Morning, Zhijin.

130
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,640
Morning, Grandpa.

131
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,800
Zhijin, you're here.

132
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,040
Uncle Yan, is there still porridge?

133
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
There is.

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Could you get me a bowl?

135
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,600
Sure thing.

136
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
You look a bit pale.

137
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
Didn't sleep well?

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,640
Work's been busy lately.

139
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,960
I hardly slept at all last night.

140
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
Ziqi stopped by yesterday.

141
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
Thanks.

142
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,080
Big mouth.

143
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,600
No point getting mad now.

144
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,240
Just be honest.

145
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,240
That way, things go easier.

146
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,400
When did you meet him?

147
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,920
How long have you known him?

148
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
What does his family do?

149
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,480
Grandpa.

150
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,040
Look at what you care about.

151
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
Shouldn't you be asking,

152
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,400
"How he treats you?

153
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,600
Are you happy with him?

154
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,080
Do you really like him?"

155
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
Do I even need to ask?

156
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
With your charm,

157
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
who wouldn't treat you well?

158
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,480
Even if he's faking,

159
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
he'd keep it up for a year or so,

160
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,640
just to get into the Li family.

161
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,320
Grandpa,

162
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,840
he's really not like that.

163
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,880
We've known each other for seven years.

164
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,360
Even if we hadn't met before,

165
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,560
we've worked together.

166
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,240
He knew our family

167
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
was pretty well-off long ago.

168
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,200
If he had some plan,

169
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
we wouldn't have only met

170
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
three times these years.

171
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Besides,

172
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,280
about the Jufeng manager thing,

173
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
I honestly had no clue.

174
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,680
You've got a sharp eye

175
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
that you picked him out right away.

176
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
So, think about it,

177
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
isn't this a coincidence?

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Don't flatter me too much.

179
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,880
Choosing a manager

180
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,400
isn't the same
as picking a grandson-in-law.

181
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,600
Li,

182
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,960
he made it on his own.

183
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,800
You can't just dislike him

184
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
because I like him.

185
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,120
Whatever.

186
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Three meetings in seven years.

187
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,680
I should at least meet him, right?

188
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
You want to meet him?

189
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
This weekend.

193
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
So you're saying,

194
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,560
Mr. Li agreed?

195
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,480
Or is he just being vague?

196
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,040
It's still too soon to tell.

197
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,400
Anyway, I just want a clear answer
from him.

198
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
So he can't say
I made decisions on my own.

199
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Take a look at this first.

200
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,760
Which company is this?

201
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,160
Are they also at the mining site?

202
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Way more than that.

203
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,360

How did I not know this?

208
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Someone hid it on purpose.

209
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
Of course you had no idea.

210
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,360

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,240
Are you suspicious...

217
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,280
Not suspicious,

218
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm certain.

219
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600

No one really runs this company.

It's just an empty shell.

get this?

The company records

230
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,200
were sent by Cai Yanzhi's people.

231
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,280
She wanted to know if I was aware.

232
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,600
As for the rest,

233
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,200
I had someone check on it in private.

234
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,000
We both know what kind of person

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Chen Zhuhe is.

236
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,400
He doesn't have that kind of nerve.

237
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
But just a loan alone

238
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,360
isn't enough to pin him down.

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
why sneak around to do it?

325
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,760
you asked me
about renting a place, remember?

326
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,040
I've sorted it all out for you.

327
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,440
It's our own property.

328
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,560
The place isn't big,

329
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,600
but you can use it however you like.

330
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,080
It's reliable.

331
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,360
There's one more thing.

332
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,400
Remember the girl you helped last time?

333
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,040
She's been looking for you everywhere.

334
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,840
When did that happen?

335
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,240
Come on, drop the act.

336
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,640
She's already asked me about you.

337
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,040

He has a girlfriend now.

342
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,000
Seriously?

343
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,360
When did that even happen?

344
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,280
Look at you, man. Not bad.

345
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,640
Why keep something this big from us?

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,840
You didn't even let me meet her.

347

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,080
Actually, I have something
to ask you two.

350
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm meeting her parents this weekend.

351

Can you guys help me figure it out?

352
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,760
What should I bring as a gift?

353
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,040
What kind of family are they?

354
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,200
If I tell you, you'll freak out.

355
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,080
Have you heard of the Li Group?

356
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,040
That's her family's company.

357
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,640
No way!

358
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,680
You're about to join a wealthy family.

359
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,840
Well, in that case,

360
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,840
here's what I think.

361
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,600
Let's just bring some tea.

362
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,400
Tea is always a safe choice.

363
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
They pretty much have everything else.

364
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:01,760
So,

365
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,800
when the time comes,

366
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,160
I'll sneak two tea cakes
from my dad's stash.

367
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,200
But tea isn't exactly surprising.

368
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
How's her grandpa doing?

369
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,120
He's alright.

370
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Why not ask Mr. Huang
for a herbal prescription?

371
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,440
Put it in a nice box,

372
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,080
and wrap it up yourself.

373
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,120
Now that would be unique.

374
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,680
Don't just wing it.

375
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,000
What if their family minds it?

376
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,240
"Sending me medicine now?

377
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,720
Do you mean

378
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,960
I'm too old?"

379
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,680
Honestly,

380
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,960
if you ask me,

381
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,280
you'd better just

382
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
ask your girlfriend properly,

383
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
what does her grandfather want?

384
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,640
I asked her.

385
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,760
She told me just two words,

386
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
"Sincere heart."

387
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,600
Come on.

388
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,560
Get up.

389
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,040
Hello, Mr. Li.

390
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,360
Nice to meet you.

391
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,640
This is a gift for you.

392
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
Oh, young man.

393
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,440
It's even alive!

394
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,840
Hold it properly.

395
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,680
This is quite precious.

396
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
Honestly, I don't dare take it.

397
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,480
Mr. Ma Xiaotiao,

398
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,800
I see you've grown up.

399
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,080
Back in college,

400
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,280
wouldn't you have made me

401
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,840
wear a suit that barely fits,

402
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
and slick my hair back?

403
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,760
It's not like he hasn't done it before.

404
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,880
Go on, keep playing.

405
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,840
I'll watch for you.

406
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
Here, give it a try.

407
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,400
This moves it forward.

408
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,640
Neither of you can do it.

409
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,480
Let me handle it instead.

410
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,680
You do it.

411
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,080
Hey.

412
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Hey, are you ready yet?

413
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm almost there.

414
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Didn't I say you don't have to come?

415
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,080
Such a hassle.

416
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,640
I just wanted to
go gift shopping with you.

417
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,800
Just in case you pick the wrong one.

418
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
No way I'll mess this up.

419
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,840
I've made up my mind.

420
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
Your grandpa wants
a live-in grandson-in-law, right?

421
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
I'll make a flag,

422
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
then carry it on my shoulder,

423
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,840
with big letters saying,

424
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
"I'm the Li family's son-in-law."

425
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
I'll get one for you too,

426
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,760
reading,

427
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,400
"Yes, he is."

428
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,400
After that,

429
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,560
I'll go tell your grandpa,

430
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,200
from now on, whenever I go out,

431
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,400
I'll carry it everywhere, every day,

432
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,000
so everyone knows where I belong.

433
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Isn't that sincere enough?

434
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,560
Alright, I'll remember what you said.

435
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,280
Whoever doesn't carry it is a coward.

436
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,160
Should I wear a tie, you think?

437
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,400
Would that be too formal?

438
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,080
Either way is fine.

439
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,560
My grandpa doesn't care about that.

440
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,400
My grandpa

441
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
has two steps to judge people.

442
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,960
First, he checks your handwriting.

443
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
Second, he watches how you eat.

444
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,280
Grandpa always said,

445
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,040
"Your writing shows your character,

446
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
and eating shows your upbringing."

447
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,840
Well, that's not good.

448
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,080
My handwriting is decent,

449
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,280
but I've never learned dining etiquette.

450
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,400
At my place, we just eat to be full.

451
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,280
So,

452
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
I'm here to help you out.

453
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
Let's grab a meal together first.

454
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,480
I'll give you a quick lesson.

455
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,280
Sounds good.

456
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,880
Thanks for looking out for me.

457
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,280
I'll stop talking for now.

458
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,440
I'll let you know when we're there.

459
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,720
[Li Residence]

460
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,280
Mr. Li.

461
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
What's up?

462
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,760
Mr. Xu, Mr. Fan,
and the others are here.

463
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,360
They've been waiting a while.

464
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,680
[Original Interpretation
of the Analects]

465
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,400
Sorry, sorry.

466
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Thanks for waiting.

467
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,600
Please, have a seat.

468
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Getting old, you know.

469
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,200
I always need a nap after lunch.

470
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,640
Go on, sit down.

471
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,400
Everyone, please take a seat.

472
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,400
Where's Jinghai?

473
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,400
He said he had a meeting.

474
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
He'll be here a bit later.

475
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,280
Oh.

476
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
Everyone showed up today.

477
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,240
What's going on here?

478
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,640
Did someone have an argument?

479
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,240
No, not at all.

480
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,800
It's about the joint expansion.

481
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,200
We all had a meeting about this.

482
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,240
About the investment shares,

483
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,080
they're pretty much the same as before.

484
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Alright.

485
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,480
Mr. Li,

486
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
I thought it was pointless before.

487
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,560
The Li family has always been strong.

488
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,600
It should've been like this all along.

489
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,800
That's not fair to say.

490
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
The Lis got here today,

491
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
thanks to everyone's support
over the years.

492
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,400
It's only right we contribute more.

493
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,680
Mr. Li,

494
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
the shares are settled.

495
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,200
But...

496
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,520
who's going to be
the commander-in-chief?

497
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,760
That's not decided yet.

498
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
Everyone

499
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
has different opinions.

500
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
We wanted to hear your thoughts.

501
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,440
Mr. Xu.

502
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,200
There's no need to ask about this.

503
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,640
Whoever leads, whoever decides.

504
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's perfectly reasonable.

505
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,680
Besides, no matter who

506
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,560
the Lis pick,

507
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,560
Mr. Li is always here to guide us.

508
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
About this matter,

509
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,640
why is it green tea?

510
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,440
Mr. Li, you just woke up.

511
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,640
Something light suits you now.

512
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,280
Let's switch to oolong.

513
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I'm used to that one.

514
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,400
It goes down easy.

515
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Alright, got it.

516
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,800
I've said it before,

517
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,320
when it comes to picking someone,

518
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,760
I won't get involved.

519
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,400
You all talk it over and decide.

520
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,040
Even if it's not a Li family member,

521
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,760
it's not a big deal.

522
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,960
We make decisions and operate together.

523
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
Right?

524
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,160
Since Mr. Li has spoken,

525
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll go first and share my view.

526
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
The mining project is huge.

527
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
During daily operations,

528
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,400
there are so many gray areas.

529
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,560
Letting one person handle it all

530
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,440
just doesn't seem right.

531
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,040
We used to have meetings,

532
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,840
but there was always distance.

533
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,200
If you ask me,

534
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,320
I think we need a new structure.

535
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,840
But before that,

536
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,560
I still suggest one thing.

537
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Let's review the old company accounts.

538
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
Make sure in the new joint venture,

539
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,440
nothing questionable slips in,

540
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,840
like sneaky or dishonest folks.

541
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,840
There's an old saying,

542
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
"When you make tea,
fill it seven-tenths.

543
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,560
Leave the rest for courtesy."

544
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,240
We've all

545
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,640
known each other for years.

546
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You're being a bit harsh
with that remark.

547
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,200
Mr. Li,

548
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,800
everyone knows how I am.

549
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,640
I go after the issue, not the person.

550
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,960
Too harsh or not,

551
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,440
we'll find out once we check.

552
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,080
Well, this...

553
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm sorry.

554
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,280
Uncle, everyone,

555
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,560
sorry, I'm late.

556
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,600
So many seniors here
are waiting for you.

557
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,080
What's so important about your meeting?

558
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
It's something urgent.

559
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,680
The government secretary
of the mining district called me.

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,920
Jinhai has already submitted their bid.

561
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,200
They're trying to compete with us

562
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,160
for the new land's mining rights.

563
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,840
What's going on here?

564
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,200
Didn't the bidding already end?

565
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
We've already signed
our investment intent

566
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,960
with the government.

567
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,520
Why is Jinhai suddenly stepping in?

568
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
I don't know the details.

569
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
But I heard Zhao Xin knows

570
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,720
we haven't signed the official contract.

571
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,160
That's why
he's been sending people to lobby.

572
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,200
Also,

573
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,160
the secretary said

574
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,200
Zhao Xin already promised the minister

575
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,240
that if he gets the mining rights,

576
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,680
he'll thank him personally.

577
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,560
Why is it always Zhao Xin?

578
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,480
I wish I could just
deal with him myself.

579
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,800
And it gets crazier.

580
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,480
Their offer was only a bit higher
than ours.

581
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
But fortunately,

582
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,800
we've always kept up
with government ties,

583
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,280
so it's not beyond saving.

584
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
If necessary,

585
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,800
I'll go to Kalpunia myself

586
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
and set up a meeting with Sang Ke.

587
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
Local officials will have to
show respect.

588
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,400
It has to be you, Mr. Wei.

589
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
My nerves are shot right now.

590
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,080
Everyone, you saw what happened.

591
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,600
Mr. Wei is our real commander-in-chief.

592
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,360
Mr. Qian, I'm flattered.

593
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
I think our top priority now

594
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,960
is to settle the funds quickly

595
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,840
and move forward with the contract,

596
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,000
to keep others from stepping in.

597
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,560
Mr. Fan,

598
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,840
you wanted to check the accounts,

599
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,640
and I'll fully support you,

600
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,400
but now isn't the right time.

601
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,240
Jinhai is watching us closely.

602
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,200
Right now, I think

603
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,000
we should all stick together.

604
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,480
What do you think?

605
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,400
Wei Jinghai,

606
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,280
whether it's the bid

607
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,680
or the contract,

608
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,080
these are all trade secrets.

609
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,280
So how is it that

610
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Jinhai found out about it?

611
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,720
And then you

612
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,560
stepped up to save the day?

613
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,720
Acting all honestly in person,

614
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,960
but scheming behind the scenes.

615
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,960
I've seen it all before.

616
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,320
Honestly,

617
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,400
that was pretty harsh.

618
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,720
But let me ask you this,

619
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,040
have you really never paid money

620
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,000
for a competitor's trade secrets before?

621
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm the CEO of Li Group, after all.

622
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,560
Shouldn't I know how to fix things?

623
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,800
But there's something
I can't figure out.

624
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,960
Why do you keep coming after me?

625
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,560
Did I ever do something to offend you?

626
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,560
Why do you always

627
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,400
push things to the breaking point?

628
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,200
Wei,

629
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,840
don't try your usual tricks on me.

630
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
With a face like yours,

631
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,440
you don't deserve
that kind of attention.

632
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,600
Hai,

633
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,000
watch your words.

634
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,440
My bad.

635
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,440
We're all on the same side here.

636
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,800
Let's just talk it out.

637
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,880
We can work through this.

638
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,360
Grandpa.

639
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
Is he...

640
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,560
Jiadi.

641
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,000
Grandpa, I'll show Jiadi around first.

642
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,800
Go ahead.

643
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,760
Gentlemen, you all keep chatting.

644
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,680
Zhijin.

645
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,200
