[Episode 20]

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,680
What are you thinking about?

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,720
You were personally chosen by Li.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,360
He's not going to eat you.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
You never know though.

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
He probably just saw I was young

8
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,040
and wanted to give me a shot.

9
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,360
Who would've guessed

10
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
he'd put his own granddaughter
on the line.

11
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,320
You're silly.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,520
I already talked to my grandpa.

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,120
He promised not to
ask about backgrounds.

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,000
Just be yourself,

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,040
that's enough.

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,760
Don't try too hard.

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Got it.

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,560
I'll quickly review On Writing again,

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,120
just in case he quizzes me.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
Sounds good.

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,640
Then recite it for me first.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,400
Alright, listen up.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,320
On

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,320

[Li Residence]

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,000
Hello, Zhijin.

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Why am I a little nervous now?

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,760
Now that you mention it, me too.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,360
Weren't there supposed to be guests?

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,720
Maybe we should wait a bit.

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,920
We should go up and say hi first.

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
Let me take a look at you.

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
You look great. Let's go.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Hai,

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,320
watch your words.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
My bad.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
We're all on the same side here.

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,480
Let's just talk it out.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,200
We can work through this.

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,920
Grandpa.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,000
Is he...

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,760
Jiadi.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,040
Zhao.

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,480
Grandpa, I'll show Jiadi around first.

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,520
Go ahead.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
Gentlemen, you all keep chatting.

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Zhijin.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
Wait up.

49
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,120
Fan.

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,800
You just keep watching me all day.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,960
Are you that sure about your judgment?

52
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280
Maybe you trust yourself too much.

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,120
Come on, tell me.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,040
Who is he?

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,240
Jinghai.

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,160
What do you mean by that?

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Finish what you started.

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,280
Fine, I'll just say it myself.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Mr. Li.

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
Nice to meet you.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
Didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,320
My name is Zhao Jiadi.

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm from Tang City.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm Jinhai Zhao Xin's son.

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,720
What did you say?

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
Zhao Xin?

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,840
Zhao Xin.

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,160
Zhijin.

69
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Are you aware of that?

70
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
Grandpa.

71
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,400
I do know it all.

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,960
But Jiadi,

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,120
he's already at odds with his family.

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,480
His best friend

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
almost lost his life because of his dad.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,240
He's not like what you think.

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,600
Zhijin,

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,960
some people are desperate
to get close to you

79
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
and to approach the NCC.

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,480
Do you know he...

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Just keep quiet.

82
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,800
Stop making things worse.

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,640
Hey, young man,

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,240
let me ask you something.

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
When you met Liu Xin,

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
did you know

87
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
I'm with the Chamber of Commerce?

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,160
Yeah, I knew.

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
You were running around for me.

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
When I brought you to dinner,

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
did you realize

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,960
we were competing with Jinhai?

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Yes, I knew.

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
Fan, seriously.

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
No wonder Zhao Xin

96
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,720
knows so much

97
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,960
about our business secrets?

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,120
It's all because of you!

99
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
You've been way too careless!

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,640
Don't blame Fan for this.

101
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,720
He was tricked by someone shady.

102
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,360
If it were you instead,

103
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,040
the mine would've been taken too.

104
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,000
Stop talking nonsense here!

105
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,960
All of you, quiet!

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,080
Fan.

107
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,240
Go on, say it.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
You're something else.

109
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,560
Mr. Zhao.

110
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,600
You can't stay here anymore.

111
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,080
Please leave.

112
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,160
Grandpa.

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,680
Does his name matter that much?

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
He's just speaking for himself.

115
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,680
Please don't treat him like this.

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,920
Yan, take Zhijin back to her room.

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm not going.

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm not going back.

119
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,680
Zhijin.

120
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Mr. Li.

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,880
Fan,

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
I'll say my piece and then leave.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm Zhao Xin's son.

124
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
I didn't choose

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,120
this background.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
And I can't run from it either.

127
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,880
Me, Zhao Jiadi,

128
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,680
came to Hang City

129
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,960
to start from scratch.

130
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,360
I earned everything

131
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,880
through my own effort.

132
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
I never twisted the truth.

133
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
I never played both sides.

134
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,440
I've never done anything shady.

135
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
And I never wronged anyone.

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
Scheming and plotting,

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,160
that's not who I am.

138
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,440
I don't know

139
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,880
what happened between you and Zhao Xin,

140
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,280
but it's exactly because I don't know

141
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,400
that I couldn't be honest with you.

142
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
I don't want to feel out of place

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,560
because of someone else's burdens.

144
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Everyone here is a respected elder.

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,760
You all know the art of reading people.

146
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,520
To understand is to question the heart,

147
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
the action,

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,800
not the origin.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
I've never been

150
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,320
anyone's shadow.

151
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,160
If I didn't do it,

152
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,320
I won't take the blame.

153
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm here today to visit you,

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
not to stir up trouble.

155
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,480
Sorry for any trouble caused.

156
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,080
I hope this doesn't affect

157
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,360
your ties.

158
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,840
Jiadi,

159
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,800
blood is thicker than water.

160
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,320
Don't make your grandpa choose sides.

161
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
If it's going nowhere,

162
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't want to even start.

163
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,560
I don't want to get hurt,

164
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,800
or lose anything again.

165
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,760
Then promise me something too.

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,360
If one day,

167
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,960
I ask for your name,

168
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
your family, your past,

169
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
you have to tell me.

170
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,320
Because by then,

171
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
I'm ready

172
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,240
to step into your world.

173
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,440
Just two things.

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,760
The Zhao family name
came from my grandpa.

175
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
I can't give it back to you.

176
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
From here on out,

177
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,080
you do you,

178
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,040
and I'll do me.

179
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
I dreamed we'd go hiking together.

180
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,040
It started out in daylight.

181
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,920
We kept walking and it got dark.

182
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,440
Then, all of a sudden, you vanished.

183
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
I can't figure it out.

184
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,200
Why would we

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,840
turn down an entrepreneur

186
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,520
who wants real change?

187
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,800
A favor,

188
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,520
or a friend.

189
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,520
You matter more than the favor.

190
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,480
There's so much I want to ask you.

191
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,040
Are you ready for this?

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,080

The color already looks great,

380
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,800
and it smells pretty authentic.

381
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,640
Go on.

382
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,320
We met back up north before.

383
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,160
Let's just say,

384
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,000
I owe him a favor.

385
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,840
He wants to use me to meet you.

386
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,440
How much does he know about you?

387
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Like the underground casino,

388
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
he hasn't found out, right?

389
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,920
No way.

390
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,160
It's well hidden.

391
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
Sharing the mining rights info

392
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,320
with Zhao Xin

393
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,760
was actually a risky move.

394
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,840
Lately,

395
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
I can't afford any mistakes.

396
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,960
Shut down your underground casino

397
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,720
for now.

398
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,840
Don't let it interfere.

399
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,520
It's already closed.

400
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,440
So this time,

401
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,840
the commander-in-chief thing

402
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,680
can be considered done, right?

403
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,080
We're putting Zhao Jiadi out front

404
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,120
as a shield this time.

405
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,480
It's just a way to buy some time.

406
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
In the end, it's up to Mr. Li.

407
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,600
You know how it is.

408
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,600
So,

409
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,120
Fan... Fan Longquan...

410
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,240
Fan Longquan just won't let go.

411
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,160
I heard he's been digging around

412
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,640
the mining site nonstop.

413
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,080
That guy,

414
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,040
seriously...

415
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,640
Huang Ruiyang...

416
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,240
Are we still meeting him?

417
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,160
Sure.

418
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,000
I know he's close with Zhao Xin,

419
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,880
but let him wait a bit first.

420
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Some people just want a seat
at the big table.

421
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,560
It's not that simple.

422
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,920
Fan.

423
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,040
Need your signature here.

424
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,400
News from the mining site again.

425
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,320
We've found

426
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,200
the suppliers.

427
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,120
But,

428
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,720
they won't share the accounts with us.

429
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,760
I think we should

430
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,880
try something else.

431
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,600
We can't count on them anyway.

432
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,480
I brought in someone new

433
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,440
and told him to handle it
in a different way.

434
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,920
By the way,

435
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,160
keep an eye on the company's packages.

436
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,120
If anything comes from the mining site,

437
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,200
bring it straight to me.

438
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,880
Fan, you seem off lately.

439
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,040
Is it because of

440
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Zhao Jiadi?

441
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,080
You should get back to work.

442
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,360
Alright.

443
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
Let me just say one last thing.

444
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
I think that young man

445
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
is actually decent.

446
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Lan.

447
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,600
[Shen Yulan, Fan Longquan's wife]

448
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,960
Fan.

449
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,320
What brings you here?

450
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,120
I was passing by after shopping.

451
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Thought I'd drop in.

452
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,400
Where's Hu?

453
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Mom's looking after him.

454
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,800
I made a lunchbox for Hu

455
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,040
and brought one for you too.

456
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,960
Good thing Zhu left earlier.

457
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,160
Otherwise, if he'd seen this,

458
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,920
he would have teased me.

459
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
No way, come on.

460
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,520
They've been with you for years.

461
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,600
Can't they tell

462
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,040
you've always been a kid

463
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,840
at heart?

464
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Only you can tell.

465
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,080
Last night, you thought I was asleep,

466
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,160
and you sat on the sofa all night.

467
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Wasn't that exhausting?

468
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,440
Not really.

469
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,080
Come here, let me massage you.

470
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,480
Fan,

471
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,200
you really can't hide your temper.

472
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,600
If you were mad,

473
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
he would've exploded already.

474
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,840
The reason you couldn't sleep

475
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,520
was probably guilt, right?

476
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Let me take a guess.

477
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,760
Is it about

478
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,800
that genius kid

479
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,920
you mentioned before?

480
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,080
What's done is done.

481
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,600
What's the point

482
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,840
of saying all this?

483
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,000
At first, I was really mad,

484
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,920
but after thinking it through,

485
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,760
I realized I'm not good at much.

486
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,680
But as for reading people,

487
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,760
I've never misjudged anyone.

488
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,280
It's just that back then,

489
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,320
I shouldn't have reacted that way.

490
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,720
So?

491
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,800
There's just too much
mixed up in all this.

492
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,160
It's impossible to sort it all out,

493
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,520
and no matter how much I regret it,

494
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,240
I guess that's just how it is.

495
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,480
How could it be?

496
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,320
Things might stay tangled,

497
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
but your heart won't.

498
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
He's been through so much.

499
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
Imagine how much that hurts.

500
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,320
He needs to know

501
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,440
what you're thinking right now.

502
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,840
Even if you part ways,

503
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,360
you should leave on good terms.

504
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,600
Wang.

505
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,040
About Zhao Jiadi,

506
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,000
what's your decision?

507
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
I gave him

508
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,160
a few days off.

509
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,960
Just a heads-up for you,

510
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,880
Zhao Jiadi

511
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,760
is a hot potato now.

512
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,840
Han Xuedong, to be honest,

513
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,760
I used to find you annoying.

514
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
But now I feel like

515
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,840
you're getting a bit shameless.

516
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,120
Zhao Jiadi is with Risheng.

517
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,990
Even if the Li family has the reach,

518
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,320
they can't touch here.

519
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,160
Wang Qihan, what do you take me for?

520
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,520
No matter how cold I seem,

521
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,960
I have to protect Zhao
for the sake of profit.

522
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,760
With Jufeng here,

523
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,720
Zhao Jiadi is our money-maker.

524
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm just worried about you,

525
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,920
messing up things with Mr. Li.

526
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

527
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,120
What's so funny?

528
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,280
Hurry up and apologize to me.

529
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
You really have no shame.

530
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,360
After all these years as friends,

531
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
don't act like

532
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,360
you don't care.

533
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,600
I'm still a shareholder here.

534
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,760
I'm one of the partners too.

535
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,720
Isn't that right?

536
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,560
At least show me some respect.

537
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,680
I'm here to discuss business today,

538
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,200
not to beg you for anything.

539
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,400
Jiadi, you look tired.

540
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Take a break. I'll handle the rest.

541
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,560
No rush at all.

542
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,680
I'm not tired.

543
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,240
Sweating a bit actually wakes me up.

544
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,280
It's great having a courtyard like this.

545
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,920
You can plant whatever you want here.

546
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
Maybe raise some small animals later.

547
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,640
I picked the tea leaves

548
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,200
on the back hill.

549
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,920
Try some.

550
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,440
Alright.

551
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,720
That's good tea.

552
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Mr. Huang,

553
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,240
what kind of seeds are those?

554
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,720
Oh, these? Radish seeds.

555
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,800
They can be planted
in fall and winter.

556
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,960
Fall and winter radishes
are even more valuable.

557
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,000
The extra touch of frost

558
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,240
helps radishes grow.

559
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,400
That's why older folks always say,

560
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
"frost-touched radishes
are as precious as ginseng."

561
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,880
People say talent is worth gold.

562
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,520
But for radish,

563
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,320
life is just too unpredictable.

564
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,800
Fate has other plans.

565
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,920
When I was in my teens,

566
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,920
I joined the Boatmen's Guild
as a boatman.

567
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
Once you're on the boat,

568
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,480
your life belongs to the sea.

569
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,840
If you die,

570
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,920
that's just how it goes.

571
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,440
If you make it, it's another year.

572
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,800
I did that for six years,

573
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,040
saved every bit I could,

574
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,920
and bought my very first boat.

575
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,920
It was small and barely held together.

576
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,920
But then,

577
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,960
the first deal

578
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,600
made me lose everything I had

579
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
and ended up deep in debt.

580
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,560
So what could I do?

581
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Just had to tough it out.

582
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,080
Kept going until today.

583
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
And now, it's a big enterprise.

584
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,840
Life is full of surprises.

585
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,160
I'm not talking about regret,

586
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,680
but about a new chance.

587
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,520
Once you pick a path,

588
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,520
stick with it, no matter what.

589
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
Only when you believe,

590
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,520
can you make things happen.

591
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,200
I'll grab you some fresh tea.

592
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,360
Take it with you, okay?

593
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,240
Alright.

You two,

don't just stand at the door.

Go walk around the yard too.

I'll stay here and keep an eye out.

No need to thank me.
