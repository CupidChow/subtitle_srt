00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
Where did you go?

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,960
Mr. Wei,

5
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,000
are you looking for someone?

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,920
Who are you?

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,880
I'm Huang Ruiyang from Jinhai.

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,240
We scheduled a meeting before.

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
Don't you remember?

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,040
I do.

11
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Mr. Wei.

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,200
It's about time we met, don't you think?

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,920
Sure.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,480
We have to meet.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,160
Alright.

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
I'll wait for your message.

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,960
Huang.

18
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Rui.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Yang.

20
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Mr. Wei.

21
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
You really picked a great spot.

22
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
"The water glitters,
blending into the horizon's blue.

23
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,480
Behind those doors,
there's gold and wine."

24
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,440
Honestly, I like this place a lot.

25
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,880
It's so comfortable here.

26
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
Mr. Huang, you have good taste.

27
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,960
It's yours

28
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,160
if you want it.

29
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,160
I can't afford to keep it.

30
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,120
I'll cover the cost.

31
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,800
I can't accept it for nothing.

32
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Ruiyang.

33
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,720
Honestly, I didn't plan to
meet you before.

34
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
But seeing you today,

35
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,480
there's this

36
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,280
strange kind of

37
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,880
familiarity with you.

38
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,160
Now that you mention it,

39
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
I do feel a bit of that too,

40
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,440
like I really belong here.

41
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,920
Wish we'd met sooner.

42
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,560
Zhao Xin wouldn't be where he is today

43
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
without your sister.

44
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,200
But Zhao Xin didn't promote you,

45
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
did he?

46
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,720
Go on.

47
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,000
The family runs deep.

48
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
If I were you,

49
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
I'd look out for

50
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Zhao Yange too.

51
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,720
But with Zhao Jiadi in the way,

52
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
it always feels tough, right?

53
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,920
Wish we'd met sooner.

54
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,840
Where's Chen Zhuhe?

55
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
He's on the boat.

56
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,360
Let me handle Chen Zhuhe.

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,600
You know Chen Zhuhe,

58
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,240
he spills everything when drunk.

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,320
Worried I know too much already?

60
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,440
What do you want?

61
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,480
People risk it all for money,

62
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,600
just like birds do for food.

63
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm Huang Ruiyang,

64
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,040
but I'm not greedy.

65
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,120
If you're really sincere,

66
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,920
and you want

67
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,880
Chen Zhuhe alive,

68
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
I can have him brought back to you,

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,520
or,

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
I'll send you a photo

71
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,600
as proof.

72
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,840
Ruiyang, I respect your guts.

73
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
If it's money you're after,

74
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
work with me.

75
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
I'll make sure that you'll be able to

76
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,280
set up on your own soon.

77
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,480
You'll never need to
answer Zhao Xin again.

78
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Tell me more.

79
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,160
The NCC

80
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,080
just got a new mine in Kalpunia,

81
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll be the commander-in-chief.

82
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,120
Then we can work together.

83
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,520
Mr. Wei,

84
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,520
that's not very genuine.

85
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,440
I heard the new commander-in-chief

86
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,560
will be Li himself.

87
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,360
He is just a figurehead.

88
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,680
He's getting on in years.

89
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,440
I'll handle the real work.

90
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,360
You're the one handling it for real.

91
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,280
So, basically...

92
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,480
Basically...

93
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,840
Sorry about that, Mr. Wei.

94
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
You're just too charming.

95
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Mr. Wei, here's the thing.

96
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,520
Let me lay it out for you.

97
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
Zhang Dongfeng,

98
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
whom you call

99
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
Mr. Jiao.

100
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,360
I haven't seen him in days,
now he's Mr. Jiao.

101
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Back when he was up the north,

102
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,360
he used to follow me around,

103
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,160
so to me,

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
he's an open book.

105
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
This thing here,

106
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,160
he didn't tell you about it, right?

107
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
I probably know your situation

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
better than you do now.

109
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,520
Back when Jinhai wanted
into the mining zone,

110
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,040
you used the Li family's money
and contacts to buy off Sang Ke

111
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,240
and set a bunch of traps for Xin.

112
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm here today to clean up

113
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
all those messes you left behind.

114
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
Ever since you were little,

115
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,800
you've lived with the Lis.

116
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Everyone always thought

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,880
you

118
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
were the future leader of the Lis.

119
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,280
You were given such a great hand,

120
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,440
and you still managed to

121
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,000
mess it all up.

122
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,960
That granddaughter from the Li family.

123
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,440
You had a real advantage before.

124
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
But look at you now,

125
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,720
you lost everything.

126
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,480
Also,

127
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,280
those 50 tons

128
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
of raw amber you lost

129
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
and

130
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,520
the fake customs clearance contract
and such

131
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
were all found by Xin.

132
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,680
It's all on Chen Zhuhe's boat.

133
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,560
The timing should be about right.

134
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
By now, Chen Zhuhe probably

135
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,280
has been caught already.

136
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,120
Let me give you some advice.

137
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
How does it go again?

138
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,200
"It's not easy for a dog

139
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,760
to join the owner's table."

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,440
Yeah.

141
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,120
It's not easy for a dog
to join the owner's table.

142
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
But first, you need to figure out

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
who's the owner

144
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,600
and who's the dog.

145
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,520
Looks sharp.

146
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,280
Mr. Li,

147
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
it's getting chilly.

148
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,960
Let's head inside.

149
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,880
Spread the word.

150
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,920
Tomorrow,

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm going back to the company.

152
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,120
Alright.

153
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,880
I'm feeling much better.

154
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,720
Don't worry about me.

155
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,640
Stay with Grandpa.

156
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
Sweetheart,

157
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,600
I know it's hard for you too.

158
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
If you can't sleep tonight,

159
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
promise you'll call me.

160
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,920
I'll be here for you.

161
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,400
Zhu Hongzhi.

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,720
Jiadi.

163
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,760
I need a favor from you.

164
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,920
Go on.

165
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
My dad might be missing.

166
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,560
It's probably because of my mess.

167
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,880
Those debt collectors won't stop.

168
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,440
So I think...

169
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,360
I get it.

170
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
But guessing won't help with the police.

171
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,400
They already covered up
the casino thing.

172
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,200
Even if he's been taken away,

173
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,560
it won't be easy to find him.

174
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,200
- I'll go find him.
- Zhu Hongzhi!

175
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,480
Go home first. I'll handle it.

176
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
You just got out.

177
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
Don't make more trouble for your dad.

178
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,440
[Li Residence]

179
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,080
Mr. Li.

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You've been sitting here a long time.

181
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,200
Maybe it's time to get moving.

182
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,720
Yan,

183
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
do you think I did the right thing?

184
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,720
If he's gone,

185
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,560
there's no coming back.

186
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
Did I let Mingyi down?

187
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,840
I just...

188
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,800
I...

189
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,960
I really don't know anymore.

190
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,760
Guess that's what happens with age.

191
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,240
I'm getting more sentimental.

192
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,920
I just can't let go.

193
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
I really can't let go.

194
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,400
Take care of yourself.

195
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Hai,

196
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,760
Mr. Li is resting.

197
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,200
Please wait here a moment.

198
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll go let him know.

199
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
You go in first.

200
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,120
Uncle.

201
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,960
Ancient Large-Leaf Tea.

202
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,440
Your favorite.

203
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Have a seat.

204
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,960
Uncle.

205
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,360
How have you been?

206
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I tear up in the wind.
I must be getting old.

207
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm here today to ask your advice.

208
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
With such major staff changes,

209
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
why wasn't I informed at all?

210
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,880
When branches get too dense,
you trim them,

211
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,280
or the trunk won't grow right.

212
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,520
But junior Yan and Gu Xiao,

213
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,600
have worked with me
since the Sales Department,

214
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,840
all the way till now.

215
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,720
After what you've done,

216
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,040
do I even have a place left here?

217
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,120
Branches can be trimmed,

218
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,360
but the roots stay put.

219
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,880
Hai,

220
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
there's something I need to tell you.

221
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm listening.

222
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,640
I've made a new decision.

223
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,920
Here it is.

224
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,080
This is a ticket to Kalpunia.

225
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,360
You'll be in charge of
the company there.

226
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,960
Unless you hear from me,

227
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,120
don't come back.

228
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,920
Uncle,

229
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,520
I've been General Manager
for five years.

230
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,560
You know how much

231
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,240
we've grown.

232
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,960
Sometimes,

233
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
I did bend the rules,

234
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,000
but I never hurt the company.

235
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,080
So what is this now?

236
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,760
Just throwing me away?

237
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,760
Or are you scared that Chen Zhuhe's mess

238
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,920
will drag the company down?

239
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,080
Are you cutting me loose early
to protect yourself?

240
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,440
Do you really think that I cared

241
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,840
about you moving the money?

242
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
I have people in the company's finance.

243
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,440
I know how many accounts

244
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
you've faked.

245
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
My standards for you

246
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,040
have always been different from others.

247
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
But this time,

248
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,000
my boy,

249
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
you crossed the line.

250
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,080
Even now, I don't want to believe

251
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
you're involved in
what happened to Longquan.

252
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,520
But

253
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
I own the Fan family

254
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
an explanation.

255
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Letting you leave early

256
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
not a banishment.

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,920
Do you get that?

258
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,120
Uncle,

259
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,960
if you think

260
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,000
this is all about me,

261
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,160
leaving won't fix anything.

262
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,720
Would you be willing to help me again?

263
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
I still have big plans for the company.

264
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,680
As long as you're willing to step in,

265
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I know I can get through this safely.

266
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,240
When the time comes, I'll take down

267
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
your old rival, Zhao Xin.

268
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
When I marry Zhijin,

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,320
I'll bring Jinhai along

270
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,720
as a wedding gift for you.

271
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,880
From then on,

272
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,880
Zhijin will lead the Li Group,

273
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,720
and I'll stay by your side,

274
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
looking after you
in your later years.

275
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,560
How does that sound?

276
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,280
I still remember,

277
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,080
when you first brought me
to the company,

278
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
you told me,

279
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,400
"Hai,

280
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,720
I'll be tougher on you
than anyone else."

281
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,200
Why is that?

282
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,920
It's because you treated me
like your own son.

283
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,320
I still remember
when I signed my first deal,

284
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,200
you told me,

285
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
"Work hard.

286
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
One day, I'll trust you
with the Li Group."

287
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
But after all this time,

288
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,320
you haven't kept a single promise.

289
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,160
Didn't you say

290
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,080
you'd raise me like your own son?

291
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,480
If I called you "dad" now,

292
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,240
would you even accept it?

293
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,920
Then let's do this your way.

294
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,320
Let's talk business.

295
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,400
I can't take
the company's shares with me.

296
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,560
But when it comes to the technology,

297
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,080
the talent,

298
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,200
the clients,

299
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,200
I can take those with me.

300
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,200
If it really comes to that,

301
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
you'll be holding onto an empty shell.

302
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,120
There's really no point in that.

303
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,200
Can't believe
you have this on your mind.

304
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
I learned it all from you.

305
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
Always talking about
morality and righteousness,

306
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,160
but never leaving your rivals a chance.

307
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,720
You taught me by example.

308
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,560
Honestly, I just picked up a bit.

309
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,240
Alright.

310
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,320
Alright.

311
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,360
It's good to clear the air.

312
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Over all these years,

313
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,040
when it comes to you,

314
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,240
I owe you nothing.

315
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,120
If you've made up your mind,

316
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,680
then go ahead and do it.

317
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,120
Let's see if this old body of mine

318
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,600
can take it or not.

319
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,120
Just now, you said

320
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,400
you owe me nothing.

321
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Alright, sure.

322
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,920
Let me ask you something.

323
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,640
Back when you started your business,

324
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,040
wasn't it Mingyi's ideas and technology?

325
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
So tell me,

326
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,320
how did he go from business partner

327
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,880
to working under you?

328
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,120
Wei Mingyi was too naive.

329
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,840
Just too trusting.

330
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,920
He believed everything you said.

331
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,080
He shouldn't have let business

332
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,080
get in the way of friendship.

333
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
What did you do back then?

334
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,680
While Wei Mingyi was drowning in debt,

335
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,280
how coincident was it

336
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,520
that he just happened to
land in the hospital?

337
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
You know how people

338
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,280
used to come after debts, right?

339
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,600
Branding on the chest with iron tongs,

340
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,720
heated until they glowed.

341
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,480
I didn't see it with my own eyes.

342
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,080
When those people
came to collect the debt,

343
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,720
Wei Mingyi...

344
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,840
Wei Mingyi used to lock me in a room.

345
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,760
So I never actually saw it,

346
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
but I could hear everything!

347
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,560
I could hear it all...

348
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,440
No wonder you like bamboo.

349
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
It looks so strong and upright,

350
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,400
like it stands for what's right.

351
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,200
But inside, it's hollow.

352
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,280
Tell me,

353
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
isn't that kind of fake?

354
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,560
Hai,

355
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,520
when you first got here,

356
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,520
you were twelve.

357
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,200
You walked in and told me,

358
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
"Uncle Li,

359
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,120
I don't have a home anymore."

360
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,360
My boy,

361
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,400
sincerely,

362
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,560
I raised you with care all these years.

363
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,040
I never imagined

364
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,880
you actually resented me so much.

365
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,440
You held it in for twenty-one years.

366
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,680
I always planned to hand this family

367
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,080
over to you,

368
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
Hai.

369
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,920
I do owe something

370
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
to Wei Mingyi,

371
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,920
but it's not what you think.

372
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,400
It's a sixteen-year friendship,

373
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,280
don't misinterpret it.

374
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,280
I failed,

375
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
and I failed badly.

376
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,640
I had no idea you felt this way.

377
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,320
My boy,

378
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,240
I guess this is

379
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,880
as far as we go.

380
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,520
It ends today.

381
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,960
That's it.

382
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,560
Mr. Li.

383
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
What's wrong?

384
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,600
Call 120, hurry!

385
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,960
The real show is just starting,

386
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,440
Dad.

387
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,840
I really regret it.

388
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,160
I should've called the police sooner.

389
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,120
But I've already said everything I know

390
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,040
and given my statement.

391
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,520
From here on,

392
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,800
let the police handle it.

393
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,760
Honestly, at that time,

394
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,480
I didn't hear anything unusual.

395
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,080
This Mr. Jiao

396
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
is really sly.

397
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I had Ms. Cai's people
tail them yesterday,

398
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,960
but they lost them halfway.

399
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,880
I suspect where you were held

400
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,360
is their current hideout.

401
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,400
Lan,

402
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,200
any news from the driver?

403
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,560
I called Officer He this morning.

404
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,840
He said if there's an update,

405
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,240
he'll let us know right away.

406
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,120
Now Uncle Li
has made his position clear,

407
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
so the investigation Fan insisted on

408
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
will surely yield an outcome.

409
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Let me take this call.

410
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,120
Alright.

411
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,440
Zhijin.

412
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,920
What?

413
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,960
Uncle Yan.

414
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,560
You're here.

415
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,000
Doctor,

416
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,880
how's my grandpa doing now?

417
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,040
Mr. Li had a sudden brain bleed,

418
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,160
but he got to the hospital in time.

419
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,440
We've done everything we can.

420
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,760
Next,

421
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,360
he needs to be monitored for 48 hours.

422
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,480
Is there any more bleeding

423
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,520
happening now?

424
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,160
Wasn't everything fine this morning?

425
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,600
How did things change so fast?

426
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,040
Sweetheart.

427
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,160
Sweetheart, hey, sweetheart.

428
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,600
How many people do you want to hurt?

429
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,360
What are you trying to do?

430
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,160
This is a hospital, don't fight here.

431
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,360
If you fight, I'll call the police!

432
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,720
You're here just in time.

433
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,480
Uncle Li's been hospitalized.

434
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,880
So I have to run the chamber.

435
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,360
Go back and tell Shen Yulan,

436
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,480
the mine's operation rights

437
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,160
are about to expire soon.

438
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,440
I need a clear answer from you.

439
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,960
Are you in or out?

440
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,280
You have until tomorrow to decide.

441
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,880
Otherwise,

442
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,920
I'll have to find another company

443
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,000
and replace your team.

444
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Wei Jinghai,

445
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,920
you're running out of time.

446
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,040
Enjoy your freedom while it lasts.

447
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,560
[Emergency Room]

448
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,920
Don't be upset.

449
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,080
Everything will get better.

450
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,000
Jiadi,

451
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,840
I...

452
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
Zhu,

453
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,160
let's go downstairs and talk.

454
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,720
Come on.

455
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Zhu,

456
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,800
you heard what Lan said.

457
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,760
I feel the same way.

458
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,440
We don't need to bow to Wei Jinghai.

459
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,080
Right now, Li Group

460
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,000
is all run by Wei Jinghai alone.

461
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,360
It's no use for Zhijin
to return to the company.

462
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,520
If we had time, maybe it'd be fine.

463
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
But we don't.

464
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
The payment for the mining rights
is due soon.

465
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,840
At this moment,

466
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,200
we can't just back out, right?

467
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,760
Zhu,

468
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,560
is there a way
to talk to their government?

469
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,320
I want to set up a new joint venture

470
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,480
and bid for the mining rights
against Wei Jinghai.

471
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,960
Bid again from scratch?

472
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,520
Actually,

473
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,680
Mr. Xu and the Minister of Mining

474
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,720
have a good relationship.

475
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,160
They can talk things out.

476
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,280
But asking him

477
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,400
to stop working with Li Group

478
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,200
is almost impossible.

479
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
Besides,

480
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,960
without Li Group,

481
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,760
we can't come up with that much money.

482
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,880
I'll go talk to Mr. Xu.

483
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,320
Lan.

484
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,200
Lan.

485
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Our families go way back.

486
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,480
That should help a lot.

487
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,520
Jiadi,

488
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,600
I'm with you on this.

489
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,480
I've prepared myself.

490
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,160
We're not backing down.

491
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,520
Do what you need to do.

492
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,400
Thanks, Lan.

493
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,400
Zhu,

494
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,320
I'm not acting on impulse.

495
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,440
Did you see Wei Jinghai today?

496
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,520
He wasn't as calm as usual.

497
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,360
The mining rights deadline is close.

498
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Normally,

499
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,720
no one would want more trouble now.

500
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,640
Wei Jinghai wants
to get through this period safely

501
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,360
more than anyone else.

502
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
He's been hung up on the mining rights.

503
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,560
But now, at this moment,

504
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,600
he's desperate
to push the Fan family out.

505
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,520
There's got to be more to this.

506
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,120
But we're racing against time too.

507
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,400
Instead of wasting time with him,

508
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,360
why not just keep it simple?

509
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Let's handle it ourselves.

510
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
Alright.

511
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
You've got my support.

512
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,600
Lan,

513
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,120
Mr. Xu's stand is crucial here.

514
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,840
Zhu,

515
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,360
you and I will sort out the money.

516
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,360
Let's start with the company's partners

517
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,560
and your own network.

518
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,720
I'll handle finance firms and banks.

519
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,040
Basically, let's try

520
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,560
every idea we can think of.

521
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,280
Let's call it

522
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,400
a do-or-die moment.

523
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,960
