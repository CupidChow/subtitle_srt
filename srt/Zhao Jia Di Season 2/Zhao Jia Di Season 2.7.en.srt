00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,110
Alright, let's cut to the chase.

4
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
Sign with me.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,360
I'll help you
package and apply for the competitions.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
If you play a full year of tournaments,

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
you could earn over a hundred million.

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,910
We split it ninety to ten.

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
Thanks, but pro Go isn't for me.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,310
I get one, you get nine.

11
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,150
It's not about the money.

12
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,310
With your talent,

13
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,110
it's a shame to let it go to waste.

14
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,400
It'd be such a loss.

15
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,270
I know a top former national player.

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,560
He's looking for a student now.

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,950
Want me to introduce you?

18
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,270
He already has a teacher.

19
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,950
You should answer your phone first.

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,430
Seems pretty urgent.

21
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
About what I told you,

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,430
think it over carefully.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,950
Take your time with it.

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,430
Ying can be pretty direct.

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Don't take it to heart.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,680
It's okay.

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,950
I haven't

28
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,630
thanked you yet.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
As long as I didn't slow you down.

30
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you free this afternoon?

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
I've got plans later.

32
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,790
Do you need something?

33
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,790
It's nothing major.

34
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,310
Well,

35
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,080
I still owe you a thank-you gift.

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,240
I figured a book would be best,

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
and I thought
you could pick one yourself.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,310
Thank you, Ms. Jiang.

39
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,560
I actually need to buy books
in Hang City.

40
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,520
I'll send you the address then.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,840
Have you decided to head to Hang City?

42
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,270
Thanks to Mr. Jiang's recommendation letter,

43
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,680
I got an interview at Risheng.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,910
I should be leaving
in a couple of days.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,000
You're only in your twenties.

46
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,270
This is such a crucial time
in your life.

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,000
Finance might not be what you expect.

48
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,400
It can get pretty dull.

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,200
It can gradually make you rigid.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
That doesn't sound like

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,000
an English teacher talking.

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,950
Throughout one's life,

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,150
who decides what's important,

54
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,880
and what's not, anyway?

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,470
We all end up the same in the end.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
So just do what you want.

57
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,630
It's never the world that's rigid.

58
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,080
It's our minds.

59
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,590
Some people can only find peace
in the mountains,

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,910
while others find calm
in the city chaos.

61
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,000
It's the same idea.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,720
Can I run something by you?

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,560
Go ahead.

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,560
We're friends now, right?

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
So, stop calling me "miss".

66
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,430
No problem.

67
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,560
Is she your girlfriend?

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
No, she's not.

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,400
We're just online friends.

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
We met in a finance group years ago.

71
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,560
"Where can I gaze upon the Divine Land?

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,110
Panoramic views from

73
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,720
Beigu Tower unfold.

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
Rise and fall through ages grand...

75
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,310
Sun Quan led ten-thousand men at youth....

76
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,270
an army of ten-thousand men..."

77
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,360
"Sun Quan led an army of
ten-thousand men at youth.

78
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,400
Firmly holding the Southeast,
warfare never ceased."

79
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,310
I finally learned how to say "army".

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,430
But you'll never be a hero.

81
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,160
[My beloved father, Wei Mingyi]

82
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
You left without looking back,

83
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
pretty decisive.

84
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,750
But you left a mess behind for me.

85
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
I had no choice
but to stay with the Lis.

86
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,750
Now I have to come visit you
every month,

87
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,110
just to show Li Minxian I care.

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
He has been...

89
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,470
putting on more airs lately.

90
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,950
Thinking back,
the Li family's first pot of gold

91
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,400
was all thanks to your help.

92
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,470
But in the end,

93
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,080
it all came to nothing.

94
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,910
They've made it big now,

95
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,950
but all you got is one comment.

96
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,270
You were a good guy.

97
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,590
But from this matter,

98
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,240
I've learned something important.

99
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,240
People

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,430
either get used by money

101
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
or by affections.

102
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,910
If you're the first to show your heart,

103
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,110
you'll end up as just a pawn.

104
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,680
I'm alive

105
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,880
just to win.

106
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,630
I'll get everything

107
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,270
they took from you back

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,310
one by one.

109
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,750
When it's finally all done,

110
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,680
maybe I'll ask Zhao Xin for you,

111
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,790
see if he still remembers

112
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,680
who Wei Mingyi is.

113
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,560
I'll come see you again next month.

114
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,000
Coward Dad.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
I checked on what you asked me to do.

116
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,310
It's just like you guessed.

117
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,000
Wei Jinghai is the son of an old friend.

118
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,080
Li Minxian raised him.

119
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,750
I've known Wei Mingyi for years.

120
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,240
I've never heard of

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,110
him getting married and having a kid.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,880
If I hadn't seen that boy's eyes,

123
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,470
I wouldn't even dare think about it.

124
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,430
If I'd known it,

125
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,000
I would've brought him back

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,110
as I did to Dongcao.

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
Dongcao knows what's right.

128
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
She's got kindness in her heart.

129
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,080
But not everyone is like her.

130
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,430
After all these years in business,

131
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,750
few people have moved me,

132
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,400
but Wei Mingyi is one of them.

133
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,360
Back when Mr. Qi was in trouble,

134
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,310
I was left

135
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,430
no other choice.

136
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,880
Back then, I thought,

137
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,910
after things settled down,

138
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,880
I'd take everything I had and find him.

139
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,360
But who could've thought...

140
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,630
You've sent Fu Fang and the others
to the mining site.

141
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,630
Can you really trust them?

142
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,400
Uncle,

143
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,790
I entered the mining site for business,

144
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,360
not to stir up any fights.

145
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,680
As long as that boy from the Wei family

146
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,270
doesn't cross my line

147
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,590
and cause trouble, it's fine.

148
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,150
By the way, Uncle,

149
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,310
that rascal

150
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,270
went to Hang City.

151
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, I know.

152
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,430
After raising eagles for years,

153
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,790
I've realized something.

154
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,750
Raising eagles is like raising people.

155
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,200
Eagles need to be strong,

156
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,430
but can't get too many muscles.

157
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,560
As for raising people,

158
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,310
you need to break their arrogance,

159
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,560
but keep their pride.

160
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,590
What do you think?

161
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,430
I can pretty much guess it.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,840
But I wonder
if Baliang can handle it.

163
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,880
After all, it's their turf.

164
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,110
Plus, he's carrying your debt.

165
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
When I first started out on my own,

166
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,910
let me tell you,

167
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,470
forget roughing it outdoors.

168
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,080
Even if it's just scraps of food
someone else left,

169
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,110
I'd kneel down

170
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,520
and lick them clean, not leaving a bit.

171
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,950
Uncle,

172
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,840
compared to me,

173
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,000
he knows nothing about hardship.

174
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,950
You Zhaos

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,400
are all stubborn as mules.

176
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,590
Your biggest flaw

177
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,310
is being way too proud.

178
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,000
You win ninety-nine moves,

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,950
but lose just one,

180
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,720
and you lose the whole game.

181
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
I actually feel for Baliang.

182
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,310
Not because I'm afraid he'll struggle,

183
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,110
but because he has
such a good foundation and nature,

184
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,080
yet you keep forcing him
to grow too fast.

185
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,910
Still, I'm kind of curious.

186
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
Back then,

187
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,630
you were set on expanding south,

188
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,470
constantly clashing with Li Minxian,

189
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,310
which ended up helping them
form a chamber of commerce.

190
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,750
In the end, you got nothing.

191
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,360
Now it's Jiadi,
who actually has compassion.

192
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,270
Maybe...

193
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,470
this is a new opportunity.

194
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
Where the hell are you?

195
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,880
If you don't get out soon,
we'll miss our stop.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,790
It's packed up front.

197
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,790
I'm at the end of the train.

198
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,720
Dear passengers,
we're arriving at Jia City Station.

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,750
Please get ready to get off in advance,

200
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
and make sure
you have all your belongings.

201
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,110
Please don't leave them on board.

202

We want to avoid any trouble for you.

203
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
Looking forward to seeing you again.

204
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,240
Have a pleasant journey.

205
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,270
Excuse me, sir.

206
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,840
Did you take the wrong bag?

207
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,200
Are you sure that's your bag?

208
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,750
It's mine.

209
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,750
I know my own stuff.

210
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,520
Mind your own business.

211
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,200
Wait.

212
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,430
Maybe open it to check.

213
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,240
It'd be a hassle if it's not yours.

214
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,000
What's wrong with you?

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,950
I'm in a rush to get off.

216
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,750
Let go of me.

217
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,150
It's better if you check now.

218
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,200
Let go, I'm getting off now.

219
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,840
Sir,

220
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,430
you got here just in time.

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,880
What happened?

222
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Please, take it easy.

223
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,630
Please put your hand down.

224
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's talk this out,

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,000
okay?

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,720
What's going on?

227
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,880
When we got on earlier,

228
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,110
didn't I help you put it up?

229
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,110
There's another one just like it.

230
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,310
Maybe this gentleman
took the wrong one.

231
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,240
Please, check your bag.

232
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,150
So... so,

233
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,360
let's just have a check

234
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,310
to avoid misunderstanding.

235
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,750
Why do I have to check my bag?

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm in a hurry to get off.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,430
Hold on.

238
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,360
Just open your bag.

239
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Let's take a quick look.

240
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,430
Do you want a fight?

241
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,430
Open it up and check inside.

242
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,360
Let go!

243
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,110
The gentleman asked you

244
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,790
to open the bag.

245
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,430
Let's have a look inside.

246
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,520
Are you serious? Let go of me!

247
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,400
I'll let go once you check it.

248
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,910
Are you letting go or not?
If not, I won't be nice.

249
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,790
No, I'm not letting go.

250
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,000
Then I'll have to get physical.

251
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,950
- Calm down.
- Let go!

252
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,680
If you don't let go, I'll use force!

253
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,470
What's happening here?

254
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,310
Officers.

255
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,040
What's going on?

256
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,470
Here's the situation.

257
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,590
When this gentleman boarded,

258
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,470
I helped put his bag up.

259
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
There was a cartoon print under his bag.

260
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,790
I think he might have the wrong bag.

261
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,110
Officer,

262
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,110
I'm in a rush to get off.

263
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,470
He won't let me leave.

264
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,790
Please cooperate with me.

265
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,000
Let me check your bag.

266
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,470
It's just my bag, nothing special.

267
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,520
It's fine, just a quick check.

268
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,080
That's my granddaughter's toy.

269
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,240
No idea when she stuck it on.

270
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,630
This is my bag.

271
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,880
- This is my bag.
- Alright.

272
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,280
So this one's yours.

273
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,190
Where's your bag then?

274

My bag?

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Maybe this is actually mine.

276
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,560
They look the same.

277
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,470
It was a mix-up.

278
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Sorry about that.

279

I'm sorry.

Everyone, sit down.

290
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,120
Please sit down.

291

Nothing's missing.

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,950
Are you sure?

293
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,440
Yes.

294
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,190

on the rack.

do you know finance?

Nothing.

Everyone throws their money in.

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,150
Laozi called this pattern
the Way of Heaven.

373
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,600
Heaven isn't just emptiness.

374
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,120
It's nature itself.

375
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,600
Everything adapts to survive,

376
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,280
and that's what we call the Way.

377
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,280
If you want to get things done,

378
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,470
first, follow the Way of Heaven.

379
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,600
But remember,
you need to think about this.

380
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,150
I'm talking about Laozi's philosophy.

381
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,120
Yeah, I know about that.

382
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,510
Laozi's impact
on Western philosophy and science

383
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,470
was huge.

384
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,830
Hegel, Tolstoy,

385
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,720
and even Adam Smith in economics

386
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,120
all respected him a lot.

387
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,670
The futures market

388
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,280
is pretty complex,

389
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,920
but no matter how complex it is,

390
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,190
its impact on the spot market
is still limited.

391
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,240
The deliverable goods

392
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,280
is limited.

393
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,790
Everyone wants to make quick money,

394
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,920
but when seeds hit the soil,

395
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,440
they have to follow their growth cycle.

396
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,830
When economic fluctuations get big,

397
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,560
governments always step in to manage it.

398
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,310
In the end,

399
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
finance is just a tool,

400
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,440
and it still has to serve
the real economy.

401
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,920
The foundation of life isn't money.

402
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,350
It's the crops that grow from the land.

403
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,470
It's conservation of energy

404
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,950
and extremes meet.

405
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,720

406

408
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,310
That's definitely a good thing.

409
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,760
But it has its downsides too.

410
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,150
People are surrounded by abundance,

411
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,280
but feel distant from nature.

412
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,880
We stand on the ground,

413
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,510
yet barely notice the earth below.

414
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,350
Give it time,

415
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,510

416
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,920
It's rare I find someone to chat with.

417
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440

can you make it a bit cheaper?

Eight hundred is the lowest.

558
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,600
Right here.

Thanks, miss.

562
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,600
Which school are you from?

563
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,510
My senior and I are from Springton.
What about you?

564
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,190
I'm from Tsinghua, PhD program.

565
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,720
You two look exactly

566
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,920
like real pros.

567
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,560
Like something out of a movie.

568
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,760
Which position did you apply for?

569
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,880
My senior's going for
proprietary trader.

570
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,830
There's only one opening.

571
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,040
I went for the Middle Office
to avoid competing. And you?

572
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,560
As long as Risheng picks me,

573
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,830
any job is fine with me.

574

Yeah.

578

Can I borrow your pen again?

582
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,400
How did Risheng split the groups?

583
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,120
Do latecomers still get to interview?

584
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,670
Now we all have to wait because of that.

585
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,830
Exactly.

586
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,880
Sorry about that.

Honestly, you're right on time.

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,760
Mr. Zhao, which job
did you sign up for?

591
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,830
Proprietary trader.

592
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,760
But there are other jobs on the form.

593

You sure you don't want to reconsider?

594
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,600
No, this is the one I want.

So, basically, you have no chance.

How did you score on the exam?

603
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,120
Perfect score.

604

Yeah.

The last EPI question was brand new.

614
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,350
My advisor only just published
a paper on it.

615
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,830
How did you manage to solve it?

616
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,470
Maybe I just got lucky.

617
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,600
I guess I calculated it right by chance.

618
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,470
There's no such thing as luck in math.

Does your family work in this field?

620

Is the entry bar this low now?

Ignore him.
He doesn't deserve to be talked to.

Good morning, everyone.

667
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,600
Let me introduce myself first.

My name is Song Mingjian.

to take part in this interview.

671
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,760
I graduated from Springton University.

672
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,350
My major was Business Administration.

During my studies,

674
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,630
I also chose our university's well-known

and Financial Engineering courses.

676
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,240
I was also selected twice

for the summer research program

678
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,510

The results of my research

received praise from the professors.

681
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
My alma mater puts a lot of focus
on computation.

682
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
And they really value
real-world applications too.

683
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,560

I attended their seminar once.

They deserve a lot of respect
in the industry.

like Master of Finance?

690
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Bendheim's master's program

691
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,040
is much more academic
and finance-focused,

692
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,150
centered on research.

693
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,720
That doesn't really match
my career goals.

694
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,790
So I didn't apply in the end.

695
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,190
You interned at Goldman Sachs
for less than four months,

696
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,280
but you worked on three major projects.

697
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,560
Projects that big

698
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,670
usually can't be finished
in such a short time.

699
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,830
So, is it fair to say

700
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,560
you haven't handled
a full project from start to finish?

701
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,990
Then please tell me
about your actual duties.

702
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,920
Well, I started here as an intern.

703

For the Concrete Acquisition Project,

705
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,510
I mainly handled industry research
and data analysis,

706
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,560
as well as organizing and related tasks.

707
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,920
Back in college,

708
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,790
I worked with my mentor

709
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,720
on a research project
about quantitative stock selection.

710
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,080
So the company moved me
to quantitative analysis

712

your understanding and insights on it.

716
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,760
Quantitative analysis

717
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,880
means using mathematical models
instead of human judgment.

718
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,310
As for quantitative stock selection,

719
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,470
it uses mathematical formulas and tech

720
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,950
to lower the risks
of picking stocks manually.

721
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,400
Let me give you an example.

722
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,400
Right now,

723
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,440

724
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,150
called the Magical Formula
for quantitative stock selection.

725
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,350
It's not really popular here yet.

726
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,350

727
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,280
to avoid complex industry background

728
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,080
and tough value analysis issues.

729
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,880
It's practical and the returns
are impressive.

730
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,630
Plus, the person
who created the formula

731
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,080
is Joel Greenblatt himself.

732
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,790
He's become a legend
in the investment world.

733
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,790
So I really think

734
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,630
developing true mathematical thinking

735
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,790
and valuing quantitative analysis

736
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,510
are big advantages
for the finance industry abroad.

737
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,280
I hope to bring that mindset with me

738
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,630
as I move forward in my career.

739
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,240
