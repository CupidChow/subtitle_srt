[Zhao Jiadi S2]
[Director: Jing Xiaoyao]

2
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,080
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
Mr. Li heard that Mr. Zhao is doing

4
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,520
mining business.

5
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,440
He's worried you'll stir things up again,

6
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,470
so he sent me to meet with you.

7
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
Stir things up?

8
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,000
What makes you say that?

9
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,470
After all these years,

10
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,310
that old guy still can't
let go of the past.

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,070
Honestly,

12
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,280
a lot of people can't.

13
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,360
Go back and tell him,

14
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,630
he'd better get ready,

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,160
and wait for me.

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
As for the overseas market,

17
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm definitely getting in.

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,360
So you're saying

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,150
Mr. Zhao already has the ticket
for the overseas mining site.

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,230
Kid,

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,040
didn't that old guy

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,870
teach you manners?

23
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,600
Tell your people

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
to behave themselves.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,630
Stop having them

26
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,200
constantly checking up on me.

27
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,950
The rod is yours now.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
Mr. Zhao, I heard you're busy.

29
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,230
So this is what you're busy with.

30
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,680
Dongcao.

31
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,360
I heard about the company.

32
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,070
Want me to come back and help?

33
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,950
You finally have a break.

34
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,280
Besides,

35
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,390
the desalination project
keeps you busy.

36
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,550
No matter how busy,
it's worth it for you.

37
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,710
That won't do.

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
You should focus your energy
where it counts.

39
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,120
Let me sort out the company first.

40
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,310
Then our project can finally start.

41
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,600
Let them see

42
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,760
if this newcomer can handle it.

43
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,280
So, are you still going to dig deeper?

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,150
The internal fund issue

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
could be a big deal, or nothing.

46
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,870
If they cover the general loss early

47
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,790
and come up with a legit reason,

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,950
what will you do then?

49
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,840
All I want is a clear outcome.

50
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,520
Last time we got rejected for listing.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,710
Wasn't it because the accounts
were a mess?

52
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,310
No matter what excuse they use,

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,790
I can still hold Fu Fang accountable.

54
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,040
So,

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
have you figured out how to tell Dad?

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Baliang,

57
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,840
have you ever thought about this?

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
Maybe Dad just doesn't want to
go public.

59
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,550
I joined Jinhai when I was fifteen,

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,040
and still haven't figured out

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
how many hidden shares Dad has

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,070
and what investments
he's made in private.

63
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,200
No one knows.

64
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,680
I have a guess.

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,280
What Dad wants

66
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,470
is a family business.

67
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,070
Dongcao,

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,150
can we still call this a family?

69
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,680
Maybe...

70
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,280
Dad has his reasons.

71
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,150
When I was a kid,
people said I had no dad,

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,070
called me an outsider.

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,440
Mom said he had his reasons.

74
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,000
At Grandpa's funeral,

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
he brought Ms. Huang and Yange home

76
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,230
after Mom waited for him for ten years.

77
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,390
Tell me, how hard must life be

78
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,360
for someone to just tear apart

79
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,870
a family like this.

80
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,470
Hello, Mr. Fu.

81
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,310
I'm glad you called.

82
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,230
Mr. Huang, everything's set.

83
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,600
Go ahead, get to it.

84
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,710
Mr. Huang.

85
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,280
Biao.

86
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,920
Bringing out the whole crew today?

87
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,790
Is there something up?

88
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,600
Last time, you looked into me.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,310
Now it's my turn to check on you.

90
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
Tables always turn, don't they?

91
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,710
As soon as I walked in, I smelled you.

92
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,040
If you're checking, hurry up.
Then leave.

93
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,390
My smell?

94
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,230
Pretty sure
that's coming from your place.

95
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,360
Bet it's that ledger
you can't hide anymore.

96
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,470
Jiadi

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,790
rarely gets involved.

98
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,870
Let's see who saves you this time.

99
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,360
Hello?

100
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,280
Stop checking?

101
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,390
Hey.

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,470
Hello?

103
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,870
Biao.

104
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,630
This way.

105
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,200
No rush.

106
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,790
I'll grab some breakfast.

107
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,200
Clean up a bit.

108
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,000
Shake off bad luck.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,790
Alright.

110
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,710
Go ahead, get busy.

111
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,360
Uncle.

112
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,000
Who stopped it?

113
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,120
Okay.

114
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
Take this and get it done.

115
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,470
Old boy,

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,630
you got a raw deal.

117
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,950
Not at all.

118
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,870
Jiadi did it for the company.

119
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,280
You're the thoughtful one.

120
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,630
By the way,
has the mining site handover

121
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,390
been completed?

122
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,070
Yes.

123
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,040
Cheng Jianshe made the connection.

124
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,760
As for the Wu shareholders,

125
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,630
they have no objections
to us joining the company.

126
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,470
The boy from Wu family
has had it tough.

127
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,760
When it comes to money,
let's make sure

128
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,310
treat him fairly.

129
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,630
Don't worry about that.

130
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,310
But...

131
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,440
Cheng Jianshe mentioned

132
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,920
that boy's stubborn,
very set in his ways,

133
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,630
so we kept things a bit vague with him.

134
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,600
We all talked it over

135
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,440
and agreed to reserve a spot for him.

136
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,120
We should give him some respect.

137
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,280
Everyone wants to

138
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,230
achieve something,

139
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,280
but they don't know their limits.

140
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,200
Not a single one of them

141
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
can handle it.

142
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,710
Exactly.

143
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,630
That huge project

144
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
was handed to some rookie to handle.

145
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,470
Investors' money
isn't just falling from the sky.

146
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,280
Now he doesn't have to do a thing,

147
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,870
and he can just lie back and earn money.

148
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,230
If I were him, I'd be grinning too.

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,390
Boss.

150
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,200
That gap in the account

151
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,280
is already been filled.

152
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,120
Earlier, it was because

153
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,840
we had to fund the project quickly

154
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,920
that the proper financial steps
got skipped.

155
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,520
That was my mistake.

156
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,470
I'm willing to take the blame.

157
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,440
No need to blame you for this.

158
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,310
When a foot soldier slips up,

159
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,790
should we punish the general for it?

160
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,710
If that young man
wants to investigate, let him.

161
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,840
I think it's actually pretty good.

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,390
Just a quick reminder for everyone,

163
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,470
don't always undermine your team.

164
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,310
Right?

165
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,280
Yeah,

166
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,310
you're right.

167
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,550
It's just a lot of projects involved.

168
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,790
We can't tell every partner everything.

169
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,150
It's just about payment timing.

170
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,790
If needed, I can cover it for now.

171
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,520
I heard

172
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,920
it's quite a sum, isn't it?

173
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,230
You got a raw deal.

174
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
No, not at all.

175
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,000
It's what I should do.

176
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,840
Fu,

177
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,440
the General Manager of Li Group,

178
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,550
you've met with him, right?

179
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Yes.

180
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,230
What did you talk about?

181
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,150
We didn't say much.

182
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,710
He just tried to tell us not to

183
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,150
do business with the mining site.

184
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,920
Nothing concrete, really.

185
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,920
Oh,

186
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,520
he even tried to win me over.

187
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,280
I just ignored him.

188
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,310
Li Minxian's getting old now.

189
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,390
And the company

190
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,200
is in a rough patch.

191
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,710
Sending some rookie over here.

192
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,760
Fu,

193
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,950
you've been with me the longest

194
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,150
in Jinhai, right?

195
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,760
Yes.

196
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,950
Just put your heart

197
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,000
into the mining project.

198
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,600
Whatever you deserve,

199
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,440
you'll get every bit of it.

200
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,040
Boss,

201
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,470
thank you.

202
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,310
Thanks.

203
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Have some tea.

204
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,390
Jiadi, you're back.

205
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,760
Uncle Fu, you sure know
how to find a spot.

206
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,840
Should I call you Mr. Fu again?

207
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,520
Boss.

208
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,070
I'm heading out now.

209
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,870
Go on, take care.

210
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,950
Coming back at this hour.

211
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,390
Is there something to say?

212
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,470
There was, actually.

213
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,040
But not anymore now.

214
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,520
Guess I came back for nothing.

215
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,470
I should've thought of

216
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,200
how you'd deal with people.

217
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,310
About Fu Fang's issue,

218
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I've already handled it.

219
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,950
You don't have to like him,

220
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,520
but I want to tell you

221
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,550
that people who get things done

222
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,710
don't need everyone to like them.

223
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,360
Come on, let's eat.

224
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,950
Mr. Fu, is something wrong?

225
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
Let me say this again.

226
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,310
The money I took from you

227
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,000
was all my personal loan.

228
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm not blind

229
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
to your plans for Jinhai,

230
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,710
and

231
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,870
I have my own principles too.

232
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,000
Besides,

233
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Zhao Xin won't be easy to handle.

234
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,360
Of course.

235
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,760
Then let's hope
for a smooth partnership.

236
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,760
About the desalination project,

237
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,040
Dongcao mentioned it to me.

238
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,680
The proposal looks good,

239
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
but timeline is pretty long.

240
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,070
Ten years.

241
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,280
So far, this is

242
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,760
the biggest one Jinhai has ever had.

243
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,840
Just follow the project plan.

244
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
You'll make it work.

245
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,600
I know what you're capable of.

246
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,680
That's why we need to
go public and raise funds.

247
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,310
Then make it happen.

248
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,550
Don't worry about the money side.

249
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,760
Dongcao said
you don't want to go public.

250
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,120
Is it because you're afraid of losing control

251
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,150
or sorting out the shares.

252
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,680
Or is there something
you don't want to get exposed?

253
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,760
No matter what you think,

254
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Jinhai will be yours,

255
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
or it'll go to Yange,

256
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,790
or you could marry Dongcao
and let her handle it.

257
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,600
Anyway, before I close my eyes for good,

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,550
Jinhai has to stay with the Zhao family.

259
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,760
Zhao Sanjin.

260
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,070
You've already made enough money.

261
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,790
If Jinhai keeps earning
for ten or twenty years,

262
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,790
does it even matter?

263
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,150
Jinhai supports tens of thousands of staff,

264
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,120
plus a lot of partner companies.

265
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,600
Besides, I'm a major taxpayer here.

266
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,600
How could you say it's meaningless?

267
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,360
If my project works out,

268
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,150
it could help even more people.

269
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,950
Apart from the desalination,

270
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,870
I'm interested
in the internet economy too.

271
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,230
Once Jinhai invests in tech development,

272
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,000
maybe Jinhai Tech can even go global.

273
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,710
Even if,

274
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,390
Jinhai is just a stepping stone
in the end,

275
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,360
I still think it's worthwhile.

276
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,630
The way you talk right now

277
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,840
is exactly

278
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
like your grandpa.

279
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,790
Sometimes I wonder,

280
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
did I raise a son

281
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,550
or my own father?

282
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,360
You might think I'm just talking big.

283
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,120
I can't change the way you are.

284
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,870
And you can't change me either.

285
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,950
But for now,

286
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,360
I hope every cent Jinhai earns

287
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,840
comes from an honest day's work.

288
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,710
Kid,

289
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,150
in business,

290
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,310
there's no such thing.

291
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,840
We

292
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,310
have worked together in the Wu family

293
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,470
for so many years now.

294
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,950
Have I ever left anyone out
when money's on the table?

295
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,710
That's true.

296
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,230
The mining business

297
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,790
will only get better from here.

298
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,470
As your fellow, let me say this.

299
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,710
I hope from now on,

300
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,870
we all pull together, alright?

301
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,630
Cheng, that's a must.

302
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,150
You can count on us, seriously.

303
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,360
Whenever

304
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
you point east,

305
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,230
none of us will go west.

306
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,840
Right?

307
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,280
Yeah.

308
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,000
Come on, let's toast Cheng together.

309
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,470
It's been a tough journey,

310
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,870
but we finally made it.

311
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,470
What a relief!

312
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,950
Yeah, such a relief.

313
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,920
Couldn't agree more.

314
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,070
All thanks to Cheng.

315
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,200
He got us on the Jinhai "expressway".

316
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,070
It saved us so much trouble.

317
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,760
Cheng, we've signed
the shareholding contract.

318
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,840
Why keep Wu Dengke around now?

319
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,520
If Jinhai's cool with it,

320
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,760
we can call a board meeting

321
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,680
for electing a new chairman.

322
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,520
If you become the chairman,

323
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
the rest of us

324
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,310
won't have to sneak around anymore.

325
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,470
Honestly, that guy doesn't look like

326
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,310
a chairman at all.

327
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,070
He probably wishes

328
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,390
we'd all just bring it up.

329
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,040
So he can

330
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,070
take a huge payout,

331
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,600
and go live the easy life somewhere.

332
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,680
But a figurehead

333
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,000
still serves a purpose.

334
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,200
Right now,

335
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,440
it's not the time
to go head-to-head yet.

336
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,470
So when do you plan to make your move?

337
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,280
Mr. Wu, come here.

338
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,840
It's just old friends

339
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
having a drink together.

340
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,440
Worried you wouldn't join.

341
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,200
Come on.

342
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Take a seat.

343
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,470
Listen to me, hurry up.

344
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
Sit down.

345
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,790
Uncle Cheng, about the mining proposal,

346
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,950
I pulled three allnighters

347
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,950
and finally nailed it.

348
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,120
But I couldn't find anyone to handle it.

349
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,280
When I finally find someone,

350
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,760
he told me

351
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,390
you'd already had a meeting on it,

352
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,330
and sent people to handle it.

353
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,760
Mr. Wu,

354
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,200
you've misunderstood.

355
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Look, in every major corporation,

356
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,040
the chairmen

357
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,630
don't handle everything personally.

358
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,520
Their teams are just capable.

359
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,040
They solve problems for you.

360
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,000
Isn't that a good thing?

361
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,440
Isn't that right?

362
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,950
Yeah, that's right.

363
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,470
My dear Chairman,

364
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,870
here's the fact.

365
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,440
The company has money.

366
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,150
You love cars, don't you?

367
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,870
Go have your fun.

368
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,440
Champagne, pretty ladies,

369
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,390
and the yacht.

370
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,870
Plenty of free time.

371
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,200
So why bother handling business with us?

372
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,550
Besides,

373
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,040
haven't you all noticed?

374
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,360
Our Chairman

375
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,710
has got

376
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,390
an artistic vibe.

377
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,070
Just look at that hair.

378
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,280
Handsome.

379
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,040
Honestly, he's no worse than

380
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,280
those small stars out there.

381
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,120
Let's drop it.

382
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,950
That's enough.

383
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,920
Everyone, please don't misunderstand.

384
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,550
Uncle Cheng, don't get me wrong.

385
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,630
I'm not here

386
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,840
to argue or anything like that.

387
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,230
I thought it through before I came.

388
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,710
Your previous comments about me
were all true.

389
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Like saying I'm unreliable,

390
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,630
not skilled enough,

391
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,600
or lack perspective.

392
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,520
Honestly, I think you're right.

393
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,870
About my hair,

394
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,630
you said it hurt the company's image,

395
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,360
and told me to cut it.

396
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,440
But I didn't.

397
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,390
I was wrong.

398
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,310
So today I'm here

399
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,840
just to talk with you

400
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,950
and with everyone else here.

401
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,440
Let me say something.

402
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,760
Everyone here
built the business with my dad.

403
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,200
You watched the company
grow from nothing.

404
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,520
You also watched me grow up.

405
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,840
Before my dad passed, he told me

406
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,550
that the company was like
his second son,

407
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,840
three years younger than me.

408
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,440
So I'm the older brother.

409
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,520
I have to take care of him.

410
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,630
But I ended up losing it.

411
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,280
Now, do I look like a chairman to you?

412
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,550
I remember, back when we had nothing,

413
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,470
you all used to come over to our place.

414
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,310
You'd sit and talk all night long.

415
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,310
Talking about creativity and contracts.

416
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,230
I was too young

417
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,150
to understand that.

418
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,120
My dad would drink with you guys,

419
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,070
one case after another.

420
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,520
You talked about

421
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,520
dreams, life, and making money.

422
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,950
You want to get rich.

423
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,120
I have no reason to stop you.

424
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,950
If you say I'm not capable,
I accept that.

425
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,470
I just want to implore you

426
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,790
to give me a hand

427
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,390
for the old times' sake.

428
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,280
Ke,

429
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,440
you signed the Stock Transfer Agreement.

430
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,230
You can't blame anyone else.

431
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,470
Business is like a battlefield.

432
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,840
There are no friends,

433
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,870
only interests.

434
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,200
This is something

435
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,200
we all understand.

436
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,230
The Zhao family knows it too.

437
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,470
Uncle Cheng,

438
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,310
I made two mistakes.

439
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,710
First, I trusted you.

440
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,710
Second, I trusted the Zhao family.

441
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,760
You're right.

442
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,520
It's my fault.

443
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,120
No hidden tricks.

444
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,360
There's no comeback for me.

445
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,070
But I've got my conscience

446
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,120
and my pride.

447
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,520
Remember this.

448
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,920
No matter what happens next,

449
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,630
my dad built this company.

450
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,550
His last name is Wu,

451
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,600
not Zhao.

452
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,470
Yes.

453
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,710
Everything's settled.

454
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,150
Jinhai's people didn't notice, right?

455
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,310
Our chairman has ties
to the Zhao family,

456
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,920
so they won't catch on.

457
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,550
Good. Nicely done.

458
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,920
Mr. Wei,

459
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,390
there's something I don't get.

460
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,550
Aren't we doing this
for Boss Wei's revenge?

461
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,600
But why did you hand the mining site

462
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,950
over to Zhao Xin?

463
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,070
There are secrets in the mining site.

464
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,550
Zhao Xin just got his ticket in.

465
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,280
I used Li Group's bid as a cover,

466
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,840
and kept him wanting more.

467
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,550
If he wants it,

468
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,710
he has to spend big.

469
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,840
Only when he spends,

470
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,120
do I get a shot at Jinhai. You see?

471
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,150
No good bait, no big catch.

472
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,150
Why do you sound

473
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,390
a bit off today?

474
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360
It's nothing.

475
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,550
I had too many drinks tonight.

476
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,680
Feeling a bit tired.

477
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,600
I keep thinking back
to when I met Boss Wei.

478
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,000
When I had nowhere to go,

479
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,870
didn't know a thing,

480
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,630
he still kept me around.

481
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,680
You know, such a good person.

482
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,920
It's a shame things he ended that way.

483
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,040
Uncle Cheng,

484
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,950
at your age,

485
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,680
try to cut back on the drinks.

486
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,040
Take care of yourself.

487
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,840
We've got big plans ahead.

488
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,390
Our game

489
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,710
is just beginning.

490
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,200
Alright.

491
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,520
Hello, welcome to the staff conference.

492
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,600
Baliang,

493
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,600
it's time to go downstairs.

494
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,520
What's wrong?

495
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,710
I just can't settle down today.

496
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,840
Is your head hurting again?

497
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,680
Maybe take some meds.

498
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,390
I'm fine.

499
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,360
Come on, let's go.

500
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,710
Aren't we supposed to
greet them downstairs?

501
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,920
All shareholders are here today.

502
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,390
It's kind of a big deal.

503
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,230
Read speech draft?

504
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,840
Want to go over it again?

505
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,630
Yeah, I did.

506
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,390
Uncle,

507
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,150
let's go.

508
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,000
Excuse me, sir.

509
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,840
You can't park here.

510
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,760
Sir.

511
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,870
Pan Honghu is a key shareholder.

512
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,550
He's pretty neutral.

513
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,000
But he did mention Dad's idea before.

514
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,120
If you want to
proceed with your plan,

515
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,550
you could try talking to him.

516
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,920
Let me get you some medicine later.

517
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,230
I'm fine.

518
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,200
[Jinhai Group Q3 Staff Conference]
Leaders, colleagues,

519
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,710
good morning!

520
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,230
Today,

521
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,200
we're gathered here

522
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,360
for the Q3 staff conference
of Jinhai Group.

523
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,390
In Jinhai...

524
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,050
We've known each other
since we were in diapers.

525
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,280
Tell me. What do you want?

526
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,310
Have you heard of Kalpunia?

527
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,760
There's a rich, high-quality
mineral vein under that land.

528
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,440
I don't want to lose control of this.

529
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,230
For Mr. Wu's project,

530
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,440
it was equity pledges
in the first place, right?

531
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,150
We've had another plan with Mr. Wu.

532
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,710
Besides, it's less risky

533
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,680
for Jinhai.

534
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,950
Ke,

535
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,710
what happened to your hair?

536
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,470
This punch is for me.

537
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,550
Any issues with the project?

538
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,790
Let him go.

539
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,470
Let go!

540
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,520
Baliang,

541
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,870
you have more important tasks.

542
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,600
This punch is for you.

543
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,920
In business,

544
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,950
there's no such thing
as a clear conscience.

545
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,710
We're in business,

546
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,600
not a charity.

547
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,230
I want profit.

548
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,710
Jinhai is my blood and sweat.

549
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,470
I won't let you mess it up.

550
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,870
Jinhai people have a resilient spirit

551
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,760
and a united front.

552
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,200
Together, we face challenges.

553
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,230
Mr. Zhao.

554
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,150
Chairman Zhao,

555
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,470
it's time for your speech.

556
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,760
Now, let's give a big round of applause

557
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,680
to welcome Chairman Zhao
of Jinhai Group,

558
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,760
Zhao Jiadi, to the stage.

559
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,360
Dear shareholders and colleagues,

560
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,230
good morning.

561
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,000
This is Jinhai's sixteenth year.

562
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,000
I'd like to take this chance

563
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,520
to share something from the heart.

564
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,470
Since Jinhai was founded,

565
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,920
we've welcomed
five generations of staff.

566
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,760
Wait for me outside.

567
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Our predecessors said

568
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,030
the toughest days were at the start.

569
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,950
The company only had 350 yuan back then.

570
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,320
[Jinhai Group Staff Conference]

571
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,360
We owed money outside,

572
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,550
and couldn't pay wages.

573
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Everyone worked on an empty stomach,

574
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,470
but held on for months.

575
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,440
Somehow, Jinhai never fell.

576
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,440
People outside always say

577
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,200
Jinhai is rich.

578
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,280
But in my eyes,

579
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,000
Jinhai's greatest treasure

580
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
was the unity we had back then.

581
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Everyone in the company
understood each other.

582
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,680
Every single person

583
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,550
felt Jinhai

584
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,680
was their home.

585
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
While the life is easier,

586
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,200
people have changed.

587
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,280
Jinhai is facing new challenges,

588
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,360
but the problem isn't outside.

589
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,150
It's something inside Jinhai.

590
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,550
Some people rest on their laurels

591
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,150
and forget why they started fighting.

592
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,120
They forget that a company

593
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,710
needs to have real warmth.

594
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,680
How many companies

595
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,230
thought they were on top,

596
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,710
but crashed overnight?

597
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,230
For Jinhai's future,

598
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
for the next hundred years,

599
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,630
for every front-line worker,

600
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,030
Jinhai must change and reform.

601
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,390
So,

602
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,600
I've decided...

603
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,360
Thanks to the chairman for his speech.

604
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,440
For Jinhai's greater success,

605
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,230
let's give a big round of applause

606
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,440
and welcome Chairman Zhao Xin
to the stage.

607
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,550
We're all family here,
please have a seat.

608
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,150
I'll keep it short today.

609
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,470
Earlier, to cooperate
with the investigation,

610
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,520
I asked my son, Zhao Jiadi,

611
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,950
to act as interim chairman.

612
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,840
He's done a great job during this time,

613
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,790
which everyone has seen.

614
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,920
Starting today,

615
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,870
I'm coming back to Jinhai,

616
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,360
ready to serve

617
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,600
as the chairman once again.

618
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,000
One more thing

619
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,080
I'd like to share with you.

620
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,600
As for our Jinhai,

621
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:23,120
we've secured
the mining rights in Kalpunia.

622
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
I'll say it again,

623
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,440
go for it without holding back.

624
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,390
If anything goes wrong,

625
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,760
I'll take the blame.

626
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,150
Well said!

627
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,120
You're finally back.

628
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,360
Chairman Zhao.

629
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,120
I'm back.

630
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,920
You're finally back.

631
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:34,950
Ke,

632
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,550
I know you're not happy
with me right now,

633
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,200
and you don't want to listen.

634
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,310
But please, trust me.

635
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,440
Baliang has nothing to do with this.

636
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,710
If he knew,

637
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,030
he'd try to help right away.

638
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,470
It's just that Jinhai's situation
is tricky.

639
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,230
It won't be solved in a day or two.

640
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,760
We need to think this through.

641
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,920
Thanks, Dongcao.

642
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,520
If he knew,

643
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,760
we'll still be like brothers.

644
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,200
Ke, I know this is tough for you.

645
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,470
But I really don't know what to say.

646
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,550
Today I told Baliang

647
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,230
to trust me.

648
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,440
Right now, I want to tell you too...

649
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,230
Ke?

650
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,600
