[Zhao Jiadi's Resume]
Hai College of Economics.

4
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,630
Recommended by Mr. Jiang.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,430
He has real hands-on trading experience.

6
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,040
Please, have a seat.

7
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,680
Good morning, everyone.

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,720
My name is Zhao Jiadi.

9
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,040
I graduated
from Hai College of Economics.

10
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,110
I'm here to apply
for the trader position.

11
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,040
I started learning about stocks
in high school,

12
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,720
trading as an individual investor

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,080
for five years already.

14
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,400
About the trading rules
needed for this role

15
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,400
and the market data involved,

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,910
I have a solid understanding.

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
I can write research
and analysis reports alone.

18
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,240
In the materials I submitted,

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,790
you'll find detailed results and proof.

20
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,430
As for the trader position,

21
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,110
I think my strength is...

22
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,840
Besides what's on my resume,

23
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,630
is there anything else to add?

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
I've analyzed

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,910
Risheng's public trades,

26
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,630
especially how Risheng performed

27
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,200
under the subprime crisis,

28
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,270
so I know a fair bit
about Risheng's trading style,

29
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,470
and I can adjust
to the company's pace fast.

30
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,240
On the materials you sent in,

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,040
the cells
on English skills and grades

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,790
are blank.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,680
So you don't even have a test score?

34
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,950
No, I don't.

35
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,240
How did you get through the screening?

36
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,270
Our company's huge.

37
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,040
Is English really not required?

38
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,360
For trader jobs here,

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,470
there's no English requirement.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,890
What about your college entrance exam?

41
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,240
You must have an English score
from the exam.

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,270
I got a zero in the English.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,110
Excuse me.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,840
Maybe you misunderstand finance.

45
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,110
In our job posting,

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,630
we didn't list English as a must,

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
but actually,

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
it's an essential skill for us.

49
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,240
So, you don't quite fit.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Then what's your total exam score?

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,470
I scored 570,
full marks in math, and 296 in science.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,430
No wonder.

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,430
He also aced the exam last round.

54
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,680
His weaknesses are obvious.

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,590
But he's definitely talented.

56
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,080
For a trader,

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
being good with numbers matters most.

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,270
I checked his modeling work.

59
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,430
He even won an award.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Dear interviewers.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,270
I don't want to make excuses

62
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,430
for my English grades.

63
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,520
In the end,

64
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,520
it turned out to be a big lesson
in my life.

65
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,840
I used to think

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,630
grades and real skills
were two separate things.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,590
But my university principal told me,

68
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,470
my actions show my attitude,

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,950
including respect for the rules

70
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,240
and for others as well.

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,630
That really made sense to me,

72
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,270
and I decided to change.

73
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,430
Back in high school,

74
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,000
I already read
German and Russian with ease.

75
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,910
After some advice
from the principal,

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,430
I improved my English vocab and grammar.

77
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,400
For anything I need to read at work,

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,630
I can handle all the English just fine.

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,470
Since you get what I'm saying,

80
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
you should understand my point.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,790
Manager Lin.

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,630
We're sitting here today

83
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,910
because we owe it
to the company to hire right.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,240
This isn't a classroom.

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,590
It's not a training center either.

86
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,560
This is the battlefield.

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,630
Once you're in, you're in the fight.

88
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,680
Do you really think
you can handle Risheng's money

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,240
with your inadequate experience?

90
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,950
There are true genius mavericks,

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,400
but maybe not you.

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,430
No one bets on the unknown.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,790
Alright, thanks for your time.

94
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,590
I can handle Risheng's funds.

95
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,840
In fact,

96
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,880
if Risheng's traders had listened to me,

97
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,470
I would've saved them from losses.

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,270
I need a minute to clear my head.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Shanke still hasn't hit our target.

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,720
With the market index
swinging this much,

101
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,880
I think your team
should recalculate the numbers.

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,430
Don't wait until it's too late.

103
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
We discussed this at the meeting.

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,040
The team leader thinks
it's not the peak yet.

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
He wants to wait a little longer.

106
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,430
Are you talking about Shanke Coal?

107
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,430
Sell everything.

108
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,790
It's already past the highest point.

109
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,840
Someone once told me

110
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,590
everything in life follows a pattern.

111
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,240
I think that's true in finance too.

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
The best example is the industry cycle.

113
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,910
If you look at the big picture,

114
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,310
the subprime crisis isn't over yet.

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,680
Coal prices went up earlier this year,

116
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,200
but that wasn't just because of demand.

117
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,430
Plus, the ChiNext Board is opening soon,

118
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,400
and new energy concept stocks

119
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
will attract more investors
as growth stocks.

120
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,270
So overall, here's my take,

121
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,240
the coal industry
is already in a downturn.

122
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,840
While organizing Risheng's trading data,

123
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,720
I focused mainly on resource stocks.

124
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,240
Right now,

125
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,880
there are 23 listed coal companies.

126
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,750
Shanke Coal itself

127
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,470
doesn't really stand out
against leaders.

128
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,950
Suspecting a big gap
in Shanke's share price,

129
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,680
I ran a modeling analysis on it.

130
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
The results showed

131
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,270
Shanke Coal's share price

132
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,790
has seriously strayed
from Risheng's profit expectations.

133
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,750
It's not a growth stock,

134
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,840
and its corporate compound
growth rate can't hit 18%.

135
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,040
So overall,

136
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,880
before the market shows clear signs,

137
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,630
now is the best time to sell Shanke.

138
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,750
If you wait any longer,

139
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,240
you might miss your chance to exit.

140
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
I even printed out
my whole calculation process.

141
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,080
I was going to submit this
after the interview.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
I thought it would give me an edge.

143
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,240
But now it seems

144
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,630
it might've been unnecessary.

145
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Did you...

146
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,360
do all of this on your own?

147
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,240
Not exactly.

148
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,430
I started
with the residual income model,

149
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,040
then factored in the local market
and Shanke Coal,

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,200
and built out an expanded version.

151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,910
Olson's theory has some assumptions.

152
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Are you that sure
about your calculations?

153
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,790
The point of modeling

154
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,000
is to define risk
and forecast the future.

155
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not about trusting myself.

156
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,560
It's about trusting the facts.

157
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,920
After all, no one pays for the unknown.

158
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,750
I prepared thoroughly

159
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,470
as Risheng's recruitment requirements.

160
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Relying on my own ability,

161
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
I've made it
from the written exam to here.

162
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,310
You interrupted me
right as the interview began.

163
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,830
I thought you were testing
how I handle pressure.

164
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,310
That's true.

165
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,240
A trader needs to handle stress.

166
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,880
But as things went on,

167
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,080
it felt more like
you simply don't like me.

168
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,880
An interview is supposed
to be a two-way choice.

169
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,670
Your attitude fell below
what I expected.

170
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,670
Need any workers?

171
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,120
Plumbing or electrical repairs.

172
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,400
Hiring now.

173
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,310
We're hiring.

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,470
Learning this will cost
at least twenty or thirty thousand yuan.

175
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,920
That's way too expensive.

176
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,080
I haven't even started making money yet.

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
And now I have to pay so much upfront.

178
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,920
There's no other way.

179
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,470
Forget it, then.

180
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,510
[Hiring]

181
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,510
Hey, do you guys need labor?

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,720
You're a bit late.

183
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,080
The trucks took everyone
at five this morning.

184

Come back tomorrow.

185
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,760
Thanks.

186
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,080
Hey, boy.

187
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,240
I'll save you a spot next time.

188
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Just pay fifty yuan up front.

Unusual moves in Shanke Coal stocks

191
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,440
have caught the market's eye again.

192
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,470
Due to a delayed earnings report,

193
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,280
Shanke Coal hit its limit down
at 11 a.m. today.

194
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,040
It's now at 3.74 yuan per share.

195
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,080
A sharp drop for four straight sessions

196
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,350
has wiped out
nearly 2.3 billion yuan in value.

197

198
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,350
Alright, take care.

199
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,240
Please invest sensibly, everyone.

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
Be mindful of market risks.

201

Here's another update.

202
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,400
Because of the economy...

203
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,510

204
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,920
You're here.

205
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,510
What do you feel like eating today?

206
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,310
Not eating yet. I got paid yesterday,

207
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,150
but it was late so I didn't come by.

208
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,720
Let me pay you back for the meals.

209
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
How much is it?

210
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,600
Fifty.

211
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,950
This will do.

212
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,990
That can't be right.

213
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,120
I remember it as,

214
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,440
one meal, two, three, four meals...

215
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,630
It wasn't that many.

216
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Why didn't you go out to work today?

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,280
I woke up late today,

218
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
so I missed the chance.

219
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,830
I heard

220
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,280
that factories hiring temp workers

221
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,310
usually offer no job security.

222
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,080
Why not try finding a steady job?

223
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,880
I don't have a choice now.

224
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,240
So I'll just stick with it for now.

225
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Save up some money and see how it goes.

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,400
Alright, I gotta go.

would you want to work for me?

230
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,150
Ms. Fang, I know you mean well.

231
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,790
But I'm a grown man.

232
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,600
Don't worry.

233
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm actually looking to hire.

234
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
My resto is doing pretty well.

235
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,880
But it's just me running everything now.

236
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,150
I have to restock,
keep track of the books,

237
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,790
handle the customers,

238
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,440
and clean the whole place.

239
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,880
Plus, I still need to
look after Tongtong.

240
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,120
Honestly, it's just too much for me.

241
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
I think you're hardworking,

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,310
and reliable too.

243
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,280
That's why I asked you.

244
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,720
We can talk about salary.
It's flexible.

245
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,920
So...

246
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,630
will meals be provided?

247
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,950
Of course.

248
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,880
I was just joking with you.

249
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,150
Pay me whatever you want.

250
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,950
Just feed me, then I'm good.

251
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,040
No problem.

252
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,040
You think you can
eat my resto out of business?

253
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,190
Hey, you never know.

254
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,790
You know how much I can eat.

It was late yesterday

at its core,
is all about talented people.

369
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,630
Everyone here

370
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,600
gets the highest pay in the business.

371
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,350
So you need to deliver value
that matches it.

372
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,190
But honestly,

373
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,080
no one is irreplaceable here.

374
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,150
I built Jufeng

375
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
to lead this whole industry.

376
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,150
If someone doesn't get that,

377
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,600
then they're just not right
or this place.

378
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,040
I've only got thirty minutes

379
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,950
to hear your growth plan
for next quarter.

380
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,790
Are you listening or not?

381
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
I've got some inside info.

382
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,190
Let's talk in person.

383
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,310
Mr. Wei, my boss is really upset.

384
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,080
The inspection by the coast guard

385
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,760
already cost us quite a bit.

386
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,400
Now you want more goods,

387
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,510
it's hard for us to trust you again.

388
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,310
I'm here to make it up to you.

389
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
I know you pulled a big move.

390
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,400
Now the international market
is watching oil closely,

391
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
and you still went after the oil pipeline.

392
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,920
You're eager to sell

393
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
your goods on hand, right?

394
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,350
You want to buy in...

395
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,310
Make them quiet.

396
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,310
Alright.

397
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,790
But this time, no advance payment.

398
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,760
Only full buyout works.

399
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,190
US dollars.

400
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,790
If you want the goods,

401
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,670
pay it all at once.

402
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,280
That's not how deals work.

403
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,950
I paid the money.

404
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,670
Then someone snatched
the goods right away.

405
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,350
Stuff like that,

406
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,990
I can only let it slide once.

407
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,510
What the hell are you doing?

408
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,350
Mr. Wei,

409
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,790
you know I used to admire your smarts.

410
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,600
But sometimes,

411
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,240
being too clever isn't always good.

412
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,150
I want 50,000 tons of refined oil.

413
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,510
Buying it all is fine.

414
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,150
But only at today's price.

415
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,830
Or,

416
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,310
we can stick to advance payments

417
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,600
and split the profits thirty-seventy.

418
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,120
You know finance is my real edge.

419
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
Oil prices will go up for sure.

420
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,470
I promise we'll make a real fortune.

421
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,830
Twenty-eighty.

422
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,150
You know the law here is strict.

423
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,150
Smuggling is such a big risk.

424
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,310
If you push harder,

425
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,310
I'm out.

426
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,150
This time, I trust you.

427
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,120
But there can't be any mistakes.

428
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,830
You know me.

429
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm not that brave.

430
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,630
Don't scare me.

431
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,630
Alright?

432
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,470
Deal.

433
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,280
Actually,

434
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,760
there are more profitable things.

435
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,120
You should give it a shot.

436
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,600
Thanks, but I stay away from drugs.

437
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
What's going on here?

438
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,560
It's life or death, uncle.

439
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,920
Is everyone okay?

440
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,150
I'm fine.

441
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,720
Don't use water! Where's the lid?

442
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,720
Here.

443
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,310
Go, open all the doors!

444
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,280
Oh no, there's still a fire.

445
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,120
Open all the doors outside.

446
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,150
Did anyone ever do anything to you?

447
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,350
You ruined a perfect chicken.

448
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Look what you did to it.

449
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,920
Such a waste of food.

450
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,310
Seriously,

451
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,080
you aren't meant to be an employee.

452
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,510
You know what you should do?

453
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,190
You should open a restaurant.

454
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,950
Cook every chicken just like this,

455
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,120
and serve them to your customers

456
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,120
one by one.

457
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,040
Uncle.

458
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,120
Uncle, that's enough.

459
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,560
Let's just have instant noodles
for lunch.

460
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,600
Sure, I'll clean up after lunch.

461
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,600
Coming!

462
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,150
I'll get it, let me.

463
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,510
- Hello.
- Hi.

464
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,240
Li Qian.

465
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,350
I was going to call and meet you out.

466
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,120
But I saw your address is close by.

467
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,600
Somehow, I just ended up here.

468
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,510
Is this too sudden?

469
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Not at all.

470
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,920
Who is it?

471
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,150
Come on, tidy up a bit.

472
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,790
Hi, please come in.

473
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,400
Make yourself at home.

474
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,150
Let me get to the point.

475
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,510
I'm here to see you.

476
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,920
I want to invite you to join Risheng.

477
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,920
I saw the list.

478
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,720
Your name wasn't on it.

479
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,600
We even had two meetings just for you.

480
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,990
Still, we couldn't reach a decision.

481
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,920
Your strengths really stand out.

482
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,990
Strictly in terms of skills,

483
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,080
you're beyond an ordinary trader.

484
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,950
But your flaws are just as clear.

485
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,470
Though, maybe "flaws" isn't fair.

486
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,880
You've got an edge.

487
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,670
But we're looking for staff,

488
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,600
not someone to boss us around.

489
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,760
Honestly, what you said is true.

490
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
I can't promise that'll change.

491
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,240
Because in my view,

492
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,400
doing the right thing

493
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,190
matters way more than saving face.

494
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,510
For you, following orders strictly

495
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,600
just means saving face.

496
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm honestly not surprised.

497
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,920
If that's the case,

498
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,920
maybe starting a business

499
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,310
is the only real option for you.

500
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,150
This company

501
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:13,950
or the whole society,

502
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,720
has levels for a reason.

503
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,510
It's to keep order
and set responsibility.

504
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,950
After all, the world
isn't about truth alone.

505
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,190
It's here for people
from all walks of life,

506
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,920
so everyone can be a part
of how it runs.

507
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,510
I see that differently.

508
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,280
Have some water.

509
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,470
When I was a kid,

510
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,510
my grandpa taught me

511
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,560
everyone needs something to hold on to.

512
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,040
That's how you grow.

513
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,950
That applies here too, I think.

514
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,400
If you know an order is wrong,

515
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,560
but don't stand up due to rank.

516
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,790
Isn't that missing the point?

517
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,630
Zhao Jiadi,

518
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,720
I'm not here to change your mind,

519
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,310
but to give you a new perspective.

520
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,470
I saw it back at your interview.

521
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,280
You're an idealist.

522
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,470
Risheng isn't your dream company.

523
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,920
I was just like you when I started out.

524
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,830
But now I think,

525
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,190
real maturity

526
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,120
lies in recognizing the shades of gray,

527
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,830
blending in, and accepting it,

528
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,470
then turning it
into your own experience.

529
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,310
Whether you get changed by it,

530
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,470
that's up to your skills.

531
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,350
If you can change it,

532
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,470
that's your vision.

533
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,760
But you're not a full-time hire yet.

534
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,720
You can see it this way,

535
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,470
your probation period
is longer than others,

536
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,120
and the bar is set differently too.

537
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
If during probation,

538
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,600
you can't handle your relationship
with your boss.

539
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,280
No matter how talented you are,

540
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,080
Risheng just won't keep you on.

541
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,280
So, what do you think, Zhao Jiadi?

542
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,920
Do you dare to join Risheng?

543
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,400
Will it change you,

544
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
or will you change it?

545
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,920
Can I ask something?

546
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,120
Who would be my boss?

547
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,600
Lin Peng, the manager.

548
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
The one who kept cutting you off
in the interview.

549
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,400
There's something you should know.

550
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,720
During the meeting,

551
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,880
we all agreed on one thing.

552
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,990
You weren't going to make it.

553
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,120
The only person who spoke up for you

554
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,310
was actually Manager Lin.

555
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,990
Sorry, everyone.

556
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,310
Flush.

557
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,990
Boss, you're on fire today.

558
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,150
All my article fees

559
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,440
are gone now.

560
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,880
Didn't you notice
Mr. Wei was going easy on us?

561
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,400
You don't know the half of it.

562
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,280
Back when we played cards with him,

563
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,040
I never won a single round in this room.

564
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,080
Don't be ridiculous.

565
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,080
It's just a card game, after all.

566
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,720
There's really no need to go easy.

567
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,600
Your boss just plays really well.

568
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,600
Yeah.

569
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,150
But this table money isn't much.

570
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,990
If you want real cash, learn from Hai.

571
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,280
Absolutely, that's for sure.

572
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,350
Lately, diesel prices have been good.

573
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,470
The factory must be doing alright now.

574
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,560
For private companies like ours,

575
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,630
surviving is already a win.

576
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,150
You're too humble.

577
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,040
Mr. Wei,

578
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,190
as your friend, let me say this.

579
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,510
If you get a big opportunity,

580
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,400
you have to bring us along.

581
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,990
Exactly.

582
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,400
Gotta bring us along.

583
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm just an employee.

584
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,510
Everyone knows that.

585
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,510
Don't listen to the rumors out there.

586
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,510
See, this is what annoys me about him.

587
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,150
What's Mr. Li's granddaughter's name?

588
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,120
Li Zhijin.

589
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Right.

590
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,560
Didn't she start her own fund company?

591
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,350
It's already come to this point,

592
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,950
but Mr. Li still won't let
her run the company.

593
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,670
Isn't that pretty clear?

594
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,670
Is it really that obvious?

595
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,760
Isn't it?

596
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,720
Isn't it?

597
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,670
Doesn't even matter.

598
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,790
Still pretending, huh?

599
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,470
Who's not aware
you're Mr. Li's future son-in-law?

600
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,990
You're carrying the Li Group name.

601
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,470
You're its future boss.

602
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,440
Always acting so humble with us.

603
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,950
Place your bets, let's keep going.

604
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,560
Mr. Wei,

605
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,830
I need to be upfront here.

606
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,310
We all know you stashed a shipment of goods

607
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,190
in the high seas.

608
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880
At a time like this,

609
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,350
calling us together

610
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,920
shows you really value us.

611
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,120
Let me make my position clear.

612
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,470
If there's money to make,

613
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,120
I'm in, no questions asked.

614
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,990
Just let me know

615
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,510
what word you want out there.

616
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,790
Within a week,

617
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,670
consider it done.

618
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,950
This guy

619
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,120
usually quiet as can be.

620
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,190
But the minute money's mentioned,

621
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,950
he gets excited.

622
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,510
I'm in too.

623
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,440
Count me in as well.

624
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,550
We haven't even dealt all the cards.

625
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,440
That's a big blind bet so early.

626
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,550
Isn't that a bit risky?

627
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,760
Don't worry about it.

628
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,760
We're all in by choice.

629
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,990
Yeah, we all agreed to this.

630
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,390
No one's forcing us.

631
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,760
To be honest,

632
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,190
I invited everyone today

633
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,350
because I need a favor.

634
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,230
Go ahead.

635
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,320
It's about that shipment of mine.

636
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,510
The port's really strict right now.

637
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,510
My goods need to go south first,

638
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,760
take a detour, then come back.

639
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,600
So for the road connections,

640
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,960
I'm hoping

641
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,160
you can help, boss.

642
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,960
Don't worry about it.

643
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,120
I've got this covered.

644
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,280
I'll get it done in a few days.

645
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,080
Yeah.

646
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,760
And about your factory's goods,

647
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,350
plus the goods
from your friends' factories,

648
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,760
hold off on selling them for now.

649
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,160
Wait until oil prices go up.

650
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,960
I'll let you know.

651
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,280
I trust you.

652
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,440
Come on, keep playing.

653
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
- Keep playing.
- Yeah, keep going.

654
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,920
Want to make money?

655
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,760
You gotta stick with Hai.

656
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,600
- That's right.
- Follow Hai.

657
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,600
Chen Qingzhi, the white horse rider.

658
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,320
From Zhao Jiadi.

659
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,550
Guoguo.

660
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,160
Who's Zhao Jiadi?

661
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,350
He's Qiang's private tutor.

662
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,760
He's super talented.

663
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,710
He plays Go and does the Math Olympiad.

664
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,710
Honestly, he teaches better
than our teachers.

665
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,510
Really?

666
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,230
Guoguo,

667
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,550
isn't it time for your English class?

668
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,080
Come on, tell us.

669
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,760
Zhao Jiadi,

670
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:51,830
who is he?

671
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,830
You just heard it earlier.

672
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,760
He was Qiang's previous tutor.

673
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,990
[Ji Jie]
Wait, that's not right.

674
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,800
Someone was super impressive
at the docks recently.

675
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
It was all for that one person.

676
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,830
Picking up all the wrong habits,

677
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,920
just following Luoshen's nonsense.

678
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm really out of options here.

679
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,320
All I do is handle
daily chores every day.

680
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,550
And I still have to balance
two families.

681
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,870
I only hear

682
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,800
these stories from you.

683
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm not just killing time here.

684
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,960
This is what keeps me going.

685
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,190
See? Look at that.

686
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,390
She's just like me, this troublemaker.

687
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,640
As we start talking about secrets,

688
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
she always shows up.

689
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,030
Guess where I am right now.

690
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,350
You went to find
that cold guy behind my back.

691
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,350
I can hear you, you know.

692
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,230
If I knew you all were meeting,

693
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,760
I'd have gone to Hai City too.

694
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm so over Hang City.

695
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,990
Can't even find a decent tailor here.

696
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,960
Isn't that easy to fix?

697
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Just get yourself a guy,

698
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,960
have a quick marriage and breakup,

699
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,350
then move back to Hai City.

700
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,830
You're teasing me again, aren't you?

701
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,550
I finally get it now.

702
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
Men, honestly,

703
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,960
are just so dull sometimes.

704
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,160
All those admirers around me

705
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,830
can't even match one Yang Qingdi.

706
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,550
Isn't that just perfect?

707
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,600
Now Queen Cai

708
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,510
has another Yang Qingdi by her side.

709
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,800
Tell me, isn't that unfair?

710
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,760
You and I were in it for love,

711
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,350
but she's all about her career.

712
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,600
Without trying at all,

713
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,190
she just ran into him.

714
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,030
I know.

715
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,280
Is he the one
who jumped in the river for her?

716
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,440
What river? Seriously?

717
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,760
Where'd you even hear that?

718
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,350
Hey, I spent a fortune, you know.

719
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,350
Swarovski chocolates,

720
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,230
five whole boxes.

721
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,350
You bribed Guoguo, didn't you?

722
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,960
You didn't let her have any candy.

723
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,800
That gave me an opening, you know.

724
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,550
This little one knows everything.

725
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,960
And it's not just
about jumping in the river.

726
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,760
That guy

727
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,800
is young and capable.

728
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,640
He even managed to straighten out

729
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,920
that troublemaker
from the Situ family.

730
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,510
I'll take Guoguo's phone away.

731
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,830
Parents shouldn't be so controlling.

732
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,120
Just talk it out, okay?

733
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,990
You and that little genius...

734
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,760
Is there something going on there?

735
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,760
No, nothing at all.

736
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,510
I just think he's got real potential.

737

He'll definitely go far one day.

You said it yourself.

740
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,120
So if I go see him next time,

741
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,510
don't get jealous, okay?

742
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,030
Stop being ridiculous.

Can you give me his contact info?

748
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,390
No way. Don't even think about it.

why are you so interested in Zhao Jiadi?

I asked you just now.

762
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,550
You said it yourself.

763
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,710
It has nothing to do with him.

764
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,510
So what should I do now?

765
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,510
