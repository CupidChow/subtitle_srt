00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,990
I called the police.

195
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,640
Ms. Cai,

196
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
the police are here.
Let them handle this.

197
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,430
Would you mind joining me?

198
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,110
Let's talk over there.

199
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,640
I'll wait for you there.

200
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,830
Boss.

201
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,800
Go help the police
with investigation.

202
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,670
Alright, let's leave.

203
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,110
Everyone, break it up.

204
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,320
Get back to work.

205
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,670
Cai Yanzhi.

206
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,670
I'm warning you.

207
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,560
Don't get too cocky.

208
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,750
Remember,

209
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,960
everything you own
came from Yang Qingdi.

210
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,320
Even if he changed his name,

211
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,350
he's still part of the Chen Family.

212
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,830
One day, I'll take it all back.

213
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,720
The Chen Family
is getting shameless lately.

214
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,880
Not just you, Ms. Cai,

215
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,880
even I can't stand watching this.

216
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,350
No need for niceties here.

217
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,270
Cut to the chase.

218
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,350
After Yang Qingdi passed away,

219
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,400
his business was split in two.

220
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,190
You handle shipping,

221
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,350
the Chen Family takes the mining.

222
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,240
Both sides want the upper hand,

223
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,040
but at best, we'll be back to half of

224
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,240
what Yang Qingdi owned before.

225
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,350
Even if you're that capable,

226
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,240
there will be tough moments too.

227
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,510
You know my group's pull

228
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,480
at the mining site.

229
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,510
If you ever need anything,

230
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,320
I'm willing to help you out.

231
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,590
Chen Zhuhe flatters you nonstop.

232
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,750
You two should be working together.

233
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,960
Yet here you are,
turning cold in minutes.

234
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,480
With your attitude,

235
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,640
I'd rather not work with you.

236
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,430
If someone else said that,

237
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,160
maybe I'd let it go.

238
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,080
But coming from you, Ms. Cai,

239
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,160
I really don't get it.

240
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,040
Mr. Yang passed away early,

241
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,430
yet you managed to hold onto
half his legacy.

242
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,240
The methods you used...

243
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,880
I think we both know them well.

244
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,040
I always believed

245
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,240
it's survival of the fittest.

246
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,080
Working with strong partners

247
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,240
is our shared belief.

248
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,590
The only business we can do together

249
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,960
is at the mining site.

250
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,660
No one gets up early for nothing.

251
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,960
So tell me,

252
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,350
what do you want from me?

253
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,480
I'll be straight with you.

254
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,430
Everyone knows about

255
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,510
Li Group's ties to Jinhai.

256
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,560
There's nothing to hide.

257
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,800
Now Zhao Xin

258
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,350
wants a piece of the mining site.

259
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,640
As long as he dares to show up,

260
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,350
I'd make sure

261
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,400
he gets nothing.

262
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,640
Maybe, at some point,

263
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,160
I'll need a little help from you.

264
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,990
Also,

265
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,240
defeating Zhao Xin

266
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
must have been Mr. Yang's last wish.

267
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,800
Has Jinhai's recent trouble
got anything to do with you?

268
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,510
I just got back from Tang City.

269
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,480
But does it really matter

270
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,190
if I'm involved or not?

271
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,240
I don't care what happens to Zhao Xin.

272
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,320
But if your moves

273
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,590
end up hurting Zhao Jiadi,

274
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,960
don't blame me for what happens next.

275
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,240
A rookie who got kicked out.

276
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,400
What makes him so special

277
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,640
that you favor him?

278
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,270
If...

279
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,190
And that's a big if.

280
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
If I go after Zhao Jiadi,

281
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
what would you do?

282
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,880
In your eyes, Zhao Jiadi

283
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,190
is just like these pebbles
on the ground,

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,990
not worth a thing.

285
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,240
But if you pick one up,

286
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,880
what do you think will happen?

287
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,110
Let's call it a day for now.

288
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Ms. Cai.

289
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
I hope you seriously consider my offer.

290
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,320
Looking forward to working with you.

291
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,480
[Hai City]

292
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,320
Uncle.

293
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,720
[Shang Bao]

294
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Where's your stuff?

295
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,910
You didn't bring anything?

296
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,590
Well, I'm here to join you.

297
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,720
What do you mean?

298
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,640
Never mind.

299
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,560
Let's go to my place first.

300
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,960
Let's go.

301
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,510
Why did you lose so much weight?

302
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,040
Not eating well, huh?

303
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,990
Don't judge this car by its size.

304
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,960
It's got everything you need.

305
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
Let's go, Uncle.

306
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Triplet with a single.

307
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,960
Follow or not?

308
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,560
If not, I won.

309
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,830
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,880
Time to collect the cash.

311
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm speechless.

312
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,750
I'll give you ten...

313
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,720
Uncle, we're here.

314
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,240
Hello, Uncle Zhao.

315
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,510
Hello, Uncle Zhao.

316
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,670
Just call me by my name.

317
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,270
My name's Zhao Jiadi.

318
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,240
Didn't I tell you to clean up?

319
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,960
Why still playing?

320
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,430
Take a seat and rest for a bit.

321
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,750
Hei.

322
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,400
- Where's Zhang's clothes?
- Thanks.

323
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,640
Where did you put them?

324
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,430
Right here.

325
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,800
You could've said something.

326
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,960
Don't worry, Bao.

327
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
I washed everything already.

328
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,400
These are from my old coworker.

329
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,430
He's about your size.

330
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,400
Just use them for now.

331
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,640
We wear the same shoe size.

332
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,240
Wear these...

333
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,110
I'll get you another one.

334
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,910
No need.

335
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,560
These are just fine.

336
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,750
Bao.

337
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,040
Didn't you say your uncle was a big shot?

338
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,800
How come he ended up

339
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,670
asking us for clothes here?

340
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,640
If you stay quiet,

341
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,990
no one will think you can't speak.

342
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,960
Did he do something wrong

343
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,320
and come here to hide?

344
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,830
We can't let that happen.

345
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,830
Don't drag us down.

346
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,590
Listen to me,

347
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,110
big shots don't always

348
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,270
do the right thing.

349
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,080
Look at the blood on him,

350
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,480
no idea how it got there.

351
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
Hua, I...!

352
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,800
Bao.

353
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,400
Human blood.

354
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,350
From my buddy.

355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,990
You do your thing first.

356
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,350
I'm heading out for a walk.

357
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
Uncle, he's always like this.

358
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,590
Don't take it to heart.

359
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,800
Sit here and get some rest.

360
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,960
I'll go rent a place for you.

361
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,990
I'll be back soon.

362
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,590
Bao.

363
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
Why not let Uncle Zhao stay here?

364
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,750
It's fine to stay here.

365
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,480
Step aside.
I've already got someone lined up.

366
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,270
Just need to say hi.

367
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,960
Uncle, I'll go check on them.

368
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,480
Did he come with you?

369
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,160
No.

370
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,320
Do you have any spare cash?

371
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,110
Can I borrow some?

372
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,720
I'll pay you back once I get paid.

373
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,160
Yeah.

374
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,590
Bao.

375
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,800
Where did you even get this from?

376
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,640
You guys don't mind the smell?

377
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,240
It's pretty safe.

378
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,960
Thanks, bro.

379
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,640
No problem.

380
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,190
As usual, keep a low profile.

381
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,190
Don't let boss find out.

382
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,670
I'll go with him.

383
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,320
Keep it quietly.

384
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,510
Uncle.

385
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,470
Bao,

386
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,000
just be honest with me.

387
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,950
Did everyone get their share

388
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,600
after Jinhai bought our startup?

389
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,000
Did you get nothing?

390
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,680
Uncle,

391
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,440
stop talk about it.

392
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,390
No need to rent a place.

393
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,120
I'll just stay here. It's nice.

394
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,630
I'll go explain to them.

395
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,630
Uncle,

396
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,950
I've got money.

397
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,600
I mean it.

398
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,000
I want to spend it on you.

399
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,760
It makes me happy.

400
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,470
Bao.

401
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,600
Uncle, I know
you're not feeling good now.

402
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,000
But it's exactly at times like this

403
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,390
that you need to take care of yourself.

404
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,390
Eat well and get enough sleep.

405
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,470
I can't do much else to help,

406
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,950
but on this, you have to trust me.

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Go upstairs and get some rest.

408
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,550
I'll be back soon.

409
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,440
Dad.

410
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,710
I've wrapped up everything
at the company.

411
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,280
I'll...

412
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,600
leave tomorrow.

413
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,360
Come on, sit down.

414
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,840
Is it decided?

415
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,790
With Baliang gone from Jinhai,

416
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,520
there's no point

417
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,120
in me staying here.

418
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,470
Before your father got into trouble,

419
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,280
he asked me to look after you.

420
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,950
If you want to leave now,

421
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,470
I can give you

422
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,550
half of

423
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,840
Jinhai's assets

424
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,080
as your dowry.

425
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,280
Dad,

426
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,470
I've already received so much from you.

427
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,120
You've always treated me like your own.

428
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Actually,

429
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm the one who let you down.

430
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,920
You're starting your business now.

431
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,870
Have you picked a name for the company?

432
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,680
Jinchao.

433
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,950
Jinchao.

434
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,150
Nice name.

435
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,150
In the future,

436
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,760
you won't compete with Jinhai,

437
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
right?

438
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,840
Of course not.

439
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,230
Dad.

440
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,760
I'll let you go back to work.

441
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,360
I need to go tidy up a bit more.

442
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,280
Hey, kid.

443
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,520
If you really leave,

444
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,150
I'll be all alone,

445
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,470
left by myself here.

446
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,000
The doctor said

447
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,790
you shouldn't overdo it.

448
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,310
Make sure to rest up.

449
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,080
Finally, you made it.

450
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,600
Why stand there? Come in.

451
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,840
Uncle.

452
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,630
This is the old town.

453
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,870
The power goes out a lot here.

454
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,470
Let's just deal with it for now.

455
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,520
Uncle.

456
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,950
About Ke...

457
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,630
Enough talk.

458
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,550
Let's drink.

459
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,680
Hear me out first.

460
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,390
Yang already visited him.

461
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,680
Ke is gonna be fine.

462
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,920
In a few days,

463
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,120
he'll move to the general ward.

464
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,920
Uncle,

465
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,080
no one blames you
for what happened to Ke.

466
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,550
If someone did blame you,

467
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,080
they wouldn't be real friends.

468
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,080
Everyone gets it.

469
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,950
We know you'll stand up for Ke.

470
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,080
It's just a matter of time.

471
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,230
I still mean what I said.

472
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,840
If there's anything I can do,

473
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,150
just let me know.

474
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,950
It's good

475
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,030
that he got lucky this time.

476
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,150
Yeah, no kidding.

477
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,550
He survived something big.

478
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,600
He's bound to catch a break.

479
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
I'll make sure to tell him that.

480
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,600
If he makes it big,

481
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,920
don't leave us behind.

482
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,840
Uncle,

483
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,150
what's your next move?

484
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,950
When I left Jinhai,

485
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,920
I told Zhao Xin

486
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,440
I'd get Ke's stuff back.

487
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,030
But I haven't figured out

488
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,870
how to actually do it.

489
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
If you're unsure,
let's earn some cash first.

490
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,120
That project with Zhang

491
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,080
was pretty profitable, right?

492
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,600
Ask around in the QQ Group again.

493
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,550
See if there's anything else.

494
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,920
Let's just make money for now.

495
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,920
Bao,

496
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,520
it's not about the money

497
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,790
or Jinhai.

498
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,920
Neither?

499
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,710
Then what is it?

500
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,470
Uncle,

501
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,790
do you know
what I've admired most about you,

502
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,550
ever since I was a kid?

503
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,680
I can't really put it into words.

504
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,680
It's just this energy you have

505
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,120
that makes everyone
feel safe around you.

506
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,000
When things get to you,

507
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
nothing's ever a big deal.

508
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,950
When hauling those bags,

509
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,840
you told me,

510
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,510
"Even if people push you down,

511
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,030
you still have to stand tall and bloom.

512
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,800
When life hits you hard,

513
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
you've got to fight back."

514
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,990
Have you forgotten all this?

515
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,830
The old school principal's saying,

516
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,710
not mine.

517
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,710
Does that really matter?

518
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,120
As long as it makes sense, right?

519
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,160
And that thing Mr. Huang taught us,

520
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
"The Yellow River never flows backward.

521
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,550
Worrying till your hair
turns white won't help.

522
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,440
If you lose money,
you can earn more.

523
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,550
Being happy
is what really matters in life."

524
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,600
This poem is called Bring in the Wine.

525
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,280
I always tell you to read more books,

526
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,120
but you never listen.

527
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,120
I will, from now on.

528
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,390
See?

529
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,280
The power is back.

530
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,320
It's all just fate.

531
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,120
Even the heavens think you've got this.

532
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,320
You're really talkative.

533
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,030
Come on, have a drink.

534
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,230
It's so late
and someone's still calling.

535
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,160
Ms. Cai.

536
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,080
Did you just arrive in Hai City?

537
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,600
Send me your address.

538
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,120
I already heard about Jinhai.

539
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,160
I need to tell you something.

540
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,230
It's useful for you.

541
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,390
Okay, Ms. Cai.

542
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,640
I'll send you the address.

543
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,710
Someone once said, "To build a career,

544
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,160
you need five types of support.

545
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,830
First, someone influential
to back you up.

546
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,030
Second, wise guidance from a mentor.

547
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,760
Third, blessings from your family.

548
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,800
Fourth, your own hard work.

549
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,350
Fifth, a little pressure
from your rivals."

550
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,520
[Five types of support]

551
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,230
These days,

552
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,480
my stay at Jinhai
wasn't exactly pleasant,

553
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,760
but it did open my eyes to a few things.

554
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,990
I used to always think

555
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,760
that true earners

556
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,190
don't think about money,

557
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,550
but higher ideas instead.

558
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,280
But Zhao Xin doesn't buy that.

559
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,320
Turns out he proved himself right,

560
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,350
while I messed up.

561
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,030
But if being successful

562
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,160
means turning into someone
like Zhao Xin,

563
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,510
I'd rather not make it.

564
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,040
[Ms. Cai, old school principal,
Xu Zhenhong?]

565
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,480
Look who I found, our missing person.

566
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,390
Shouldn't I get some reward money
for this?

567
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,350
Why are you still up?

568
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,080
How else could I wait for you?

569
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Come on, spill it.

570
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,990
You've been gone so long.

571
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,190
Did you come up

572
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,760
with another amazing financial model?

573
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,030
Everyone in the group chat thinks

574
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,770
you've been climbing the social ladder,
except me.

575
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,280
Not really. Just ran into some trouble.

576
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm trying to figure it out.

577
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,440
What's there to figure out?

578
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,600
You know, ninety percent of problems

579
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,480
can be solved with money.

580
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,670
As for the other 10% of issues,

581
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,800
money can also help.

582
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,160
I know you're the boss,

583
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,600
but stop showing off your wealth.

584
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
Careful, I might try to extort you.

585
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,190
Seriously though,

586
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,440
if you have outsourcing projects,

587
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,120
just reach out to me.

588
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,440
I'm available now.

589
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,230
I saw your message in the group chat.

590
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm here to help you out.

591
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,640
Is 100,000 yuan enough?

592
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,480
What project? Send the materials first.

593
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,670
No jobs right now, just the money.

594
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
What do you mean?

595
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,510
Boss, are you trying to sponsor me?

596
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,600
[Your account received RMB 100,000.]

597
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,080
It's sent to your last payment account.

598
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,760
Think of it as an advance payment.

599
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,760
Just keep it for now.

600
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,320
I'll let you know when there's work.

601
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,960
If you dare pay me back,

602
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,830
I'll lose all respect for you. Bye.

603
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,230
There really are fools online.

604
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,480
Ms. Cai.

605
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,190
Come downstairs.

606
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,510
Right now?

607
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,600
Yeah, right now.

608
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,510
Alright, give me a minute.

609
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,600
You reek of alcohol.

610
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,320
If he signed that contract himself,

611
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,390
there's nothing we can do.

612
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,710
Jiadi.

613
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
Right now,

614
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,830
you and your friend

615
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,510
are way out of your league

616
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,510
against Zhao Xin.

617
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,390
But I get it,

618
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,120
you're young.

619
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,640
There's still a lot
you need to go through.

620
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,990
Maybe it's time to step back this once.

621
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,440
Do what you truly want.

622
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,390
Whether I deserve it doesn't matter.

623
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,120
If I promise something,
I'll see it through.

624
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,230
I'll definitely find a chance

625
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,190
to get my friend's stuff back

626
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,230
and return it to him.
