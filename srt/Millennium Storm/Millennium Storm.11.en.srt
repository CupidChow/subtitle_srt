1
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
Come play with me, little girl.

2
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,799
Let me go!

3
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,320
Let her go!

4
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,280
Let her go!

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,560
I'll count to three.

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,759
If you don't leave now,

7
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,759
don't blame me for being rough.

8
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,400
Kid, trying to play the hero?

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,640
Let's see if you're up to it.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,519
Tian, you're so cool!

11
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,200
Xia Yu, you...

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,760
Get him! Get him!

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,120
Take those two down!

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,799
Get them!

15
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,239
You...

16
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,319
Call the guys out.

17
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,079
Come out!

18
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,719
What did you just say?

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,120
Run!

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,400
After them!

21
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,519
Stop!

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,560
Stop!

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,120
Stop!

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,159
Run!

25
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,000
Stop!

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,959
Don't run!

27
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,640
Stop!

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,400
Freeze!

29
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,199
Xinyue, it's not like that.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,120
Don't go.

31
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,759
Xinyue.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,080
Xinyue.

33
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,840
We really were avoiding danger at that time.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,759
You have to believe me.

35
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,000
Even if there's something between you two,

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,199
it has nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,479
How could it have nothing to do with you?

38
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,199
Let go.

39
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,919
Xinyue.

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
There's really nothing between us.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,759
You have to believe me, I swear.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Xinyue.

43
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,360
I know before,

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,840
I wasn't a good husband.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,879
But I've really changed now.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,479
I just want to be good to you alone.

47
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,400
So right now, exactly

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,360
in what capacity are you being good to me?

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,919
I...

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,199
Our relationship,

51
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,599
does it really make things so difficult for you?

52
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,520
No.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,199
I know you're the one who wants a divorce.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,639
But I insist on staying here.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,639
So what exactly are we now?

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,280
You're my wife.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,639
You're the only woman I'll ever truly love.

58
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,560
I'm heading to the hotel first.

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,839
Make sure to have breakfast.

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,040
Hello?

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,040
Hello?

62
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,079
Tian.

63
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,959
I'm leaving now.

64
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,959
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

65
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll wait for you at the office.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Wait for me to come over.

67
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,600
Why are you crying now?

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,199
You get to chase your own dreams.

69
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,639
Isn't that a good thing?

70
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,480
Why are you crying?

71
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,759
I can't bear to part with you.

72
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,319
And Sister Wanqing.

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
Listen to what you're saying.

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,560
In the future,

75
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,560
it's not like we won't see each other again.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,839
Tian.

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,519
You won't forget me in the future, will you?

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,560
You silly girl.

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
What are you thinking about?

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,519
You're such a beautiful woman,

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,399
how could I ever forget you?

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
You remember this,

83
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,879
you've supported me before.

84
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,439
Yeah.

85
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,680
If you forget me,

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,199
you'll be at a real loss.

87
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:46,879
Of course.

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,839
I'm just worried you'll get famous

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
and pretend you don't know me.

90
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,319
That will never happen.

91
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,399
Well then, I...

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,399
I'm leaving.

93
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:55,959
Okay.

94
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,399
Take care of yourself.

95
00:05:59,319 --> 00:05:59,879
Okay.

96
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,519
What crazy idea are you thinking of this time?

97
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,959
You really know me well.

98
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,800
I was just thinking,

99
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,199
right now, our company

100
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,160
is actually developing pretty well.

101
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,839
But if we want to compete with Tianming Group,

102
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,839
we're still a bit too slow.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,399
So I want to make a

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,920
game that can lead the whole country.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,759
Sounds good.

106
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,279
I support you.

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,160
Really.

108
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,160
Of course.

109
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,800
Then I'll give it my all.

110
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,839
Our Ping An Story

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,000
We must create more innovative gameplay.

113
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,360
We want players to

114
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,399
be able to choose

115
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,040
more characters.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,519
What's important is

117
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,680
that between characters

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,360
there should be cooperation.

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,639
We want them

120
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,879
to complete more challenging game content.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,560
Alright.

122
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,120
Next, let me introduce

123
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,600
a brand new game mode.

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,360
3D.

125
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,000
As single-player games decline,

126
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,519
the era of online games

127
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,240
has officially arrived.

128
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,079
Now, customers

129
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,720
demand even better graphics.

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,839
So we

131
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,439
must achieve effects as realistic as real objects.

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,920
We need to give them a better gaming experience.

133
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,120
Mm.

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,519
From now on,

135
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,480
we can't operate like a small workshop anymore.

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
We can't keep running things this way.

137
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,240
This way is really too slow.

138
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,920
The market is changing too fast.

139
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,160
We need to speed up as well.

140
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,800
Liu Yu,

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,360
Yang Yang,

142
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,319
from now on, you two will be the main force.

143
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,519
I will fully train you.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Okay.

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,399
Next,

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,639
I'll show you

147
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,399
the process of creating female characters.

148
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,879
Pay close attention.

149
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Latest news

150
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,879
Li Tian is going to develop a 3D game

151
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,919
3D

152
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,480
We're the only ones in the country

153
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,360
who have just brought in 3D technology experts

154
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,559
I didn't expect

155
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
Li Tian caught up right after

156
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,799
Li Tian

157
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,720
just insists on going against me

158
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,039
Hello.

159
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,960
Li Tian.

160
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,159
Stop wasting your energy.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,399
No matter how hard you try,

162
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,799
you'll never surpass Tianming.

163
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,960
All the top 3D talent in the country

164
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,639
have already partnered with Tianming.

165
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,080
You're pretty well-informed.

166
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,559
Looks like Zhang Liang

167
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,559
is still quite afraid of our Qianxi.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Qianxi is nothing special.

169
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,039
You’re nothing compared to Mr. Zhang.

170
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,360
You want to make a 3D game,

171
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,240
and so do we.

172
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,960
So you called me

173
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,000
just to provoke me?

174
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,919
I just wanted to tell you

175
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,200
that you can never beat Mr. Zhang.

176
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,080
He’s more talented than you,

177
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,480
has more power than you,

178
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,519
and most importantly,

179
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,000
he’s already prepared

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,080
to completely crush Qianxi.

181
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,600
If you don’t want Qianxi to be utterly defeated,

182
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,159
I advise you

183
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,519
to give up on competing in 3D games as soon as possible.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,039
That’s just the kind of person I am—

185
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,519
naturally rebellious.

186
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,879
The more you tell me not to do something,

187
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,000
the more I want to do it.

188
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,120
Then let’s wait and see.

189
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,639
Let’s see whether Tianming or Qianxi

190
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,039
will have the last laugh.
