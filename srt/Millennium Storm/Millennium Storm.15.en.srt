1
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,799
Xinyue

2
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,840
Are you okay?

3
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,120
I'm fine.

4
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,719
Li Tian is such a jerk.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
He just can't change his bad ways.

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,239
He was only pretending to be better lately.

7
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,840
Now his true colors are showing.

8
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,799
So what are you trying to say?

9
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,959
Xinyue

10
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,280
Li Tian doesn't deserve your love.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I like you.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,439
Whether in the past or now,

13
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,719
I've always liked you.

14
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,439
The reason I'm single

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,280
is because in my heart

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,000
there's always been a place for you.

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,239
Can you give me a chance?

18
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,280
I can't say yes.

20
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,959
It's already over between us.

21
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,920
And a long time ago,

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
I stopped liking you.

23
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,879
If today, because of what happened with Li Tian,

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
I chose to use you as an escape,

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,239
that wouldn't be fair to you.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,719
It would also be unfair.

27
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,919
I understand.

28
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,680
I respect your choice.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Thank you.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
I won't bother you again.

31
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,360
If you still consider me a friend,

32
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,360
remember to come to me if you need help.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,319
Okay.

34
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,599
I never sent you any messages.

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,719
Don't you think all of this is really strange?

36
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,159
It's like someone

37
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,960
is deliberately setting me up.

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,439
What are you doing?

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,719
Speak.

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,680
I...

41
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,439
I...

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,719
Brother Tian.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,759
Mr. Li.

44
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,719
Liu Yu.

45
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,520
It really is you.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,560
Why did you frame me?

47
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,639
I didn't.

48
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,479
You didn't?

49
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,280
What you just did

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,599
was all recorded on surveillance.

51
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,680
It's all on the USB drive.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,319
Do you want me to hand it over to the police?

53
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Li. I was wrong.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
Please don't turn me in to the police.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
Mr. Li has been so good to you.

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,759
Why did you harm him?

57
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,039
Zhang Liang forced me to do it.

58
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,400
My mother is still sick.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
She needs someone to take care of her.

60
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,199
He gave me a lot of money.

61
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,680
I had no choice.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,039
About your mother,

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
why didn't you tell me?

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
I could have helped you too.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,159
I've let everyone down.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,840
Get up.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,599
Get up.

69
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,919
I'm sorry, Xia Yu.

70
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,639
I'll find a way to help with your mother's situation.

71
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,800
Get up.

72
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,360
As long as you've done something wrong,

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
you still have to bear legal responsibility.

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Let's go.

75
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,639
Happy birthday to you

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,639
Happy birthday to you

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,759
Xinyue

78
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,639
Happy birthday to you

79
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,959
Xinyue

80
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,759
I know you don't believe me

81
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,040
But I really have changed

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,680
I'll show you how I've changed

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm sorry, Xinyue

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,439
I failed to protect you

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,680
I think this outfit is a bit tight

86
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,120
No

87
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,279
It's just right

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,959
And this

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,319
This is all the money I earned this month

90
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,879
I'm giving it all to you to keep

91
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,759
From now on

92
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,199
I'll earn even more money

93
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:06,959
You

94
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,439
You won't have to work so hard anymore

95
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,439
You're my wife

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
You're the only woman I'll ever truly love

97
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,480
He told me to leave you

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I never will

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,519
I would never start a business by selling my wife

100
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,040
Xinyue

101
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,199
Thank you for these five years

102
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,160
For never giving up on me

103
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,399
The old me

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,079
Really wasn't a good person

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
Thank you

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,519
For being willing to marry someone as terrible as me

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,199
Honey

108
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,600
Everything has been investigated and made clear

109
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,079
I know.

110
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,079
What's done is done.

111
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,279
It has already hurt you.

112
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
I really don't know how to make it up to you.

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,079
I just hope

114
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,680
you can forgive me.

115
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,360
Please, don't divorce me, okay?

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Honey.

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Darling.

118
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,800
Are you hungry?

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,639
Let me make you a bowl of noodles.

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,399
Honey.

121
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
Thank you, dear.

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
You can forgive me.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,199
Trust me.

124
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,839
Darling.

125
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,079
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,120
I didn't believe you right away about this.

127
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,759
You were a victim too.

128
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,560
You also needed comfort.

129
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,680
Don't blame yourself.

130
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,439
This has nothing to do with you.

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
Honey.

132
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,399
From now on,

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,199
no matter what happens,

134
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,040
I will always trust you unconditionally.

135
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,399
And I will always be on your side.

136
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,480
A breaking entertainment news update today.

137
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,079
The widely discussed

138
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,839
Xia Yu scandal has taken a turn.

139
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,199
According to police investigation,

140
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,040
an employee of Qianxi Company, Liu,

141
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,040
was instructed by a business competitor

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,920
to maliciously drug the drinks of Xia Yu and Li Tian.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,360
This caused both to become victims of the incident.

144
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,160
The police now have evidence

145
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,800
and have arrested Liu according to the law.

146
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,279
Li Tian.

147
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,399
Next time, you won't be so lucky.

148
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you, honey.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,759
Breakfast is here.

150
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Try it quickly.

151
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,679
Mm.

152
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,440
Is it good?

153
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,039
It's good.

154
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,639
It's been a while since "Peaceful Story" was released.

155
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,759
Aren't you thinking about developing a new game?

156
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,919
My wife is getting better and better.

157
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,759
You even think about my future now.

158
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,720
Of course.

159
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,759
Hello, Jun.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,159
Tian, hurry back to the company.

161
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,240
Something happened at the company.

162
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
What happened?

163
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,000
They say our "Ping'an Story" plagiarized "Brave Ones."

164
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,759
Plagiarized?

165
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,720
That's not all.

166
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
It's all over the internet now.

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,159
Okay, wait for me, I'll be right back.

168
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,879
What's wrong?

169
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,759
Something happened at the company.

170
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,720
I need to go handle it.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Don't worry.

172
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,279
It's nothing serious.

173
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,720
Okay.

174
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,360
Be careful.

175
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,759
Alright.

176
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,399
Okay.

177
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,000
Millennium Company, which claims to be the top original developer in the country,

178
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
has its game "Ping'an Story" accused of plagiarizing "Brave Ones."

179
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,840
Tell me,

180
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,840
isn't that ridiculous?

181
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Ridiculous.

182
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,120
Absolutely ridiculous.

183
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Boycott plagiarism.

184
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,960
Boycott plagiarism.

185
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,720
Boycott plagiarism.

186
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,320
Li Tian.

187
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,120
You have the nerve to plagiarize,

188
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,559
but not the guts to come out

189
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
and give us loyal players

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,000
an explanation?

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Give us an explanation.

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,639
Give us an explanation.
