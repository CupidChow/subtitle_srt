1
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,200
I've already got what you wanted.

2
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,200
What about mine?

3
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,320
I've already drafted the contract.

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,079
Pleasure working with you.

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,920
I hope that when the time comes,

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,040
you'll keep your promise.

7
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,719
What's going on here?

8
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,879
The character design concept for Guardian.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,959
Why is it exactly the same as Dream Journey of Heartmoon?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,799
I don't know.

11
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,959
Then last night,

12
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,560
did you see anyone suspicious

13
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,879
come to my office?

14
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,560
I'm not sure.

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I'll go check now.

16
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,800
That's right.

17
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,280
I was the one who gave the information to Zhang Liang.

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,199
Why?

19
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,319
When you had nothing,

20
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,520
I was the one by your side.

21
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,879
When you had no money,

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,319
I gave it to you.

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,479
When you had no connections,

24
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,039
I gave them to you.

25
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,400
When you argued with your wife,

26
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,360
I was always the one comforting you.

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,919
Now you have everything.

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Your relationship is going well too.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
And now you just want to kick me aside.

30
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,840
When did I ever want to kick you aside?

31
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,879
Wanqing.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,960
I never thought you would misunderstand me this much.

33
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,400
Misunderstand?

34
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,840
Li Tian.

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
I do like you.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,800
Even knowing you have a wife,

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
I still like you.

38
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,680
But I just can't control it.

39
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm being pathetic.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
I can lose to her in love.

41
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,039
But I just can't understand

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
why you brought her into the company.

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
And now you're pushing me out at work too.

44
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,800
What do you take me for?

45
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,159
Wanqing, don't get so worked up.

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
We've been through so much together.

47
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,960
Is there anything we can't solve together?

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,159
Let go of me.

49
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,919
Lin Wanqing.

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,120
Li Tian.

51
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,879
I'm officially announcing now

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,400
that I'm leaving Qianxi Company.

53
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,639
Come on,

54
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,800
let's welcome our Director Lin

55
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,000
to join Tianming Group.

56
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,240
Hello, everyone.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,439
I'm Lin Wanqing.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,400
From now on, we'll be colleagues.

59
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,120
I look forward to working with you all.

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Li

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
We can't pay this month's salaries anymore.

62
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,040
Most of last month's salaries are still owed to the staff.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,199
Let's dissolve the company.

64
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,040
Is there really no other way to save us?

65
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,439
At this point, there's nothing else we can do.

66
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,399
We invested all our funds

67
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,800
into Xinyue Dream Journey.

68
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,079
We even signed a partnership agreement with Fengxue.

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,519
Now the game data has been leaked.

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,560
We can't afford the penalty for breach of contract.

71
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,480
We can only use all our game assets

72
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,240
as collateral to Fengxue.

73
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,959
I'm sorry, Xinyue.

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
I've let you down.

75
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
This isn't your fault.

76
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,360
How could Sister Wanqing betray Qianxi?

77
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,480
Is there some kind of misunderstanding here?

78
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,480
There's no misunderstanding.

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
She admitted it to me herself.

80
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,319
She even went to work at Tianming.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,360
Honey,

82
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,639
at worst, we can just start over.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Life is full of ups and downs.

84
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,360
But no matter what happens,

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,040
I'll always be by your side.

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,959
I'll help you make a comeback.

87
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,279
Brother Tian,

88
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,040
I support you too.

89
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,079
Mr. Li,

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,079
I support you as well.

91
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,199
Gather everyone

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,040
for a meeting.

93
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,800
Our Millennium Company

94
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,160
is very fortunate

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,680
to have everyone's companionship and support.

96
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,439
However, our company

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,920
due to work-related mistakes

98
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,399
is now unable to operate normally anymore.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,279
But everyone, please rest assured,

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,360
I will have the HR department

101
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,000
issue back pay for the past two months' salaries.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
Thank you for your hard work.

103
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,519
President Li,

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,519
Xin Yue Meng Lv is everyone's hard work.

105
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,319
Are we really going to give up just like this?

106
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,959
We all know very well.

107
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,279
If we keep working on Heart Moon Dream Journey,

108
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,600
it still won't help.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,360
We can still make changes.

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,199
We can build on this foundation

111
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,920
and create a version even better than the first Heart Moon Dream Journey.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,000
A better game.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,959
Yes.

114
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,360
That's right.

115
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,879
We can revise it.

116
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,959
Yes, exactly.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
But the company

118
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,360
can no longer afford to pay everyone's salaries.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,279
I'm willing to stay and work on Heart Moon Dream Journey.

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,879
Millennium Company

121
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,920
has given me so many happy memories.

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,800
I don't want to see it just disappear.

123
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,920
I believe

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,279
if we hold on for two more months,

125
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,800
the revised Heart Moon Dream Journey

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,639
will be even better.

127
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,279
I'm willing too.

128
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm willing.

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Me too.

130
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm willing.

131
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,199
Me too.

132
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm willing.

133
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Me too.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,720
Me too.

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,439
Me too.

136
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,319
I'm willing.

137
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,920
The company is truly lucky

138
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,680
to have had you all by its side.

139
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,120
However,

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
I really won't force anyone.

141
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
Those who want to stay can stay.

142
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,600
If you don't want to stay,

143
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,079
I'll have HR

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
pay you the back wages for the past two months.

145
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,240
Today

146
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
It's really lively.

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,519
What are you doing here?

148
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,439
Miss Xia Yu, there's no need to be hostile.

149
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm not your enemy.

150
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,639
I'm willing to lend you money to help you through this difficult time.

151
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,319
And

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
I don't need any interest.

153
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Why are you helping me, President Ye?

154
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,519
Because

155
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm also one of Qianxi's shareholders.

156
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,600
So

157
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,639
You admit it.

158
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,439
You were the one who provided that ten million.

159
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,240
That's right.

160
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,000
But aren't you Zhang Liang's wife?

161
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,279
What exactly is your goal?

162
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,879
Of course, I have my own plans.

163
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,000
So, what do you think?

164
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,759
This money—

165
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,879
Do you want it or not?

166
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,399
Of course.

167
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,559
Brother Tian

168
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,519
I can also contribute some funds.

169
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,000
If it weren't for Brother Tian's help back then,

170
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,120
I wouldn't be who I am today.

171
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,919
Now that you're facing difficulties,

172
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,159
as a shareholder,

173
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,240
I also have an obligation to share the hardship.

174
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,639
Don't forget,

175
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,519
I'm here too.

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,519
I'm also one of the shareholders.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
Thank you all.

178
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,039
Let me out!

179
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,440
Let go of me!

180
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
Let me out!

181
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
Who are you?

182
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,039
Zhang Liang

183
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,480
What are you going to do?

184
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,200
Your value has already been used up.

185
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,039
A discarded item

186
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,759
naturally needs to be disposed of.
