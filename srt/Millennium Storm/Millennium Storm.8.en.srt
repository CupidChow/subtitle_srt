1
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,520
Come on.

2
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
Take a look, Mr. Lin.

3
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,920
With the limited budget I had,

4
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,360
I found this office.

5
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
What do you think?

6
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,200
It's great!

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,600
Look over there.

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,840
Do you see that room?

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,560
It's so big.

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,640
Over there.

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
That's the office I prepared for you.

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,200
And as for this area,

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,120
let's give it to the tech department.

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,600
Because this spot has a great view.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,800
They can see the scenery outside the window.

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,040
It might inspire them.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,080
Where's Jun?

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,720
Jun, Jun, hurry up!

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,760
Take the guys with you

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,840
and move the computers over first.

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Be careful, everyone.

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,520
Don't drop anything.

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,400
Don't worry.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,240
Slow down, slow down.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,880
Is it this one?

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,840
I'll help move things too.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,160
Alright.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,560
I've already set up your workstation.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,440
I think this spot is good.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,320
The feng shui here is great.

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,840
Sounds good.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,840
This is for you.

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
I love it.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Go ahead.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,800
That's wonderful.

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
That's great.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,960
Okay.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Yay!

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,920
Lift your foot.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,120
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
Go sleep in the bedroom.

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,280
Don't get the wrong idea.

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,200
It's just that you've been so tired lately.

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,680
That's why I'm letting you have the bedroom.

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Thank you, honey.

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,240
I...

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,080
I'll go make you a late-night snack in the kitchen.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
It's so nice to have a wife.

49
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,960
Liu Yu.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,080
Remember to report in tomorrow.

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,600
Okay.

52
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,080
He has no salary requirements.

53
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
Go home and wait for our response.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Okay, thank you.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,760
Mm.

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,400
Next.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,520
Next.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,280
Next.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,000
Sooner or later, I'll acquire your company.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,960
No requirements, as long as meals are provided.

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,880
Is it possible not to work overtime?

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Are you interested in the internet industry?

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
Do you have any previous work experience?

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,240
Okay, thank you.

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,040
Congratulations, you've been hired.

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Thank you, Director Lin.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,760
Thank you, Director Li.

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,240
I won't let everyone down.

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,240
From now on, our investment focus

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
will be on

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,440
real estate,

72
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,280
film and television,

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,760
and the internet

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,400
among these three sectors.

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,320
First of all,

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
we need to focus on observing

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,160
the real estate development in first-tier cities.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,160
For example,

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,880
Beijing,

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,960
Shanghai,

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,920
Guangzhou,

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,760
and Shenzhen.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
These four cities

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
As for second- and third-tier cities,

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,399
I think we can invest

86
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,000
just a small amount of capital.

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320
We should pay special attention to

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,440
the area of Tongxian in Beijing.

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
It has now been renamed

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
Tongzhou District, Beijing.

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,800
The housing prices there

92
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,880
are currently similar to those in second- and third-tier cities,

93
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
but the development potential

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,640
is limitless.

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,480
Alright.

96
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
Next is our

97
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,440
internet sector.

98
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,360
Invest.

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Yes, invest.

100
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,280
Yes.

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,760
Yes, invest.

102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
Invest, invest, invest.

103
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,560
Invest.

104
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,720
Mr. Li,

105
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,160
this one is worth investing in.

106
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,400
Thank you.

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,640
Here.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
I can invest.

109
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
Thank you, thank you.

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Not bad.

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,440
Hello.

112
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,040
Hello, Mr. Li.

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,080
My name is Ma Yun.

114
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,360
I think...

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,040
What did you say your name was?

116
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600
Ma Yun.

117
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
You are the Ma Yun of this era.

118
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,040
Mm.

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Mr. Li, please don't rush to refuse.

120
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,520
I think the internet is very...

121
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Invest.

122
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
We must invest.

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,160
You haven't even seen my business plan yet.

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,200
No need to see it.

125
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
I believe in your talent.

126
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
You can definitely do it.

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,240
This...

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,120
Your name...

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,280
...is proof of your...

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,440
Your era has arrived.

131
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,920
Go ahead.

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,920
No matter how much you need, I'll invest in you.

133
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,640
If there's Ma Yun,

134
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,240
then there should also be Liu...

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,360
Sister Wanqing,

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
help me find someone in Zhongguancun.

137
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
A guy with the surname Liu.

138
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,920
He should be selling CDs there.

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,400
Go tell him

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I want to invest in him.

141
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,040
Why are you investing in him?

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,120
I want to help him start a logistics company.

143
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Thirty million next year.

144
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,440
Sixty million the year after.

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,160
And the year after that...

146
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Sorry.

147
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,720
Are you crazy?

148
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,760
You must do exactly as I say.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,040
You'll understand when the time comes.

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
You're getting more and more reckless with your investments.

151
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,440
Good luck.

152
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Go ahead.

153
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Don't worry about it so much.

154
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
You must find him for me.

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,680
Go.

156
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,840
With their participation,

157
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,320
acquiring Tianming Group

158
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
will be a piece of cake.

159
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,080
Cheers!

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,960
Once again, thank you all for your hard work.

161
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,160
And thanks to President Li's strong leadership,

162
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,160
our Millennium Investment Company

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,480
has achieved outstanding results in just six months.

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
Thank you, President Li.

165
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Thank you, President Li.

166
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Hold on.

167
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,120
Hold on.

168
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
No need to thank me just yet.

169
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,480
Your bonuses

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
were all given out by President Lin.

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,880
Aren't you going to show your appreciation?

172
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
President Lin, thank you for your hard work.

173
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,520
Let me toast you first.

174
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,520
Thank you.

175
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,600
Here, President Lin.

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,080
Thank you.

177
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,760
Thank you for your hard work.

178
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,280
Here, President Lin.

179
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,040
President Lin, President Lin.

180
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,560
Let's have a drink.

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's have a drink.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,360
A toast to you.

183
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
President Lin, a toast to you.

184
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,520
Have a drink, have a drink.

186
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,360
Brother Tian

187
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,000
What's wrong?

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
Is something on your mind?

189
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,159
You can tell me.

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,640
Maybe I can help you solve it.

191
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah.

192
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
I feel like

193
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm a bit too dissatisfied.

194
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
In the past,

195
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,160
I worked hard to make money

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
just to survive.

197
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,200
Yeah.

198
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,320
But now, following you and Sister Wanqing,

199
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I've made money.

200
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,200
But I'm still not happy.

201
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,760
Why is that?

202
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,000
Actually, my dream is to be an actress.

203
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Because I want to experience different lives

204
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,200
through film and television.

205
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,600
Life is too short,

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,560
but we're always held back by reality.

207
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
Do you think

208
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm being too unrealistic?

209
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,680
Of course not.

210
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,480
You're so beautiful,

211
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
and smart too.

212
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
As long as you keep at it,

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
you'll succeed at anything.

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,160
Brother Tian

215
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,880
Hearing you say that

216
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,160
already makes me very happy.

217
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,880
Xia Yu

218
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,320
Whenever you want to leave,

219
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,920
you can do it anytime.

220
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,240
Go bravely chase your dreams.

221
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,120
Sister Wanqing and I

222
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
will always support you.

223
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
Thank you, Brother Tian.
