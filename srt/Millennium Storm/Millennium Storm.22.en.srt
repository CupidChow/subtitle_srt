1
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,560
Zhang Liang

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you going to do?

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
You've outlived your usefulness.

4
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,600
Broken things

5
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,319
naturally need to be disposed of.

6
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,359
So it was all your scheme.

7
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,480
You actually dared to trick me.

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't make it sound so harsh.

9
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,760
What you wanted

10
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,640
I've already given you everything.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,920
Don't forget,

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,799
I have evidence of your illegal dealings.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
If anything happens to me today,

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,959
this evidence

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,200
will automatically be sent to the police.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
Stop trying to scare me.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,519
Your little tricks

18
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,359
are nothing to me.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Do you really think

20
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,640
you still have that chance?

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,040
As long as you're gone,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,480
there will be no one left to testify.

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,400
Zhang Liang

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,599
Help!

25
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,159
Let go of me!

26
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,439
Let go of me!

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,599
The Chairman has great foresight.

28
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,080
He has led us to achieve excellent results.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,039
Thank you, Chairman.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
Good, good, good.

31
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,599
Thank you, Chairman.

32
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,759
Everyone has worked hard during this period.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,520
Let's keep up the good work.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,639
Don't let your guard down.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,240
Let's strive to create the next big hit.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,639
Good, good, good.

37
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,639
Come on.

38
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,560
Let me propose a toast to everyone.

39
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,599
Come on.

40
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,599
A toast to the Chairman.

41
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,439
To you.

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,879
Everyone, have fun and enjoy yourselves tonight.

43
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,479
Alright?

44
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,360
Have a great time.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
Congratulations, Mr. Zhang.

46
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,639
Defender is a huge success.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,199
It's an honor to receive praise from Mr. Li.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
It's truly an honor.

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,439
Defender

50
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,080
is indeed a very special game.

51
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,039
But I heard

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,680
that Millennium has been having some difficulties lately.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
It's close to bankruptcy.

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
That's really a shame.

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,879
But if you ask me in person,

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,719
maybe

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,840
I could consider acquiring Millennium.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,039
Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Zhang.

59
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,560
As for Millennium,

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
we won't trouble you with that.

61
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,879
As you wish.

62
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,960
I came here today

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,919
to give you a gift, Mr. Zhang.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,199
I hope you like it.

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,159
It's been so many years.

66
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,000
You still haven't learned anything.

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,719
Do you think this thing is useful to me?

68
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,040
Mr. Zhang,

69
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,360
That thing just now

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
was just the packaging

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
for the gift I wanted to give you.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
As for the gift inside the packaging,

73
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,480
there's still one more.

74
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,279
I'll give them to you one by one.

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,360
Then take it out and show me.

76
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,399
When your game launched,

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
didn't you check it carefully?

78
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,800
It's probably trending now.

79
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,560
Li Tian,

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,399
nice move.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,399
You actually tampered with our defender.

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,480
And there's this, too.

83
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,920
Listen to it.

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Sound familiar?

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,199
I want you to bring Xin Yue Meng Lü

86
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,720
and join Tian Ming together.

87
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,800
At that time,

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,959
your position

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
will be second only to mine.

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,600
You want me to steal Xin Yue Meng Lü?

91
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,480
Absolutely impossible.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,399
You can tell this is fake just by listening.

93
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,040
We're all tech people.

94
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,639
Faking this kind of recording

95
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,680
is very easy.

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,959
If you insist this is real,

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
then call her over here.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,639
Let her confront me face to face.

99
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,000
What a pity.

100
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,560
She can't confront you in person.

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,000
Because she's holding a press conference right now.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,120
Good luck.

103
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,839
What press conference?

104
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Honey,

105
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
What exactly is going on with Wanqing?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,879
Sister Wanqing,

107
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,360
Thank you for your hard work.

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,319
This is...

109
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,160
If I don't agree to work with Zhang Liang,

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,959
will he just look for another target?

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,560
I can pretend to agree to his proposal.

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
But he has informants in the company.

113
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,079
Also,

114
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
from what I know about him,

115
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,959
he is very meticulous.

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,639
If you suddenly agree,

117
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm afraid you still won't gain his trust.

118
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,920
Then we'll keep acting until he believes it.

119
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,519
Inside here

120
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,079
are all the project files.

121
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,839
I've changed some of the parameters.

122
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,839
I've also implanted a trojan in it.

123
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,959
As soon as he uses this USB drive,

124
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,519
I'll be able to access all his programs.

125
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,439
Are you okay?

126
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,920
It's okay now, it's okay.

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
Li Tian, you finally came.

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,240
Don't be afraid.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
I almost couldn't see you again.

130
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,120
It's all right now.

131
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,799
You guys are just messing around.

132
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
This was way too dangerous.

133
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
If you don't enter the tiger's den,

134
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,519
how can you catch a tiger cub?

135
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,559
Yeah.

136
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,000
Zhang Liang's good days

137
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,080
are finally over.

138
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,600
He brought this on himself.

139
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,639
He can't escape the consequences.

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,759
Leading gaming company Tianming Group

141
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,679
has declared bankruptcy due to a scandal.

142
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,159
Former Tianming Group chairman Zhang Liang

143
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,360
used despicable means to suppress competitors.

144
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,519
His reputation and public image have hit rock bottom.

145
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,679
He has yet to apologize for the incident.

146
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,240
Nor has he given any explanation.

147
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,080
Mr. Zhang

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,639
Mr. Zhang, please respond.

149
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,440
Mr. Zhang, please accept our interview.

150
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,440
Mr. Zhang

151
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,840
Come out!

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
You scum!

153
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,960
Pay back the money!

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,080
Give me back my money!

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Give us back our money!

156
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,080
Pay back the money! Pay back the money!

157
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
Get out here!

158
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,279
Pay back the money!

159
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,799
Hello, Yun-ge.

160
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,240
It's Li Tian.

161
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,759
I need to return a favor.

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,120
I've decided

163
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
to acquire Tianming Group.
