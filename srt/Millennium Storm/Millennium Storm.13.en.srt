1
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Change this part as well.

2
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,880
Okay.

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,440
Sure.

4
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,880
Here.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Optimize this a bit more.

6
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,240
Alright.

7
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,280
Thanks, you’ve worked hard.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,040
No problem.

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,320
How is it?

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,800
Sis.

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,600
Yeah?

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,800
Did you design this?

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Yes, I did, sis.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,120
It’s good.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,200
The job is done.

16
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Great, that's wonderful!

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,920
Everyone has worked hard during this time.

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
I announce

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
For the past six months,

20
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,480
everyone's performance bonus will be

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,920
doubled.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
That's fantastic!

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,960
Here,

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,960
I also want to thank my wife, Xinyue.

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,440
She has truly done so much for me.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
She has supported me wholeheartedly.

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
Thank you.

28
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,440
The production of "Ping'an Story" is complete.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Very good.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
You've worked hard during this time.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
I've transferred your payment.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Mr. Li.

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,600
What are you doing?

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,960
Oh.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm calling my mom.

36
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
You've really worked hard lately.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
It's time for you to take a long vacation.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Go spend some quality time with your family.

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,560
Mm.

40
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,320
What's wrong?

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Are you feeling unwell?

42
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,480
No.

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,440
It's just a bit hot.

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Go inside and get some rest.

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Go have some late-night snacks.

46
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,680
Mm, okay.

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,920
Come on, be careful.

48
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,680
Lift your foot.

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,040
Lift your foot.

50
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,280
Alright, be sure to be careful.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600
The road here is a bit rough.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,360
Be careful.

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
You're so annoying.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Go, go, go.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
It's okay, it's okay.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
Go, go, go.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,760
Hurry up over here.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,760
Quick, quick, quick.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
Where are we going?

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,720
Surprise.

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,200
Xinyue.

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,360
From now on,

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,360
this will be our new home.

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
This is the property deed.

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
It only has your name on it.

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,800
When did you buy it?

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
There's another surprise.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Wishing us

69
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,280
a happy fifth wedding anniversary.

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,640
Thank you, honey.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,640
Xinyue.

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
Thank you for these five years

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,840
of never giving up on me.

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,880
The old me

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,680
really wasn't a good person.

76
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
Thank you

77
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,960
for being willing to marry someone as terrible as me.

78
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,400
I still owe you a wedding

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
and a proposal ceremony.

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,920
Today,

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,840
let me make up for the proposal ceremony first.

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,280
We'll have the wedding after the company is stable.

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,760
Ms. Chu Xinyue,

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,320
will you marry Mr. Li Tian?

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,000
Mm.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
I will.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
Xiayu, Xiayu, Xiayu

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,320
Xiayu, I love you, Xiayu

89
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Xiayu, I love you

90
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
Xiayu, so beautiful

91
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,280
Xiayu, so lovely

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,520
So pretty, Xiayu

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,600
Thank you, everyone

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,640
Look at me

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Xiayu, look at me

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Today

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,480
I have some news to tell everyone

98
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,920
We have a mysterious spokesperson

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,280
coming to be the ambassador for our Peaceful Story.

100
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,560
Let's all welcome her.

101
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
Xia Yu

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Xia Yu is back.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,920
Xia Yu

104
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
Wanqing, hurry!

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,160
Wanqing

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
Long time no see.

107
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,640
You've become even more beautiful.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
No wonder you're a big star.

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
Fame really changes a person's aura.

110
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,920
Wanqing, you still know just what to say.

111
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
President Li, you're amazing.

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,680
You actually got the superstar Xia Yu

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,200
to be our game's ambassador.

114
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah.

115
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,760
I never thought I'd see Xia Yu in person.

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
I'm so happy.

117
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
Alright, alright, alright.

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
Some colleagues who joined later

119
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,040
might not know much

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,680
about Xia Yu.

121
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,120
She has been with our company from the very beginning.

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,480
Yes.

123
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,440
Later, she left to pursue her own dreams.

124
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,080
But now,

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,800
she's become very successful.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,120
But she's always kept us in her thoughts.

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,960
So,

128
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,280
she turned down many

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
high-profile endorsement opportunities elsewhere

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,040
to choose to be the ambassador for our Peaceful Story.

131
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,920
Let's all

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
thank her.

133
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
No need to be so formal, everyone.

134
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,200
We'll be working together for some time.

135
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
Let's cooperate and get along.

136
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
I look forward to your support.

137
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,760
Alright.

138
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,240
I announce

139
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,720
Heian Story

140
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,280
is officially starting.

141
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,080
Great, great, great.

142
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,480
Heian Story, huh?

143
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,960
That's the new release, right?

144
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,400
Look at these visuals.

145
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,360
Let's change our pose.

146
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Come on.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,840
One, two, three.

148
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,840
Good.

149
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,440
Great, really great.

150
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,919
Thank you all for coming.

151
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,600
to the Heian Story launch event.

152
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm honored to

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
serve as the spokesperson for this event.

154
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm also very grateful to everyone

155
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,000
for taking time out of your busy schedules to come from afar.

156
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll keep working hard from here on.

157
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you, everyone.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
Alright, alright, alright.

159
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,320
Goddess of otakus.

160
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
The popular singer Xia Yu

161
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,320
serves as the image ambassador for Heian Story.

162
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Her influence

163
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,040
has brought tremendous attention to Millennium Company.

164
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,360
Sales of Heian Story soared for a time.

165
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,640
Fans rushed to buy it in a frenzy.

166
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,800
Millennium Company also pioneered

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
a new model for free online games.

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,280
Its innovation

169
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,120
provided a great experience for many players.

170
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,800
Millennium Company's reputation kept rising.

171
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll give you three days.

172
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
Get Brave Ones online.

173
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,280
Yes, yes.

174
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,400
Chairman, we'll do it as soon as possible.

175
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,040
I don't care what method you use.

176
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
Destroy Millennium for me.
