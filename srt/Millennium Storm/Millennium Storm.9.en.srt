1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,119
Liu Yu

2
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Yang Yang

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,880
I chose you at first

4
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,320
because you are software engineering majors.

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,039
Now

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,799
it's time for you to use your strengths.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,879
You'll learn from me for a while

8
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,640
and then work with me

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
to develop a mobile app.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
But remember

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,280
you must keep this confidential.

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,159
Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,599
Okay.

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,040
What are you scheming this time?

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,480
You really know me.

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
That Zhang Liang kid

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,680
has moved up the development timeline for the Fruit Phone.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,840
This means

19
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,640
he has changed the times.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,719
Technology

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,680
is now entering a period of rapid advancement ahead of schedule.

22
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,359
As soon as this phone hits the market,

23
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,120
customers will love it.

24
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,079
It will become a nationwide sensation.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,239
So

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,280
we need to develop

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,680
a game software that can be compatible with this phone.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640
a game software.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,319
You mean

30
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,959
this is the same as when we outsourced Yuanqi

31
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,319
the same kind of situation?

32
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,040
Yeah.

33
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
But Zhang Liang has always been against us.

34
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,000
Would he agree to work with us?

35
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,879
We'll have to come up with a way.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,240
President Ye,

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,719
long time no see.

38
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,479
Our President Li

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
has become even more handsome.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,960
President Ye, doing this

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
aren't you afraid President Zhang will get angry?

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,199
You really

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,280
know how to kill the mood.

44
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,879
President Ye, you've kept things well hidden.

45
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,159
I only just found out

46
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,439
that you and President Zhang

47
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,039
are married.

48
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,879
You were the one who reached out to me.

49
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,639
You didn't just come to hear gossip, did you?

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,039
President Ye is straightforward.

51
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,919
You definitely wouldn't get mad

52
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,879
over a joke.

53
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
I came to see you today

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,599
because I want to discuss a collaboration with you.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,199
You want to work with me?

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Yes.

57
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,360
The Fruit Phone developed by Mr. Zhang

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,719
is about to be launched.

59
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,719
As for this phone,

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
I know a bit about it.

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,240
To retain users,

62
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,759
besides the essential software,

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,240
lifestyle and entertainment apps are also indispensable.

64
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,319
I have a mobile app

65
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,800
that would be a great fit for your Fruit Phone.

66
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,240
I can't give you an answer on this right now.

67
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,319
However,

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,360
I can ask Mr. Zhang for his opinion

69
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,840
and get back to you later.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,360
Alright.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,439
Then,

72
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,039
thank you in advance, Mr. Ye.

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,960
Goodbye.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,039
I never thought Li Tian would come to me for help one day.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,159
But his idea is actually pretty good.

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,000
Isn't Chen Yang

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,280
also competing for the software agency rights?

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,120
But Chen Yang's technology isn't very stable yet.

79
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,680
It still needs improvement.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,800
Enough with the nonsense.

81
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,439
The old-timers at the company are watching me closely.

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,800
We can't let Li Tian take advantage of this.

83
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,480
Contact the person in charge at Chen Yang

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,199
and agree to work with them.

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,000
As for Li Tian,

86
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
let's keep him waiting for now.

87
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,199
Leave.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,959
Is there anything else?

89
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,160
Tianming Group said

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,040
they could consider signing an agency contract.

91
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,199
But they still haven't given us the contract.

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,839
Sister Lin, don't worry yet.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Since Brother Tian said this can work out,

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,639
there shouldn't be any problem.

95
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,839
Yeah.

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,839
Don't worry.

97
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,399
This technology,

98
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,800
if you look across the whole country,

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,040
no, actually,

100
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,839
to be precise,

101
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,079
it's the whole world.

102
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,800
Only our Qianxi's technology meets the standard.

103
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,319
They probably

104
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,639
wouldn't risk their own future as a joke.

105
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,879
Let's hope so.

106
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,519
Yeah.

107
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go.

108
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:26,879
Okay.

109
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,439
Yeah.

110
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,920
Sorry about that.

111
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,439
Thank you all for waiting.

112
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,480
Today, our Tianming Group

113
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,839
is holding the decision meeting for the mobile system software agency.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,639
So,

115
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,680
we've invited two

116
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,160
potential future partner

117
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,439
company representatives

118
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
to attend this meeting.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,199
The proposal from Qianxi

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,720
in terms of logic and technology

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
is excellent.

122
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,680
Therefore,

123
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,800
after careful consideration and research,

124
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,199
we have decided to grant the agency rights

125
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,720
to

126
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,879
Chenyang Company as the sole agent.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,920
Congratulations, President Chen.

128
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Mr. Li

129
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Our company, Qianxi,

130
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,759
has only recently switched industries.

131
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,680
So in terms of experience and technology,

132
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,160
we're definitely not as good as Chen Yang.

133
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm really sorry about that.

134
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,040
Thank you for your trust.

135
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,959
Looking forward to working together.

136
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,800
Looking forward to working together.

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,879
Logically, the technology provided by Qianxi Group

138
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,959
should actually be more advanced.

139
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,600
That's right.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
I remember Qianxi did really well

141
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,519
in the gaming industry.

142
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,879
What a fool who can't see real talent.

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,199
Let's talk about

144
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,079
today's hot topics in technology.

145
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,439
Tianming Group announced today

146
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,160
that their smart Fruit Phone has officially launched.

147
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,920
It has made a strong entry into the domestic market,

148
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
with its unprecedented high-performance specs

149
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,000
and revolutionary user experience,

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,439
officially opening a new chapter in communication history.

151
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,879
It has sparked a buying frenzy.

152
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,680
Sir,

153
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,600
may I interview you

154
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,240
about your thoughts on the Xiaoyao game?

155
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,160
It's so convenient to play games on this phone.

156
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,079
And this game is really fun.

157
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,879
Ma'am,

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,639
may I interview you

159
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,120
about your thoughts on the Xiaoyao game?

160
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,600
Although the price is a bit high,

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,519
there are many helpful lifestyle apps included.

162
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,959
There are even makeup tutorials.

163
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,399
Stop watching.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,319
Let's eat.

165
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,079
Alright.

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,759
Let's go.

167
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,079
Mr. Li, someone is here to see you.

168
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,040
Mr. Chen.

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,079
Long time no see.

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,000
Long time no see.

171
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,800
Let me introduce you.

172
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,120
This is Mr. Chen,

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,480
an old friend.

174
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,399
We still have to thank Mr. Li.

175
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Our Xiaoyao

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,879
has not only made huge profits,

177
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
but the other lifestyle apps

178
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,160
have also earned quite a lot.

179
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,519
When did you two start working together?

180
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,519
Hello.

181
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,839
Oh, please come in.

182
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,199
Hello.

183
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,319
Are you Chen Yu?

184
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,480
Yes, I am.

185
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,560
I know you.

186
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,240
You're a top student from the Computer Science Department at Qingbei University.

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,240
Currently, you're starting your own business.

188
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,600
You want to create your own internet company.

189
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
Oh, let me introduce myself.

190
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm the founder of Millennium Investment Company.

191
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,959
Li Tian.

192
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,279
I'm willing to invest in you.

193
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,759
Okay.

194
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,480
Oh.

195
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Thank you.

196
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,080
So you two set this up from the beginning.

197
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,759
That's right.

198
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,759
It's because Mr. Li gave me startup funding.

199
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,159
Otherwise, I wouldn't have achieved what I have today.

200
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,879
Well played, Li Tian.

201
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,559
You even kept it from the two of us.

202
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,039
Exactly.

203
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,559
Isn't it because you and Xia Yu acted so poorly?

204
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,720
I was afraid you two would give it away.

205
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,960
What are you talking about?

206
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,519
You're something else.

207
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,879
And you didn't even say anything.

208
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,360
Yeah.

209
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,919
I did it for the company.

210
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,559
You kept it from us.

211
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,799
You didn't tell us just because it was for the company?

212
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,200
Mr. Chen is still here.

213
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,559
The real boss behind Chenyang Company is actually Li Tian.

214
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,840
We just found out too.

215
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,879
He fooled all of us.

216
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,159
Terminate the contract for me immediately.

217
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,759
I won't let him make another cent off me.

218
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,519
But our contract is for ten years.

219
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,399
If we terminate it now,

220
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,000
we'll have to pay a huge penalty.

221
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,480
If I say terminate, then terminate.

222
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,600
Stop with all the nonsense.

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,960
As for the shareholders,

224
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,120
I developed the phone.

225
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
They've made so much money.

226
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,559
What right do they have to bargain with me?

227
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,639
When you met Li Tian before,

228
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
what did you say to him?

229
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,360
Nothing.

230
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,519
I didn't say anything.

231
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,360
Nothing.

232
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,000
Help!
