1
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,879
Get me a high-performance computer.

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,319
I can make a game.

3
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,919
I guarantee that within three months,

4
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,120
you'll make a big profit.

5
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,319
In the future,

6
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,400
we'll start another

7
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,520
electronics sales company.

8
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,479
We'll strive to grow bigger and stronger.

9
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,319
And work towards going public.

10
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,240
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

11
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,159
Let's work hard together.

12
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,680
Yeah.

13
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,560
Right now, our company

14
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,599
is actually developing pretty well.

15
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,439
But if we want to compete with Tianming Group,

16
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,400
we're still a bit slow.

17
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,439
So I want to make a

18
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,080
game that can lead the whole country.

19
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,919
Sounds good.

20
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
I support you.

21
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,319
Really.

22
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,240
Of course.

23
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,879
Then I'll give it my all.

24
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,639
Mr. Lin.

25
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,840
Let's find a place to talk.

26
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
Coming.

27
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,520
Have a seat.

28
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,159
Freshly arrived tribute tea

29
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,719
Have a taste

30
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,479
I can't accept a reward without merit

31
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,479
Why did you come to see me?

32
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,960
Don't be so nervous

33
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm here to help you

34
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,639
One-sided effort

35
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,479
Will always lead to imbalance

36
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,000
You take Li Tian seriously

37
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,360
But in his heart

38
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
There's only Chu Xinyue

39
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,800
They're husband and wife

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,519
That's the loyalty he should have

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,399
I'm a man

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
I understand men best

43
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,240
Men aren't loyal to just one woman

44
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,319
He's ambiguous with Xia Yu

45
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,480
But towards you

46
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,040
He acts like you don't exist

47
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,920
What do you think you mean to him

48
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
In his heart?

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Li Tian

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
He's different

51
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,319
Fine

52
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,120
Let's set that fact aside for now

53
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's change the subject

54
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,839
You've started a business with him for so long

55
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,800
Do you really think he

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
Sees you as a close partner?

57
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,800
Li Tian is now alone

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
Holding all the company's power

59
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,759
Do you think he's really worried about tiring you out

60
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,519
Or cares for you?

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Actually, he's just sidelining you

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
Do you think Millennium now

63
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,920
With or without you

64
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,360
Is there any difference?

65
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
What nonsense are you talking about

66
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,399
Don't even think about using such a clumsy tactic

67
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,519
To drive a wedge between us

68
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,680
Then we

69
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,959
should make a bet.

70
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,759
Sure.

71
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,560
What are we betting on?

72
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,199
Let's bet that within a month,

73
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,720
you'll be pushed out by Qianxi.

74
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,120
And if you lose?

75
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,639
Impossible.

76
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,839
What do you really want?

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
I want you to bring Xinyue Dream Travel

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,439
and join Tianming together.

79
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,519
By then,

80
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,759
your position

81
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,959
will be second only to mine.

82
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,360
You want me to steal Xinyue Dream Travel?

83
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Absolutely not.

84
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,600
Zhang Liang,

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,439
just give up on that idea.

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,079
No need to answer me so quickly.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,399
Once Li Tian loses his power,

88
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,800
and goes back to being a poor guy,

89
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,560
Chu Xinyue will leave him.

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,920
And you

91
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,480
will be his last hope.

92
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,399
Where's President Lin?

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,519
President Lin took a sick day today.

94
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,639
Hmm.

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
Already sick,

96
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,680
shouldn't you be resting at home?

97
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,399
Why are you still running around?

98
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,800
I've been looking for you all day.

99
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,160
I've never beaten this game.

100
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,480
I wanted to try it today.

101
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,759
Xinyue heard you were sick,

102
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,079
so she made you some porridge.

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Eat it while it's hot.

104
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,639
Li Tian,

105
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,319
I like you.

106
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,199
I really like you.

107
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,040
Can't you feel it?

108
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,759
Sister Wanqing,

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,839
I'm very grateful

110
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,279
for your companionship and support over all these years.

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,319
I've always considered you my best friend

112
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,000
and partner.

113
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,000
But when it comes to feelings,

114
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,879
I can't lie to you.

115
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,680
Even more so,

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,519
I can't be irresponsible to two women at the same time.

117
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,199
My heart belongs only to Xinyue.

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Get out.

119
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,480
Get out.

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,840
Leave.

121
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,039
Take your food with you.
