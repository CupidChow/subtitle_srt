1
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,359
Open this so I can take a look.

2
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,040
Okay.

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,599
Mm.

4
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,159
Morning.

5
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,640
Do you think this is okay?

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,359
Like this.

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,359
This is fine.

8
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,200
Come in.

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,319
Take a break.

10
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,639
You don't need to bring me fruit anymore.

11
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,000
Alright.

12
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,800
This is the last time.

13
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,759
Send an email over there.

14
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,039
Everyone, please pay attention.

15
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Starting today,

16
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,520
Xinyue

17
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
that is,

18
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,879
my wife,

19
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,839
will be joining the company.

20
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,600
She will be the manager of the R&D department.

21
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Alright, alright, alright.

22
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,040
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

23
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,920
Thank you, everyone.

24
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
I will work hard from now on.

25
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Please take care of me.

26
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,920
Okay, let's go.

27
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,920
What's wrong, Mr. Lin?

28
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,399
At 2 p.m. this afternoon,

29
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,879
the Technical Department and the R&D Department

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
will have an integration meeting.

31
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,959
Will you be attending?

32
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,040
Then for this meeting,

33
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
let Xinyue host it.

34
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Go to the market this afternoon.

35
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,079
Some office supplies need to be replaced.

36
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,120
Okay.

37
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:15,920
Mm.

38
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Thank you.

39
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,879
Look here.

40
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,120
Actually, this is pretty simple.

41
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:06,879
Yeah.

42
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,959
Click here.

43
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,920
Then you can draw.

44
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,079
Come, I'll show you.

45
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,680
You never taught me this all these years.

46
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,759
Then click here.

47
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,519
Okay.

48
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,639
Let me tell you all,

49
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,120
Mr. Li really loves his wife.

50
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,399
She clearly doesn't know anything,

51
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,879
yet still gets a high position.

52
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,439
That's normal—they're married, after all.

53
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,920
Right, Ms. Chu?

54
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,759
Are you afraid Ms. Lin will steal your husband?

55
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,399
Is that why you insist on coming to the company to keep an eye on things?

56
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,639
From what I see, Ms. Lin

57
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,279
doesn't really help much at the company.

58
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
Maybe Mr. Li wants to use this chance

59
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,079
to have Ms. Chu replace Ms. Lin.

60
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't talk nonsense.

61
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,160
Ms. Lin and Mr. Li

62
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,079
are both founding members of the company.

63
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,120
She has shares.

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,199
They're a married couple.

65
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
If they wanted to dilute Ms. Lin's shares,

66
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,839
that would be easy.

67
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Yeah.

68
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,120
Ms. Lin, Ms. Lin, don't say any more.

69
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,480
Maybe they're right.

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,120
In their eyes, I'm nothing.

71
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,319
After Li Tian loses his power,

72
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,920
he'll go back to being a poor guy.

73
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,839
Chu Xinyue will leave him.

74
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,439
And you are his last lifeline.

75
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,639
And you are his last lifeline.

76
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,399
Everyone,

77
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
Our project, Xinyue Dream Journey,

78
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,040
has now entered its final stage.

79
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,480
Regarding this project,

80
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,959
I want to put my wife, Xinyue, in charge.

81
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Because this project itself

82
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,800
was inspired by her.

83
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,319
I believe

84
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,079
that this game named after you

85
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,040
will, with your hard work,

86
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
become a global sensation.

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,079
Alright, alright.

88
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,959
I will do my best.

89
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,319
Come, have a seat.

90
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,319
Wanqing,

91
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,079
for this project,

92
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,160
you will assist Xinyue.

93
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,759
Okay.

94
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,079
We

95
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,000
will continue the meeting.

96
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,240
Hello?

97
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,600
I've decided to work with you.

98
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,480
I hope you

99
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,279
will keep your promise.

100
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,879
Of course.

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,080
Alright.

102
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,519
Sister Lin

103
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,360
It's so late

104
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,039
and you're still at work.

105
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm going to Mr. Li's office to get a document.

106
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,360
Oh.

107
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,600
I've already got what you wanted.

108
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,480
What about mine?
