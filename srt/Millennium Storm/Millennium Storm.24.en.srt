1
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,720
You're asking about

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,880
the boss partnering with Xiya Company?

3
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,840
Let me tell you,

4
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,200
it's probably true.

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,040
I heard the two of them are secretly dating.

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,720
They might even become family in the future.

7
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,040
Our company's Manager Zhang

8
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,920
is at most just an assistant.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,200
His shares will be diluted sooner or later.

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
After all, in such a big company,

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,520
there's no room for idle people.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Manager Zhang,

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,280
Manager Li asked me to help buy some late-night snacks.

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,440
I'll head over first.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,240
Go ahead.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,920
Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920
I've reviewed the contract.

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,200
There are no issues on our end.

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
How about on your side?

20
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,040
No problem.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,760
Okay.

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,440
Alright.

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,120
Sounds good.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,200
So, tomorrow then?

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
We'll send you the finalized contract

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,160
tomorrow.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,160
Thank you for your support.

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,960
Looking forward to working together.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,080
Could you pour me a glass of water? Thanks.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,520
Not at all, not at all.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Our company's success today

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
is thanks to all of our efforts.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,640
How could it be just because of me?

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,240
Alright, alright.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,400
You're too kind.

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,320
Pleasure working with you, goodbye.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,240
Do you think Ye Xuan is suitable for marriage?

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,280
I think she's quite suitable.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,520
She's gentle, beautiful, and virtuous.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,320
Most importantly,

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,520
When you achieve success and fame, you want to abandon me.

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,880
I hate being abandoned by others the most.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,520
Zhang Liang.

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,880
I've always considered you my best brother.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,920
Good brother.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
Then can you forgive me?

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,320
Can you return to me what I've lost—

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,160
money, reputation, status—

50
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,440
can you give all of that back to me?

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,160
Can you?

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
I can't forgive you.

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,440
I can't forgive you.

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
Where is Xinyue?

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,120
Where is she?

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
When you die,

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,800
you'll be able to see her.

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,800
What did you say?

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Why?

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Why is it that in every era,

61
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,800
you always achieve success and fame,

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
while I can only be your shadow?

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,280
Why?

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,000
Zhang Liang.

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Heaven gave us both the same chance to be reborn.

66
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,920
You're the one who didn't seize the opportunity.

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,360
Instead, you did even more terrible things.

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
Then let's die together.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,600
Die together.

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,960
Xinyue.

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,200
Xinyue.

72
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,000
Xinyue.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Honey.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,600
Xinyue.

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
Honey, are you okay?

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,440
I'm fine.

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,240
Are you okay?

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm fine.

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,160
Check on her.

80
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,680
Are you alright?

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Are you okay?

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm fine.

83
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
Sorry.

84
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,440
It's okay.

85
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
You didn't get hurt, did you?

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,240
No.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
Are you really not hurt?

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,600
President Ye.

89
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
There's a technical exchange meeting at 1 p.m.

90
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,160
You need to leave now.

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Got it.

92
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,560
It's Li Tian.

93
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,480
Mr. Li.

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
The "Heart Moon Dream Journey" you created for your wife

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
has been a huge success.

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
The government is also going to give Millennium an award.

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
Do you have anything to say?

98
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,760
Thank you all for your support.

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Millennium has also become one of the top three companies in the world.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
And you acquired

101
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,720
the largest domestic game company, Tianming Games.

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
Your own net worth has soared to tens of billions.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
What are your plans for the future?

104
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I'll keep working hard.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,120
I still have things to do.

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
I can't accept any more interviews for now.

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,080
Mr. Li, why are you in such a hurry?

108
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
Is there something important you need to do?

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm getting married.

110
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm never going shopping with you again.

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,680
With so many bodyguards following us,

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
it feels like we're going to war.

113
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,800
Isn't this too much attention?

114
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,960
The company arranged it.

115
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
I don't want it either.

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Let's go.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,080
Let's pick out tomorrow's dress.

118
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, right.

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,680
Let's go.

120
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,000
Now, let's invite the bride and groom

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,520
to exchange rings.

122
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,480
Xinyue,

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,240
I will make you happy for the rest of your life.

124
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
The three of us as a family

125
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
will be very happy.

126
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,120
I love you.

127
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
I love you too.
