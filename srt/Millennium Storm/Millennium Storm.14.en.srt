1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,840
Okay.

2
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,520
Hold on.

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,840
First of all,

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,280
congratulations to our "Peaceful Story,"

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
for surpassing one hundred million!

6
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,160
Thank you all for your support during this time,

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,960
both for the company and for this project.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,200
All those late nights,

9
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,560
the dark circles under your eyes,

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
and the hair you lost,

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
have all paid off.

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,760
Next,

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,720
I have an important announcement to make.

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Our General Manager Li

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,120
will unveil the red cloth for everyone.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,080
Alright.

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,240
Come on.

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Three,

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
two,

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,360
one!

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,920
These are all bonuses for everyone.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,600
Hand them out.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,640
Quick, quick, hand them out!

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,240
Come on, come on!

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,920
Everyone, don't rush.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,720
There's enough for everyone.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,520
Thank you, General Manager Li, for your support.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,080
And thank you, Miss Xia Yu, for being our game's spokesperson.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,520
No, no, not at all.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,760
It's thanks to you that "Peaceful Story"

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,480
has become a household name.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,760
Thank you, Miss Xia Yu.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,840
You're welcome.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,160
How is it?

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,040
During this period,

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,400
has it been hard?

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
Not at all.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Because

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,400
it's what my heart desires.

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,680
That's great.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
Then first, congratulations!

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,520
Come on.

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
But you,

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
it's about time you found a shoulder to lean on.

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,760
In our line of work, it's not allowed

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,480
to date at the peak of your career.

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,040
Not allowed.

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
That won't do.

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,360
You're successful in your career,

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,840
but you can't neglect your family.

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,160
How about this,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,520
another day,

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,640
I'll introduce you to someone, Brother Tian.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,320
How about it?

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Brother Tian,

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,240
stop joking with me.

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,200
What about you?

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,320
I've already picked out several bags.

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,360
What's wrong with you?

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,440
I feel a little dizzy.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,760
I think I do too.

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,760
How about this,

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll help you go rest for a bit.

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,120
Okay.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,560
Let's keep working.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,200
Let's do our best.

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,960
Of course.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,600
Right?

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,360
Everyone's worked hard.

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,880
It's nothing.

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Are you okay?

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,440
Sit here.

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Come on.

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Brother Tian

75
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,400
I have something to say

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
I'm afraid if I don't tell you now

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,800
I'll never get another chance

78
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,560
Xia Yu

79
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,880
I'll just pretend you're drunk today

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,640
I love my wife very much

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
I can't do anything to betray her

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,920
Brother Tian

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
I really do like you

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,200
Xinyue

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,640
Xinyue

86
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,680
Li Tian

87
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
What are you doing?

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,400
Xinyue

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,080
Xia Yu

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,040
Xinyue

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,240
Listen to my explanation.

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,280
Xinyue

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
Li Tian, what's going on?

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
There's no time to explain everything.

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
Take good care of Xia Yu.

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,440
Xinyue

97
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,120
Xia Yu

98
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
Xia Yu

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Sister Wanqing

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,280
Xinyue

101
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,880
Xinyue

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,880
Xinyue

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,000
Xinyue

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Let go of me

105
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,960
Xinyue

106
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,000
It's really not what you think

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Not what I think?

108
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,200
I saw everything

109
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,120
How could it be fake?

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Xinyue

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,320
I know that whatever I say now

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,600
you won't believe me

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,600
But

114
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,640
don't you think this whole thing is strange?

115
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,800
When it happened

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,880
I really couldn't control myself at all

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
When I came to my senses

118
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,320
it was just like what you saw

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't want to hear these details

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
If you like her

121
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
you can tell me

122
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
We can get a divorce

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,320
I can let you be together

124
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
But why did you text me to tell me

125
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
and let me see all of this?

126
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
Text you?

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,800
I never texted you at all

128
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,000
Xinyue

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,840
Don't you really think all of this is too strange?

130
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,200
It's like someone

131
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
is deliberately setting me up

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,280
I don't know

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
I don't know anything right now

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,480
I need to be alone for a while

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Don't follow me

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,880
Recently

137
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
Famous actress Xia Yu was exposed

138
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,520
to be involved in the family of Millennium Company's founder Li Tian

139
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
as the third party in their relationship

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,400
This instantly became the focus of public opinion

141
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,800
Intimate video clips of the two spread online

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
The public responded with a wave of criticism

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,640
Many fans stopped supporting her

144
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
Numerous endorsements were terminated

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,960
Her future career prospects are now uncertain

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,520
Millennium Company will also face a PR crisis

147
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,440
What should we do now?

148
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,880
Ping'an Story has just started

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,640
and something like this has already happened to the company

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,040
Things really aren't as they seem

151
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,440
Of course I trust your character

152
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,240
I've already helped you with PR

153
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
But many videos online

154
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,440
can't be taken down at all

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
It's obvious someone set this up

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
They deliberately filmed the video and put it online

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
Now it has not only hurt you and Xinyue

158
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,280
but also damaged the reputations of you and Xia Yu

159
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,360
causing a huge impact on the company

160
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,840
Thank you, Mr. Li, for your support

161
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,520
And thank you, Ms. Xia Yu, for endorsing our game

162
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,600
The wine

163
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,240
What wine?

164
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
The wine we drank yesterday

165
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
There was something wrong with the wine

166
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,080
We all drank it

167
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,960
After I drank that wine yesterday

168
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,920
my mind became very fuzzy for a while

169
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
I had no idea what I was doing

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
You mean...

171
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,840
If I'm not mistaken

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,200
it was Zhang Liang

173
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,240
The top priority now

174
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
is to quickly find the person who filmed the video

175
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Let's check the surveillance footage

176
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,640
Li Tian, you jerk.

177
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,280
Can you really face Xinyue after this?

178
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,280
President Guo.

179
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,080
Why did you hit him?

180
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,760
The matter hasn't been fully investigated yet.

181
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Li Tian.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
I really misjudged you.

183
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,640
I never should have let Xinyue be with you.

184
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
Don't show up in front of her again.

185
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,520
Or I'll hit you every time I see you.

186
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,120
What kind of person is he?

187
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,760
Does it hurt?

188
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,240
It's fine.

189
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,360
The truth will definitely come out.

190
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,920
Yeah.

191
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,400
Thank you for believing in me.

192
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
Sister Wanqing, Brother Tian

193
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
I dragged everyone into this.

195
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,080
But I really didn't know what happened yesterday.

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,680
I just...

197
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,160
It's okay.

198
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,400
We just checked.

199
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,640
We know what happened now.

200
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,800
There's a mole in the company.

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
Work with us.

202
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,160
Put on an act.

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,760
Okay.

204
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,360
Mm-hmm.

205
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,480
We were definitely drugged.

206
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,120
So, Xiayu,

207
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
Sister Wanqing and I

208
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
have already checked the surveillance footage.

209
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,560
We've already got the footage.

210
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,160
Although the surveillance was destroyed during that time,

211
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,160
we've already found someone to fix it.

212
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,880
Once it's fixed,

213
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,840
we'll immediately know who did it.

214
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Really?

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,560
How long will it take to fix?

216
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,440
It'll be delivered tonight.
