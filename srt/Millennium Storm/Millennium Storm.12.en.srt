1
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
As for us right now,

2
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,440
we want to make a 3D game.

3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,960
It might require a large amount of funding.

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,680
And this 3D technology

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,240
has just been introduced from abroad.

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,960
We also need a foreign group

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,319
to send technical staff for guidance.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,240
How much do we need?

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,760
Fifty million.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,720
Hmm.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,960
But we only have forty million in our account.

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
The rest has all been invested elsewhere.

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,320
Let's do it this way, then.

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Time is tight.

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,680
Let's first reach out to some clients we've worked with before

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
to help with the cash flow.

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,760
Okay.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Let's split up and take action.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,920
Alright.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,120
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,240
I won't let you down.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,680
Great, looking forward to working together.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,520
Mr. Zhao, you have a good eye.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
Pleasure working with you.

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,040
Pleasure working with you, Mr. Lin.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,280
Let's have our legal team draft the contract tomorrow.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,840
Okay.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,400
Alright.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,200
Tell those people

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,880
that anyone who dares to invest in Qianxi

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,840
is going against me, Tianming.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,800
Yes.

33
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,840
Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhao

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
and a few other investors who had agreed

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,240
suddenly turned us down today.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
It must be

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,160
that he made a move again.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,240
You're here.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,200
Yeah.

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,200
What's wrong?

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,360
Nothing.

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Someone's been waiting for you for a long time.

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,720
Li Tian.

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Your wife’s cooking is really good.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
These dishes your wife made

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,960
are really delicious.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,440
And she's beautiful, too.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,520
Zhang Liang.

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,960
What exactly do you want?

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Relax.

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm not interested in your wife.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
What are you doing?

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,320
Sit, sit, sit.

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,960
Calm down.

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,320
You'll scare your wife.

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,280
Why did you try to kill me?

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
Aren't you alive and well?

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
Killing is against the law.

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,360
All your past success

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,840
was because of me.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Do you really think, with your abilities,

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
you could surpass me?

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,160
So that's why you tried to kill me?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,720
Zhang Liang.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,160
I've always considered you my best brother.

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
Do you have any conscience at all?

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,880
You're talking to me about conscience.

68
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,120
When you took credit for my achievements step by step,

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,240
why didn't you think about conscience then?

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,840
If I stood in the line of fire for you,

71
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,320
and that means taking your credit,

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
then that's exactly what happened.

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Fine.

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm not here today to reminisce with you.

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,440
Since we've both come to this era,

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,920
let's compete in the fields we're best at.

77
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,160
Let's have a proper contest.

78
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's see who the real winner is.

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,960
Li Tian,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
you can't beat me.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,240
Alright.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
If you really want to compete,

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
then let's give it a try.

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,640
You owe me this meal.

85
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,720
Mr. Li, please settle the bill.

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,320
What's wrong?

87
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,240
It's nothing.

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
Don't worry.

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,160
Tianming Group and the investment circle have already been notified.

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
Anyone who invests in Qianxi

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,080
will be blacklisted by him.

92
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,080
I can invest twenty million in you.

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
I know your company's cash flow

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
has all been invested.

95
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,280
It will take time to recover the costs.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,720
And the project has already started.

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,040
If you stop halfway,

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
the losses will only be greater.

99
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,280
Would you really be so kind as to invest in me?

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,200
Aren't you afraid Tianming Group will blacklist you?

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,920
My business is mainly overseas.

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,840
Tianming's reach isn't that long.

103
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,840
Oh.

104
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Alright.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Then go ahead.

106
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,400
What are your terms?

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,640
Take this money.

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Leave Xinyue.

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,440
Just this little bit of money

110
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
and you want me to sell my wife?

111
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,680
Keep dreaming.

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,640
Take your money

113
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,560
and get lost.

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,760
Let me give you some advice.

115
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
Think it over carefully.

116
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,480
Li Tian.

117
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,600
Why did you turn down his investment?

118
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
None of your business.

119
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
Guo Wenbang asked me to give this to you.

120
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,960
He knows you're having difficulties.

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
What are you doing?

122
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
Without this money,

123
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,400
where will you find another investor?

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
He wants me to leave you.

125
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,160
I would never do that in my life.

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
Start a business by selling my wife.

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,360
So this is what it feels like to throw away twenty million.

128
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm really so cool.

129
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,360
But my heart hurts so much.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
What should I do next?

131
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
Oh heavens.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Can you drop a pie in my lap?

133
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,320
Hello?

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,240
Li Tian.

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,320
I can give you ten million in funding.

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,320
Hello?

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,280
Isn't that pie falling from the sky now?

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
You really need to get more rest.

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,920
How can I rest? We just started.

140
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,760
Sister-in-law.

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,080
Xinyue.

142
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
Let me tell you some good news.

143
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,760
The investment funds

144
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
have arrived.

145
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,200
Where did you get the money?

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The investor doesn't want to reveal their name.

147
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,880
What about the money?

148
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,600
It was transferred from a foreign account again.

149
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,919
I don't know their identity either.

150
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,520
There are still people who do good deeds without leaving their name?

151
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,240
That's called having vision, okay?

152
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,880
Alright.

153
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,640
Now that the investment funds are in place,

154
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,040
we still have a tough battle ahead.

155
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,280
Let's perk up.

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,160
Yeah.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Let's do our best.

158
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,440
Come on!

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,080
Don't fall asleep.

160
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,720
There's just a little left.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,120
Did you design this?

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,720
Yeah.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
Where did you get the inspiration for this?

164
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,280
Take a look.

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
That's amazing.

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,880
Teach me.

167
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,920
Oh, right.

168
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,400
Look.

169
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
Help me take a look.

170
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,960
Here.

171
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,920
Would it work if I change it to this?

172
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,880
This is a great idea.

173
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,520
Sister-in-law.

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,560
Everyone, let's eat.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
This is amazing.

176
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
Now everyone gets to enjoy a good meal.

177
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
You all worked hard.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
This is all I can do for you.

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,160
Xinyue.

180
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,400
Don't say that.

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,880
As the saying goes,

182
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,800
you need to eat well to have the energy to work.

183
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,280
Besides,

184
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,400
you've been supporting us from behind.

185
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,480
That's a big contribution.

186
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
Then let's eat.

187
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,920
Why are you just standing there?

188
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,840
Thank you, sister-in-law.

189
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,440
Thank you, sister-in-law.

190
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,200
