1
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,560
Pay back the money! Pay back the money! Compensate us!

2
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,280
Pay back the money! Compensate us! Compensate us!

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,200
Come out and pay us back! Come out!

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,320
Come out here, hurry up!

5
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,799
Everyone, please calm down.

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,640
Our boss is already handling this matter.

7
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,960
We’ll give everyone an explanation soon.

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,000
I paid a year’s agency fee.

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,079
It’s only been three months.

10
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,760
And now the game has problems.

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,079
Hurry up and give me a refund.

12
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,439
Refund! Refund!

13
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,560
Okay, okay, just wait a moment.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,200
You must have known about the game’s issues long ago.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,319
Before the problems appeared,

16
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,560
you wanted to make a big profit, right?

17
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,799
I knew it.

18
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,640
This game’s copyright

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,040
was given to us so easily.

20
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,159
So you just wanted to rip us off, right?

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,560
Compensate us! Compensate us! Compensate us!

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,439
Shut up!

23
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,040
What are you doing?

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,959
Our boss wanted to make money together with everyone.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,959
That’s why the copyright was sold to you at a low price.

26
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,359
Now that there’s a problem,

27
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,000
none of you are helping to solve it.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
You just come here to make trouble, right?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you have any conscience at all?

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Are you just here to cause trouble?

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,560
They are here to cause trouble! Get them!

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,239
Go get help, quick!

33
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,439
Hurry up!

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,599
Go now!

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
Compensate us! Compensate us!

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
Compensate us!

37
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,599
Our arch-enemy

38
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,920
is only Ye Xuan.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
It must be her.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,120
She can't win fair, so she plays dirty.

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,919
That's really despicable.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,879
Brother Tian,

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
what do you think?

44
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,879
If you agree,

45
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,400
we can use the same method to get back at her.

46
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,479
I'm going out for a bit.

47
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,280
Okay.

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,199
Mr. Li,

49
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,039
Ms. Ye,

50
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,240
what brings you here today?

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,879
To my place?

52
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,759
About Millennium Internet Cafe being shut down—

53
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,199
You were the one who had someone do it, right?

54
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,159
Mr. Li,

55
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,759
do you think

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
someone as talented as you

57
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,719
is really wasted at Millennium Internet Cafe?

58
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,719
President Ye

59
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,240
You're a bit heavy.

60
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,879
My back can't handle it.

61
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,599
You know that.

62
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,520
Behind me

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,599
is the Number One Network Group.

64
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,840
Tianming,

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,159
don't you think

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,719
that here

67
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,719
is truly your stage?

68
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,919
Didn't you already use a virus

69
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,680
to break through my firewall?

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Your company already has such talented people.

71
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,360
Do you still need someone like me?

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,159
What firewall?

73
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,960
I just had someone report you

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
for allowing minors to access the internet.

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,879
It wasn't her.

76
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,960
Is there someone else behind this?

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,039
So,

78
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,439
have you thought it over?

79
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,879
We're just not compatible.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,199
Let's just forget it.

81
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,360
You'd better think carefully.

82
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,199
Once you walk out this door,

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,199
no network technology company

84
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,319
will dare to hire you.

85
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,439
All roads lead to Rome.

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll just take a different path.

87
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,920
But as a person,

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
it's best to leave some room for others.

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Otherwise, you'll suffer sooner or later.

90
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,839
Here.

91
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,720
Here.

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Drink a little less.

93
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,279
Me,

94
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,480
now I can be sure that behind Ye Xuan

95
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,120
there's a helper just as capable as me.

96
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,560
So what do we do?

97
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,199
The other side has power and influence.

98
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,519
Whether it's money or technology,

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,160
they easily outmatch us.

100
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,399
The main thing is, we don't know who that person is.

101
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,279
Yeah.

102
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,399
Don't worry, eat first.

103
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,399
Let's talk about it later.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,079
Bro,

105
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,920
You old Deng, you scared me!

106
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,000
You know me?

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,720
I don't know you.

108
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,399
You know him?

109
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,800
I don't know him, who is he?

110
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,279
Then how did you know my last name is Deng?

111
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,040
I didn't expect

112
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
my reputation

113
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,199
to be so well-known already.

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
Yes, yes, yes.

115
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,319
Your reputation, Brother Deng,

116
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,600
is really impressive.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,519
Take a look.

118
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,959
Want a pager?

119
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,160
They're all legit.

120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,680
Take a look.

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,199
You...

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,120
You and your pager, here with me...

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,920
Wenqing

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Pack your things now and come on a business trip with me.

125
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,160
We're about to make a fortune.

126
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
Right now?

127
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes, yes, yes, hurry up!

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,879
I haven't even finished eating.

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,839
There's only this one room left.

130
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,000
And it's a single room.

131
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,480
The nearby rooms

132
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,360
are all fully booked.

133
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,399
How are a man and a woman supposed to stay together?

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,399
How about this then?

135
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,000
In a bit,

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,839
I'll sleep on the sofa.

137
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,680
Alright.

138
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,040
This room is way too basic.

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,120
It doesn't even have a sofa.

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,199
How am I supposed to sleep?

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
I haven't even said anything.

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,279
You're a grown man who's already married,

143
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,360
why are you being so fussy?

144
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,199
What's wrong with just sleeping openly?

145
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,959
I'm exhausted.

146
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm going to take a shower first.

147
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,959
Sister Wanquing

148
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,120
You can't do this.

149
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,800
What shouldn't I do?

150
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,799
Li Tian

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
What were you dreaming about?

152
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,600
Wanqing, you...

153
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,480
You... you...

154
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,919
Did you sleep well last night?

155
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,559
Yeah, it was okay.

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
Nothing happened between us, right?

157
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,759
What do you want to happen?

158
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,440
You don't want something to happen between us, do you?

159
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,120
Don't get the wrong idea.

160
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,960
That's not what I meant.

161
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,840
You rascal.

162
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,399
Hurry up and get ready to go.

163
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,919
Hello, boss.

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,360
Let's go.

165
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,799
Okay.

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,799
It's just up there.

167
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,759
Let's go.

168
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,000
After you, boss.

169
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,799
Brother Ji

170
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,440
I brought what you wanted.

171
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
Thank you, Brother Ji.

172
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,679
So...

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,559
Where's what I asked for?

174
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
Li Tian

175
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,600
Are you messing with me?
