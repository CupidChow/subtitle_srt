1
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,560
The so-called top original company in the country, Qianxi,

2
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,520
their game "Ping'an Story" plagiarized "Brave Ones".

3
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,320
What do you all think,

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
isn't it ridiculous?

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,960
It's ridiculous.

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,600
It's just too ridiculous.

7
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,799
Boycott plagiarism!

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Boycott plagiarism!

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,200
Boycott plagiarism!

10
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:09,840
Li Tian!

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,640
You have the nerve to plagiarize,

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,040
but not the guts to come out

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,840
and give us loyal players

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,799
an explanation?

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,120
Give us an explanation!

16
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,000
Give us an explanation!

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,680
This woman is Lin Wanqing, the boss of Qianxi.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
If Li Tian won't come out and explain,

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,680
let her give us an explanation!

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,840
Give us an explanation!

21
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,120
Give us an explanation!

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,599
You plagiarized Tianming Company's game,

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,400
deceiving us loyal players into spending money.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
You should compensate us.

25
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,680
Compensate us!

26
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,760
We might as well go play "Brave Ones".

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,159
You at Qianxi are just plagiarism dogs!

28
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,159
What did you just say?

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,680
Nothing has even been finalized yet.

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,079
Who is plagiarizing whom, anyway?

31
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,439
You plagiarize and still won't admit it.

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,840
Do you have any shame at all?

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,159
Don't push people too far!

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,799
You're going too far!

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,480
I...

36
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,079
Li Tian

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,959
Finally showed up.

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,359
The things you did before

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,719
were all shady and sneaky.

40
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,000
Nothing you could show in public.

41
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,400
No wonder you would plagiarize Tianming Company's game.

42
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,680
What evidence do you have that I plagiarized?

43
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,879
Evidence?

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,520
The legal documents are already out.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,759
Tianming Company is the largest game company in the country.

46
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,080
You are reckless and bold.

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,439
You actually dared to plagiarize a game under Tianming.

48
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,719
This counts as a malicious lawsuit.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,879
And also,

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,319
your current actions

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,639
are already suspected of breaking the law.

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
This is considered provoking trouble.

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Provoking trouble?

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
As you instructed,

55
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,000
the price of "Brave Ones"

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
has already been reduced by one third.

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,039
How are things going with Li Tian?

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Just as you expected.

59
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,599
Peaceful Story has already stopped sales and distribution.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Under the public opinion we created,

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,840
its reputation in the industry has plummeted.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,280
It’s also facing criticism and doubts from many players.

63
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,599
Taking advantage of this incident,

64
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,800
our Brave Ones is receiving continuous praise instead.

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,319
Sales are rising rapidly.

66
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,639
Very good.

67
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,680
Li Tian,

68
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,000
what do you have to compete with me?

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,960
You’ll only end up in total defeat.

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,759
Hurry up and pack everything.

71
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,599
Move out all these computers and everything else.

72
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,159
Mr. Lin,

73
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,719
thank you for your guidance.

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
If there’s anything you need from us,

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,759
we’re always ready.

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,520
We’ll be leaving now.

77
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,400
Okay.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,919
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

79
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,199
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
Zhang Liang, through Liu Yu,

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
found out the core content of Peaceful Story in advance.

82
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,639
He even registered the copyright before us.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
Even if we launched first,

84
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,479
the copyright ownership issue

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,039
still can’t be resolved.

86
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,319
He’s really cunning and calculating.

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,120
Life is full of ups and downs.

88
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,960
Li Tian,

89
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,039
you’re like an unkillable cockroach.

90
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,680
You won’t go down easily.

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Who comforts someone

92
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
by calling them a cockroach?

93
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,439
I mean you’re resilient.

94
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,000
It’s not an insult.

95
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,639
Tianming Group won the lawsuit.

96
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,120
We have to pay them 300 million in compensation.

97
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
But the previous investment projects

98
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,759
are all long-term and haven't paid off yet.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
After the compensation,

100
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,439
there's no money left in the account.

101
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,079
Zhang Liang,

102
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,600
do you think that

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,079
this is enough to bring me down?

104
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,319
Zhang Liang,

105
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,680
you lowered the game's price without permission

106
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,600
and ignored the opinions of the other shareholders.

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,800
They're very dissatisfied with you now.

108
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,439
Aren't you going a bit too far?

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,959
Let me give you some advice:

110
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,920
don't get too involved.

111
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,000
Li Tian actually went bankrupt.

112
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,480
Let's celebrate properly.

113
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Come on.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,160
No matter what,

115
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,319
I'm still your wife.

116
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,199
What do you take me for?

117
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,879
I know you're my wife.

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,279
That's why we should enjoy tonight.

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
Take off your clothes.

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
Come here.

121
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,800
Come here.

122
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,839
Squat down.

123
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,879
You're so slow.

124
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,439
Beautiful lady

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,680
The road is slippery at night

126
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,480
You need to be careful

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
Come with us

128
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,879
Don't touch me

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,079
We're not bad people

130
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
It's dangerous to go home alone

131
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,959
We'll walk you home

132
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,600
Don't touch me

133
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
You're pretty strong

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,040
Get lost

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
Let go of me

136
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Let go of me

137
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,240
Stop

138
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,839
Don't touch me

139
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,040
Get out of here now

140
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,279
I've already called the police

141
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,879
Come on

142
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,639
Are you okay?

143
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll take you to the hospital

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,759
No need to go to the hospital

145
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
The injury on your neck

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Zhang Liang did that to you, didn't he?

147
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,480
Why don't you leave him?

148
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,639
Ye Group

149
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,879
Back then, it was also developing well.

150
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,360
But something happened to my dad.

151
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,000
It was Zhang Liang who showed up.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,800
And he saved our family.

153
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,279
He was like a ray of hope in my life.

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,399
So,

155
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,959
the Ye Group was renamed Tianming Group.

156
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,919
Under Zhang Liang's leadership, it grew bigger and bigger.

157
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,480
That's how it achieved its current status.

158
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,960
Have you ever thought about

159
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,200
that the Zhang Liang of today

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
is no longer the person he used to be?

161
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,320
Even if he's changed,

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,159
I'm destined not to leave him.

163
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,840
He and I

164
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,399
are destined to be entangled.

165
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,679
Just like you and him.

166
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,120
Thank you for today.

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,879
But I was too much of a mess.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,240
Just forget about today.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,080
I don't think you and Zhang Liang are the same kind of person.

170
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,320
President Ye,

171
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,279
that ten million back then

172
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,799
was from you, wasn't it? You hid your identity.

173
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,720
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,960
I don't know.

175
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,279
President Ye,

176
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,919
why don't you leave Zhang Liang?

177
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,639
From what I know about him,

178
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,399
he's cunning and deceitful.

179
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,799
If you stay by his side,

180
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,320
you'll only get hurt even more.

181
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,559
You don't understand.

182
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,240
You have no idea what he means to me.

183
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,919
I will make him atone to my father.
