1
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,760
I've reviewed the contract.

2
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,840
There are no issues on our end.

3
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,920
How about your side?

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,760
No problem.

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,080
Okay.

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:02,960
Alright.

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,280
What about tomorrow?

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,560
I'll send you what I've confirmed on my end

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,520
and send it over to you.

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,960
Don't worry.

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,520
No need to check with Mr. Zhang again.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
I have the final say.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,680
We grew up together.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,840
He always listens to me.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,520
Alright.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,240
That's it.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm hanging up.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,320
Mr. Zhang.

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Didn't I die?

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,560
The year 1997...

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
Did I time travel?

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,280
Li Tian.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
What trick are you trying to pull this time?

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,920
Are you trying to use soul transfer to trick me out of the property deed again?

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,640
Xinyue.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,400
Don't come any closer.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,720
Xinyue, don't be nervous.

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm not Li Tian.

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,040
No, that's not right.

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I am Li Tian.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
But I'm not the bad Li Tian from before.

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
When I asked you for the property deed,

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,280
you just gave it to me.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,760
I'm your husband.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Are you really going to just watch me die?

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,320
Give it to me.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Give it to me.

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,160
Give it to me.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,640
No.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,120
No.

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,040
What are you looking at?

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,160
Mind your own business.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,480
Get lost.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Get out of here.

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,480
Get out right now.

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
Or I'll call the police.

47
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,960
Get out.

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,640
Leave.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,640
Even though I've been reborn in this jerk's body,

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,320
I guess it's fate

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,120
giving me a second chance at life.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,840
Maybe

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,920
I can ride the tide of the times again

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
and return to the top.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Who are you guys?

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Hold him down.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
What are you doing?

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,160
Li Tian.

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
You owe us twenty thousand yuan.

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
It's due today.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
If you can't pay it back,

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
you'll have to pay the price.

63
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Hold him down.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,480
Let me give you a manicure first.

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm telling you,

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,480
if you don't pay the money today,

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,040
you can forget about keeping your fingers.

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,360
One finger is five thousand.

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,680
Four fingers.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,800
That covers your debt.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
It's a good deal.

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,040
Wait a second.

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
Wait.

74
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm the president of Tianliang Group.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,240
The richest man in Tiancheng.

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
A mere twenty thousand yuan.

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
Let me go and I'll transfer it to you.

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
Tianliang Group?

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,920
You're the president of Tianliang Group?

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Yeah.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,840
You must have gambled your brains away.

82
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,120
Stop bragging.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,840
I'll show you what happens when you brag.

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Let him go.

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
The house is yours.

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
I'll give you one day.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Move out quickly.

88
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,520
Let's go.

89
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
We're leaving, we're leaving.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,720
Xinyue

91
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,560
Thank you.

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,280
Don't worry about this house.

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll definitely get it back for you.

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,480
As you wish.

95
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
The house is gone.

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
Let's get a divorce.

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,200
Here

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,720
is 1997.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
It's an era where opportunities are everywhere.

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,120
I, Li Tian,

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,360
am here.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
With my knowledge of the future,

103
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,200
making money here

104
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,560
should be a piece of cake.

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Five years—

106
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,840
No,

107
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,240
within three years,

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll be at the top of the rich list.

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Everyone will

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
look up to me

111
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
and worship me.

112
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,040
Are you Li Tian?

113
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,840
Yeah.

114
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,120
Hit him for me.

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Stop.

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Who are you?

117
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
Why are you hitting me?

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,080
Li Tian.

119
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
Do you know how much trouble we went through to find you?

120
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,040
Do you know how much effort it took?

121
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,320
Speak.

122
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,760
When are you going to pay back the money you owe us?

123
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,720
What money?

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
Li Tian.

125
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,480
You were the one who told us to sell pirated CDs.

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,720
Because of you, I lost thirty thousand yuan.

127
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,080
This debt—

128
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
How do you plan to settle it?

129
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
You, you are...

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,760
Li Tian's creditor.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Lin Wanqing.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
That bastard Li Tian—

133
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,160
Just how much debt does he owe out there?

134
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,280
All these creditors coming to the door one after another—

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
He's really made my life miserable.

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
Why are you pretending to be clueless?

137
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't you know what you've done?

138
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Aren't you aware yourself?

139
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,040
Push him down for me.

140
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm sorry!

141
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry!

142
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,800
Sister Qing—

143
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,200
I'm sorry, I apologize to you.

144
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,120
I will definitely pay back the money.

145
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
With interest, too.

146
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,240
I'll pay you back.

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,400
You've already mortgaged your own house.

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
How are you going to pay?

149
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,440
I...

150
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Sister Qing

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
I have the ability to foresee the future.

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,400
This will definitely help you make money.

153
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
Turn on the TV first.

154
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
The midday news will be on soon.

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,480
They'll report an important piece of news.

156
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,840
Princess Diana

157
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
passed away at 4:15 in the early morning.

158
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
Hurry, go!

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,440
Good afternoon, viewers.

160
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,960
Welcome to the midday news.

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
Today's highlights

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
The US stock market is turbulent.

163
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
The New York Stock Exchange experienced severe fluctuations.

164
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,960
The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a significant drop.

165
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,080
Could it be that this timeline and my original timeline

166
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,560
have different events happening?

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,640
Sister Lin

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,400
I told you, this kid never tells the truth.

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,000
Push him down.

170
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,320
There's no need to waste words on him.

171
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,440
Now we bring you

172
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
shocking and tragic news.

173
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
The world-renowned

174
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Princess Diana of Wales

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,360
has been in a serious car accident.

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,520
Damn.

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,200
Bro,

178
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
that princess really died.

179
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Even the timing was spot on.

180
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,200
That's incredible.

181
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,320
That was close.

182
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
I almost forgot.

183
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,840
There's a delay in the broadcast.

184
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
No, Lin,

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,120
this guy definitely knew the news in advance.

186
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,480
This is breaking news.

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,840
And you brought me here early this morning.

188
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,880
How would I know?

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
How do you plan to make money for me?

190
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,720
Go ahead,

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,520
what do you want to do?

192
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,800
Give me a high-end computer.

193
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
I can make a game.

194
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,840
I guarantee that within three months,

195
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
you'll make a big profit.

196
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,080
You?

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,640
If you're really that good,

198
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,120
would you still be chased by debt collectors every day?

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
It's just that

200
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
I haven't found a big boss like you, Qing,

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
who can support me from behind.

202
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

203
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
If you can't do what you said,

204
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,720
you know what the consequences are, right?

205
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,560
I know, I know.

206
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,560
Don't worry.

207
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,520
It's a sure thing.

208
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,880
But, Qing,

209
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,840
could you lend me thirty thousand yuan first?

210
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,400
My wife used our house deed as collateral

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,120
to pay off my debts.

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
I need to get it back first.

213
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,760
I won't lend you money.

214
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,000
But that's not a problem.

215
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
I can help you.

216
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,440
I'll do you a favor with the house deed.

217
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
I'll help you get it back first.

218
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,200
But if you dare trick me again,

219
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,120
it won't just be about a house.

220
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,200
Xinyue.

221
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,160
Xinyue.

222
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
I got the house deed back for you.

223
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,400
Xinyue.

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,680
Xinyue.

225
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,520
What are you doing?

226
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,480
Get out.

227
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry, Xinyue.

228
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,920
I got the house back for you.

229
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,080
Here, this is yours.
