1
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:52,719
No.

2
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,280
This is just too infuriating.

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,039
They're clearly the ones copying us.

4
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,079
And yet they're the ones playing the victim.

5
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,439
Tian.

6
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,719
We can't just let this go, can we?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
A gentleman's revenge is never too late.

8
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,679
Don't be so impulsive.

9
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,760
That's how it is.

10
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,840
Behind Tianming,

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,680
there's a powerful programming team.

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,159
They stole our ideas

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,280
and business secrets.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,439
Then, using their massive user base,

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
they suppressed us and overtook us.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,120
After that, they refined it further.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,480
They don't copy outright,

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,799
they just "draw inspiration."

19
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,359
On top of that,

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,560
they have a strong legal team behind them.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,560
It's hard for us to catch them out.

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,400
It's tough for us to win.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,760
So how do we turn this situation around?

24
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,439
Let's look at it from another perspective.

25
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,000
If our product can be copied,

26
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,920
it means our product

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
has gained commercial recognition.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,560
The more our competitors go out of their way to suppress us,

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,040
doesn't that just show they're afraid of us?

30
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,920
As long as we keep innovating

31
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,120
and upgrading our products,

32
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,040
maintaining our vitality,

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
we'll always remain unbeatable.

34
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,439
So what do you plan to do next?

35
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,319
I plan to

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,680
develop a brand new product.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,000
I've even thought of the name.

38
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,919
It will be called

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,479
Heart Moon Dream Journey.

40
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,400
Brother Tian,

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,039
you're still such a romantic.

42
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,879
And this,

43
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,599
is also a gift for my wife.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,680
How do we have the money to develop a new game right now?

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Find new investors.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,000
I support you.

47
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,759
You little rascal.

48
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,159
You surprise me every time.

49
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,240
That piece of land you resold to me last time,

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
has doubled in value again.

51
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:53,960
So, how about it?

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,719
Do you regret it?

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,919
Of course I don't regret it.

54
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,039
You deserved it in the first place, Brother Fang.

55
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,479
But,

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
your investment this time is a bit large.

57
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,159
My personal cash flow

58
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,800
isn't enough.

59
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,560
But I just met a few people

60
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,319
who might

61
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,240
be able to help you.

62
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,400
That would be perfect.

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,400
Thank you so much, Brother Fang.

64
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,919
Then I won't stand on ceremony with you.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
Thank you for making the introductions.

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,560
Fish.

67
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,400
Fish.

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,120
Hurry.

69
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,159
Don't do yours yet.

70
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,240
Shake it, shake it.

71
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,719
You,

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,439
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

73
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,599
You need to find a balance.

74
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,039
Right now,

75
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,120
haven't we already taken a step toward success?

76
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,400
Thank you, dear—

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
Thank you for caring, honey.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,759
Brother Tian,

79
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,199
Xiaoyu is here.

80
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,039
Sister Xinyue,

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
I heard from Sister Wanqing

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
that you're starting a new business again.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
That's life.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,599
It's about growing through each failure

85
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,479
and becoming stronger.

86
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
So inspiring.

87
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,360
Here is ten million.

89
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,840
This is the money you worked hard to earn.

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
I can't accept it.

91
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,680
This is my investment.

92
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,479
Please take it.

93
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,520
Why are you investing money?

94
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,439
I can't take this money.

95
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,240
Brother Tian,

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,599
I want to make money too.

97
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,399
I've thought it over and over.

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,920
Your project is the most reliable.

99
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,920
So,

100
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,680
please help me make money.

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,839
What,

102
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,120
you don't want to help me make money?

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
No,

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
you don't want me to get rich?

105
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,160
Sister-in-law, look at him.

106
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,160
Just accept it.

107
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,399
We're all family.

108
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,560
Let's make money together.

109
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,160
That's right.

110
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,680
I have a share too.

111
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,839
It's not much,

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
but it's still an investment.

113
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,959
Alright.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,800
Then,

115
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
it's settled.

116
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,040
Anyway, I won't let you lose money.

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,680
Okay.

118
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Hello, Brother Fang.

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
My friends from foreign companies

120
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
have already set up a meeting for you.

121
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,920
Tomorrow morning at eight.

122
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,319
Come to my company to meet them.

123
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,519
Really?

124
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,800
Thank you, Brother Fang.

125
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Chairman

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Sparks received good feedback as soon as it launched.

127
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,079
But it also got a lot of negative reviews.

128
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,560
They say we

129
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,959
have too much overlap with our previous games.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
None of these are real problems.

131
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,040
How are things going with Li Tian?

132
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,079
It's said he's developing a new game.

133
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
But all his employees have been let go.

134
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,839
How could he have the funds to develop a new game?

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,800
How are the talks with Blizzard going?

136
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Sparks

137
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,519
They think it's not influential enough yet.

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,480
But they're very interested in our game in development, Defender.

139
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,839
They're still very interested.

140
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,519
Speed up the development.

141
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,480
Make sure we can collaborate with Blizzard.

142
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,879
For us,

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,439
this would be a major breakthrough.

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,279
Okay.

145
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,199
Li Tian

146
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,040
Will you make a comeback or stay a loser?

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Let's see what you're really capable of.

148
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,879
Honey, come out quickly!

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,959
Coming, coming!

150
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,199
We're going to be late!

151
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,959
You're going to nag me to death.

152
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Let me see.

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,120
Is it okay?

154
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,639
My husband is so handsome.

155
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,920
Let's go.

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,319
Wait.

157
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,040
All the clients today are foreigners.

158
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,519
Are you sure you don't need a translator?

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,519
No, I don't.

160
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,120
But...

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,040
I need

162
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,040
some encouragement.

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,720
What?

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Let's go.

165
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,240
Go.

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,680
Next,

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's have Mr. Li present the design plan.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,279
What you're seeing here

169
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,199
is our character design sketch.

170
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,839
Dear Mr. Li,

171
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,000
we also hope

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,399
to collaborate with Millennium on "Heart Moon Dream Journey."

173
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,120
This would be a win-win situation for both of us.

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,839
Your company is famous worldwide.

175
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,199
Let's work together.

176
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,480
Mr. Li,

177
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,439
I believe our company can contribute

178
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,839
to character creation.

179
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,120
As for the investment,

180
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,519
we are also very interested.

181
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,600
Alright.

182
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,120
Wishing us a successful partnership.

183
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,560
We're back again.

184
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
Mr. Li, Mr. Lin,

185
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,959
everyone,

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,519
you're all back.

187
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,319
Is everyone here?

188
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,600
Everyone's here.

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,399
Well then,

190
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,920
Are you ready?

191
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,399
Ready.

192
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,079
This time,

193
