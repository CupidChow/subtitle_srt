1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,640
I brought what you wanted.

2
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,880
Thank you, Brother Ji.

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,840
So,

4
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,760
where's what I asked for?

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,320
Li Tian.

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,680
Are you messing with me?

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,240
Brother Ji.

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,720
Take a look below.

9
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,080
Alright.

10
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,320
Okay.

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,680
Brother Ji.

12
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
I made this figurine especially for you.

13
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
It's one of a kind.

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,280
It's a limited edition.

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm a devoted fan of Spring Story.

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,080
Even though they're no longer on the market,

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
I'm still very grateful to them.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,840
They helped me through a tough time.

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Big Brother.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Bring the wine, let's drink.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,720
Thank you.

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
Everything's been taken care of.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,320
Thank you, Brother Ji, for helping me out.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,840
with the Xiaolingtong agency rights.

25
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,479
Come on.

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,560
So,

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
about the goods...

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
Don't worry.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,400
I've already arranged everything for you.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,800
You can pick up the goods in a couple of days.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,080
Thank you, Brother Ji.

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,080
Thank you, Brother Ji.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,440
Miss Lin.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,160
You have beautiful hands.

35
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,680
Brother Ji.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,600
Boss Lin is my capable partner.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Oh.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,080
Li Tian.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,880
You're really a lucky guy.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
Let me toast Brother Ji.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,800
Okay.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,240
Tonight, we’re not leaving until we’re drunk.

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,400
Not leaving until we’re drunk!

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,080
Come on, come on, come on!

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
Come on, let’s drink, let’s drink, let’s drink!

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
Let’s get hyped! Let’s get hyped!

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
The girl sings pretty well.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,920
Did I pay you to come here and cry for me?

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,920
Sing for me.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,800
Let go, I can’t sing.

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
Can’t.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,560
If you can’t, why are you here?

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,640
Bro, calm down.

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
Please calm down, okay?

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,360
Please, have a seat inside first.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,440
All your expenses tonight

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,320
will be on the house.

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
Get lost.

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
What?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Do I look like I need money?

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
I’ve got plenty right here.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Sing for me.

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
Get lost.

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Today,

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
I’m not singing.

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,160
I’ll kill you today.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,760
Stop!

68
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,680
Guys, get him!

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,440
Boss!

70
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,400
You dare play the hero here?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,240
Tired of living?

72
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,880
Stop!

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
Causing trouble on my turf

74
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,080
You've got some nerve

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Brother Ji, I failed to recognize you

76
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
I accidentally offended you

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
I-I'm sorry, really sorry

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,640
I'll punish myself

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,520
Enough

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
Apologize to my guest

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
Sir, it was my fault

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm not the one you should apologize to

83
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
It's her

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
Miss, I was wrong

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
I'm sorry

86
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,560
And?

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Please accept this

88
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,320
Take it as my apology

89
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,960
Get lost

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
You think you can settle this with a little money?

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,800
Sorry

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,880
Sorry

93
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,560
Sorry

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,680
My fault, it's my fault

95
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,920
My fault, my fault

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,880
My fault, my fault, my fault

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,520
That's enough

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,680
Okay

99
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,080
Thank you

100
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,880
Get out

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
Hurry up and leave

102
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,440
Let's go, go, go, go

103
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,640
Are you okay?

104
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,600
Thank you.

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,080
But now the customer is upset.

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
After you leave,

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,040
he definitely won't let it go.

108
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,560
So I can't sing here anymore.

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,560
How about this instead?

110
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
Actually, it's perfect.

111
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
We're starting a business too.

112
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
With your singing, business will surely be good.

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
We'll definitely need someone like you in the future.

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,960
See?

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,560
Would you like to join us?

116
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Really?

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,240
Welcome aboard.

118
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,560
Thank you.

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
Delicious.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,040
Xinyue.

121
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Long time no see.

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,400
Guo Wenbang.

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,120
Have some water.

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Mm.

125
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,760
Weren't you abroad all this time?

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,200
Why did you suddenly come back?

127
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
I just got back.

128
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
I wanted to come see you.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
How have you been these past years?

130
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,280
You...

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,720
You're married.

132
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Yeah, I'm married.

133
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
Life just goes on, you know.

134
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,480
What about you?

135
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,040
I'm still single.

136
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Is he good to you?

137
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
He's pretty good to me.

138
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
You're not that young anymore either.

139
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
It's time to settle down.

140
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Xinyue...

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,040
I can't forget you.

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,160
We're in the past now.

143
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,400
You deserve someone better.

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,040
Xinyue, I...

145
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Taking advantage of my absence to bother my wife, huh?

146
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
Li Tian, you misunderstood.

147
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
He's just my friend.

148
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
Don't, don't, don't.

149
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
You two, stop fighting.

150
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Eat your noodles.

151
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
Aren't you two being childish?

152
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,760
Xinyue...

153
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
I'll come see you again in a couple of days.

154
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
Take care, I won't see you out.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,039
Honey, don't let him come over again.

156
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
You can tell he's up to no good.

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,800
What?

158
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,960
So you're allowed to be around pretty women,

159
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
but I can't?

160
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,920
There's really nothing between me and Sister Wanqing.

161
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,200
We're just work partners, that's all.

162
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,320
He was my first love.

163
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,360
That was many years ago.

164
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm most afraid of old love suddenly coming back.

165
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,280
What are you mumbling about?

166
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,840
Oh, it's nothing.

167
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh, right, Xinyue.

168
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
This time when we went to Yuzhen,

169
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,960
we successfully got the dealership for Xiaolingtong.

170
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
I believe that before long,

171
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,200
we'll make a fortune.

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah.

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
I believe in you.

174
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
You'll succeed at whatever you do.

175
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,160
Yeah.

176
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah.

177
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,160
Congratulations to our Millennium Xiaolingtong.

178
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,880
Wishing a great opening!

179
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Come on, come on.

180
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
Jun, give us a countdown.

181
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Come on, let's do it together.

182
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,160
Three.

183
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,520
Two.

184
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,640
One.

185
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,760
Okay.

186
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,680
Let me see. Show me.

187
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
This Xiaolingtong of ours,

188
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
has truly achieved

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,320
making landlines no longer fixed.

190
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,280
I want to order three more.

191
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,680
The standby time is very long.

192
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,640
Does this come with a warranty?

193
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,920
No problem, don't worry.

194
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,440
Here.

195
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,000
Give me one.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Okay, here you go.

197
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Give me one too.

198
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,360
No problem.

199
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
There aren't many left now.

200
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,040
When everyone uses it,

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,160
be sure to read the manual carefully.

202
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,800
The manual has detailed instructions.

203
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,960
I'll buy one, I'll buy one.

204
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Recently, Li Tian from Yuzhen

205
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,320
got the distribution rights for Xiaolingtong.

206
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,720
They sold out very quickly.

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,160
Business is booming.

208
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
Xiaolingtong.

209
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
How could I have forgotten about this?

210
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,880
Tell the mobile phone R&D department

211
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,880
to speed up the development of smartphones.

212
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,720
The mobile information era is coming.

213
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,960
As for Li Tian,

214
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,120
let him sell as many Xiaolingtongs as he wants.

215
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,120
He has already given up on developing games.

216
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,360
Why are you still targeting him?

217
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,800
What?

218
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
After a few interactions,

219
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,840
you feel sorry for him now?

220
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
No.

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's good, then.

222
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,200
What is it?

223
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,320
Did I hurt you by pinching?

224
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,400
It's nothing.

225
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll head out first.

226
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Go ahead.
