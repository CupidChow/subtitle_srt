1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,359
Mr. Zhang's arrangements are really thoughtful.

2
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,799
This place is pretty good.

3
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,679
Yeah.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,920
Perfect.

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,079
Delicious, really delicious.

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
It's really good.

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,640
Mr. Qin.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,439
Yes?

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,920
About what comes next,

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,120
I'll leave it to you.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,359
Is that really okay?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
Mr. Qin.

13
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,519
When we make money in the future,

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,000
we'll earn it together.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,239
There's still a long way to go.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,599
Don't worry.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,840
Mr. Zhang's capabilities

18
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,480
are second to none.

19
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,400
There's good news

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,840
and bad news.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,760
Pick one.

22
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,680
Let's hear the good news first.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,719
The good news is,

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,040
among the two games that Fengxue Company is considering,

25
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,079
our "Xinyue Dream Journey" is one of them.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,879
If this collaboration works out,

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,599
our game will be released worldwide.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,840
That's great, that's fantastic!

29
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,280
And the bad news?

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
They're only picking one.

31
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,159
So our competitor is...

32
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,879
Talk about a narrow road for rivals.

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,719
Tianming's "Defender."

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,840
Fengxue Company will announce the final result tomorrow.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
We don't know what the outcome will be.

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,120
Good luck.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,680
Li Tian.

38
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,520
You brought so many people to support our Tianming.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,919
It's truly my honor.

40
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,439
It's still not decided who will win.

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Mr. Zhang, are you in such a hurry to prove us wrong?

42
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,080
Let's wait and see.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,360
Despicable person.

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,080
Don't get angry with them.

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,719
No need to upset yourself over it.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,840
Let's go.

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,960
We invited everyone here today

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,639
to make an announcement.

49
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,199
Our Fengxue Company

50
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,400
has finally decided on a partner.

51
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,120
At present,

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,840
both your companies are very strong.

53
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,400
After screening many companies,

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,639
we narrowed it down to you two.

55
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,879
Let's keep it brief.

56
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,520
Now, I'll announce

57
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,080
the final result.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
Tianming's game, "Defender,"

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
is an excellent game.

60
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,639
It perfectly matches

61
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,879
our company's aesthetic requirements.

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,719
It also has great design.

63
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,199
Therefore,

64
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,919
Fengxue Company has decided

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,560
to cooperate with Tianming.

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Let's give a round of applause.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,319
Thank you for your recognition.

68
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,439
I'll book a restaurant.

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,319
Hope you'll join us later.

70
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,319
Let's have a meal together.

71
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,680
Then I'll gladly accept.

72
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,959
Looking forward to our cooperation.

73
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,720
Looking forward to our cooperation.

74
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,560
What do you think, Mr. Li?

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Would you like to join us?

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,000
Taking your seat now

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,399
is a bit too early, isn't it?

78
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,199
Boss

79
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,759
How dare you do this

80
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,879
Why are you here?

81
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,959
I heard you've been deceiving your superiors

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,279
Accepting bribes is truly shameful

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,399
You told us

84
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,000
that Li withdrew voluntarily

85
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,839
but that's not the truth

86
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,000
Can you take responsibility for this?

87
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,240
You're fired

88
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm sorry

89
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
Please spare me

90
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,560
Please don't fire me

91
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,600
Get out

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,519
Give me a chance

93
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,360
Please give me a chance

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Sorry

95
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,199
We don't want to work with someone who cheats

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,120
Please leave

97
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,439
Congratulations, Li Tian.

98
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,279
For becoming our partner.

99
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,639
We ultimately chose to work with you.

100
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,399
This game's concept and business model are very innovative.

101
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,839
Looking forward to our collaboration.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
Here's to a successful partnership.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,480
Come on.

104
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,360
Take a photo for us.

105
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,879
Help us take a picture.

106
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,560
Come on.

107
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,800
Three, two, one.

108
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:07,959
Thank you.

109
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,399
I told her a secret.

110
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,399
Miss Xia Yu.

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Highly recommended you.

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,240
So after reviewing this proposal,

113
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,240
I think her idea is excellent.

114
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,160
As expected, it's currently

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
the most creative and competitive game.

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,120
That's how it should be.

117
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,199
This time, you didn't make the cut.

118
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
In the future, the board will definitely limit your authority.

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm the chairman.

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,439
Let's see who dares.

121
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,680
Take a break and have some soup.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,439
Thank you, honey.

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
I stewed it all afternoon.

124
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,439
It smells really good.

125
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,720
Of course.

126
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,000
Does it taste good?

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,800
It's delicious.

128
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll have another spoonful.

129
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,639
What's wrong?

130
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,560
Honey.

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Yeah?

132
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,160
It's so good to have you.

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,399
At your company

134
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,920
What's wrong with being at my company?

135
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,199
Hugging my own wife isn't against the law.

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,399
Honey

137
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,639
Yeah

138
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,279
Can you try not to work so hard from now on?

139
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,560
You really need to take care of your health.

140
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,879
That way,

141
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,839
you'll have the energy to take care of our baby.

142
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,879
What baby?

143
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,959
The baby we'll have together.

144
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
You're so annoying.

145
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,720
Mr. Li and his wife really have a great relationship.

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
Yeah

147
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,240
But why do I feel like

148
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,320
Ms. Lin is being really attentive to Mr. Li?

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,039
Could it be that she likes Mr. Li?

150
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,440
She totally does.

151
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,080
Look,

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
the way she looks at Mr. Li

153
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,519
is so clingy.

154
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,480
But doesn't Mr. Li already have a wife?

155
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,919
If she keeps this up, isn't she just a mistress?

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,039
So shameless.

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,919
I don't think Mr. Li is interested in her at all.

158
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,559
She's the one trying to seduce Mr. Li.

159
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,399
Brother Jun

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Jun—Brother Jun

161
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,919
Brother Jun, stop hitting him.

162
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,519
Gossiping behind people's backs

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,279
Talking nonsense

164
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,279
Slandering Mr. Lin, right?

165
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,039
Stop hitting him.

166
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,679
Get lost.

167
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
I see you're a woman

168
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
I didn't hit you.

169
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,159
If I hear you talking nonsense again

170
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,120
I'll tear your mouth apart.

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,080
Chen Jun

172
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,519
This is a company.

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
He deserves to be hit.

174
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,200
Your medical expenses

175
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,320
Come to me after work to claim them.

176
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,759
Oh, okay.

177
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Stop staring, everyone.

178
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,840
Get back to work.

179
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
You go work too.

180
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,559
Alright, alright.
