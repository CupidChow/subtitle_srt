1
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,560
Xinyue

2
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,000
Xinyue

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,719
What are you doing?

4
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,640
Get out.

5
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm sorry, Xinyue.

6
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,479
I've redeemed the house for you.

7
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm giving this back to you.

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,239
Stay away from me.

9
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,000
Xinyue

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,519
Let's get the divorce certificate as soon as possible.

11
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,200
Be careful.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,920
Don't touch me.

13
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,959
Xinyue

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,359
I'll definitely buy you a new dressing table.

15
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,519
With what money will you buy it for me?

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
Are you going to keep making money by playing games?

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,519
Yes.

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
Get out.

19
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,400
Get lost.

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Xinyue is actually a good wife.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,079
Li Tian is really a jerk.

22
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,840
Feels like I'm scolding myself.

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,040
Starting tomorrow,

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,239
I'll work hard to make money.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
My next goal

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
is to get rich by buying lottery tickets.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,919
After winning five million in the lottery,

28
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,639
I'll go into the restaurant business.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
I can also invest in real estate.

30
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,520
Next,

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,520
the real estate industry will develop rapidly.

32
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,599
Related building materials,

33
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,800
furniture, and renovation businesses will also boom.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,879
Making money will be a piece of cake.

35
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,879
Getting rich overnight won't just be a dream.

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,120
Luxury cars and villas will beckon to me again.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,840
I will definitely reach the peak of my life again.

38
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,240
From now on, in this world,

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,360
I will become a legend.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,639
Boss

41
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,120
Buy this number for me.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
This number just came out yesterday.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you sure you want to buy it?

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,080
Yesterday...

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh no, I only remembered the number.

46
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,719
I didn't remember the time.

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
What should I do now?

48
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,479
I don't understand stocks either.

49
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,240
Bitcoin will only be valuable in twenty years.

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,719
Other people make great progress after being reborn.

51
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,439
But I don't know anything after being reborn.

52
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,680
All I can do is play games.

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,199
What should I do now?

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,919
Then, boss,

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
Can you pick five random numbers for me?

56
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,479
I can't.

57
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,879
You still owe me fifty from before.

58
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,319
I'll deduct this ten first.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,759
You still owe me forty.

60
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,639
Pay me back tomorrow.

61
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,439
Okay.

62
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll bring it to you tomorrow then.

63
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,319
Hurry up, what are you waiting for?

64
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah.

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,639
Pair of Kings.

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,080
Three sevens.

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,919
Play, it's your turn.

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Two of Dots.

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,840
Hurry up.

70
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,479
Chow, chow, chow.

71
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Have something to eat.

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,079
Yeah.

73
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,560
It's over.

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
It's not over.

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
It's not over.

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
It's getting late, Qing.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's call it a day.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
This kid

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,879
really does have some skills.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
Come on, come on, take a look!

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,560
Millennium Internet Cafe has a new game, guys!

82
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
If you love gaming, come try this one out.

83
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:25,959
Just come right in.

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
Don't hesitate.

85
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,399
Go straight inside.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,759
Experience our 3D game.

87
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,720
It's awesome.

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,879
Come on, give it a try.

89
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,839
Li Tian really is talented.

90
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
He not only paid back my money,

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
he even made me a profit.

92
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,160
Lin,

93
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,959
business is booming right now.

94
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,920
A lot of people want to get online.

95
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
They all have to book in advance.

96
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,199
We're short-staffed at the shop.

97
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,040
We'll need the guys to help out more.

98
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,519
Please pay extra attention and arrange things well.

99
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,240
Don't worry.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Yeah.

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,879
You picked a great spot.

102
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,920
Let's go again another day.

103
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,480
Okay.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,879
Is there any left at home?

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,720
No, there's none left.

106
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,279
All gone?

107
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,240
Excuse me, coming through.

108
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,279
This way.

109
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,519
You two, slow down.

110
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:32,959
Okay.

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
Slow down, be careful.

112
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,160
It's fine, it's fine.

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Brother

114
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,759
Do you think these things

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
are worth quite a bit of money?

116
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,680
Yeah, brother.

117
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
If we resell them at the secondhand market, we can make a little profit.

118
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,160
Just these things

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,759
are worth a hundred yuan.

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,639
This whole load, a hundred?

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll give you the money first.

122
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,519
Alright.

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,240
Load it up.

124
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,800
Li Tian, what are you doing again?

125
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,480
We just got the house back a few days ago.

126
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,639
And now you've sold it again.

127
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,279
Tomorrow

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
Tomorrow we'll get divorced.

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

130
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,680
Don't even think about the house anymore.

131
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,319
Xinyue, that's not it.

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,040
Sister-in-law

133
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Who are you calling sister-in-law?

134
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Ex-sister-in-law.

135
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,560
We're here to deliver furniture.

136
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
It's inside the house.

137
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,120
Xinyue

138
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,080
This is the birthday present I bought for you.

139
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,039
Do you like it?

140
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,399
I feel very guilty.

141
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,000
I've made too many mistakes in the past.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,240
I've made you suffer too much because of me.

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
But I've changed now.

144
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,080
I just hope you can be happy.

145
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,759
And have a better life.

146
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,919
Thank you.

147
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,720
Boss

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,200
There's a guy named Li Tian at the Millennium Internet Cafe.

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,120
He developed a game called Spring Story.

150
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,320
Business is booming.

151
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,799
He must be a technical talent.

152
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,480
Should we try to recruit him?

153
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,679
Li Tian.

154
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,960
So you're Li Tian.

155
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,279
And you are?

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
You're not here to collect a debt from Li Tian again, are you?

157
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,840
I'm Ye Xuan, Vice President of Network at Tianming Group.

158
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,279
What brings you here?

159
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,639
Li Tian, you're quite straightforward.

160
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,399
Then I'll get straight to the point as well.

161
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,919
This Millennium Internet Cafe

162
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,440
is just a small operation.

163
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,840
How much can you really make working here?

164
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,840
Why not

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,399
sell me the rights to your game, Spring Story?

166
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,600
I'll give you a ten percent share.

167
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,679
What do you think?

168
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,399
President Ye's offer is really generous.

169
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
But what about Sister Qing?

170
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,399
When I had nothing,

171
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,679
she gave me all her support.

172
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,440
I would never betray her.

173
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,720
Opportunities don't always come around.

174
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,679
Don't wait until you've lost it

175
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,279
to regret it.

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Take care.

177
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,840
I won't see you out.

178
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,720
No need to rush your decision.

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Go home and ask your wife for her opinion.

180
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,039
Let's go.

181
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,559
All your dishes are here.

182
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,360
Please enjoy your meal.

183
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,799
Boss lady.

184
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,679
Sit down and have a drink with my buddy.

185
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,039
I still have things to do over there.

186
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,879
You guys go ahead and drink.

187
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,799
Have a drink.

188
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,879
Have a drink, come on.

189
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,000
