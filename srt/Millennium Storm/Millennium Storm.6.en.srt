1
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,840
These,

2
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,520
are the profits from this period.

3
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,479
Here you go, Mr. Lin.

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,280
This is yours.

5
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,520
This stack is mine.

6
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,480
And these are for Brother Ji.

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,879
It's only been a few days,

8
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,480
and we've already made so much money.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,959
This

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,519
is just the tip of the iceberg.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,840
Right now, market demand is surging.

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,079
Soon, Xiaolingtong

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,840
will be everywhere, with everyone in the country owning one.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,280
We

15
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,959
must seize this opportunity

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,640
and strive to get the agency rights for East China

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,719
and take them all.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,200
In the future,

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,359
we'll start another

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
electronics sales company,

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,439
aiming to grow bigger and stronger,

22
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,280
and work towards going public.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,560
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,959
Brother Li, you're amazing.

25
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,480
This here

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,799
is the money I earned this month.

27
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm giving it all to you to keep.

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,239
This...

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,799
Is this the money you made from selling Xiaolingtong?

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,319
Yes.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,480
That's quite a lot.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,480
In the future, I'll earn even more.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,359
You know,

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
you don't have to work so hard anymore.

35
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,680
I don't think it's that hard right now.

36
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,000
I think it's pretty good like this.

37
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,639
I don't want to be

38
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,639
a woman who only relies on her husband.

39
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,120
Besides,

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,919
you're so outstanding now.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,759
And you have so many female friends around you.

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
If I don't work hard,

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,479
you might start to dislike me.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,960
I don't have that many female friends.

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,120
We're just work partners, that's all.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,719
You...

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,360
Hmm?

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,240
You're jealous.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,840
I—I'm not.

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,919
You are jealous.

51
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm not.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Look at your face.

53
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,159
I'm not jealous.

54
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,360
You're upset, so you're jealous.

55
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,759
Does it tickle? Does it tickle?

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,240
How is it?

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,759
Does it tickle?

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,319
Don't tickle me, I'm ticklish too.

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,319
I'm not jealous.

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,120
If you don't believe me, you can come to my company and see for yourself.

61
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,400
I—I—I still have something to do.

62
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,120
I won't tease you anymore.

63
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,120
Alright, thank you, Mr. Fang.

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
These two months' worth of goods

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,360
must be shipped out quickly.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,439
Sales are especially good.

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Mr. Li,

68
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,919
why did you only order two months' worth of goods?

69
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,240
Sales are trending so high right now.

70
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,520
Why not take advantage of the momentum

71
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
and order more?

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,120
My supply is in high demand.

73
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,680
Since you're a friend of Brother Ji,

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
so,

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm giving you the biggest share.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
If you ask me again in two months,

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,719
I can't guarantee

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,479
there will still be goods for you.

79
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,759
Mr. Fang,

80
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,280
the main thing is, the cash I have on hand

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
is only enough to pre-order two months' worth.

82
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,639
That's easy to solve.

83
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,240
You can just pay a deposit first.

84
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,840
Once the goods are sold,

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,879
you can pay me the rest.

86
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,080
It's 1998 now.

87
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,800
I remember the market peak for Xiaolingtong

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,520
was from 2000 to 2005.

89
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,319
There's at least six or seven years of value left.

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,680
Ordering more shouldn't be a loss.

91
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,199
Alright.

92
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,879
Then thank you, Mr. Fang.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
Reserve a year's worth of goods for me first.

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,759
No need to be so polite.

95
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,279
Here's the deposit.

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,160
Okay.

97
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,319
Brother Tian,

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,240
Brother Tian,

99
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,240
Sister Wanqing,

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,959
So early in the morning,

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
why does everyone look so worried?

102
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,800
Boss Fang just called.

103
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,680
He said he won't supply us with goods anymore.

104
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,360
Now our supply has been cut off.

105
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,079
Many clients are asking for refunds.

106
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,199
And a lot of stores

107
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,279
are demanding we pay them penalties for breach of contract.

108
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,199
Hello?

109
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,600
Hello, Mr. Fang.

110
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,120
What's going on here?

111
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Mr. Li,

112
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,839
I'm really sorry.

113
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,319
Someone offered double the price

114
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,519
and signed a five-year contract for the goods.

115
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,959
They took all the domestic sales rights.

116
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,240
The problem is, you offended

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,600
someone you shouldn't have.

118
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,360
Well...

119
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:27,839
Hello?

120
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,319
Brother Tian

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,279
So what should we do now?

122
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:38,800
Here's what we'll do.

123
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,480
First, refund all the buyers' deposits.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Compensate where necessary.

125
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,519
Then settle the accounts.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
See how much spare cash we have left.

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,319
Okay.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,879
We've already secured

129
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,920
the exclusive domestic distribution rights for all Xiaolingtong devices.

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,160
Li Tian's side has also sold out of stock.

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,839
They're currently handling compensation.

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,000
Well done.

133
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,079
Xiaolingtong will only be popular for another five or six years.

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,800
Next comes the era of smartphones.

135
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
Quickly arrange for the technical staff

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
to start developing and producing smartphones.

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,759
Alright.

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,399
Xinyue

139
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,519
You're back.

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,160
Yeah.

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,439
What's wrong?

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,319
Why do you look so tired?

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Oh.

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,279
It's nothing.

145
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,319
Let's go eat, then.

146
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,879
Okay, I'll get ready.

147
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,279
Then let's go home early.

148
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,279
Okay.

149
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

150
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,480
Who has been working against me all this time?

151
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,800
Today, we are very honored

152
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,639
to have invited the founder of Tianming Group

153
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,519
Mr. Zhang Liang.

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,199
In just three short years,

155
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,600
he took Tianming Group public.

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,439
Mr. Zhang Liang, may I ask

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
what insights you have?

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,879
Insights...

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Perhaps it's about keeping up with the tide of the times.

160
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
In the near future,

161
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,519
it will be the era of internet technology.

162
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,639
So the key industries for Tianming Group

163
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,439
will be

164
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,319
electronics,

165
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,160
information,

166
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,240
and technology-related fields.

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,439
Hmm.

168
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,519
Of course,

169
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,879
it's not limited to communications and gaming.

170
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,439
Everyone will have a smartphone by then.

171
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,839
People will be able to use their phones

172
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,319
to shop online.

173
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,959
They can receive goods without ever leaving home.

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
Life will become more and more convenient.

175
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,199
Most importantly,

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,839
Zhang Liang has also traveled back.

177
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,279
Tianming Group

178
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,360
You know.

179
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Behind me is the top internet group company.

180
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,240
Tianming

181
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,199
Don't you think

182
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
this is where your stage truly is?

183
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,800
So he was the one behind it all.

184
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,040
No wonder Yuanqi's firewall could be breached.

185
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,399
Looks like he had his eyes on me from the very beginning.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,320
No matter what I do,

187
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,639
he always tries to interfere.

188
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,919
Sorry, excuse me.

189
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,759
Sorry.

190
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,240
I think buying a house in this area is a good idea.

191
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,519
They're going to build a high-speed rail here soon.

192
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,279
The property prices here are sure to go up.

193
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,759
If you buy now, you'll definitely make a profit.

195
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,039
Welcome to the "Current Affairs Appointment" program.

196
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,320
We are honored to have with us

197
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,759
the world's eighth richest person on the Forbes list,

198
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,960
real estate tycoon Mr. Fang Jianguo.

199
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I think our audience is very curious

200
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,480
about what opportunity

201
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,879
led you to enter the real estate industry

202
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,240
and eventually become a real estate tycoon?

203
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,279
Well, the real turning point

204
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,919
was in 1998.

205
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,440
That year,

206
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,320
I met a young friend.

207
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,159
I thought he looked so familiar.

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,879
It turns out he is the one who, twenty years later,

209
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,279
became the real estate tycoon Fang Jianguo.

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,519
Hello, Wanqing.

211
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,559
Transfer all the company's cash to me.

212
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,360
Also,

213
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,639
tell all the buyers

214
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,360
we'll delay the compensation by ten days.

215
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,840
If we fail to fulfill our obligations,

216
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,759
we'll pay double compensation then.

217
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
There's always a way out.

218
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,440
This time,

219
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,279
just wait and see.
