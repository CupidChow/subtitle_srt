1
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,799
Is this okay, Brother Tian?

2
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,880
Yeah, this will do.

3
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,640
Alright.

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,599
Brother Tian.

5
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,799
I think the houses in Hedong District are pretty good.

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,840
The location is great.

7
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,120
It's near the financial center.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
It'll definitely go up in value in the future, right?

9
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
The prices in Hedong District are inflated.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,280
I don't recommend buying there.

11
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,959
If you want to buy,

12
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,760
you should buy a house in the western suburbs.

13
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,200
Right now, it's five hundred per square meter.

14
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,920
Although the location is a bit remote,

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,480
it's definitely going to develop over the next few decades.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,159
The price will increase by at least

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,319
fifty times.

18
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,560
Fifty times?

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,120
Yeah.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,640
Young man,

21
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,079
your opinion on this

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,439
I find it pretty funny.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,760
The west side of the city is deserted.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,000
Who's going to develop it?

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,239
If there's money for development,

26
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,599
it'll go to the east side.

27
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:53,879
Brother,

28
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,439
don't doubt me.

29
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,079
Within the next ten days,

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,959
the houses in the western suburbs

31
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,640
will increase at least tenfold.

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,319
Young man,

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,599
when it comes to the housing market trends,

34
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,120
I have quite a bit of experience.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,639
What you're saying is impossible.

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
How about this, then?

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,599
Okay.

38
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,840
Let's make a bet.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,319
Alright.

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,639
If the houses in the western suburbs

41
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,360
increase fiftyfold within ten days,

42
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,319
you pay me twenty million.

43
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,840
If I lose the bet,

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,039
I'll pay you twenty million. How about that?

45
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,479
Twenty million?

46
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,039
Are you sure about this?

47
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,400
This isn't a small bet.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,039
As for me,

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,000
of course I have my own conditions.

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,319
When you do something,

51
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,080
there should always be something to gain.

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Just tell me, do you dare to take the bet?

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,719
For you, twenty million

54
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,199
is just a small amount.

55
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,960
But for me,

56
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm betting on a big chance to move up.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,759
It seems

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,719
you didn't come here

59
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,599
just to fish.

60
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,879
It is fishing,

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,159
but what I'm fishing for

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,319
is someone willing to take the bait.

63
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,639
Hmm.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,960
Alright.

65
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,479
Since you put it that way,

66
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,280
I'll take the bet.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
July 1998

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,479
The State Council issued

69
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,719
a notice on further deepening

70
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,240
the reform of the urban housing system

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,000
and accelerating housing construction

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,159
marking the end of the welfare-based housing allocation system

73
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,439
as it exited the stage of history

74
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,199
and the era of commercialized housing began

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,719
The state encouraged residents to purchase their own homes

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,879
and promoted the role of market mechanisms

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,800
A brand new housing revolution began from then on

78
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,639
Li Tian

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,439
You definitely won't miss

80
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,000
this chance to turn things around, will you?

81
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,719
Then let's have a good competition

82
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,719
I want you to know

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,840
you will never beat me

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,599
Hello

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
Do you know where there are houses for sale around here?

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh, I don't know

87
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,319
Thank you

88
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Miss,

89
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,959
do you know where there are houses for sale around here?

90
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,600
There aren't any houses for sale here.

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh, thank you.

92
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,879
Sorry to bother you.

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,199
Sir,

94
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,639
do you know where there are houses for sale around here?

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,639
Yes.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,000
My house.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,759
Your house?

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,519
That's right.

99
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,160
We'd like to buy your house.

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,439
Could you show it to us?

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,199
Sure.

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,279
Okay.

103
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,360
This way.

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,319
Alright, let's take a look.

105
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,240

Okay.

112
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,319
I understand.

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,079
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

we will conduct anonymous bidding via telephone.

119
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,519
A dedicated agent

will place bids on your behalf.

121
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,759
Each bidding round lasts two minutes.

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,920
The highest bidder wins.

123
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,279
The auction will now begin.

124
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,120
We will now officially start.

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,879

Boss

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
We have successfully won

167
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,439
all the houses in the Hedong area

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
Very good

169
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,519
Boss

170
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,759
The cell signal is lost

171
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,920
What's going on?

172
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,639
Use the landline

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,240
Okay

174
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,879
Brother Tian, it's done.

175
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,480
I disconnected their phone line.

176
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,079
I also installed a signal jammer.

177
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Good job.

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,839
We got the house without any problems.

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,439
Client number 061.

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,839

Bid seven hundred fifty thousand.

183
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,199
The landline doesn't work either.

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,639
Who is number 097?

185
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,560
Number 097 is Li Tian.

186
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,279
He successfully won the bid for a house.

187
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
A holdout house in the western suburbs.

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,639
A house in the western suburbs.

189
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,000
In ten days, the western suburbs

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
will be included in the high-speed rail project.

191
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,439
Houses there, in another ten years,

192
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,319
or twenty years,

193
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,120
will only increase fiftyfold by then.

194
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,399
Why did he buy a house there?

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
Brother Fang,

196
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
what about the property deed?

197
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,959
Just consider it as if you bought it for twenty million.

198
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
If you trust me,

199
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,360
within the next twenty years,

200
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,759
you must not sell this house.

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
Because after twenty years,

202
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,480
this house

203
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,199
will be worth a billion.

204
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,879
No.

205
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,720
Here's twenty million.

206
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,639
Take it.

207
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
This is the money I lost to you.

208
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,399
A bet is a bet.

209
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,120
How about this then?

210
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,439
Brother Fang, I'll be honest with you.

211
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,000
I lost a lot of money in business before.

212
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,959
I came to you because I urgently needed money.

213
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,360
That's why I made this kind of bet with you.

214
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,200
I really can't just take this twenty million from you for nothing.

215
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,159
So you must accept this property deed.

216
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,960
That's right.

217
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,039
So I should thank you too.

218
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,919
Since this house, in twenty years,

219
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,720
will be worth a billion,

220
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,879
I should pay you dividends in installments.

221
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,080
You really believe me?

222
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,240
I believe you.

223
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,919
You, kid,

224
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,919
have a unique vision.

225
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,159
Maybe,

226
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,759
you'll have some special stroke of luck.

227
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,320
How about this, then?

228
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,879
When this house

229
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,720
reaches its true value,

230
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,919
you can pay me the dividends then.

231
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,519
Okay.

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
For now,

233
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
I only need twenty million.

234
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,360
Alright.

235
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
In the future,

236
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,759
if you have any difficulties, come to me anytime.

237
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
Thank you, Brother Fang.

238
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:16,759
Fish.

239
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,519
Fish.

240
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,039
Oh.

241
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,639
All the remaining payments have been settled now.

242
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,279
What do you plan to do next?

243
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,200
As for us,

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,679
we should still have some money left.

245
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,440
It's enough to support us in starting a business.

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,799
But Ye Xuan and Zhang Liang

247
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,279
have been trying to trip us up all along.

248
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,240
I'm afraid the road to starting a business will only get harder.

249
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,559
Tell me,

250
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,600
why has he always been targeting us?

251
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,039
The most important thing

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,759
Li Tian

253
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,200
Go to hell

254
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,759
Only if you die

255
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,600
can I have everything

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
There’s someone I have

257
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,879
some unresolved issues with from a past life

258
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,080
In this life

259
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,320
we’re destined to be entangled endlessly

260
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,159
Grudges from a past life

261
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,360
It’s nothing

262
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,960
I was just venting

263
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,879
My major

264
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,360
is network information technology

265
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,759
But Tianming Group

266
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,799
has strong financial backing

267
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,440
If we keep going down this path

268
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,000
we’ll definitely face more of their interference

269
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,360
It won’t work for now

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,879
So I think

271
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,519
we might as well switch to the investment industry

272
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,759
and develop in all directions

273
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,919
First, let’s earn

274
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,720
a substantial amount of capital

275
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,200
Mm

276
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,399
It’s been found out

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,919
Someone deliberately planted a jammer

278
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,080
The phone line was also pulled out

279
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,960
But the surveillance didn’t catch anyone’s face

280
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Li Tian

281
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,559
You’re messing with me

282
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,559
Next time, you won’t be so lucky

283
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
Just wait and see
