1
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,240
Let me tell you some good news.

2
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,600
Tianming and Chen Yang forcibly terminated their contracts.

3
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,200
They paid a large amount in penalties.

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,759
This battle made Zhang Liang suffer a loss.

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,439
He probably won't let this go easily.

6
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,400
What if he tries to get back at us?

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,519
Don't worry.

8
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,719
Now, we

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,599
are no longer left with nothing.

10
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,319
It's time to have a real showdown with Zhang Liang.

11
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,480
Today is a good day.

12
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,719
Let's give everyone a day off.

13
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,760
Get some rest early.

14
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,439
Let's have dinner together tonight.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,439
To celebrate.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,040
Alright.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,760
But I'll have to go a bit later.

18
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:37,959
Right now,

19
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,640
I need to help my wife at the restaurant.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,560
Take care.

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,159
Okay.

22
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,040
Thanks.

23
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,000
Xinyue.

24
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,560
How about we close the restaurant?

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,879
It's too exhausting.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Why?

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,439
Isn't this pretty good?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm just worried about you every day,

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,519
working so hard.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,479
Then you should help out more.

31
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,159
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:10,639
Mm-hmm.

33
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,159
Go ahead.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll put this in.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Okay.

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,639
Xinyue.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,240
Coming.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,639
Yeah.

39
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,199
The usual.

40
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,759
Alright.

41
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,360
Take care of him.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,039
Excuse me.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Mr. Li

44
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,919
You always put your hard work into useless things.

45
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,599
What are you guys doing?

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
I thought he looked too lonely eating by himself.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,759
Keep him company.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,039
Come on, help us get two bottles of beer.

49
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,319
Beer.

50
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,039
Don't drink too much.

51
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,560
Thanks.

52
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,039
Here, Mr. Guo.

53
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,919
Let me toast you.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,719
Thank you every day

55
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,159
for looking after our Xinyue's business.

56
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,280
Xinyue is a great cook.

57
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,520
I can only get used to her cooking.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,719
That's true.

59
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,360
Every day,

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,639
I get to eat the late-night snacks Xinyue makes for me with love.

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,280
Looks like Xinyue works really hard.

62
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,919
It's not enough to be busy at the shop,

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,000
she still has to take care of someone at home.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,159
Someone who can't take care of himself.

65
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,919
Some people want to be taken care of

66
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,280
but don't even get the chance.

67
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,960
You didn't know how to cherish it before.

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,800
Why pretend to be so devoted now?

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,639
Say that to me again.

70
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,120
I said, why are you pretending to be so devoted?

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,800
You...

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,800
What are you two doing now?

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,479
Cheers.

74
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,960
Everyone, behave yourselves.

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,840
Mm.

76
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,720
This is called realizing one's mistakes and changing.

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,439
It's not too late.

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,839
I hope so.

79
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,399
Come on.

80
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,759
Weren't you going to drink with me?

81
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,560
Let's compete.

82
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,319
Let's compete.

83
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah.

84
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,800
Come on.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,680
We won't stop until we're drunk.

86
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,600
You old rascal.

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Stop drinking.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,240
It's getting dark.

89
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,920
I made hangover soup for you two.

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,879
Hurry up and drink it.

91
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,920
Thank you.

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Childish.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Hey.

94
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,240
Don't forget the celebration dinner tonight.

95
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:41,839
Xinyue.

96
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,240
Yeah.

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,120
Our company is having a celebration dinner tonight.

98
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Do you want to come with us?

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,879
I can't leave right now.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,959
Why don't you go ahead first?

101
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,879
I'll come find you later.

102
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,199
Okay, finish up early and come find me.

103
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,600
Okay.

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,360
Okay.

105
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,920
Get up.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,439
Let's go back.

107
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,439
Alright.

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,920
Um, Xinyue.

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,839
I'll come see you again later.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,759
Why come again?

111
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,759
I already drank you all under the table.

112
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,240
Be careful.

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,639
Who was the first to pass out?

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,519
Great singing.

115
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Come on, come on.

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,639
Li Tian.

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,439
An incredible man.

118
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,199
Go, go, go.

119
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,199
No, no, no.

120
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,879
Thank you for everything you've done for us.

121
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,480
Let's do it together.

122
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's toast to him.

123
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,959
Cheers.

124
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,439
Come on, cheers.

125
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,920
Come on, come on.

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
Cheers.

127
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,240
Li Tian.

128
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,199
Thank you.

129
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,480
Brother Tian.

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,959
Thank you.

131
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,480
Come on.

132
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,279
Thank you all, too.

133
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,959
Cheers, cheers.

134
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,279
Drink up, I'm telling you.

135
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,920
You have to drink well.

136
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,720
Some things,

137
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,879
don't take them to heart, okay?

138
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,480
Brother Tian, why did Brother Tian leave?

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,240
Why isn't my wife here yet?

140
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,319
Hmm.

141
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
Why isn't she answering the phone?

142
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
Could it be that Guo Wenbang is still bothering her?

143
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Li Tian

144
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,079
Why did you come out?

145
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,720
Why are you here?

146
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,240
Qing

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,839
Why do you look

148
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,199
a little sad?

149
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,240
I just feel

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,399
that starting a business together

151
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,240
has really not been easy.

152
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,879
I really didn't expect

153
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,560
even a strong woman like you would have moments of sadness.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
How about this,

155
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,279
if you have any anger

156
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,360
or if you're upset about something,

157
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,480
just hit me.

158
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,680
Hit me a couple of times, it'll help.

159
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,440
Don't move.

160
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
Let me lean on you for a while.

161
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,399
It's okay.

162
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,159
Li Tian

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,279
Do you know,

164
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,799
Mm.

165
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,799
I once loved a man.

166
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,480
He was just like you,

167
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,279
talented,

168
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,440
smart and wise.

169
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I thought I had found

170
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
the most reliable man in the world.

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,480
But I never expected

172
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
he would use me

173
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,240
and cheat me out of all my family property.

174
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,320
Wanqing

175
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,879
The past

176
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,120
is already behind you.

177
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,440
Besides,

178
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,240
you still have me now.

179
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,279
And Xia Yu,

180
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,919
Jun,

181
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,399
we can all protect you.

182
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,000
Li Tian

183
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Yeah

184
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,919
You're better than him

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,799
Yeah

186
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,000
Tian

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,799
Wanqing, you...

188
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,320
Xia Yu

189
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,240
What happened to you guys?

190
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,879
Wanqing

191
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:04,919
Wanqing

192
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,080
Xia Yu

193
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,759
Tian

194
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,559
How did you all end up drinking this much?

195
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,679
Let me help you back

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,879
Okay

197
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,399
A big brother fell from the sky

198
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,840
Look at all of you

199
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,000
Why did you drink so much?

200
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Why did you push me over here?

201
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,480
I don't know either

202
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,559
But

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,399
I really like you

204
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,519
What did you say?

205
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,440
She's a real beauty

206
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,559
Who are you?

207
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,600
You're in my way

208
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Let go of me

209
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,279
Let go of me

210
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,159
Come home with me

211
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,559
My cat can do backflips

212
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,519
Wanqing

213
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,240
This is bad

214
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,279
Beautiful lady

215
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,120
Stay here

216
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,159
Don't go anywhere

217
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,879
Let's have some fun together

218
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,679
Yeah, that's right

219
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,000
Come on, come on

220
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,519
Let go of me

221
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,240
Let go of her
