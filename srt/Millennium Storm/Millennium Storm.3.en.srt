1
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,200
You bitch.

2
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,720
I’ve been too nice to you, haven’t I?

3
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,680
Today I’ll teach you a lesson.

4
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,400
Let go of me!

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,560
Get lost!

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
How dare you touch my wife!

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,480
Do you have a death wish?

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,160
Get away!

9
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,720
Xinyue!

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,280
Everyone, hurry up and leave!

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,800
Xinyue!

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,760
If you don’t leave, I’ll call the police!

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,880
Just you wait.

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,800
Let’s go.

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,480
Are you okay?

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
Are you hurt?

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,640
Come here.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,320
Sit down.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Is everything alright here?

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
It’s fine.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,960
I’m sorry, Xinyue.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
I didn’t protect you well enough.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,280
It’s not your fault.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,080
Shouldn’t you bandage your hand?

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,800
It’s nothing.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,960
I’m a tough guy, I can handle it.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
This little injury is nothing.

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,039
As long as you’re okay.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,039
What have you been busy with lately?

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
You look exhausted.

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Lately, I’ve been...

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,960
Starting a business with Sister Qing from Millennium Internet Café.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,760
Something happened at the internet café.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
These bastards

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,400
could do something so despicable.

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
Even the police don't know who did it.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
What should we do next?

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,040
Buying these computers will cost a lot of money.

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
I don't have that much money in my account.

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,520
Qing, don't worry.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,760
It's just money, right?

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,880
I have it.

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,000
Where did you get so much money?

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,000
Li Tian

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
If you really want to buy them,

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,120
I suggest you

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,600
take a look at the Asian qualifiers.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,520
Place a bet on football.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,800
The 1998 France World Cup Asian qualifiers.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,680
I remember now.

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
I bet on a 3-0 score.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
China wins.

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,880
You can even predict that?

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,760
Tian

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,680
You're amazing.

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Now,

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,680
the internet café business is doing well.

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
I think we can keep going.

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,880
We should take advantage of our momentum.

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
Open another new internet café.

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,440
Then renovate and upgrade it.

62
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,640
And also offer

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
private rooms

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,120
and food services.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Yeah.

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,400
Sounds pretty good.

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,120
Then I think we should now

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,600
hurry up and develop a new game.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,240
We need to bring in new blood.

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,520
Online,

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
we should set up game development and sales.

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,400
Offline,

73
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,280
we should build a complete industry with merchandise, figurines, and internet cafes.

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,560
I agree with your point of view.

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,360
But developing a new game

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
requires upgrades in graphics and design.

78
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,600
It might also need a lot of money.

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
How much do we need?

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,520
Three hundred thousand.

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
We don't have that.

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,600
At most, one hundred thousand.

83
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright.

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
One hundred thousand it is.

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
I'll take care of the computers.

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
As for the development part,

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,920
I can contribute a bit too.

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Consider it as investing in Millennium Internet Cafe.

89
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,720
Deal.

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Boss Li.

91
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
Mm.

92
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,320
Mr. Li,

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,480
my internet café has only just opened recently.

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm only selling it in a hurry because something came up back home.

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,080
Look,

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,440
these computers are still almost brand new.

97
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
They're pretty good.

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,200
The environment is nice too.

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,680
It's just that the location

100
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
is a bit lacking.

101
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
But Mr. Huang, that's not a problem.

102
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,920
Right now, I'm also in the startup phase.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
Funds are a bit tight at the moment.

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Could I pay you a third first?

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
And the remaining two-thirds,

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,280
you could invest as a shareholder.

107
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,040
Well...

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
But this is a bit difficult for me.

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
Mr. Huang,

110
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
I understand your concerns.

111
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,560
I promise you,

112
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,960
if you don't make a profit within two months,

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,240
I'll pay you back with interest.

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
How does that sound?

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,760
Alright.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,600
Here

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,200
is our new internet café.

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,120
Guys,

119
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
what do you think?

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,880
Even though this place is second-hand,

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,240
it's also

122
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,480
a new beginning for us, right?

123
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,760
What's wrong with second-hand?

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,880
We'll make it

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,240
look brand new.

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
Brand new.

127
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,840
Brand new.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,600
Come on,

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
let's replace everything on these shelves.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,840
Here, put it here.

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,480
Slow down.

132
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,520
A little to the left.

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,320
That's good, that's good.

134
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,080
Thanks for your hard work, guys.

135
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,320
Thanks, thanks.

136
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,360
Come on.

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
We're open!

138
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,440
We're open!

139
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
We're open!

140
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
We're open!

141
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Everyone, come inside.

142
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,440
Buy one, get one free.

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
Is there a free trial?

144
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,880
Save me a seat.

145
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,000
Boss, add 100 yuan to my account.

146
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,680
Go inside.

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Is it okay for a few people?

148
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,400
There are still seats.

149
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,080
Over here.

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,320
Not bad, business is good.

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,040
I've bet everything I have on you.

152
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,800
If you dare make me lose,

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,320
I'll...

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,520
Millennium Internet Cafe grand opening special!

155
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,960
Recharge any amount and get the same amount free.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
Lots of great deals.

157
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Welcome!

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,800
Welcome!

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Recharge any amount and get the same amount free?

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Please come inside.

161
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,920
Mr. Zhang.

162
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,600
Li Tian has released a new game called Yuanqi.

163
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,560
It's caused our game's ranking

164
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,760
to drop quite a bit.

165
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Don't worry.

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,160
I want to see

167
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,120
how long this frog can last in warm water.

168
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Li Tian

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
Our shop's business is doing so well right now.

170
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
Should we consider opening a branch?

171
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,800
No need for now.

172
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720
We need to win with quality.

173
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,680
Service,

174
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,480
brand,

175
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,160
and content—

176
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
none of these can be missing.

177
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Stop playing, come out.

178
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,080
Everyone, stop playing.

179
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,680
Stop playing, come out.

180
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
What are you doing?

181
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Shut up.

182
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,800
Millennium Internet Cafe, right?

183
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,720
What kind of "Vitality Game" are you working on?

184
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,240
You’ve taken all our business.

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
Everyone just saw it.

186
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
They’d rather wait in line

187
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
than come to our internet cafe.

188
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
It’s so infuriating.

189
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
We’re all just trying to make a living.

190
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,840
It’s all just to put food on the table.

191
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Millennium Internet Cafe,

192
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,040
don’t go too far.

193
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,840
Let me tell you two,

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,480
if you don't resolve this today,

195
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,920
we'll come and make trouble every day.

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,200
We'll make sure you can't do business either.

197
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,600
If we're going down, we're all going down together.

198
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Yeah.

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,200
That's right.

200
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,640
Exactly.

201
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,600
You shameless bunch.

202
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,280
Our Millennium Internet Cafe does well

203
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,840
because the two of us owners are smart

204
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
and we're willing to invest heavily.

205
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
You don't look for the reasons yourselves

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
and still want to come here and cause trouble.

207
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Believe it or not, I'll hit you.

208
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,000
Watch your mouth.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,760
What should we do?

210
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,520
It's good that they came.

211
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,520
Exactly.

212
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,560
You steal other people's business and think you're in the right?

213
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,280
Why should you?

214
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm really going to do it!

215
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,800
You're unbelievable.

216
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Does that make sense?

217
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
Come on, come on.

218
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,640
I'm talking to you.

219
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,800
Everyone, please listen to me.

220
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,400
We're all in business here.

221
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,920
Harmony brings wealth.

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
I was just talking with Boss Lin

223
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,160
about visiting all of you.

224
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
But what a coincidence,

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,400
we all ended up here together.

226
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,080
What is it?

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
Are you trying to provoke us?

228
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,560
Boss Huang,

229
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
that's not what I mean.

230
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
At our Millennium Internet Cafe,

231
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,280
the latest game, Vitality, just launched.

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm sure you've all heard of it.

233
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
Our Millennium Internet Cafe

234
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,840
isn't that powerful,

235
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,520
but we do have something good.

236
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,280
We want to share it with everyone.

237
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,160
So Boss Lin and I

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,720
have decided together

239
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,520
to distribute the rights to Vitality

240
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
to all of you.

241
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Is there really such a good deal?

242
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
Is this a scam?

243
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
This agency you mentioned,

244
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,520
how does it work?

245
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
It's simple.

246
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,920
We give you the rights to the Vitality game.

247
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,840
Each year,

248
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,640
you just pay me an agency fee.

249
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,360
Then you can launch the game in your own internet cafes.

250
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,080
When can we start?

251
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,440
You can sign up starting today.

252
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,800
I'll sign up.

253
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Me too.

254
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
Everyone can join.

255
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
From now on, we can all make money together.

256
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,040
Everyone's included.

257
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,160
Everyone can earn money.

258
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
Great, yes, yes, yes.

259
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,800
Why give them the rights?

260
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,560
Wouldn't it be better if we did it ourselves?

261
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Games are meant to serve the community.

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,920
With them advertising for us,

263
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,160
in the future, other provinces

264
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,200
and even the whole country

265
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
might see Yuanqi's presence.

266
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,480
Pick one.

267
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,600
Li Tian.

268
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,880
You don't have a crush on me, do you?

269
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm not interested in married men.

270
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,560
Really not interested.

271
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,480
But

272
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,760
if you give it to me as a gift,

273
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
I won't refuse.

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,200
No,

275
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,160
Qing, you misunderstood me.

276
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
I just think women have better taste

277
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
than men.

278
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
The clothes you like

279
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
might also be to Xinyue's taste.

280
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
How about this one?

281
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,440
Yeah, let's go with this one.

282
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
Boss, please wrap this up for me.

283
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,920
I...

284
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,680
I think this outfit is a bit tight.

285
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,600
No,

286
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,840
it's just right.

287
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,000
I really like it.

288
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
Thank you.

289
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,280
Xinyue

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,720
Sorry.

291
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,080
I woke you up.

292
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,320
I saw your blanket had fallen to the floor.

293
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,240
I was worried you'd catch a cold.

294
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
So I covered you up.

295
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
It's okay.

296
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,520
I've been too busy lately.

297
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
I don't even know

298
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,160
when I fell asleep.

299
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,520
Your health comes first.

300
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,280
Yeah.

301
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,240
Don't overwork yourself.

302
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Xinyue

303
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
Are you worried about me?

304
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,400
You should get some sleep.

305
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay.

306
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,920
What's going on?

307
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,160
All the customers outside are having the same problem.

308
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,800
A lot of computers can't log into the game.

309
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,240
The system's been infected with a powerful virus.

310
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
The game ports are destroyed.

311
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,520
The system is down.

312
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
What should we do?

313
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,720
This firewall—

314
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I've already encrypted it with multiple algorithms.

315
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,560
With current network technology,

316
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
it shouldn't be so easily breached.

317
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,320
I don't know why either.

318
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
This is bad.

319
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Our internet café is being investigated.

320
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,560
What?

321
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,640
How is that possible?

322
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,240
They've got a lot of evidence.

323
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
I heard

324
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,240
someone reported us.

325
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,560
Looks like someone set us up.
