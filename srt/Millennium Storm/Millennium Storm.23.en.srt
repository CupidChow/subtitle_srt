1
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,640
Zhang Liang, it's already come to this.

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,679
Why are you still putting on airs?

3
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,159
He's acting stubbornly.

4
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,719
He doesn't listen to us shareholders.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,200
He can just wait to go to jail.

6
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,400
Enough, stop talking.

7
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,400
He just went over there.

8
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,359
Without my permission,

9
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,439
who let you in?

10
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,319
It's already come to this point,

11
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,840
why are you still acting high and mighty?

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,359
Zhang Liang,

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,640
you're being stubborn.

14
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,159
You don't listen to the shareholders.

15
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,439
And you've caused such a big mess.

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,000
You can wait to go to jail yourself.

17
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,760
Zhang Liang,

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,359
we're here today to tell you

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
that all of us are pulling out our investments.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,760
Let's go.

21
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,319
It's done.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
That's great.

23
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,840
Good job.

24
00:01:59,439 --> 00:01:59,799
Amazing.

25
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,079
Thank you, Mr. Li, for your support.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,799
This final version of Heart Moon Dream Journey

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,319
is much better than the previous one.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,959
The scenes are more realistic.

29
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,319
There are more ways to play now.

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
Brother Tian,

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,280
you should feel a sense of crisis.

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,479
Yang Yang is about to surpass you.

33
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,520
If I lose to Yang Yang in terms of technology,

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,479
I accept it.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
By the way,

36
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,360
Tianming Group

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
has already been acquired by me.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,719
From now on, everyone can show their talents.

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,639
Alright, alright, alright.

40
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,240
That's awesome.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Okay.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,840
You want to step on me too?

43
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,840
Zhang Liang, do you know?

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,680
I've been waiting for this day

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
for a very long time.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,400
This is the retribution you deserve.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,680
You're my wife.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
Whatever happens to me,

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,280
do you think you can escape?

50
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,599
A beast who abuses his own wife

51
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,639
is in no position to curse me.

52
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,719
This is the evidence of you taking over the Ye Group

53
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,439
and killing my parents.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,039
Zhang Liang,

55
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,840
I once thought you were a ray of light in my life.

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,599
But I never expected

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,280
that all of this,

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,159
everything,

59
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,199
was all started by you.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,639
You are the one who killed my parents.

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,759
It's their own incompetence.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,439
If they want to kill themselves,

63
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,080
what does that have to do with me?

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
Zhang Liang, you’re shameless.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,280
Fine.

66
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,519
Zhang Liang, do you really think

67
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,040
these are the only pieces of evidence I have?

68
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,600
Let me tell you,

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
all the evidence of your illegal fundraising

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,279
and secretly transferring company assets

71
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,079
has already been handed over to the police.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,600
You—

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,319
You, Zhang Liang,

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,560
will spend the rest of your life

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,399
in prison,

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,720
repenting for your actions.

77
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,439
Wait a minute.

78
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,759
Honey.

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,279
Darling.

80
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,240
Now that this big problem is solved,

81
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,160
tonight,

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,519
shouldn't we relax a little?

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,839
You’re so annoying.

84
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,720
What’s wrong?

85
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,639
We can’t.

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,199
Why not?

87
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,759
I think I...

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,079
might be pregnant.

89
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,000
Pregnant?

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,279
What do you mean, pregnant?

91
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,480
You’re pregnant?

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,199
Yeah.

93
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,639
I’m going to be a dad!

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,079
I’m going to be a dad!

95
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,000
Be gentle.

96
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,600
Xinyue.

97
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,519
Xinyue.

98
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,920
You’re already pregnant,

99
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,319
and you’re still doing so much work.

100
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,519
Hello, honey.

101
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,399
Li Tian.

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,399
Your wife is with me.

103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,959
What do you want?

104
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,800
Come alone if you want to see her.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
If you dare call the police,

106
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,920
I promise

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,319
you'll never see your wife again.

108
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
I promise you,

109
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm coming right now.

110
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,879
Don't come! Call the police!

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
Zhang Liang.

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,399
Where is he?

113
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,279
Zhang Liang.

114
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,639
Xinyue.

115
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,120
Xinyue.

116
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,439
Zhang Liang.

117
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Zhang Liang.

118
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,279
Zhang Liang, come out!

119
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,079
Zhang Liang.

120
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,879
Zhang Liang.

121
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,279
Zhang Liang.

122
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,480
Stop shouting.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Do you know what I hate most about you?

124
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,360
Where is Xinyue?

125
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,399
What did you do to her?

126
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,759
Yes.

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
That's exactly it.

128
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,720
It feels like you're always thinking of others.

129
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
That fake look of caring about others.

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,000
But when that person is no longer useful to you,

131
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,519
you won't even spare them a glance.

132
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,199
Zhang Liang.

133
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,279
If you have a grudge, take it out on me.

134
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,160
Xinyue is innocent.

135
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,720
Let her go, please.

136
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,959
Don't be in such a hurry.

137
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,319
Talk with me for a bit first.

138
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
I have nothing to say to you.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,120
If the conversation goes well,

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,120
maybe I'll consider letting you see her.

141
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,439
I have nothing to say to you.

142
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,360
But I do.

143
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,040
We grew up together

144
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,360
in the orphanage since we were kids.

145
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,839
We were often bullied.

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,480
We relied on each other to survive.

147
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,439
We started a business together.

148
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,800
But why is it

149
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,199
that I can only ever be your shadow?

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
Mr. Li,

151
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,519
we heard that the business tycoon Mr. Meng

152
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,920
is currently negotiating a partnership with you.

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
If it goes through,

154
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,399
it would be a major breakthrough

155
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,199
for your company.

156
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,800
Do you have any comments on this?

157
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,759
First of all,

158
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,959
thank you all for your attention.

159
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,959
Secondly,

160
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
I believe that all of this

161
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,920
would not be possible without our team's support.

162
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,600
We heard that Tianliang Company is planning to merge with Xiya Company.

163
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,840
Is that true?

164
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,840
Is your relationship with the heiress of Xiya Company

165
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,960
also true?

166
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,759
We refuse to answer these questions.

167
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,480
Mr. Li has other matters to attend to today.

168
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,240
He is in a hurry.

169
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,360
Sorry, excuse us.

170
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,240
Sorry, excuse us.

171
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,960
Next time, definitely next time.

172
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,000
Sorry, sorry.

173
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,759
Just Mr. Li's lackey.

174
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
Who do you think you are?

175
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,960
Mr. Li's cooperation with Xiya

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,039
has nothing to do with you.

177
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,360
Mr. Meng,

178
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
I have a game proposal here.

179
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,759
Please take a look.

180
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,480
In the future, don't bring just anyone

181
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,480
over here.
