1
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:03,550
Hey, Minase.

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:05,947
Seriously, stay away from Hirukawa.

3
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:07,412
Hmm? Why?

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Even if you say that the other party

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:10,956
is not a bad person,

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,074
but in the end,

7
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:13,756
people will be deceived and lost.

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,871
If you get involved with a troublemaker,

9
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:17,575
your life may be ruined.

10
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:19,277
It's better to avoid

11
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:20,621
friendships altogether.

12
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,440
The protagonist,

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,758
in order to prevent waves of suffering

14
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,836
from overwhelming his important person,

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,560
watched from the sea.

16
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,860
Tell me! I'll kill you!

17
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,700
You're not going to fight back?

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,060
I don't want to be like him.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,760
I...

20
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:40,827
Do I look that pathetic to you?

21
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,320
Mhm.

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,900
Yeah. You do.

23
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,980
Minase.

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,960
Have you ever kissed someone?

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,300
Just when I think we're close,

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,940
the distance grows again.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Rocked by the waves…

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,580
By the time I notice,

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,600
I was swept offshore

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
again.

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,120
"Our Youth"
(Episode 3)

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,004
What do you think lies

33
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:21,628
beyond the horizon?

34
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,160
Want to swim there together?

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,620
The sea you invited me to go to

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,540
is very beautiful.

37
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,060
But also,

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
so very lonely.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,200
(Bystander)

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,340
Before I knew it,

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,920
you were waiting in the sea.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
(May 1, 2019)

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,060
(May 1, 2019)

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,880
Wait a minute!

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,740
Hey! Wait a minute!

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,980
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

47
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,000
Good morning.

48
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,020
- What I was going to say...
- Huh?

49
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,400
Before that,

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,620
about the theory...

51
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,040
That theory, huh?

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
- You listened to it, right?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,260
Bothered by it?

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,180
- Will it be on the test?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,280
That's complicated.

56
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,500
Ignoring me?

57
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,080
What?

58
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:11,112
Hey, can I come hang out again?

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,140
Why?

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,302
Tests are coming up.

61
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:17,724
You'd just be a distraction.

62
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,680
Then I won't bother your studying.

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,580
What?

64
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,520
Seriously, what's your deal?

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,480
Lend me your handkerchief.

66
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,660
Do you like me?

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,100
Huh?

68
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,900
We're both guys. Of course not.

69
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,760
But kissing's okay?

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,770
A kiss and liking someone

71
00:04:58,787 --> 00:04:59,974
aren't the same thing.

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,255
You're okay kissing someone

73
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,435
you don't even like?

74
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,800
What about you?

75
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,780
Did you hate it that much?

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
I…

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,180
Hey.

78
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,760
Hirukawa, you here?

79
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,208
Oi,

80
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,060
what are you doing?

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,977
I just borrowed his handkerchief.

82
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,793
No need to start anything.

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Thanks.

84
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,600
I forgot my handkerchief too, y'know.

85
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,540
Use your own damn shirt.

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,100
Man, you're cold.

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,480
Minase.

88
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,080
Done with cram school?

89
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Let's watch this today.

90
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,440
Do whatever you want.

91
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,240
This one is really fun.

92
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,600
Yo, earlier than I thought.

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,580
Got this for today.

94
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,780
Seriously, you again?

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,820
Ah, wait up.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Welcome back.

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,280
Today's a double films.

98
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm studying again tonight.

99
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,785
Doesn't matter.

100
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:39,081
I'll just watch by myself.

101
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,560
I want some too.

102
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,780
Here.

103
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,960
- Thanks.
- Mhm.

104
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,833
I smell something but

105
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:14,990
it's not a cigarette.

106
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,740
Maybe because I'm using deodorant spray.

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,460
Huh?

108
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,720
I've been using mouthwash too.

109
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,254
Huh, you actually care

110
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,489
about stuff like that?

111
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,260
When I'm around you, yeah.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,580
You always smell good, you know.

113
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Hey.

114
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,180
Makes me want to try doing the same.

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm going back to study.

116
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,760
Haa...

117
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,980
Hello?

118
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,560
Hey, Jin! How've you been?

119
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,600
Yeah. Just the usual.

120
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,866
School treating you well?

121
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:51,569
Living alone must be tough.

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,020
Dad, I've got someone over right now.

123
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,800
Ah, sorry. Studying with a friend?

124
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Something like that.

125
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,860
What's that supposed to mean?

126
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,260
So, did you need something?

127
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,147
Oh, right.

128
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:14,287
Next month, my new movie is coming out.

129
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,860
Wow, congrats.

130
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
Mhm.

131
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,306
There's going to be

132
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,345
a premiere screening.

133
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,916
I was thinking you could come see it.

134
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,960
Huh? Me?

135
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,954
Yeah. I know you're busy with school,

136
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,250
so no pressure.

137
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,340
No, it's not like you're forcing me.

138
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,862
If you don't want to be alone, you could

139
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:36,565
even bring that friend of yours along

140
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:37,573
if you want.

141
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,380
Hmm?

142
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,460
Jin? You still there?

143
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,960
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm listening.

144
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,777
I'll send the details

145
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:50,988
once everything's set.

146
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,940
Mhm.

147
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,420
Alright. I'll think about it.

148
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,180
Mhm. See you later.

149
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,880
Mhm. See you later.

150
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,380
(Possibility of entering
the selected institution)

151
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,460
(Kebashi University - B-level)

152
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,160
Huh?

153
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,060
Hey, you okay?

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,560
Something up?

155
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
Nothing. I just wasn't feeling well.

156
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:29,447
Well, if I keep living like this,

157
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,460
it would be stranger than not.

158
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,900
I guess. I guess it can't be helped.

159
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,375
Man, if I could just get reincarnated

160
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:39,671
and become overpowered,

161
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,380
I wouldn't have to bother with studying.

162
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,847
Just reading in

163
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,276
a book is useless, isn't it?

164
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,308
Oh, wait a minute.

165
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,582
I really like this word.

166
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,400
Crap, it's my mom.

167
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Time to head home.

168
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,660
Oh, then I'll go back, too.

169
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,740
(Billiard shop)

170
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,240
- Wow, that's a nice dribble.
- That's right.

171
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,820
Huh?

172
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,360
Hey.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,360
Ah, man, lost virginity already.

174
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,000
You've got no class, dude.

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,540
Shut it.

176
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
- Like you guys are any better.
- Don't count everyone.

177
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,420
Not this way.

178
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,660
Right?

179
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm still a virgin.

180
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,787
Don't lie. Of course not!

181
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,208
How come?

182
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,301
Are you different from your appearance?

183
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,000
- Oh.
- Huh?

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,100
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

185
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,420
The air is bad.

186
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,380
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- What the heck are you talking about?

187
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
(Can I bring DVD to your house again?)

188
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,440
(Whatever. I'll study)

189
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,240
(Yay! This time I'll bring a lot
of the stuff you like)

190
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
(Stop studying a while
and let's watch it together)

191
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,880
(I'll bring it again)

192
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
(Minase Jin)

193
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,680
Ah, hello.

194
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,400
Just happened to be on my phone.

195
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,850
Hey, did you leave your

196
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,036
deodorizing spray here?

197
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,680
It's in my bathroom.

198
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,700
Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's mine.

199
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Thought so.

200
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,898
If you're not in a hurry,

201
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:46,076
you can leave it here for now...

202
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,720
- I'll come get it right now.
- Huh?

203
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,700
I'll be there soon. Wait for me.

204
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,360
Now?

205
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,120
Yup. Later!

206
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,320
- You haven't returned.
- Ah, sorry. I'm leaving.

207
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,720
Huh?

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,580
Hey!

209
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,780
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

210
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,680
You didn't have to rush.

211
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,480
What are you doing?

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,669
When I'm at your house,

213
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,099
I have to smell good.

214
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,340
I didn't ask you to come.

215
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,540
Weren't you with someone?

216
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,480
I'd rather be here

217
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,599
than with them.

218
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,909
I saw you walking with your

219
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,620
girlfriend in front of the station.

220
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,420
No, not a girlfriend.

221
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,760
- Just friends.
- Oh, are you watching TV?

222
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,160
No, I just turned it on.

223
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,020
Do you watch dramas like this?

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
Well...

225
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I was just curious.

226
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Don't you watch them at all?

227
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,980
Well, I'm not interested.

228
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,003
I don't care about

229
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,339
other people's love lives.

230
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,500
But...

231
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,980
I think this actor is not bad.

232
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,640
Huh?

233
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,776
Regardless of the story,

234
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,465
this person always makes me

235
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,010
want to watch him.

236
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,720
I guess that's how I feel.

237
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm better looking.

238
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,060
Huh?

239
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,920
I think...

240
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,580
I'm better looking.

241
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,061
What are you talking about?

242
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:11,288
You're a little strange today...

243
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,400
Maybe I should become an actor too.

244
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,480
What the hell is wrong with you?

245
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,800
I got dumped!

246
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,200
I got dumped by a girl again!

247
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,404
I was serious this time!

248
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:15,869
Seriously serious!

249
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,763
The exam is coming up.

250
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:18,956
What are you doing?

251
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,000
What? I'm your friend, you know?

252
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,280
Well...

253
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,240
Maybe focus on studying instead.

254
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,685
Says the guy who's salty

255
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,380
because he can't get a girlfriend.

256
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,817
It's not that I can't go out with girls,

257
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,059
it's just that I don't want to

258
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,192
go out with them.

259
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,260
- That's Minase, isn't it?
- Huh?

260
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,108
Minase has been popular for a long time,

261
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:40,096
but he hasn't gone out with anyone.

262
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,440
That's not true.

263
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,134
So there is actually someone

264
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,399
you are interested in?

265
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,180
No, there isn't.

266
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:50,695
Really? Don't hide it.

267
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,279
Even if there was,

268
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:53,568
it'd just be a distraction.

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,460
Exactly. We're fine as we are.

270
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,760
Ah.

271
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh.

272
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,860
Hey.

273
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,040
Isn't that your school uniform?

274
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,460
You know them?

275
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,660
- Let's go.
- Huh?

276
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,340
Ah, wait, Haruki.

277
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,540
This is the most annoying timing.

278
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,645
The rumor that he's popular

279
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,052
with girls is true, isn't it?

280
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,200
What's with him?

281
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,808
Huh? What?

282
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,180
Huh? It's nothing.

283
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,131
Just saying that even though we're busy

284
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:43,192
with our studies every day,

285
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:44,725
it is easy and it's not a problem.

286
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,616
It's best not to get involved

287
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,905
in that kind of thing.

288
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,400
That's right!

289
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,380
(Hirukawa: What are you doing?)

290
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,200
(Swipe to turn off)

291
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,240
Alright, handing out the exam papers.

292
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,540
Please forward them to the back.

293
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,720
You can pass them now.

294
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,360
Don't start yet.

295
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,800
(Second-year high school exam rankings)

296
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,710
(Third place, Shiba Kento, 497 points)

297
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,140
(Tenth place, Minase Jin, 476 points)

298
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,240
This is not like you at all.

299
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,520
That's how it is.

300
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,460
Third place, huh Shiba?

301
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,780
As expected from you.

302
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,564
Because I'm not getting

303
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:53,610
distracted by girls.

304
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,480
Even Minase himself is distracted.

305
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,180
But hey, it happens sometimes.

306
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,140
Don't talk nonsense.

307
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,800
Probably because it's my turn.

308
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,980
Mine's at 19th.

309
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,360
I'll tell you, it's still good.

310
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,285
Is it good?

311
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
Minase.

312
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,840
- You listening?
- Oh, sorry. What is it?

313
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,460
I think I'll find a private tutor

314
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,686
and he can tutor another person.

315
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:42,696
What do you think?

316
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,540
Sounds good!

317
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,120
- Maybe I'll do that too.
- Hirukawa.

318
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,438
First of all, don't play with girls,

319
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:48,577
come to cram school properly.

320
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:49,648
I'm already going even

321
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:50,805
if you don't tell me.

322
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,100
You might change your mind.

323
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,640
Going down to the rough sea by yourself.

324
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,180
Thanks. I'll think about it.

325
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,660
is bound to cause something.

326
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,160
You...

327
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,600
got beat up again?

328
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,540
You look worse than last time.

329
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:56,875
Mhm.

330
00:20:58,361 --> 00:20:59,680
But this time,

331
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:02,507
I was hit on purpose.

332
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
I thought...

333
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,272
If I get hit,

334
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:12,960
will you feel sorry for me again?

335
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,900
I won't kiss you again.

336
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,600
Please, forgive me.

337
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,040
I wish I could just stay a bystander,

338
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
no matter who,

339
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,040
even me.

340
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,012
Even though that's what I thought...

341
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,087
But for some reason

342
00:22:24,112 --> 00:22:25,792
I can't leave you alone

343
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,467
while you are swept away

344
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:31,163
without any resistance.

345
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,940
Even though I knew you couldn't swim,

346
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,900
But by the time I notice,

347
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,960
I couldn't help but reach out to you.

348
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,540
(Next episode)

349
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,640
- Amazing!
- Whoa!

350
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,880
I...

351
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:55,971
Am I strange?

352
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,680
Hmm? What?

353
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,320
It's nothing.

354
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,420
You'll catch a cold.

355
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,220
Why don't you spread the virus more?

356
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,400
If my border with you melts and

357
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,560
becomes one, that would be great.

358
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,020
At that time, I...

359
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,593
was thinking of something

360
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,297
that felt like a dream.

361
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,300
We're friends?
