1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,000
Am I still in your sea?

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,970
While swimming with a small rubber ring,

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,370
your sea is vast,

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,070
deep

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,850
and scary.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,320
As for my sea,
since the day you disappeared,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,520
it's been quiet.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:31,920
(July 18, 2019)

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,150
People say everyone gets lazy
in the second year.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,850
Think of it as having to

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,450
get into universities

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,820
with your second year's grades.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,070
No more time for club activities.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,900
That's the end of homeroom.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,900
- You can leave.
- Stand up.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,050
Pay respect.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,370
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,220
Oi, you can't get that kind of score again.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,950
This is just a routine school exam.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,800
But with a score that low, you may
have to change your targeted university.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,100
Be prepared for the next exam.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,000
Make good use of your summer break.

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,800
This feels a bit too difficult.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,850
- I know.
- It's difficult.

25
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:20,883
I'm sure about this one.

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,770
Oh, you're cheating.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Want a bite?

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,250
- No.
- Eh? Are you sure?

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,600
- The firework festival's coming. So excited.
- You're right.

30
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,000
- What should I wear?
- Fireworks.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,170
The Ariake Firework Festival.

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,620
- Hey, let's go see fireworks.
- But our test scores are bad.

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,770
What about "law"?

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,570
- I know.
- Yes?

35
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,720
- "Country rule."
- No.

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,020
Jeez.

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,070
- "Legal."
- Correct.

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,720
- So it's "legal."
- Mm.

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,020
Next...

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,420
Because he's handsome, so it's okay.

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,420
- No. Really?
- Really.

42
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,920
Whoa, the firework festival is today.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,870
You still haven't given up yet?

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,520
The summer break will be over in one week.

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,750
And we have to focus on the exam
during the next summer break.

46
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,970
Not much will change.

47
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,970
I don't get to do anything
during the summer.

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,570
The last time I didn't have a girlfriend
was the summer break in elementary school.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,300
Yes, sir.

50
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,370
I've never had a summer break
where I had a girlfriend.

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,520
Been there too.

52
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,850
He's an asshole.

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,070
Bye.

54
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,350
- See ya.
- See ya.

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,370
Minase!

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Went to tutoring today?

57
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Eh?

58
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,720
Mm.

59
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,770
Can I hang out at your house?

60
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,070
You should've contacted me.

61
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,720
I wanted to surprise you.

62
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,370
Actually I've been following you
from your cram school,

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,620
but they wouldn't leave you alone.

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
You've been watching?

65
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,370
Mm.

66
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,100
I was wondering what it'd be like
to see fireworks with you guys in yukata?

67
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,250
I don't think I can go.

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,600
I didn't go to the funeral.

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,020
- And now...
- Sorry!

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,350
Sorry.

71
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,050
I lied.

72
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,150
Eh?

73
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,920
I can't go to your house.

74
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,770
- It's no big deal. It's okay.
- It's a big deal.

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,150
If I go there...

76
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,200
it will end up a big deal.

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,870
I'm transferring to another school.

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
I came to tell you that.

79

"Our Youth"
(Episode 8)

80
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you gonna live with your mother?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,900
Mm.

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,570
She has her own life.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,400
I won't be able to live with her.

84
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,400
I'll live in a dormitory near the school.

85
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,150
Is that so?

86
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,170
I don't wanna stay in the house
I used to live with my father.

87
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,970
Mm.

88
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,450
If I stay there,

89
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,550
I won't be able to stop
being the way I am now.

90
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,870
He was a violent drunk and died that way.

91
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,300
I feel like that future's waiting for me.

92
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
You'll never turn out like that.

93
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,550
But in fact...

94
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,520
I brought you chaos
and caused you a lot of trouble.

95
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,300
I completely disagree.

96
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,570
You're too kind.

97
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm not kind at all.

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,170
I only think about myself.

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Important moments are useless.

100
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,070
I'm just a child.

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,800
Sorry.

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
For what?

103
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm all right now.

104
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,500
So please return to the way you were.

105
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,250
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,900
Get into a good university.

107
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,970
Then work for a good company.

108
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,320
That's Minase Jin's dream, right?

109
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,000
I wanna become a good adult too.

110
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,270
No matter what happens,

111
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,320
I'll overcome it with your own strength.

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,670
I wanna be that kind of adult.

113
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,320
An adult...

114
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,800
To do that,

115
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,470
I'm leaving and giving it a try.

116
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,300
Because of that...

117
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,250
I won't contact you again.

118
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,170
Minase,

119
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,500
Thank you...

120
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,000
for being my friend.

121
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,170
So...

122
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,900
I'm gonna go.

123
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,400
Hirukawa!

124
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,070
I...

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,100
I...

126
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,970
Sorry, what did you say?

127
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,500
Nothing.

128
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,500
Take care of yourself.

129
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,500
You too.

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,320
Ah! It's finally over.

133
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,350
But it's not over for you.

134
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,720
Oi, don't say that.

135
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,320
Studying for the entrance exam
for another year?

136
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,500
- I wouldn't be able to do it.
- You're right.

137
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,370
But it's awesome that
we graduated together.

138
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,870
Isn't that what usually happens?

139
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,420
Oh, come on. Enjoy this moment.

140
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,370
See ya.

141
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,670
- Let's get together when we can.
- Mm, see ya.

What's so good about this film?

144
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,770
Some people can overcome suffering

145
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,500
while others are eaten away by it.

146
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,470
This film emphasizes that.

147
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,350
That's why I like it.

151
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,870
Minase,

152
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,500
We promised to write each other letters
on our birthdays.

153
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,070
I think you'll probably read this letter,

154
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,320
so it'll probably never be sent.

155
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,550
I probably won't even get a reply.

156
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,600
But it's okay.

157
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,550
Because there's only one thing
I want to say in this letter.

158
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm glad I got to be your friend.

159
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,950
If I hadn't met you,

160
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,250
I'd probably have hated myself
for the rest of my life.

161
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,500
Spending time with you

162
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,650
made me want to be a better person

163
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,750
for the first time.

164
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,850
You're very different from me

165
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,950
and seem too special for me.

166
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,370
So it makes me think you're great.

167
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,450
You being you

168
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,420
makes me want to be
the person worthy of you.

169
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,470
Thank you for making me...

170
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,870
feel that way.

171
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,570
I actually don't want
to go to another school.

172
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,850
I want to be with you forever.

173
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,520
But that's...

174
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,250
my own selfishness.

175
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,270
When you're with me,

176
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,400
bad things happen.

177
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,750
You're better off without me.

178
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,700
Sad as this is,

179
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,570
it's how I see it.

180
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,600
I wanted to smile
and greet you for the last time

181
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,150
but did I...

182
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,150
give you a good smile?

183
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,900
I probably already knew...

184
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,700
(...that I liked you.)

185
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,700
But if I said it out loud,

186
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,000
I felt you'd stay away from me

187
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,770
so I was afraid.

188
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,350
(So ​​take care of yourself.
I wish you happiness.)

189
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,270
I think after this,

190
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,370
I may want to see you again.

191
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,550
No matter how long it'll be,

192
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll always want to see you.

193
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,600
So take care of yourself.

194
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,520
I wish you happiness.

195
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,850
Someday when we're adults,

196
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,000
and strong enough
to not succumb to misfortune,

197
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,350
I won't run away again.

198
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,370
On that day I'd like to
protect you for a change.

199
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,870
I like you.

201
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,850
(Class Schedule, 4th Year, Year 2024)

202
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:33,175
- I'll leave this to you.
- Mm, okay.

203
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,500
- I'm off.
- Bye.

204
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,050
- Oops.
- Oh, sorry.

205
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,000
What a surprise.

206
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hm, just thought
I should show my face once in a while.

207
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:43,800
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

208
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,500
- Hm, what?
- Wait a sec.

209
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,550
Eh?

210
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,475
Please do me a favor.
You smell of cigarettes.

211
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,150
When I'm at your house,
I should smell nice.

212
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:19,900
Is it really that stinky?

213
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,075
You're just unlucky.

214
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,075
That girl was in a bad mood.

215
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,550
She just broke up with
a boyfriend who smoked.

216
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:29,550
Eh?

217
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,450
What's that?

218
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,425
Here's your chance.

219
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,525
The character you're writing,
she's the model for it, right?

220
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,950
Shut up.

221
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,300
What about you? You're not writing?

222
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,175
This is my last year.

223
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,275
Mm.

224
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,675
I'm done with that.

225
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,650
Even if I finish it,
I probably won't let anyone read it.

226
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,675
Like unsent letters?

227
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:57,125
Mm.

228
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,550
Forget it.

229
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,957
Well, if you wanna write, give it a try.

230
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:06,325
This time is super serious.

231
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,125
I really wanna date her.

232
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:10,150
You say that every time.

233
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:13,350
This girl's in a film club.

234
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
She said, "If you don't mind,
come to a screening with your friends."

235
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,825
See?

236
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,050
Well, visiting another campus
sounds interesting.

237
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,675
- Mm, you're right.
- Yeah.

238
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:27,800
- Hey, that reminds me.
- What?

239
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:30,450
I've been seeing that guy around my campus.

240
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,450
Uh... That troublemaker
who transferred out in high school.

241
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,400
Uh... Hi...

242
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:40,975
Hi... Hi...

243
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,825
- Hi... Hi... Hi...
- Hirukawa?

244
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,130
That's the guy!

245
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:47,875
Keep your voice down.

246
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:49,975
Hirukawa?

247
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,450
- Wait a minute, Hirukawa...
- Mm.

248
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,600
- got into university?
- Mm.

249
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:58,425
- Are you mistaking someone else for him?
- No, no one else's that handsome.

250
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,650
It's definitely that guy.

251
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:03,550
But I'm a little annoyed
we go to the same university.

252
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,825
Jeez!

253
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,820
In a vast sea,

254
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,600
how likely is it that a lost fish

255
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,600
gets to reunite with its shoal?

256
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,275
Should I join you?

257
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,950
The screening, I mean.

258
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,700
Your sea and my sea...

259
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:43,875
must be connected somewhere.

260
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,500
Even now...

261
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,075
I still believe that.

262
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,850
(Next episode)

263
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,425
The landscape is burned by the setting sun

264
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,367
as if the sea has been melted.

265
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,025
There's nothing there,

266
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,200
so I...
