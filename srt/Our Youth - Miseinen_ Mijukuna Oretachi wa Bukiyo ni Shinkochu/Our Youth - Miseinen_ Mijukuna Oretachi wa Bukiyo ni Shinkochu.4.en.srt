00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
(May 27, 2019)

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,180
Why are you doing this?

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,220
Because I don't want us to not talk

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,760
and for you to increase your distance.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,760
I won't kiss you again.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,900
So please forgive me.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,540
Is that it?

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,600
Mm.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,480
That's it.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,080
Huh.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,100
Go take a shower.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,860
Eh?

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,400
I need to clean and dress your wounds.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,740
This way.

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,980
"Our Youth"
(Episode 4)

16
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,520
You'll probably have to miss school.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
I'll take a few days off.

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,640
Your leave quota

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,580
is probably almost filled.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,440
Almost. I'll be fine.

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,940
But you came back late today.

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,220
My test scores weren't good,
so I studied at the tutoring school.

23
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,680
Shiba...

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,540
Uh, the guy who I go to school with.

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,620
I know him.

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,960
The one who's always with you.
The smart one.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,300
Mm.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,560
He's looking for a private tutor,
so he approached me.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,480
You really care about that stuff.

30
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,940
Not really.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,300
I think he's just worried because
we're going for the same college.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,520
Plus...

33
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,720
you already have a girl
outside of school you're close to.

34
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,020
Eh, who?

35
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,000
The girl from another
school who was with you.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,120
Oh, Yuri.

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,560
We were friends in junior high.
They just ran into each other.

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,480
Hm.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,560
Your hands.

40
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,860
I saw you two hold hands.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,320
Is that so?

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,400
You two are dating.

43
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,100
- I won't tell anyone.
- We're not dating.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,560
She's just a friend.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,600
Take off your shirt.

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,300
You must put this on your back too.

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,740
You vanished so I thought you didn't
want me to know about your girlfriend.

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,360
That girl's a blabber,
so it's a bit tricky.

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,360
And maybe you're...

50
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,640
Yuri's type.

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm nobody's type.

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,260
You are.

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,820
You're super nice.

54
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,680
Never mind that. Turn back around.

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,340
So you've forgiven me?

56
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,440
For what?

57
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,040
I won't fall in love with you.

58
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,900
We're both men, right?

59
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,940
So please don't increase your distance.

60
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,680
Hm, understood.

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,620
Please continue.

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Mm.

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,020
Hey, are you asleep?

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,960
No, not yet.

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,220
I was wondering

66
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,440
if you wanted to attend
the premiere of my dad's movie.

67
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,520
The premiere?

68
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,020
Hm, I think it's a new movie
that will be released soon.

69
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,300
Really?

70
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,600
My dad asked me if I wanted to bring...

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,080
friends to the premiere.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,380
Awesome. When?

73
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,620
When?

74
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:38,995
- Uh...
- Doesn't matter.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,680
- Huh?
- Yes.

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
- I'll go.
- Mm.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
- Awesome!
- Whoa!

78
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,960
Uh.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Am I...

80
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,120
being seduced?

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,180
Just go to sleep.

82
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,080
Hey.

83
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Hm?

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,040
So we're...

85
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,960
friends?

86
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,160
Don't know.

87
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,140
But...

88
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,640
there's no other word for it.

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,540
So probably, yeah.

90
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,080
Minase.

91
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,040
Thank you for inviting me.

92
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,140
Good night.

93
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,400
Good night.

94
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,620
(Overnight Study Camp Meeting)

95
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,420
Groups and rooms are divided
as shown in the document you're given.

96
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,360
- It's not up for debate.
- So glad we're in the same group.

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,800
You're the only one.

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,100
So get to your group and start discussing.

99
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,440
Who should be the group leader?

100
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,640
If we go by our GPAs, it should be Minase.

101
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,940
Absolutely not.

102
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,920
What?

103
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,220
Hm? What's going on?

104
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,000
Nothing.

105
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,220
Mm.

106
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,360
- Then let's choose the leader.
- Are you interested?

107
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Uh, just a moment.

108
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,220
Done.

109
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,160
(What was that today? Don't do that.)

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,340
(Sorry, I was just happy
we were in the same group.)

111
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,280
(Let's start tomorrow.)

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,320
(Let's start tomorrow.)

113
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,580
(Don't mess with me in public.)

114
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,280
(We're in the same group.
Would be strange to avoid that.)

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
(Do whatever you want.)

116
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Jeez, that guy.

117
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,780
Hey, we're together, so who's Shiba with?

119
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,240
- He's with Mr. Wajima.
- Mr. Wajima, right?

120
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,900
Whoa, Mr. Fuji!

121
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,480
- Awesome.
- Wow, it's huge.

122
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,640
Hey, are you okay?

123
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,260
Mm, I got a lot of sleep on the bus
so I feel better now.

124
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,480
And I just walked around the first museum.

125
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,740
Well...

126
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,100
Let's go.

127
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,020
You don't have to go hiking.

128
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,060
Your symptoms are getting worse.

129
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,380
You're right.

130
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,620
Going back alone?

131
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Mm, I'll tell the teacher and go back.

132
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,540
Get lots of sleep.

133
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,340
From now on, focus. Especially you.

134
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,900
Thank you.

135
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,040
That's true.

136
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,100
- Fifteen maybe.
- Isn't that too much?

137
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,940
Well...

138
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,680
- Hey.
- Oh.

139
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,200
- Shiba, sit here.
- Oh, where's Minase?

140
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,720
Oh, he's sick so he's
staying in a separate room.

141
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,240
Is that so?

142
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,160
- Too bad.
- Mm.

143
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,360
Eh? What?

144
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,660
Looks like you have a fever.

145
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,500
Aren't you going to dinner?

146
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,340
You weren't there.

147
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,000
I bought a lot of food. Let's eat.

148
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,060
What should we eat?

149
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,160
You really didn't need to come.

150
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,000
You're okay with it, but I'm not.

151
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,420
It's lonely sleeping
with a cold by yourself.

152
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,460
I'm used to being alone.

153
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,420
Ah, this one.

154
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,140
My mom...

155
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,600
She bought it for me whenever I got sick.

156
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,080
So let's eat that.

157
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,920
Unlike you to have a
cold on a day like this.

158
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I studied with my window open yesterday.

159
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,360
Then I fell asleep.

160
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,060
You should've gone to bed early
the night before a field trip.

161
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,740
Something kept me up.

162
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,080
I see.

163
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,020
Excited about spending nights elsewhere?

164
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,120
Huh?

165
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,680
No.

166
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,060
I was frustrated
because of your strange messages.

167
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,720
Why were you frustrated?

168
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,800
Uh, you're gonna catch a cold.

169
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,680
They say the cold goes away
if you infect other people.

170
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,300
That's not a treatment.

171
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,940
Then infect me.

172
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,680
Huh?

173
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,640
Infect me...

174
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,940
just a little.

175
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,560
It's melted.

176
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,340
You're like a child.

177
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,420
Ah, made you laugh.

178
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,540
Probably delirious from the fever.

179
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,880
You should have a fever all the time then.

180
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm going to sleep.

181
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
What?

182
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,020
Nothing.

183
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,700
I'll be right here.

184
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,320
Relax and go to sleep.

185
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,620
Oh, Shiba, Shiba,
Shiba. This is it, a heart.

186
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,840
Huh? It's nothing like a heart.

187
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,660
- Really?
- Yeah, but I need it.

188
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,540
There you go.

189
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,080
- Is this one good?
- It's just that guy.

190
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,380
- Eh? It's creepy.
- I don't know.

191
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,980
That's cute.

192
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,980
No, I just picked it up by accident.

193
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,900
A souvenir for the girl you like?

194
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,340
I told you there wasn't one.

195
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,400
Mm.

196
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,920
Hey, Shiba.

197
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,440
- Shiba.
- Hm?

198
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,760
How much money do you have?

199
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,920
- I'm off.
- Bye-bye!

200
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,000
Take care.

201
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,180
Were you looking at me?

202
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,140
Just happened to be next to you.

203
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,140
Hey.

204
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,180
Your hand...

205
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,160
It's cool, so it feels good.

206
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,680
Here.

207
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,860
For yesterday.

208
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,620
Eh? For me?

209
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Mm.

210
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,640
I guess it's childish.

211
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Not at all.

212
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Very cute.

213
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,340
I like it.

214
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,660
That's good.

215
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
Thank you.

216
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,500
Mm.

217
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,100
Good night.

218
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,500
Good night.

219
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,460
(The overnight study
camp must tire you out.)

220
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,760
(Call me when you're back.
Something important to discuss.)

221
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,680
(Parent Notification on the Details
of the Overnight Study Camp)

222
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,680
(Takahara Manju)

223
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,340
(The overnight study
camp must tire you out.)

224
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,800
(Call me when you're back.
Something important to discuss.)

225
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,360
(Can you come out now?)

226
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,120
Sorry, it's nothing urgent.

227
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,300
It's okay.

228
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,940
I wanted to come outside anyway.

229
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,440
What happened?

230
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,420
Minase?

231
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,060
I may have to study abroad.

232
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,100
Eh?

233
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,160
Looks like my parents
are getting a divorce.

234
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,480
I knew it would happen someday.

235
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,960
But it happens faster than I expected.

236
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,300
Don't worry.

237
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,200
If...

238
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,060
you're not okay,

239
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,760
you can always tell me.

240
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,040
The more I'm with you, the weaker I become.

241
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,540
But when I'm with you,

242
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,360
I'm stronger.

243
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,900
I really don't want to study abroad.

244
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,060
Mm.

245
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,800
Don't go.

246
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,180
It's like the boundary
between the sky and the sea

247
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,220
that becomes blurry.

248
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,140
I hope the boundary between me and you

249
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,160
will fuse and disappear.

250
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
In that moment, I...

251
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,560
was imagining it like it was a dream.

252
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,260
(Next episode)

253
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,360
It's time.

254
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,820
Don't do it at school.

255
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,960
At school...

256
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,000
- Photo of a sculpture.
- Don't delete it.

257
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,720
So are we...

258
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,220
homosexuals?
