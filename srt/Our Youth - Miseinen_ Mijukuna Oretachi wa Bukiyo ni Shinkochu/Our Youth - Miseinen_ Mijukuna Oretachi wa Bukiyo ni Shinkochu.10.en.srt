1
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,025
Ah, the guy on the phone?

2
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:20,725
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,075
He hasn't woken up.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,625
Would you please?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,125
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:54,850
Minase?

7
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,075
Wake up.

8
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,800
Eh?

9
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm here to pick you up.

10
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,850
Why are you crying?

"Our Youth"
(Episode 10)

12
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,075
Here.

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,675
Why are you here, Hirukawa?

14
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,175
You called me, Minase.

15
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,250
Is that so?

16
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:12,500
You don't remember, do you?

17
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,775
I knew you weren't good at it.

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,550
What?

19
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,400
You used to feed me water.

20
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,050
End of the second year of high school?

21
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,325
You suck.

22
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,325
I remember.

23
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,475
At the time I really thought that

24
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,025
you'd die if I left you like that.

25
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,450
Are you a crying drunk?

26
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,825
You cried earlier.

27
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,550
That was your fault.

28
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,500
Why was it my fault?

29
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,875
The letter.

30
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:56,900
Eh?

31
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You read it?

32
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,550
What? How did you find it?

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
I wrote that I liked you, right?

34
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,200
You should've contacted me.

35
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,275
Well, you said you wouldn't contact me anymore.

36
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:34,875
Uh... I did say that.

37
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,175
But back then...

38
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,650
I just wanted to become
someone who can be by your side.

39
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,900
I don't understand that at all.

40
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,750
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,150
I don't accept your apology.

42
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:58,600
Huh?

43
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,225
Always blaming yourself.
I don't accept your apology.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
So what do I have to do?

45
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:27,850
Let's go home.

46
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,075
To my place.

47
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:37,725
Eh?

48
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,475
Watch out.

49
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,400
It's in walking distance?

50
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,200
Are you listening?

51
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,025
I want ice cream.

52
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:54,225
Seriously?

53
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,275
What have you been doing?

54
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,050
What else?

55
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,475
I'm living a good life.

56
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,875
Got into my number one university.

57
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,450
Went to study in America.

58
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,850
Did an internship and received
an offer from the company.

59
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,325
But what were you...

60
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,050
doing at that bar alone?

61
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,375
I wasn't.

62
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,975
Hey, give me a piggyback ride.

63
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,100
Huh?

64
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:38,850
Please.

65
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,875
I can't walk anymore.

66
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:46,600
Come on.

67
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,050
Three, four, ugh.

68
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,175
Thanks.

69
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,625
Here.

70
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:00,725
Delicious, right?

71
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,725
It is.

72
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,925
What about you? What have you been doing?

73
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,750
I'm living a good life too.

74
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,750
Congrats on graduating.

75
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,825
Mom.

76
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,550
Hm?

77
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,075
I...

78
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,325
want to go to university.

79
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,100
That's good.

80
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:44,800
Do your best.

81
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,900
Mm.

I found out later that you'd moved.

90
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,750
At the time I realized

91
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,300
I probably wouldn't see you again.

92
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,750
I lost my cellphone in America.

93
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,225
And I didn't get a new phone for a while.
It must've been then.

94
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,225
I didn't know that.

95
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,300
Mm.

96
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,950

97

Oh, about the movie

98
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,850
you made about the moon.
I want to watch it.

99
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,550
I haven't watched it yet.

100
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,775

00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:41,300

Mm.

118
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,650
I like you too.

119

120

I like you.

122

You probably don't remember.

123
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,800
Of course I remember.

124
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,950
But it doesn't feel real.

125
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,650
I'll take good care of you.

126
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,175

- Let's eat.

127
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
How is it?

128
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:35,925
Delicious.

129
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:42,225
So delicious.

130
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,175
Let's eat the original again.

131
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,775
You call your family recipe the original?

132
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,125
Mm.

133
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,425
As long as I'm here, no one will suffer.

134
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,275
Hey.

135
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:08,975
Hm?

136
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,500
- Suffering...
- Write me a letter.

137
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,600
Um, like the one that says "Happy birthday"?

138
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,450
That's just an excuse.

139
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:24,375
I just want a letter from you.

140
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:27,975
- Hm.
- Just write me something.

141
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,050
I already replied to your letter.

142
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,975
Eh?

143
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,375
My reply.

144
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,900
I didn't know what to write.

145
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,900
Then it got so long
it almost became a novel.

146
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,000
Let me read it.

147
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,275
- Please.
- No.

148
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,450
Why not?

149
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,150
You went and wrote it for me...

150
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,100
- It's my birthday present.
- Hey.

151
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,400
- No.
- Damn it.

152
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,575
Actually, I'm getting married.

153
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,825
I have no choice but to tell you, Sota.

154
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:31,100
I build a boat to carry

155
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,800
this too long a letter.

156
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,250
But since it's a small boat,

157
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,650
it won't reach your sea.

158
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:44,000
It will be swept away by the waves and sink

159
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,625
and become something that never existed.

160
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,200
But it's okay.

161
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,400
Doesn't matter what happens.

162
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,300
Even if it never reaches you,

163
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,475
I still want to tell you...

164
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,025
that don't force yourself to be alone.

165
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,450

166
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:30,950

let the boat carrying the letter...

170
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,475
go into the sea...

171
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:43,200
out of my hands...

make movies after I graduate,

178

but I want to shoot what I want to make.

179
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,950

180
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,150

190
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,125
I thought she already refused.

191
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:10,025
This time I'm really, really, really serious.

192
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,075
- Should be a success.
- Of course.

193
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,125
She'll definitely say yes.

194
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:22,925
I thought we would be happier.

195
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,025
Mm.

196
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,675
So let's say goodbye for now.

197
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,800
Just until we become adults.

198
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,000
Bye-bye.

199
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,350
Eh?

201
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:51,925
How was it?

202
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,150
It was good.

203
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,750
Is that all you have to say?

204
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:11,825
Let's get married.

205
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,300
Mm.

206
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,875
What about the honeymoon?

207
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:33,800
Where should we go?

208
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,075
Europe would be good.

209
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,350
Why don't we travel around the world?

210
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,725
Let's get on a ship.

211
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:28,175
Is that a good idea?

212
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,875
Won't it take too long?

213
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,050
I want it to be a long journey.

214
