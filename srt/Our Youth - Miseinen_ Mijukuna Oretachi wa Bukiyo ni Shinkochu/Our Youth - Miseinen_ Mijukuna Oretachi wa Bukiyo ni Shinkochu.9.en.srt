1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm transferring to another school.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,320
So I won't contact you again.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,570
Hirukawa!

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,170
I probably already knew...

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,120
(...that I liked you.)

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,620
I've been seeing that guy around my campus.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,370
That troublemaker
who transferred out in high school.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,350
Hi... Hi...

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,020
- Hi...
- Hirukawa?

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,120
That's the guy!

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,570
Should I join you?

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,300
The screening, I mean.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,150
Your sea and my sea

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,500
must be connected somewhere.

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,400
Even now...

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,620
I still believe that.

17
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,450
It's only me

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,670
who's still swimming
in the dream that has not yet faded,

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,020
trying to flap my arms and legs
to keep myself from sinking.

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,550
But you're getting further away.

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,750
The once clear landscape becomes blurry

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,787
and gradually dissolves into the sea.

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,150
As if to warn me.

24
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,700
As if nothing had happened.

(Episode 9)

26
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,150
(Film Research Club)
I was thinking if I should go.

27
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,150
(Film Research Lab)
Interested in him, Shiori?

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,850
- Well...
- Here.

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,850
Well, you finally got yourself a boyfriend.

30
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,370
We're not dating yet.

31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,720
You were crushing on Hirukawa when you joined.

32
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,250
How long are you gonna stay single, Hirukawa?

33
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,520
You're in your third year.
You have to start looking for a job.

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,370
What's it really about, Hirukawa?

35
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,220
- The job hunting?
- No, I'm talking about love.

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
Aren't you interested?

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,100
Eh?

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,720
Or...

39
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,400
Eh? Does this mean...

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,050
- Yeah.
- you're finally dating?

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,500
There's someone that I like.

42
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,820
- There's someone he likes.
- Eh? What did you say?

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,400
- I didn't know that.
- Eh?

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,850
No, there isn't.

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,600
- What the heck?
- What's with you?

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,300
- There must be.
- There must be someone.

47
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,970
About the schedule
we have to make before the screening...

(Minagawa Haruki.

53
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,750
What the heck? It's you. You're still here?

54
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,000
Went a group blind date?

55
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,300
I didn't get anyone today.

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,070
Let me crash for a while.

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,920
Anyway,

58
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,250
looks like Director Amasawa's new film
is coming out at the end of the year.

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,070
- Is that so?
- Yeah, after nothing for five years.

60
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,450
I'm not a big fan of his latest film.

61
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,450
It was a bit too dark.

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,720
I went to the premiere. Five years ago.

63
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,970
Really? How?

64
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,770
His son was in my class.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Huh? What was this serendipitous encounter?

66
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,900
Eh? I'd love to meet the director too.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Can I attend the premiere?
Hey, please contact him for me?

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,650
Just ask and see. Well?

69
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,750
Hey, Hirukawa-kun.

70
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,750
I don't really know

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,620
how to contact him.

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,550
How can that be?

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,300
You said you were friends.

74
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,200
So what's this guy's name?

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,320
Let's check on social media.

76
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,700
He's not one to use social media.

77
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,320
And please drink this.

78
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes, yes.

79
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,770
- Ooh. Sorry.
- Ooh.

(Independent Film Screening

81
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,070
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

82
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,820
The flyers are ready.

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,070
- Director Hirukawa, how many do you want?
- Whoa! / Wow!

84
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,850
One is enough. No one will come.

85
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,100
Eh? You didn't invite anyone?

86
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,900
Eh, why not?

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,600
It's your first ever work.

88
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,920
There must be someone you want to see it.

89
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,900
Yeah.

90
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,220
There is.

91
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,770
But it's not like I want anyone to attend.

92
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,300
What's with you?

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
It's like writing a letter
knowing no one will read it.

94
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,600
You have middle-school syndrome?

95
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,970
Probably.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,320
Anyway, you'll get your debut one day.

97
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,500
I hope that person will see your name, Hirukawa.

98
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,300
- Mm.
- Mm.

("Floating on the Moon"

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,100
Good. All done.

101
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,470
And do people smile at you
just because you walk past each other?

102
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,370
- She must be into me.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,420
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Shiba.
- Mm.

104
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,320
So after the screening, you're meeting up
with the girl you like, Nemoto?

105
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,550
Mm, she said after they finished packing up.

106
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,620
I see.

107
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,420
So what was her job on the movie?

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,970
Directing or acting?

109
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,250
She said she was the art director.

110
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,450
- Mm.
- Mm.

111
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,650
Is it an original script?

112
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,950
Well, it's an independent film.

113
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,420
Your novel may be adapted in the future, Shiba.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,250
I write as a hobby.

115
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,150
Want me to teach you about true love?

116
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,450
You called us here and still talk like this?

117
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,750
You're worried too, aren't you?

118
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,320
Well, you're right about that.

119
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,550
Because it's not like high school
when it was just a phase of adolescence.

120
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,122
Adult love is different.

121
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,950
Huh.

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,950
- Feed me.
- Huh?

123
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,000
It's okay.

124
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,132
I'm gonna go.

125

They'll make the decision today.
Stay and give me some moral support.

126
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,450
- I can't take it.
- Sure thing.

127
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,270

- Cheers.

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,700
- Ah, have some more.
- Ah.

130
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,470
Let me read your novel, Minase.

131
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,570
Eh?

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,150
I don't write stuff like that.

133
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,520
Eh? What is going on? Hm?

134
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,520
Sometimes you write it in the library.

135
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,458
I saw you.

136
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,700

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,020
All right.

to the future great writers.

- Mm.

Ah, yes.

- I'm okay.
- How is this okay?

155

- Don't worry.

Uh, wait a minute.

- Eh?
- Oh, you forgot something?

so I'm trying to help him.

- There.
- Oh.

- Here.
- Thank you.

- Yes.

- Ah, sure.
- Yeah, call him.

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,325
Why did you call me here?

181
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,100
Excuse me.

182
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,250
The film already started.
You can't go in during the screening.

183
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,175
Ah, that's right.

184
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:52,875
Well, a club member lent me this.
I wanted to return it.

185
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,075
Is that so? I'll return it for you.

186
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,050
Thank you very much. Please do.

187
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,100
If you don't mind, please take this with you.

188
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,675
Ah, thank you.

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,725
- Minase, are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

190
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:12,875
Her movie was over,
so I thought I'd go outside for a bit.

191
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,725
- Ah, sorry, I didn't watch it.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

192
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,720
- You had too much to drink. Let's all it a day.
- Yeah.

193
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,375
Really sorry about that.

194
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,160
- You got him drunk.
- Jeez, who knew this would happen?

195
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:33,725
Ugh.

196
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,975
(Alumni Building)

197
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,375
Ugh, it's heavy.

198
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,100
Here we go.

199
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,000
Wow, so cool. Keikyo University.

200
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,875
What?

201
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:26,475
(Keikyo University
Minase Jin)

202
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:27,900
Oh! The guy from yesterday.

203
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,075
You know him?

204
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,775
- He was not feeling well, so I helped him.
- I see.

205
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,100
Hey, did any of you invite
students from Keikyo University?

206
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,075
Let's keep it for now.

207
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,125
- I guess.
- Hey, Hirukawa.

208
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,000
- Hm?
- Can you clear out the auditorium?

209
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,875
You got it.

210
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,550
- Thanks.
- Hey, I'll be right there.

211
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,425
- Mm.
- Mm.

212
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,000
I wanna become a good adult too.

213
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,025
Thank you...

214
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:27,575
for being my friend.

215
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,950
Because of that...

216
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,050
I won't contact you again.

217
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,750
Minase.

218
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,500
Right?

219
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,500
Mm.

220
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:49,625
It's been so long.

221
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,525
Are you doing well?

222
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,625
Eh? I...

223
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,725
Why are you here?

224
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,300
Ah, the guy from yesterday!

225
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,475
- Eh?
- You dropped your pass, right?

226
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:03,150
Ah, yes. I'm sorry about yesterday.

227
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,700
No problem. It's good to see you.

228
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,500
But you know him, Hirukawa?

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,575
Uh, he's my classmate from high school.

230
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,350
You should've said
you knew someone from Keikyo.

231
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,275
I didn't. It's been a long time,
so I didn't know where he went.

232
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,600
I see.

233
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:20,400
But just like I thought.

234
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,821
I had to wait for a year to retake
the entrance exam to get in here.

235
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,150
No, it's not that...

236
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,675
- I'll take you to get your pass.
- Eh?

237
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,125
Ah, yes.

238
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,000
Ah, wait!

239
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,350
Huh?

240
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,800
Let's exchange contact information.

241
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,350
Oh, sure.

242
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,250
I lost your number.

243
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,750
This is me.

244
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,525
So... I'm gonna get to class.

245
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,250
Mm.

246
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,600
Uh, shall we?

247
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,275
Ah, yes.

248
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,125
Sorry.

249
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,925
What about your class?

250
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,125
Didn't go in the end.

251
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:12,425
Want one?

252
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,250
No, I don't.

253
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,275
A smoker who doesn't smoke, huh?

254
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,950
The person I like doesn't smoke,

255
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,950
so I quit.

256
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,225
I see.

257
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,375
Oh, the person who'd come back
for his pass already left.

258
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,125
Mm, thanks.

259
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,325
Looked like he was curious about you.

260
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,225
Asked me if I was your girlfriend.

261
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,650
- Eh?
- Something happened, didn't it?

262
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,775
Or do you guys like the same person?

263
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,875
It's nothing like that.

264
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,450
Hm?

265
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,200
I really don't understand you.

266
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,525
(Coco)

267
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:09,375
Sorry for calling you here out of the blue.

268
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,300
No worries. What's going on?

269
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,800
Looks like you really liked that girl.

270
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,575
I did. And I still like her.

271
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:39,600
But she went back to her ex. It's so unfair.

272
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,675
I know.

273
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,675
- You know?
- Mm?

274
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,600
I really don't understand what love is.

275
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,225
- Mm.
- But going out with her...

276
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,625
It was my first time.

277
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,825
- I even wrote a novel about it.
- Are you...

278
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,625
- Huh.
- You cry this easily?

279
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,475
Don't you get lonely, Minase?

280
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,950
You've always been alone.

281
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,325
Uh...

282
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,400
Excuse me.

283
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,250
Are you dating Hirukawa?

284
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,425
Me? What are you talking about?

285
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:26,475
I see.

286
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,075
But looks like there's someone he likes.

287
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,750
He probably wanted to
invite her to the screening.

288
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,650
Love.

289
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,875
It's so annoying.

290
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,175
Whatever.

291
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,725
Let's...

292
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,100
Let's drink. Come on.

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,750
It's been so long.

294
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,800
Are you doing well?

295
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:09,875
Damn it. What the hell? Damn it.

296
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,075
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

297
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,200
Thank you.

298
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,825
Are you sure you're okay?

299
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,900
- I'm okay.
- Yes.

300
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,800
Hey, are you okay?

301
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,525
Yeah. Thanks for today.

302
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,300
I should probably get over it.

303
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:32,550
Minase, are you okay?

304
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,400
Mm.

305
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,925
Mm. I'm off then.

306
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,645
(Minase Jin)

307
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,857
(Hirukawa)

308
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,040
(To Minase: It's been so long.
Didn't think I'd see you again.

309
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:52,967
I was in shock.
Let's get something to drink...)

310
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:19,550
Hello?

311
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,300
- Sir?
- Hello?

312
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:27,400
If you pass out here, you'll get in trouble, sir.

313
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:30,700
Minase? What's going on?

314
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,675
Sir?

315
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,675
Minase?

316
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,875
Hello?

317
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:42,600
Uh, he already passed out here, sir.

318
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:45,775
Where's your bar, Miss?

319
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,025
(Finale Preview)

320
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:07,475
I'm here.

321
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,550
I've had a pretty good life.

322
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,150
I've had a pretty good life too.

323
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:17,475
So you like me?
