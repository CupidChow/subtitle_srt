1
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,822
We made a promise to write letters

2
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:28,423
to each other on our birthdays,

3
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:29,448
didn't we?

4
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,586
Since I don't think anyone

5
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,930
will ever read this letter,

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,375
I guess it'll end up

7
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:40,953
being an unsent letter.

8
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,360
I probably won't get a reply,

9
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,120
but that's okay.

10
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,750
There's only one thing I want

11
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,446
to say with this letter.

12
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:24,200
(We met in the fall of our
first year of high school)

13
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,460
(25 September 2018)

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,880
Please lift the chair.

15
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,986
Minase-san, are you interested in

16
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,549
joining the student council?

17
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,112
If you start from the first year,

18
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,270
you could become president easier,

19
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,008
and it would be advantageous

20
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:54,956
for college applications.

21
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,700
- I'll think about it.
- I'll leave it to you.

22
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,722
There are three kinds of

23
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,347
people in the world.

24
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,120
- Hey, look at that.
- Wait, what's he doing?

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,580
Should we call the teacher?

26
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,860
- Yeah.
- Yes, let's go.

27
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,240
The perpetrators, the victims…

28
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,360
And the bystanders.

29
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,405
Each person has their own sea

30
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,414
to live in.

31
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,660
And the waters will never mix.

32
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
"Our Youth"
(Episode 1)

33
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,740
(Test results for first-year students)

34
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
(Third place Minase Jin 496 points
Fourth place Chiba Kento 494 points)

35
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,060
(Tenth place Nemoto George 470 points)

36
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Fourth place...

37
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,520
Hmm? What?

38
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,940
I must have forgotten to write my name.

39
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,140
Fourth place?

40
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,360
Next time, I will definitely win.

41
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,040
Sorry.

42
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,380
Even without me.

43
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,800
Isn't it a bit cold?

44
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,060
It's cold.

45
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,940
Oh!

46
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,800
It's snow.

47
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,400
- Super cold.
- Wow, I really like snow.

48
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,840
(9 April, 2019)

49
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
Minase, did you do it?

50
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, and Shiba?

51
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,720
I did it too.

52
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,740
- That's great.
- What about you?

53
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,680
No.

54
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,337
Feels like college exams

55
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,884
are suddenly getting closer.

56
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,240
We're only second years.

57
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,260
- It's already the second year.
- I told you to back off, got it?

58
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,520
So what to do?

59
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,041
The girl we hung out with last time

60
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,659
said she wants to meet again,

61
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:23,768
but only tell Hirukawa.

62
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,200
That's how it is.

63
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,540
What about private university?

64
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,680
I probably won't go.

65
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Huh?

66
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,460
Come on, it's probably fine, right?

67
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
- How is it fine?
- That's right.

68
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,580
Umm, so...

69
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,115
A to the power of two

70
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,326
minus three is zero.

71
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,470
Which means...

72
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,220
A equals plus or minus...

73
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,008
Hirukawa-san.

74
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,420
That noise is a bit loud.

75
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,820
Making art, right?

76
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,120
The question is...

77
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,100
Finding such a complex value...

78
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,720
Where are you going, Hirukawa-san?

79
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,860
Where are you going?

80
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,000
Why is Hirukawa still in our school?

81
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,660
No idea. Trash.

82
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,570
Is it true he strangled

83
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:37,929
a teacher back in first year?

84
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,140
I saw it.

85
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,140
What was it like?

86
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,180
What was it…?

87
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,000
Could he kill someone or not?

88
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
Umm...

89
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
I think he could.

90
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
Seriously? That's terrifying.

91
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:04,552
Back to your places.

92
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,180
Let's continue.

93
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,717
Um... The question is how

94
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:12,538
to find such a complicated value...

95
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,264
Next week's exam, whoever gets

96
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,225
the lowest score will buy lunch.

97
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,380
- I want a cheese hamburger.
- No way.

98
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,085
It won't be me this time.

99
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,468
I can beat Shiba.

100
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,520
I even have a shot against Minase.

101
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Are you going to come to cram school?

102
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,820
Of course, unless I have a date.

103
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,680
He's not coming.

104
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,719
Come on. Just read

105
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:35,016
the textbooks and wait.

106
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
Shiba too.

107
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,140
- Bye.
- See you later.

108
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,880
See you.

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,120
- Make it double.
- It's not decided yet.

110
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,800
What should we do?

111
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,960
Yes?

112
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,204
The dinner this weekend

113
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:50,748
has been canceled.

114
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,920
You're not coming home?

115
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,120
It's not me, it's him.

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,140
He said there's a shoot.

117
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,956
You probably think it's impossible for

118
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,306
adults to follow a schedule, right?

119
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,331
I mean, I'm making the effort to

120
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,464
come back all the way from America.

121
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,315
It's fine. Don't force yourself

122
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:13,372
to come back, Mom.

123
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,860
Don't say something so lonely.

124
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,060
What was that sound?

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,780
What's with that look?

126
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,200
You little punk.

127
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,180
Dammit.

128
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,180
Sake.

129
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,080
More alcohol! Sake!

130
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,180
Don't tell anyone.

131
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,580
(How to deal with domestic violence)

132
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,880
"Deceive."

133
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,840
- To trick.
- Correct.

134
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,218
Even if I ask suddenly,

135
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,476
I still can't fool you.

136
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,060
Well, the actions are clear.

137
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,680
How do you know it's me?

138
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,630
I found it by the trash,

139
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,467
along with some cigarette butts.

140
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,960
Then throw it away.

141
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,260
(Geenlight)

142
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,920
This is...

143
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,220
It suits me, doesn't it?

144
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,212
No. But...

145
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,840
Don't tell anyone.

146
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,060
Minase-san, please don't get involved.

147
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,220
Because you're different from Hirukawa.

148
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,740
Follow me to the teacher's room.

149
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,840
Cigarettes are the worst.

150
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
He must be a heavy smoker.

151
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,380
No.

152
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

153
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,320
Oh.

154
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,320
Yeah, then...

155
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,560
- Mhm.
- "Tiny."

156
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,080
Very small.

157
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,360
Thank you.

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
What was that about earlier?

159
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,460
Minase, are you involved with Hirukawa?

160
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
No. That's not it.

161
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,440
You should just ignore him.

162
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,218
Getting involved with Hirukawa

163
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:41,336
has no upside,

164
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,319
you don't want to be

165
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,196
the center of attention.

166
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,980
Yeah, you're right.

167
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,660
We're serious about exams, right?

168
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,780
We're dedicating our youth to studying.

169
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,260
Ah. Got rejected?

170
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,858
The girl I'm interested in

171
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,314
likes smart guys.

172
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm serious this time, for real.

173
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,320
It's not "like" but "love".

174
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,540
- Mhm.
- I got goosebumps.

175
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,920
Want to stop by the study room?

176
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,340
Ah, no, I have a date with

177
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:04,746
another girl today.

178
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm out too.

179
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,420
I'm having dinner with my family.

180
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,460
What are you eating?

181
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,900
- Sukiyaki.
- That's great. Should I come with you?

182
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,280
- Someone's joining?
- Yes.

183
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
It's cold.

184
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,220
Why is Minase here?

185
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,860
You live around here, huh?

186
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,140
You seem like a rich kid.

187
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,780
What happened to you?

188
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,980
Water.

189
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,780
Feed me.

190
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,940
Huh?

191
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,460
You're terrible at this.

192
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:06,680
Hey.

193
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:10,960
One more time.

194
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:13,200
Drink it yourself.

195
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,780
Ah.

196
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,840
Good now?

197
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,660
Yeah.

198
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,180
What are you doing?

199
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,120
Just go home already.

200
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,800
You're seriously annoying.

201
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,274
Then get ready as soon as possible.

202
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,781
That's all.

203
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,485
I lost the test.

204
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,242
Shiba will have the cheeseburger.

205
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,500
- I'll have the double.
- Okay, And Minase?

206
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,400
- Minase?
- Hmm?

207
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,740
- Are you listening?
- Huh?

208
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,840
What do you want for lunch?

209
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,440
I lost to you guys on the test,

210
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:23,616
so it's my penalty.

211
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,240
I'll have a regular burger, then.

212
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,700
- Good morning.
- Mhhm.

213
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,000
Hirukawa-san.

214
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,791
If you keep skipping at this rate,

215
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,996
you'll have to repeat the year.

216
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,280
At least respond to my messages.

217
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,360
What were you doing over the week?

218
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Vacationing.

219
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,120
What subject next?

220
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,440
P.E.

221
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,380
I'm skipping.

222
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,080
Then I'll skip too.

223
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,360
No use, I'm sleeping.

224
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,680
- Shall we go now?
- What is it?

225
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,000
Wait up!

226
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,420
I'll show you next.

227
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,340
- I'll wait and see.
- It won't change.

228
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Great, right?

229
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,860
Ah, ah, ah.

230
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,480
- Ah.
- What about the shoes?

231
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,460
I forgot to change.

232
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,260
- Oh, no! That's bad.
- You're too forgetful.

233
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,460
Hurry up!

234
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
- How did he forget?
- That's too bad.

235
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,740
Hey.

236
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:38,492
Could you peel this off my back?

237
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
I want to put on a new one.

238
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,420
I need to get back to class.

239
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,300
Ouch. That hurts.

240
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,380
Can't you be a bit gentler?

241
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
Mhmm.

242
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,880
Not going to the hospital?

243
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
Never been there.

244
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
What about your parents?

245
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,780
Don't worry about me.

246
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Here?

247
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,240
Yeah.

248
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,904
In this world, there are

249
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,609
three types of people,

250
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,440
perpetrators,

251
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,120
victims,

252
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
and bystanders.

253
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,120
All done.

254
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,960
Thanks.

255
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,900
This will never happen again.

256
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Huh?

257
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,660
Don't talk to

258
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,840
me at school anymore.

259
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,840
Each lives in their own sea, separate.

260
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,180
And the waters will never mix.

261
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,980
Or so I thought.

262
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,580
(Next episode)

263
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,001
To prevent the waves of suffering from

264
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,216
overwhelming the important people,

265
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,540
we watch from the sea.

266
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,954
Minase, you'd better not get

267
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,156
involved with Hirukawa.

268
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,735
That's why you have to choose

269
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,016
your friends carefully.

270
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,140
Tell me, I'll kill you!

271
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,480
Sorry for being weird.

272
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
(This is a work of fiction)
