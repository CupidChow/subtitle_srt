1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,180
Damn you.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,780
When my dad beat me,

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,300
I had to let him.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,800
You're so weak.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,700
Are you really my son?!

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,420
Well, maybe you're not, right?

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,560
Whenever he beat me,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,940
I decided I wanted to die.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,440
Otherwise...

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,360
As long as I'm here,
there will be no tragedy.

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,720
You too, right?

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,340
Director Amasawa had taught me that.

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,380
For you, Director Amasawa,
what is family?

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,340
(Interview with "The Sound of
Water" Director) Mm, with family.

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,680
(Amasawa Yoshito)
if you're forced to love each other,

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
(Amasawa Yoshito)
it can turn into a tragedy.

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,940
As long as I endured,
there would be no tragedy.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,960
As long as I endured.

19
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,920
Stop it.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,600
- Isn't the skirt too short?
- Don't lift it.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
- Let me see.
- Please don't. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,380
- Come on.
- No.

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,580
Is this sexual assault?

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,180
Hey, I'm just giving advice.
Wait. Fix your skirt!

25
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,900
Stay right there.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Your parents didn't say anything?

27
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,520
Shall I tell them

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,180
their son behaves horribly
and they should teach him?

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,560
Right. Your mother must have already left.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,440
Don't misbehave and make your father worry.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
But I...

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,120
They got divorced.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
You can confide in me.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
I am really my father's son.

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,840
I couldn't control it and it overflowed.

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,660
I also felt disgusted that I was dirty.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,060
And that was when...

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,880
I met Minase.

39
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,660
What's with the look in your eyes?

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,740
You brat.

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,320
Damn you.

42
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,300
Give me back my booze. Booze.

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,080
Don't tell anyone.

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,140
Minase?

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Where are you going?

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,120
Bookstore.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,340
Let me tag along.

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,420
Go to the bookstore later.
Come to my place.

49
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,460
When I was with Minase,

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,460
I forgot everything else.

51
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,820
The main character.

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,040
To prevent the waves of misery
from overcoming someone important,

53
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,540
he watched that person from the sea.

54
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,940
- Haruki!
- Hm?

55
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,520
Why is he home early?

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,100
Open it!

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,240
Hey.

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,900
- Where is it?
- If I stopped enduring,

59
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,460
Where is Haruka? Huh?!

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,580
There would be tragedy.

61
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,540
I'll kill you all.

62
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,740
Both you and that bitch who left me.
I'll kill you all!

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Then kill me first.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Haruki.

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,320
What happened?

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Today's a weekday. What about school?

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,480
Got in a fight?

68
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,240
I didn't.

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,540
Don't lie. A mother knows.

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,380
Don't make your dad worry.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,960
I know that.

72
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,360
It's cool out here.

73
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,300
Hm?

74
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,920
Hey,

75
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,340
Hinata, what's wrong?

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,120
Are you hungry? Hm?

77
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Are you hungry?

78
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,240
Come here.

79
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,160
Hm?

80
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,500
I wanted to go somewhere...

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,100
that would accept me.

82
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Anywhere.

83
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,900
That was why I...

84
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,920
So wanna come to my place?

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,960
My parents aren't there.

86
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,280
Do I...

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,380
look pitiful?

88
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,960
Mm.

89
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,480
Of course you do.

90
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,860
So do it.

91
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,140
You won't dare anyway.

92
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,040
I knew that I shouldn't,

93
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,480
but still...

94
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,520
You said it yourself.

95
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,300
He must have hated me.

96
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,260
You're okay kissing someone
you don't even like?

97
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
What about you?

98
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,740
Did you hate it that much?

99
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,640
I...

100
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,940
Shouldn't you have already accepted me?

101
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,820
This actor always has my attention.

102
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,580
I guess that's it.

103
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,920
I'm better looking.

104
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,780
Huh?

105
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,060
What are you on about?
You're being weird today.

106
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,160
Anxiety and expectations mixed together.

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,600
What's wrong with you?

108
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,580
What the hell?

109
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,940
Hey, come here.

110
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,300
What were you doing? Come here!

111
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,940
Without me, you won't make it!

112
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,840
Who would support you?

113
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
Huh?!

114
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,220
Your mom really left you!

115
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,720
Ugh!

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,800
If I got beaten up again,

117
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360
I wondered if you'd pity me again?

118
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,700
I even thought about
the disgusting thing I'd done.

119
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,040
I finally understood..

120
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,420
I...

121
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,740
I won't fall in love with you.

122
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,260
We're both men, right?

123
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
That...

124
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,440
So please don't widen your distance.

125
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,000
This was me liking someone.

126
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,680
You two are really close.

127
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,440
You don't have to go hiking.

128
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,220
Your symptoms are getting worse.

129
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,620
Going back alone?

130
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,840
Mm, I'll tell the teacher and go back.

131
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,740
In fact,

132
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,860
I wanted to be closer to him.

133
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,820
I wanted to be there.

134
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,740
I just wanted to make you laugh.

135
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,320
You're like a child.

136
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Ah, made you laugh.

137
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,960
I may have to study abroad.

138
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,060
Eh?

139
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,120
Looks like my parents
are getting a divorce.

140
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,180
I couldn't become who I had been

141
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,240
before I had you

142
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,780
in my life.

143
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,940
"Our Youth"
(Episode 5)

144
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,720
I was wondering
if I could talk to Director Amasawa.

145
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,420
After the movie, I mean.

146
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,600
Probably not. He'll be busy.

147
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,440
I really want to meet him.

148
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,220
Want me to call him?

149
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
No, wait.

150
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,480
You don't have to.

151
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,160
Hm, like...

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,980
Do I stink?

153
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,260
No, you smell good.

154
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Hello.

155
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,520
(reception)

156
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
Thank you.

157
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,688
Gonna use the bathroom
before it's crowded.

158
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:54,300
Mm.

159
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,180
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- Hello

160
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,400
- thank you.
- Thank you

161
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,780
- hello.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

162
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,740
What's wrong?

163
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,280
Wanna stay here at the end of the month?

164
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,700
Eh? Why do you suddenly...

165
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,800
He'll be out of town for work.

166
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,380
There'll only be me and Hinata here.

167
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,960
Let me think about it.

168
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,140
I tried calling my dad
but he didn't answer.

169
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,540
Is that so?

170
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,400
Thank you.

171
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,640
Sorry for the trouble.

172
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,220
Nah.

173
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,180
This was the first time I called him first.

174
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,580
Feel like I accomplished something.

175
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,880
Such a strange family.

176
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,860
Yours too.

177
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,200
So please leave your messages.

178
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,340
Director Amasawa, would you please?

179
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,420
I haven't seen him in a while.

180
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,940
Yes, uh, "The Song Before Dawn"

181
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,400
is a movie about the lives
of two people who are homosexuals.

182
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,420
It can be interpreted in many ways.

183
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,580
And we made this movie
aware of those interpretations.

184
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:52,180
It's like the nighttime
is always around us.

185
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,300
That's how I feel.

186
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,280
That's good.

187
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll sing until morning.

188
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,860
Doing that would be cheating.

189
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,140
I'd have no choice but to fall for you.

190
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,880
You're the one who's cheating.

191
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,700
So what do I sing for?

192
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,980
Just wait until then.

193
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,640
It was amazing.

194
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,560
- Yes?
- Oh,

195
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,540
I just saw that you'd called me.

196
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,560
I've watched the movie.

197
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,660
Oh, thank you.

198
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,940
The friend who came with me...

199
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,560
wants to tell you how impressed he is.

200
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,540
Do you mind?

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
- Director, the MC is here.
- Would you please?

202
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,600
I have to go.

203
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
Is that so?

204
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,260
- See you then.
- Mm.

205
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
But thank your friend for me.

206
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,300
Let's meet for a meal next time.
I have to talk to you about your mom.

207
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,280
Looks like he's busy.

208
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,440
He asked me to thank you.

209
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,620
Sorry.

210
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,300
I'll remember it forever.

211
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,380
Director Amasawa thanking me.

212
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,040
What was that?

213
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,300
Just thinking I really like his movies.

214
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,140
Mm.

215
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,880
Don't get this one either?

216
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,340
Mm.

217
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,960
I mean...

218
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,260
So...

219
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,100
are we homosexuals?

220
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,340
Huh?

221
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,480
I just feel that those two people
we saw in the movie

222
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,520
aren't that different from us.

223
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,360
Ah.

224
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,940
Did you just say you liked me?

225
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,940
That's not what I meant.

226
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,880
Forget it.

227
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,180
What are you doing?

228
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,780
Saved forever.

229
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,540
You're so serious about that.

230
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,760
Don't delete it.

231
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,960
Set it as your wallpaper.

232
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,960
No way.

233
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,180
Why not?

234
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Give me that.

235
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,060
Huh, now?

236
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,740
Stop, stop, stop.

237
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,700
(Hirukawa: Good night.)

238
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,300
(Minase Jin: Good night.)

239
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,580
- Like I said.
- Mm.

240
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,920
Yakisoba bread isn't very popular.

241
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,080
It's very popular.

242
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,360
- Well...
- The flavors don't go together.

243
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,100
What? You usually eat it.

244
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,680
(Hirukawa: Come to the pool.)
I just tried it.

245
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,140
Minase?

246
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,660
Mm.

247
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,280
Plus bread and noodles go well together.

248
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,460
- I'll be right back.
- Eh?

249
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,140
Aren't you gonna submit it?

250
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,320
What's up?

251
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,460
Minase,

252
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,360
do you like the sea?

253
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,840
Huh? Mm. I don't hate it.

254
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,400
My mother lives near the sea.

255
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,660
She asked if I wanted to stay over.

256
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,000
Because her husband's out of town for work.

257
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,440
Wanna tag along?

258
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,680
Is bringing me a good idea?

259
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Mm.

260
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,740
Going there alone...

261
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
is a little scary.

262
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,280
Let's leave separately.

263
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,860
Don't do it at school.

264
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,160
At school...

265
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
Look at that.

266
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,680
Motion sickness?

267
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,300
No, just nervous.

268
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,720
Don't say that.

269
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,560
Me too.

270
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,520
(Next episode)

271
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,420
Let's go back.

272
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,240
Hm.

273
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,440
Let's go back to my place.

274
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,680
I...

275
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,660
It's not appropriate.

276
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,040
(Next episode)
