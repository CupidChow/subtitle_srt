1
00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:01,950
Minase.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,300
Right?

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,850
So you like me?

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:11,425
I like you too.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,875
Both in high school

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,850
and now.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,275
I like you.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,750
Can I adapt your novel

9
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,075
into a movie?

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,050
How was it?

11
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:36,575
It was good.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,025
Is that all you have to say?

13
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:51,475
Let's get married.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,125
Mm.

15
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:00,875
When?

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,950
When the law changes.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,850
Let's get married.

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,500
But...

19
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:28,600
what if it doesn't change?

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,975
Eh?

21
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,400
I do want to get married.

23
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:43,850
But I can't do that to you.

24
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,275
So we should...

25
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,750
end this.

26
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:51,925
Wait, Haruki!

27
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,200
Don't go!

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,650
Don't go!

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,175
"Our Youth"
(Episode 11)

30
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:11,050
So Minase, please give your report
on what you've been working on.

31
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,425
Yes.

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,650
This time we've collected information about
how other companies are benefiting from

33
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,825
advanced AIs.

34
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:22,350
For example, IM is using LMM to support

35
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,675
their customer service center staff.

36
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,100
- Minase, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,100
Ah, Mr. Inoue, Mr. Sakae, please come.

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,925
Eh?

39
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,850
Eh!

40
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,400
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

41
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,000
- Wow, congratulations!
- Thank you very much.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,975
- How long have you been together?
- Since high school.

43
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,750
- Whoa.
- Since high school?

44
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,350
Ah, Mr. Minase, please come.

45
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,325
She's getting married.

46
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,700
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,300
Please come, guys.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,050
- Definitely.
- Please.

49
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,925
- Looking forward to it.
- Excuse me.

50
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:57,825
Do your best.

51
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,900
- Lots of people are getting married lately.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,800
Minase, what about you?

53
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,150
Eh?

54
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:06,500
Getting married, I mean.

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,025
Uh, I haven't thought about it.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,875
You don't have a girlfriend?

57
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,525
No, I don't.

58
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,875
Eh? You're not just keeping it a secret?

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,900
Someone like him must be dating.

60
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,625
(Tomorrow. You haven't forgotten, right?
Our wedding party.)

61
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,375
(Shiori will marry me!)

62
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,800
(Congrats!
You're perfect for each other.)

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,450
(Don't break Shiori's heart.
Congrats, dude.)

64
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,025
(A date after work)

65
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:38,925
(The sea, our filming location!)

66
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,150
(Filming in progress!)

67
00:05:56,725 --> 00:06:00,150
(Haruki)

68
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,100
Hello? What's wrong?

69
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,675
Just thought you might be lonely.

70
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,850
Aren't you filming?

71
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,925
We're taking a break.

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,450
What are you doing?

73
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,100
Eating and looking at your IG.

74
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,775
Hm?

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,850
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,575
About what?

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,200
Not being there because I'm filming.

78
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,725
Plus I haven't contacted you much.

79
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,925
You must be lonely.

80
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:43,550
No. Not at all.

81
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,525
Are you sure?

82
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:49,725
Yes. I'm fine.

83
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,250
Yeah? Then that's good.

84
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,975
By the way, Nemoto contacted me.

85
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,975
About the wedding party.

86
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,750
Mm, I found out from Shiori.

87
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,125
Mm.

88
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,225
You think you can make it?

89
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,450
Mm, I should be going home that day.

90
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,100
Is that so?

91
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,550
I really wanna see you, Jin.

92
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,250
I wanna see you too.

93
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,575
Director, do you mind?

94
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,525
Ah, yes.

95
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,525
Sorry, they need me. I'll call you later.

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,175
Mm.

97
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,950
(Mom: Let's have lunch
with my friend and her daughter.)

98
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,350
(I think you'll get along with her.)

99
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,950
(It's time to get serious about marriage.)

100
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,175
(Hoping for a good answer.)

101
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:33,100
(You failed at marriage
and here you are...)

102
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,425
(You failed at marriage
and here you are...)

103
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,275
Jin!

104
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,575
Why are you here?

105
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,350
The schedule changed, so I came back early.

106
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,225
You worked late...

107
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,050
Sorry.

108
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,700
No, I'm fine with it.

109
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,775
But is it okay for you to do it here?

110
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,525
It's not.

111
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:06,350
What happened?

112
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,850
Hm? What?

113
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,925
Well...

114
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:14,925
You look a little tired.

115
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,675
I had a dream.

116
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,125
A dream?

117
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,725
That you got married...

118
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,225
with someone else.

119
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,200
Weird dream.

120
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:37,775
I was thinking what if it really happened.

121
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,500
No. There's no way.

122
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,200
Probably because there's been
a lot of marriage talks lately.

123
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,725
And my mom doesn't look at herself
and dares pressure me about it.

124
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,775
Am I making you worry?

125
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,075
No, it's nothing like that.

126
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,100
But you must've been asked about it too.

127
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,100
I just tell people I'll do it when I can.

128
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,125
Eh?

129
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,675
They ask, "What does that mean?"
So I say, "What does what mean?"

130
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,250
And that's the end of it.

131
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,325
You're too harsh.

132
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,150
Never mind that.

133
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,525
As long as we understand each other.

134
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,650
Hm? What is it?

135
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,925
You're eager.

136
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,625
Well, we haven't done this in a while.

137
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,675
You smell good.

138
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,020
I've been missing this scent.

139
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,925
You're kind of a creep.

140
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,275
Don't you like it?

141
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,150
I don't dislike it.

142
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,150
Jin?

143
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,575
Hm?

144
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,900
Should we try telling them tomorrow?

145
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,275
That we're dating.

146
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,750
Eh?

147
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,350
Good night.

148
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Haruki.

149
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,975
Oh, good morning.

150
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,450
You're awake?

151
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:30,350
What's wrong?

152
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:32,625
Don't disappear without telling me.

153
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,550
Well, there's nothing to eat here.

154
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,125
What are you gonna make?

155
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,300
Why pancakes?
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

156
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,975
They served them at the place
I stayed during filming.

157
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,950
And they were very delicious.

158
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,275
Wow. Fancier than I thought.

159
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:07,900
Just a coincidence.

160
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,300
They don't serve them everywhere.

161
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:13,500
Because I had to wake up
very early during filming.

162
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,500
Ah.

163
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:17,875
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

164
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,025
How is it?

165
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:25,175
Mm. Delicious.

166
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,050
- Right?
- Mm.

167
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Hey, if you add honey,
they'll be even more delicious.

168
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,500
- Honey?
- Yes.

169
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,875
- Ah?
- Uh.

170
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,825
- Honey on eggs?
- Yes. Seems impossible, right?

171
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,525
Eh?

172
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,500
You think I'm lying? Try it first.

173
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,150
Mm. Delicious.

174
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,625
Delicious, right?

175
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:56,750
Mm.

176
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,300
Haruki, are you ready?

177
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Ready.

178
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,550
- Let's go.
- Mm.

179
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:11,075
Hey.

180
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:12,550
Hm?

181
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,075
You forgot something.

182
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,550
We're gonna be late.

183
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,000
(Coco)

184
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,250
Eh? All right.

185
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,425
To our marriage.

186
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,425
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

187
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,100
- Okay. Cheers.
- Congratulations.

188
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,925
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

189
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,725
- This glass is so cute.
- Goodness.

190
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,800
Should we buy them for our place?

191
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:55,875
What?

192
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,125
Nothing.

193
00:16:57,575 --> 00:17:00,700
Just surprised you two made it
to actual marriage.

194
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,875
I said it on the day of the screening,

195
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,975
that this time I was
really, really, really serious.

196
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,450
- Eh?
- You said that all the time.

197
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,575
But at the time I had no idea

198
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,350
you were in the film club, Hirukawa.

199
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,350
Mm.

200
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,100
I didn't even know you loved movies.

201
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,700
Why keep it a secret?

202
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,475
Mm.

203
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,100
Just didn't have a chance to tell you.

204
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,750
Besides, back in high school
I never mentioned it once.

205
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,625
- Eh? Really?
- Eh?

206
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,525
That's true.

207
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,170
Because he was a real troublemaker.

208
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:33,850
Hirukawa in high school.

209
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,275
- Eh? I can't picture it at all.
- Right?

210
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:37,750
That's nice.

211
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,350
Wish I could've been a hot-headed teenager
and rebelled like that.

212
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,850
What the heck?

213
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,675
But I wanted to be close to you guys.

214
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,300
Really? Why?

215
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,650
Back then...

216
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,475
I had a one-sided crush on Minase.

217
00:17:58,475 --> 00:17:59,275
Eh?

218
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,475
Huh?

219
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,700
I... don't quite understand.

220
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,275
What do you mean?

221
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,900
It's not funny to joke like that.

222
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:19,500
Well, I was fascinated
by outstanding students like Minase.

223
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,850
I wanted to be smart like that.

224
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,200
But Minase probably didn't care about me.

225
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,175
What? So that what you mean.

226
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,525
Don't say strange things.

227
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,575
Oh, anyway.
Where will you go for your honeymoon?

228
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,500
- Oh, we already decided.
- Right.

229
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,675
Three, four.

230
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,800
- Hawaii!
- Hawaii!

231
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,900
- Can't wait!
- Oh, nice!

232
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,550
Awesome.

233
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,750
Thank you very much. Thank you, really.

234
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,550
I love you guys so much.

235
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,650
I'm gonna go.

236
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,850
- Let's get together again.
- Go on.

237
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,350
- Again in my free time.
- You can go over there.

238
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,150
- See you! Bye!
- Bye-bye!

239
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,800
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

240
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,700
- Come on, let's go.
- Me too. Me too.

241
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
- Ah, jeez.
- I love you, Shiori.

242
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,300
Are you angry?

243
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:00,925
No.

244
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm sorry for making it weird.

245
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:07,275
It's fine.

246
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:11,950
They would never believe
that we'd date each other.

247
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,025
So why are you in a bad mood?

248
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,525
I'm just envious of those two.

249
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,850
- About getting married?
- Mm.

250
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,450
Having people around them
congratulating them.

251
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:44,375
Plus they'll be spouses in the eye
of the law. It makes me envy them.

252
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,025
So should we confess everything
and get married right now?

253
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,775
No.

254
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,400
When I think about reality,
it'll be too much of a headache.

255
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,750
Personally I don't mind.

256
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:04,925
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,200
I can't.

258
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,075
So let's go for a drive.

259
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,950
Hm? Right now?

260
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,325
Mm, is there a place you want to go?

261
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:21,550
The sea.

262
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,075
Copy that.

263
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,350
But do they still sell sparklers?

264
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,950
Sparklers?

265
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,450
Are you going in?

266
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,050
No.

267
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,350
Here.

268
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,025
Wow.

269
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,050
Not playing anymore?

270
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,650
After we finished filming each day,

271
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,750
I went for a walk alone sometimes.

272
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,575
One day I sat on the beach,

273
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,500
looking at the sea at night

274
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:29,400
at the same time.

275
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,925
No stars, no moon.

276
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,725
The sky and sea were pitch black.

277
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,325
I could barely see the horizon.

278
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,525
It was quiet.

279
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,175
But that night was a bit scary.

280
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,100
After sitting there for hours,

281
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,475
the sky gradually became brighter.

282
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,700
The sea began to sparkle.

283
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,525
And when I saw that,

284
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,175
I thought of you.

285
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,925
What does that even mean?

286
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,800
Like it gave me the same feeling.

287
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,375
Like that image moved me.

288
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,800
And then I felt warm.

289
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,575
When I felt that, I realized...

290
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:44,650
that I...

291
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,400
must've had fallen in love with you.

292
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:59,750
Even if we can't get married,

293
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,025
I will always be by your side.

294
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,650
So please don't worry.

295
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,150
Thank you.

296
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:06,675
It's cold.

297
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,525
Of course it is.

298
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,850
Jin.

299
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,225
Don't do it.

300
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,525
What are you doing?

301
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,350
(This is a work of fiction)
