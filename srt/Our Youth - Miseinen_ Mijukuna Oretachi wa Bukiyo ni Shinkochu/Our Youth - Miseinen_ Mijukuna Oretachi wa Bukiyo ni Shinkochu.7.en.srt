1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,275
- Hey, let's go see.
- What is it?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,125
- Good morning.
- What is it?

3
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:06,075
- An announcement?
- Suspension from school?

4
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,070
Yuck. I know he did it.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,800
- That's right.
- I can just tell he did it.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,218
(Notification of disciplinary action)
Speaking of which,

7
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:13,357
(Notification of disciplinary action)
I want to see their parents.

8
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:14,625
(Notification of disciplinary action)
Yeah.

9
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:17,017
- How is that relevant?
- Take a picture.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,275
It's time to go back to the classroom.

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,200
- The class is about to start.
- Okay.

12
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:26,825
- Hirukawa is in trouble.
- That's one week, it's bad.

13
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:27,775
- Right. It's terrible.
- Right?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,175
Teacher!

15
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,600
Why is Hirukawa suspended?

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,250
He didn't do anything.

17
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,250
- At the time...
- Minase-san.

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,025
- This doesn't concern you.
- But...

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,975
Minase-san.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,875
The matter is already settled.

21
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,175
But...

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,675
Hirukawa didn't do anything.

23
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,875
Why are you defending him?

24
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:02,225
It's not about defending him. I just…

25
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:05,600
- I'm telling the truth.
- Focus on what's important.

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,228
Do you want to worry

27
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:09,478
your parents overseas?

28
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,925
It has nothing to do with my parents.

29
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,800
This conversation is over.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,175
Everyone has high hopes for you.

31
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,275
Go back to class if you understand.

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,175
(25 June 2019)

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,117
Wanna go to the bookstore

34
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,051
before cram school?

35
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:35,070
Sure, let's go.

36
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,400
Minase, you're coming too, right?

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,075
- Minase?
- Hmm?

38
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,750
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

39
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,850
- Want to go to the bookstore?
- Oh, bookstore?

40
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,225
- Sure.
- Mm.

41
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:45,850
Mm.

42
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,275
Ah.

43
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,575
I heard Majima's transferring schools.

44
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:52,362
- Guess his parents are worried.
- Even though Hirukawa

45
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:53,596
was the ringleader.

46
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,750
Are you sure about that?

47
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,075
Well, no one actually saw it happen.

48
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,325
Late at night, I saw Hirukawa...

49
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,118
Late at night, I saw Hirukawa

50
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:06,868
carrying a ton of alcohol.

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,250
That doesn't mean it was for him.

52
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,850
- Why are you defending him?
- I'm not defending him.

53
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,496
Because we go to the same school,

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,401
you probably sympathize with him.

55
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,725
It's not like that.

56
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,575
It's not something we can do.

57
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,475
- The adults decided.
- Exactly.

58
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,640
If you don't interfere,

59
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:25,707
you won't be in trouble.

60
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,908
I'm going to get my bike.

61
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,625
- Then I'll head out first.
- Mm.

62
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,075
Sorry, I'll be back in a moment.

63
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,025
I forgot something.

64
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,125
Mm.

65
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,950
"Our Youth"
(Episode 7)

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,700
Oh, here's your souvenir. Herbal tea.

67
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,664
Hey.

68
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:48,976
Have you thought about studying abroad?

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,226
I'm trying to go ahead

70
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:52,828
with the procedures I can.

71
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:56,003
It's not like you have a specific

72
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:58,190
reason not to transfer schools, right?

73
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:00,625
That's true.

74
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,426
It's not like you have

75
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,598
a best friend you can't leave behind.

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,375
Or you have a girlfriend?

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,025
Impossible.

78
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,150
Wait.

79
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:16,345
Maybe you should come visit there

80
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,401
once during the summer vacation.

81
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:19,225
Here you go.

82
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,500
It could be a good break for you.

83
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,525
Maybe.

84
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,450
At that time, I'll take a break one day.

85
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,600
(Studying high school abroad)

86
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:22,925
(Why didn't you just tell the truth?
You're not the one at fault)

87
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,300
Haruki.

88
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:46,600
What are you doing?

89
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,725
You have money, huh?

90
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:53,918
Who are you relying on?

91
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,746
Why can you afford to eat like this?

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,375
Look this way.

93
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:01,750
What?

94
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,625
You still have the nerve to ask.

95
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,800
What's with that look?

96
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,650
Causing trouble.

97
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,676
They called me and told me

98
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,434
to drop you out of school.

99
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,762
You always make me involve

100
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,587
in your school's nonsense.

101
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,009
If you're a man,

102
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,451
you need to get back at them.

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,825
Get them before they get you.

104
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,735
If they don't listen,

105
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,447
hit them until they do.

106
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:37,625
Do you understand?

107
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,425
Huh?

108
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:40,950
Oww!

109
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,675
That hurts!

110
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:46,325
Hey, Haruki, wait a minute!

111
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,575
We're not done talking yet!

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,300
Hey, are you kidding? Open right now!

113
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,275
Can't you hear me, you ungrateful brat!

114
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,312
Why the hell should

115
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,250
I have to take care of you?

116
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,675
You've got nowhere to go!

117
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,314
Do you understand that?

118
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,725
I'm not living my life the way you do!

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,900
Dammit!

120
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,425
Where's the booze?

121
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:47,875
Booze.

122
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,400
Need booze.

123
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,075
Where is it?

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,225
When did it all go wrong?

125
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,975
I just wanted to live a good life.

126
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,321
I want to have a life that

127
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,282
is different from my father.

128
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:13,625
No.

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,696
If I'd just been

130
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:17,705
a better person to begin with…

131
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:21,182
None of this would've happened.

132
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,200
If only…

133
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,350
I wasn't me.

134
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,623
The left side uses the past tense

135
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:18,026
that has already ended.

136
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,045
The right side uses

137
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,412
the auxiliary verb have...

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,525
This shaded area is equal to twice of D.

139
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:30,746
Um...

140
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,661
The way to find the answer is x+y...

141
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,800
That old teacher

142
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:43,931
kept mumbling.

143
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,826
Do you understand what he said?

144
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,625
Huh?

145
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,525
- You don't get it, right?
- Yes, I don't get it.

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,575
Hirukawa.

147
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,000
Hirukawa!

148
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,450
What if you got the wrong person?

149
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,025
I wouldn't.

150
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,650
I'm glad I got to see you.

151
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:39,537
I was thinking about

152
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:40,896
heading to your place.

153
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,625
Sorry. My mom's back home.

154
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,300
Well, guess that's off the table then.

155
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,050
Are you coming to the test tomorrow?

156
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,225
Mm,

157
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,075
Well, that's the plan.

158
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,725
I'm glad you didn't get expelled.

159
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:02,225
Mm.

160
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:05,225
If I make it back to school,

161
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,089
I'll be able to steal glances

162
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,613
at you during class again.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,775
Huh?

164
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,650
What happened to your study abroad?

165
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll visit the school over summer break.

166
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,225
So, you're really going, huh?

167
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:27,491
Mhm.

168
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,425
I want to graduate with you.

169
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,051
When your mom's not home,

170
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,325
can I come over again?

171
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,900
Let's watch a movie together.

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,375
Yeah. Sure.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,225
Then I'll see you tomorrow at school.

174
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:10,300
See you tomorrow.

175
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,550
You reek of booze.

176
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,125
(Do your best on your tests.

177
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,343
I'll be in Osaka and return

178
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:11,429
the day after tomorrow)

179
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,450
(Hirukawa)

180
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:03,975
Hello.

181
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,825
Hirukawa? Are you still awake?

182
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:17,775
Minase.

183
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,034
Hirukawa?

184
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,117
I thought I took the wrong one.

185
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,050
My old man...

186
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,400
What? What's wrong?

187
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,025
My old man...

188
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,325
My old man...

189
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,300
He's dead.

190
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,275
He won't move.

191
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:55,900
What should I do?

192
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,525
Hirukawa!

193
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,225
Hirukawa.

194
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,375
What if they arrest me?

195
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:06,050
No. Why would they arrest you?

196
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,600
Because I left him unattended.

197
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,250
What do you mean?

198
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,675
If, at that moment,

199
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,775
I had checked properly...

200
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,825
At first, he was still alive,

201
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,700
However, upon seeing him,

202
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,321
I found myself hoping

203
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,446
that he'd die sooner.

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,550
It's my fault.

205
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:46,375
- It' my fault.
- No.

206
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,200
It's not your fault. It's not.

207
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:52,825
You know, what I always thought was

208
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,425
that guy should just die.

209
00:17:58,575 --> 00:17:59,789
The thought of wanting him

210
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:01,187
to die turned into a curse.

211
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,050
No.

212
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,157
It's bad luck to get involved with me.

213
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,501
You'd better hurry back.

214
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:09,625
No.

215
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,050
- We have the same genes.
- That's not it.

216
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,725
- I'm still my old man's son!
- No!

217
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,375
Please don't say that.

218
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,375
It's okay.

219
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:28,125
It's okay. You're not wrong at all.

220
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,125
You're not wrong!

221
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,476
You're not wrong at all!

222
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:34,675
You're not wrong at all!

223
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,140
You're not wrong!

224
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,225
You're not wrong!

225
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,600
It's okay.

226
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,500
I'll make a call.

227
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,500
I'm sorry.

228
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,750
For what?

229
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,125
You need to go.

230
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,125
You shouldn't stay with me.

231
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:19,900
Go home.

232
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,750
Get some sleep.

233
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:28,550
Get ready.

234
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,125
Go to school.

235
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,625
Take your test.

236
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,308
That doesn't matter right now.

237
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,250
Please go.

238
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:48,520
I need you to.

239
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,700
Please.

240
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,700
The waves rise and fall,

241
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,429
carrying you further and

242
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:19,828
further away from me.

243
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,900
Before the sea,

244
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:32,875
humans are powerless.

245
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:42,400
Still,

246
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:45,120
I just hope you don't

247
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:46,714
get swept away by the waves.

248
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:52,000
All I can do

249
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:54,800
is pray.

250
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,575
But that's why

251
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,925
I can't help but pray.

252
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,875
(Next episode)

253
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm fine now.

254
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,850
So go back to the way you were.

255
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,500
Thank you

256
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,700
for being my friend.

257
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,900
Hirukawa!
