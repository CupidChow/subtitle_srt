1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,039
There are three kinds of

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,343
people in the world.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,440
The perpetrators, the victims…

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,940
And the bystanders.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,740
Why is Hirukawa still in our school?

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,439
Is it true he strangled

7
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,127
a teacher back in first year?

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,180
I saw it.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,520
Dammit.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,500
Don't tell anyone.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,080
This will never happen again.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,980
Don't talk to

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,060
me at school anymore.

14
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:40,947
Each lives in their own sea, separate.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,100
And the waters will never mix.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,080
Or so I thought.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,120
(Documents for internship)

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
(Quarterly employment)

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,780
At first, I only

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
dipped my feet into the water.

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,020
(We talked by the sea before going home)

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,160
(25 April, 2019)

23
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:31,472
By the way, my house is this way.

24
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:32,236
Want to go?

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,820
Can I?

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,240
That'd be great.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,568
The sand beneath my feet was

28
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:37,736
pulled away by the waves.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,620
Really?

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,520
Don't want to see your ex?

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,940
- That's not it.
- Before I knew it,

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,180
I was swept offshore.

33
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,640
- Wow, so cute!
- Oh my, so cute!

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,220
Administrative teacher found it.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,860
That guy really did it.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,937
How can Hirukawa and

37
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,148
I use the same brand?

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,100
(Geenlight)

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
This is...

40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,640
It suits me, doesn't it?

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,220
By the time I realized,

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,080
I was already close to you.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,180
Majima's a lost cause too.

44
00:02:22,204 --> 00:02:23,576
That bunch is done for.

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,920
Amazing, Hirukawa's influence.

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,420
How scary.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,940
"Our Youth"
(Episode 2)

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,160
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- I'm full. It's delicious.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
Then...

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,140
Did Majima

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
always seem like a smoker?

52
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,340
Doesn't fit, right?

53
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,520
He's under Hirukawa's spell.

54
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,260
Probably doesn't realize how much damage

55
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:42,396
he's causing to people's lives.

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,760
- Another one, please.
- Majima has his own will.

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,620
It's not Hirukawa's fault.

58
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,220
- By the way, Minase.
- Hmm?

59
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,520
Aren't you defending Hirukawa?

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Huh?

61
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,740
It's not like that.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Mhm. Rina-chan?

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,280
At your place?

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Yeah, I'm free!

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Sure. Be there soon.

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,320
- Wait a moment.
- Noisy.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,420
Ah... This soda is so refreshing.

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,420
See ya!

69
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,540
- Thank you.
- Hurry up and go.

70
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,260
I'm off.

71
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,340
Haa...

72
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm taking a break.

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,280
Sure. I'll take a break too.

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,800
Geez, my shoulders are so tense.

75
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,940
- Hey, Minase.
- Huh?

76
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,580
Seriously, stay away from Hirukawa.

77
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,500
Hmm? Why?

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,389
Even if you say that the other party

79
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,776
is not a bad person,

80
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,826
but in the end,

81
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,791
people will be deceived and lost.

82
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,487
I've read novels where

83
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,909
the main character is such

84
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,721
an naive person until I'm bored.

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,380
Am I such an naive person?

86
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,540
I'm just warning you.

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,840
I don't want to end up hating you.

88
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Recommend me a book, then.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,334
Something that'll help

90
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,656
with modern literature.

91
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,840
Umm...

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,680
Hmm, Murō Saisei maybe?

93
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,920
This one?

94
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,540
Umm. Well...

95
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,980
I'm home.

96
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,100
Jin, welcome home.

97
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,920
You're late. Were you out having fun?

98
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,260
I went to review my studies.

99
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,580
What a relief.

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,760
You must choose your friends carefully.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,420
I know.

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,879
If you get involved with a troublemaker,

103
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:09,575
your life may be ruined.

104
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,207
It's better to avoid

105
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:12,418
friendships altogether.

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Such a good boy.

107
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,300
- Here, eat up.
- Mhm.

108
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,960
Bon appétit.

109
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,320
Haa...

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,862
How long does he plan on

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,838
making those unprofitable art films?

112
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,680
He kept doing that all the time.

113
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,800
What is this?

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,720
Don't you think it's strange that

115
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,016
he spent all his stepmother's money?

116
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,280
But he hasn't learned anything.

117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,355
I'm glad you didn't

118
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,387
pursue the arts like him.

119
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,800
Don't waste your life like him.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,900
Yeah. I'll be careful.

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,500
How long are you staying here?

122
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
Maybe a week?

123
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,370
I have to leave early tomorrow

124
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,331
to go to Kyoto

125
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,940
and then to Fukuoka.

126
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,100
How nice.

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,880
Sounds fun.

128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,789
I've already transferred

129
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,062
your living expenses.

130
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm just relieved you're doing well.

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,340
Mhm.

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,194
No, but honestly, it just feels

133
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,536
like we're stuck together.

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,840
- Huh?
- We just started living together.

135
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,900
Really?

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,251
I haven't made any progress

137
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,151
in cleaning up.

138
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,215
About that?

139
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,140
Hey, that's no good.

140
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,920
Congratulations.

141
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,120
- Geez, Haruki, my man.
- Minase.

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
Where are you headed?

143
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,860
Bookstore.

144
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,100
I'll come too.

145
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,600
- Good job.
- Oh.

146
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,840
- Good job.
- Good job.

147
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,700
I told you not to talk to me.

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,040
But this isn't school.

149
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,180
Don't follow me.

150
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,538
I'll go to the bookstore and

151
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,015
buy some movie magazines.

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,300
You watch movies?

153
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,560
Yeah. What about you?

154
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,860
I don't.

155
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,640
Not interested?

156
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,620
I want to, but my mom doesn't like it.

157
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,160
What's the title?

158
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
The Sound of Water. It's obscure.

159
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,880
Huh?

160
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,940
It seems like it's not available

161
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,643
for rent or distribution, so there's

162
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,459
no way to watch it, right?

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,760
Forget about the bookstore.
Come to my place.

164
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,700
Huh?

165
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,720
If I don't go there?

166
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,780
A bit weird.

167
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
No.

168
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,180
This way.

169
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,980
This way.

170
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,900
Here.

171
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,160
(The Sound of Water)

172
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,402
Out of all the directors,

173
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,847
he's my absolute favorite.

174
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,738
You're the first person

175
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,276
I've met who knows this film.

176
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,600
- How come?
- Because he's my father.

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,780
Huh?

178
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,340
- Hmm?
- Director...

179
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
Amasawa Yoshito.

180
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,900
Huh?

181
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,040
That's my dad.

182
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,420
Huh?

183
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,264
No way. I mean, yeah, I remember reading

184
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,076
that Amasawa's kid is our age.

185
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,412
I've even wondered what

186
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,795
kind of person they'd be.

187
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,420
Huh?

188
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,400
You really like it?

189
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,800
Love it.

190
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Mhm.

191
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,980
But...

192
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,320
Seems like you want to watch.

193
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,180
Let's watch it.

194
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,660
Mhm.

195
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,180
Sit.

196
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,760
- Help yourself.
- Mhm.

197
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,200
What's so great about this?

198
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,830
It shows that some people

199
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,304
can overcome their suffering,

200
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,688
while others get consumed by it.

201
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,840
And the film embraces all of it.

202
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,780
That's why I love it.

203
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,780
The protagonist,

204
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,698
in order to prevent waves of suffering

205
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,925
from overwhelming his important person,

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,920
he watched from the sea.

207
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,360
Huh?

208
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,040
Not into it?

209
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,380
Mhm...

210
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,880
I don't really get it.

211
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,560
Ha.

212
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,460
- Haruki.
- Hmm?

213
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,940
Why did Dad come back now?

214
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,640
- This way, at the back.
- Huh?

215
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,140
Bring your shoes and bag, okay?

216
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,280
Hurry up, hurry up.

217
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,020
Haruki, where are you? You know right?

218
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,660
Think you can escape me?

219
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,240
Tell me. I'll go kill you.

220
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,760
Minase...

221
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,540
Seriously, stay away from Hirukawa.

222
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,440
Hmm? Why?

223
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,490
Even if you say that the other party

224
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:09,535
is not a bad person,

225
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,904
but in the end,

226
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:13,113
people will be deceived and lost.

227
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,865
In order to prevent waves of suffering

228
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,976
from overwhelming his important person,

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
he watched from the sea.

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,180
Minase-san, don't get involved.

231
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,580
You must choose your friends carefully.

232
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,053
If you get involved with a troublemaker,

233
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,741
your life may be ruined.

234
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,928
It's better to avoid

235
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,209
friendships altogether.

236
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,471
It's an important moment

237
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,896
so make the most of it.

238
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,760
That's it for today.

239
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,720
- Majima-san.
- Yes.

240
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,860
Have you heard from Hirukawa-san?

241
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,460
Nope.

242
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,560
He's probably off on vacation again.

243
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,580
Honestly, I'd love to tag along.

244
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,020
The problem is repeating the grade.

245
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,680
Repeating the grade.

246
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,880
Why haven't you been coming to school?

247
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,380
Don't feel like it.

248
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,180
Because of your injuries, right?

249
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,100
If you already know, why ask?

250
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,200
You're not going to fight back?

251
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,120
I don't want to be like him.

252
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,160
Do you have anywhere else to go?

253
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,680
Here.

254
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,551
The senior who used to let me stay with

255
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:24,309
him is now living with a girlfriend.

256
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,640
Others live with their families.

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,040
You can't even go to an internet cafe

258
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:34,504
or a karaoke bar.

259
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,060
You could stay at my place.

260
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,620
My parents are not home anyway.

261
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,480
I...

262
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,480
Do I look that pathetic to you?

263
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Mhm.

264
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,540
Yeah. You do.

265
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,680
I will never forget it.

266
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,580
What do you talk about?

267
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,520
I like you very much.

268
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,300
Hmm...

269
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
With your family.

270
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Same here.

271
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,060
Not much.

272
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,520
Grades, Dad's complaints…

273
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,960
I just nod along.

274
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't you get lonely?

275
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,620
Mhm...

276
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,420
Don't know.

277
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,085
As long as I meet Mom's expectations,

278
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:23,335
life's easy.

279
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,824
I want to go to a good university

280
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:29,448
to please my mother.

281
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,760
and work for a good company.

282
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,900
That's it.

283
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,100
How pathetic,

284
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,280
you.

285
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,980
What about you?

286
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,180
My mom and I get along,

287
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,700
but she probably got remarried

288
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:59,172
not long after leaving my dad.

289
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,080
You should've gone with her.

290
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,240
He'd find and kill us.

291
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,820
Both me and my mom.

292
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,480
So I have to keep an eye on him.

293
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,340
Mom,

294
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,300
she doesn't even know he hits me.

295
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,300
As long as I can stop him,

296
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,400
it's fine.

297
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
Your parents are pretty mean too.

298
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,600
Stop it.

299
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,040
Minase.

300
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,200
Have you ever kissed someone?

301
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,800
Huh?

302
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,660
No.

303
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,980
Me neither.

304
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,660
Wanna try?

305
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,980
Do you like me?

306
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,240
Skipping some steps huh?

307
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,060
Then do it.

308
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,620
Huh?

309
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,140
Try kissing me.

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,580
Bet you can't.

311
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,680
You said it.

312
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,500
You're...

313
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,107
strange.

314
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,300
Mhm.

315
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,500
Sorry about that.

316
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,420
Even when I try to stay away,

317
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,140
I'm drawn back.

318
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,240
Even so,

319
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,000
just when I think we're close,

320
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,900
the distance grows again.

321
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,500
Rocked by the waves…

322
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,560
by the time I notice,

323
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I was swept offshore

324
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:57,680
again.

325
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,420
(Next episode)

326
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,660
What's with you?

327
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,680
What's wrong? Something happened?

328
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,880
Nothing.

329
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,920
You can kiss people you don't like, huh?

330
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,280
What about you?

331
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,940
Do you hate it that much?

332
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,920
Me?
