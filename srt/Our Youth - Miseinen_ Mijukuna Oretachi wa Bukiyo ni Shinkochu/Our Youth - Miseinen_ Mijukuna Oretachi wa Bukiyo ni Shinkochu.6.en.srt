00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,539
There are three types

00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:12,000
of people in the world.

00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:17,580
(Minase Jin)

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,060
Perpetrators,

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,860
victims,

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,780
My mom doesn't know anything.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,440
About my dad hitting me and stuff.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,255
So, just go along with

9
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:35,505
whatever I say, okay?

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,100
Got it.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,080
And bystanders.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,380
Mom.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,700
Oh, Welcome!

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,660
Hello.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,360
Hello.

16
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,395
- Each lives
- Hinata!

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,160
- in their own sea,
- How've you been?

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,500
- and their waters
- It must've been a long trip.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,060
- never meet.
- Not at all.

20
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,120
- Come on in!
- At least, that's what I used to think.

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,780
Come in!

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,820
"Our Youth"
(Episode 6)

23
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,920
This place is so your vibe, Mom.

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,860
Right? I love it.

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,840
Make yourselves at home.

26
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:01,685
Use the room however you like.

27
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,700
Relax until dinner is ready.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,240
Got it!

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,860
I'll sleep on the floor.

30
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,100
It's such a big bed.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,220
Isn't sleeping on the floor stranger?

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,960
What'are you drawing?

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,020
Huh?

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,060
I've drawn a lot of sketches so far.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,114
What about your college plans?

36
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:45,818
Got any schools in mind?

37
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,800
College, huh? Probably not going.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,620
Huh? Why not?

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,740
Why?

40
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:56,125
Once I graduate, I'm going

41
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,950
to work and live on my own.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,740
That's my dream.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,280
You two, let's eat.

44
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:05,722
Let's eat outside?

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Mhm.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,800
Mhm! Delicious.

47
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,707
Mm, it's really good.

48
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:18,148
I fried it twice.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,980
Think I could make this?

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,588
It's not too hard.

51
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,096
I'll teach you the recipe later.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,740
How nice. Thank you.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,880
- Hinata, want some?
- What are you doing?

54
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,880
It's too early for her.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,660
- She looks like she can eat it, though.
- No way.

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,880
Hmm?

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,540
Nothing... You guys seem close.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
I was surprised, though.

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,759
Didn't think Haruki would be friends

60
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,276
with someone like you, Minase.

61
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,120
- Really?
- Mhm.

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,573
The other day,

63
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,648
he wandered in here on a whim,

64
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,495
but he was all beat up,

65
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:01,737
face covered in bruises.

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,151
He's not causing trouble

67
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,815
at school, right? Hanging out with

68
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:06,976
bad kids or anything?

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,540
I just get tangled up easily.

70
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,904
Your dad was quick

71
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:13,146
to get into fights, too.

72
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,340
Definitely takes after him.

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,700
But.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,072
But your dad was strong.

75
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,955
Barely ever got hurt...

76
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,220
You think I should start fighting back?

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,440
I'm kidding.

78
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,707
No fighting, okay?

79
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,280
Got it?

80
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,600
I know.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Don't do it.

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,020
Still so good.

83
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,520
About Hirukawa's injuries...

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,520
What?

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,064
They heal fast.

86
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,986
Pretty amazing recovery power.

87
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,140
You're so funny.

88
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,840
I feel great.

89
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,960
Let's go home.

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Mmm.

91
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
Come back to my place.

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,120
Huh?

93
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,420
I've got an extra room.

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,700
That's...

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,028
kind of scary.

96
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,860
What?

97
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm my dad's son, after all.

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,020
What if I end up like him?

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,420
What if I end up hitting you?

100
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,940
You're not like your dad.

101
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,000
You'll be okay.

102
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,008
Will you watch over me?

103
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,060
Mhm.

104
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,260
What about after you leave for America?

105
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
What'll I do then?

106
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm not going.

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,760
Just go.

108
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,900
But you told me not to.

109
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,000
That was just my honest feelings.

110
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Huh?

111
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,228
But you can't not go.

112
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,420
Don't go.

113
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,040
Kiss me.

114
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:39,657
Are you asleep?

115
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:49,028
Hmm?

116
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,800
You could stay a bit longer, you know.

117
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:08,000
- He's got cram school.
- Thank you for having me.

118
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,971
- Come visit again with Haruki sometime.
- Yes.

119
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:12,742
Ah.

120
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,314
Here.

121
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,028
- Bye.
- Mmh.

122
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:26,742
- Safe travels.
- Mhm.

123
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,942
Hey, you have a little time left?

124
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,971
A bit, yeah.

125
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:44,857
Let's hit the beach one last time?

126
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:09,835
I'm done just taking hits.

127
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,664
My mom has a new family.

128
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:18,766
It's just my dad and me now,

129
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:23,942
I think I was scared.

130
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,185
Scared that if my dad gave up on me,

131
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,489
I'd be completely alone.

132
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,828
But I...

133
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,285
I want to be better.

134
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,514
Huh?

135
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:41,257
Tell me.

136
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:46,571
If you're ever lonely, tell me.

137
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:52,800
If you ask me, I can do it.

138
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:57,542
Thank you.

139
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,428
Minase, when's your birthday?

140
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,828
April 6th.

141
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:36,914
That's already passed.

142
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:40,285
When's yours?

143
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:45,533
December 19th.

144
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:48,742
Still a while away.

145
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:56,228
Write me a letter for my birthday.

146
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:59,020
Why?

147
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,264
Just to express congratulations.

148
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,303
If it's Minase's birthday,

149
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,007
I'll write back.

150
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:35,657
When's the last time you cried?

151
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,257
I don't remember.

152
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,171
I'll make you cry with my letter.

153
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,278
When the period is over,

154
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,633
I will leave the room.

155
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,857
The part that needs to be reviewed.

156
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:17,036
Let's start from the equations

157
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,364
in the third part on page 51

158
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:22,196
to page 64.

159
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,657
A girl wants me to introduce her to you.

160
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,428
- I'll pass.
- Why?

161
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:33,420
She's seriously cute, by the way.

162
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,877
Forget about that.

163
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,971
- Huh?
- It's boring.

164
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,644
What's with you lately?

165
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,612
You're acting weird.

166
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,616
I was thinking if I start now,

167
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,159
I think I can still make it.

168
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,563
Stop saying stuff that's not like you.

169
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,094
What does that even mean?

170
00:15:58,438 --> 00:15:59,945
What do you know about me?

171
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,371
Is Minase going to brother's store?

172
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,257
I'm stopping by the store
on the way home.

173
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,342
What are you buying?

174
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:09,518
Mind if I tag along?

175
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:11,028
- Chicken.
- Chicken?

176
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,228
- Mhm.
- What will you do with it?

177
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,571
- Mhm... It's a secret.
- What's with you?

178
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,514
- Let's disperse.
- Time to disperse.

179
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:17,428
- Mhm.
- Bye-bye.

180
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,285
Bye.

181
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:21,885
Making karaage today.

182
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:23,880
You're making it today?

183
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,428
- Mhm.
- Maybe I should come over and eat some.

184
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:28,742
Yeah, that'd be great.

185
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:31,085
Hey, stop! Shoplifter!

186
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:33,257
- Quickly! Hide!
- Hey, stop!

187
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,828
- Shoplifting?
- Dammit!

188
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:42,285
- Majima?
- Majima?

189
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:44,914
What did Majima do?

190
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,898
I think the guy running with

191
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,515
the booze looked like Majima.

192
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,400
(I got home, starting to cook)

193
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,228
(Done, it was pretty long right?)

194
00:16:58,228 --> 00:16:59,714
(Something happen?)

195
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,771
He shoplifted.

196
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:11,771
Can just tell from his face.

197
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,714
You also think so, right?

198
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,114
He was definitely shoplifting.

199
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,971
- Hmm?
- Looks like he did something.

200
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,228
- Huh?
- He probably did it.

201
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,454
Hirukawa and Majima, huh?

202
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:27,821
No surprises there.

203
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:33,142
- What did he do?
- It has nothing to do with us?

204
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,993
Remember the feeling of parting

205
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:39,060
when you realize the truth that

206
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:41,510
you have to pay the price of your life

207
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:45,049
but you still hide your human heart...

208
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:48,400
- Sit here.
- I know. I'm on it.

209
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,228
Thanks.

210
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:52,342
- Place it here.
- Yeah, thanks.

211
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:57,942
(Sorry. Come to the swimming pool)

212
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:14,875
Sorry about yesterday.

213
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:16,806
I said I'd come over.

214
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:20,114
Never mind. It's fine.

215
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,457
What happened?"

216
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
I...

217
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:35,200
I might get expelled.

218
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:39,142
Huh?

219
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:45,314
Huh? Why?

220
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,657
After I hung up with you…

221
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,400
I thought we'd get caught for a second.

222
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,685
- Close call.
- What did you lot do?

223
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:56,914
Ah, you're here.

224
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,085
Check this out. Cool, right?

225
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:07,613
Cut it out. Why are you

226
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,776
even recording this?

227
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,081
Because you're going to

228
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:11,404
do something even crazier!

229
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:13,828
- Yay!
- That's great!

230
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,820
I told you I would stop!

231
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,742
Not after all this time, it's too late.

232
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,628
I learned all the bad things from you.

233
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:27,314
- That's nonsense.
- Huh?

234
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,322
Why do you suddenly become

235
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,787
such a boring guy?

236
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,942
I got what I want to do.

237
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:38,228
I'm going to live for what I want to do.

238
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,942
Aren't you looking down on me?

239
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:44,242
You get beat up at

240
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:46,007
home by your dad, right?

241
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,057
And your mom didn't save you.

242
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,800
That's too pitiful.

243
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,542
Shut your trap!

244
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,714
- Hey! Hey!
- What did you say?

245
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:57,870
Isn't it true? Kids who get beaten

246
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,293
up grow up to do the same!

247
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:00,432
Hirukawa also...

248
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:01,721
I'm not like my dad!

249
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:03,804
I live by doing what I want to do!

250
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,200
Someone like you can't do that!

251
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,742
Because you're trash.

252
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:38,400
Neither of us are trash.

253
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:42,057
So just stop.

254
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,342
Don't give me that.

255
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,345
What are you joking around for?

256
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,970
Everything's because of you!

257
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:57,028
All because of you!

258
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:08,400
I forced him...

259
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,950
to shoplift.

260
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,342
Huh?

261
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,760
He said he was going to turn himself in.

262
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,046
I punched him in the face

263
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,242
to make him shut up.

264
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:27,514
How much lower can you go?

265
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,920
Expulsion or suspension.

266
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:29,861
Until we decide,

267
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:31,880
stay at home on probation.

268
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:44,857
I thought you were going to be decent.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,628
What are you doing?

270
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:54,971
I know.

271
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:12,342
Minase, don't go back.

272
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:20,342
Our seas are intertwined.

273
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:23,102
I think we are all being swept

274
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,422
away by the same wave.

275
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:28,171
I believe so.

276
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,971
- Hey, let's go see.
- What is it?

277
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:47,085
- Good morning.
- What is it?

278
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:49,028
- An announcement?
- Suspension from school?

279
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:51,085
Yuck. I know he did it.

280
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,885
- That's right.
- I can just tell he did it.

281
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:54,963
(Notification of disciplinary action)
Speaking of which,

282
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:55,976
I want to see their parents.

283
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,742
Yeah.

284
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,228
You drifted so...

285
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:05,028
easily away from me.

286
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,020
(Next episode)
He didn't do anything.

287
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,742
- Because at that time...
- Minase-san.

288
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:09,828
You're not related.

289
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:12,685
There's no place for you.

290
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:15,314
I'll never live like you.

291
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,828
You should hurry back.

292
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,000
You can't come and stay with me.
