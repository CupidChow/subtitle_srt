really uneasy.

I saw you were working too hard,

152
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,530
so I wanted to share your burden.

Fine, I was wrong.

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,220
I'll get you some medicine.

156
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,550
Okay.

157
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,350
Let me tell you,

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,950
even though this medicine is very bitter,

159
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,420
it's very effective.

160
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,990
Just gulp it down, and you'll feel better.

161
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,950
Here.

162
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,159
Come closer.

163
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,560
Closer.

164
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,500
Okay.

165
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,580
Be good. Take your medicine.

166
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,500
Open your mouth.

167
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm better now.

168
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Are you sure?

169
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,020
Just try it.

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm really better now.

171
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,110

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
What?

175
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,070
What?

176
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,250
Why are you up so early? Where are you going?

177
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,990
My parents are here.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
I have to pick them up.

179
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,720
Your parents are here?

180
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm doomed.

181
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,620
Okay, okay.

182
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,059
Okay.

183
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,539
Why is it over?

184
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
They don't know I've switched jobs.

185
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,700
I have been lying to them,

186
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,100
telling them I'm an accountant.

187
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,660
So don't let it slip.

188
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,290
Got it?

189
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,780
You didn't tell them?

190
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,020
If I told them,

191
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,750
they would have forced me to go home immediately.

192
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,900
You wouldn't be able to see me anymore,

193
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,430
you don't want that, right?

194
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,090
I'll pick them up with you.

195
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,020
Are you sure?

196
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,860
You can't let them stay in a hotel, can you?

197
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,420
Now that you've canceled your lease.

198
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,660
They came all the way here,

199
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,450
surely they would want to see where you're living.

200
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,820
Well, Mr. Cheng,

201
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,260
are you ready to meet my parents?

202
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,020
Me?

203
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,150
Of course.

204
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,730
Okay.

205
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,600
Ning,

206
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,060
why are you walking today?

207
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,700
Don't bring it up.

208
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,940
I couldn't squeeze onto the bus today,

209
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,280
and my wallet was stolen.

210
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,430
I'm doomed this month.

211
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,830
Hop on.

212
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,770
Ning,

213
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,630
can you lend me some money?

214
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,100
If you don't have money,

215
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,430
ask Boss for an advance.

216
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,180
Why don't you do it yourself?

217
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,170
Me?

218
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,820
I've already taken an advance for next month's salary.

219
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,080
If I ask for another, Boss will beat me up.

220
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,180
Ning.

221
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,490
Can you bear to see me suffer?

222
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,710
You want me to take you in?

223
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,700
That's not out of the question.

224
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,630
You're the best.

225
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,390
I'm in need of a cleaning auntie at home.

226
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,730
Dream on.

227
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
Handsome men don't sweep the floor.

228
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,920
Get off.

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,970
All right.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,920
I'll move in tomorrow, okay?

231
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,780
Sit tight.

232
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,170
Let's go. We're going to be late.

233
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,970
Ning, are you trying to murder me?

234
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,090
I'm worried you'll be late.

235
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,870
Wait, wait, wait.

236
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,470
What now?

237
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,220
Bai said Boss will be late today.

238
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,260
We can go slow.

239
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:42,840
Okay.

240
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,470
♫I'm looking at the moon, high up in the sky♫

241
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,210
Please come in.

242
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,990
Your house is quite big, young man.

243
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,860
-Han Han, your clothes are all over the place. -Sit down.

244
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,420
Okay.

245
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,750
Where are your manners?

246
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,850
Let me see.

247
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:01,930
Auntie,

248
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,500
I've prepared this room for the two of you.

249
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,220
Okay.

250
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,290
Dad, what are you looking at?

251
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:07,700
Sit down.

252
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,970
Come, Han Han. Sit down.

253
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,500
You're not letting me look?

254
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,030
We have to talk to you about something.

255
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,060
Sit.

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,010
Have some water.

257
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,500
Thank you, young man.

258
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,430
Thank you.

259
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,720
Cheng Mu.

260
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,140
You're Ming Ming's friend, right?

261
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,980
Yes, we were classmates and roommates in college.

262
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,540
Dad, Mom.

263
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,300
Cheng Mu is not only Brother-in-law's classmate,

264
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,810
he's also my boyfriend.

265
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,370
We are together now.

266
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,780
How can you

267
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,060
spring something like this on us so suddenly.

268
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,850
You didn't give us

269
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,150
a warning at all.

270
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,770
What's there to warn?

271
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,100
No matter what,

272
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,320
I'll have to tell you anyway.

273
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,360
Are you two...

274
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,840
No, Uncle.

275
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,060
We- We sleep in separate rooms.

276
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,110
Dad, what are you thinking?

277
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,570
We just got together.

278
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,050
We're not at that stage yet.

279
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,750
That's good.

280
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,360
Cheng Mu, my two daughters

281
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,980
are really immature.

282
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,750
I heard that

283
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,430
you helped take care of Rui Rui, right?

284
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,890
Don't worry about it.

285
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,110
Zhou Ming and I are good friends,

286
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,310
and Rui Rui is my godfather.

287
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,060
No, wait...

288
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,690
I'm Rui Rui's godfather.

289
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,700
We're family.

290
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,670
Jiang Sihan,

291
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,580
you don't tell us about what's going on,

292
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,850
and trouble others with your problems instead.

293
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,780
Come out with me.

294
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,900
I need to talk to you properly.

295
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,500
No, Dad.

296
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,430
You want to leave him alone here...

297
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,760
Get out.

298
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,270
Let's go.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Speak- Speak kindly.

300
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,820
Cheng Mu,

301
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,890
what do you do for a living?

302
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,970
I- I run a small dessert shop.

303
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,170
If the two of you are free,

304
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,780
I'll bring you there to have a try.

305
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,080
This is a good occupation,

306
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,540
and it takes artisanship.

307
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,340
Yes.

308
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,820
What do your parents do?

309
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,500
My parents passed away when I was very young.

310
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,830
My sister brought me up.

311
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,050
I see.

312
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,080
I didn't want to ask this just now,

313
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,340
when Cheng was around.

314
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,220
How's work?

315
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,650
How's work?

316
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,480
Is your boss giving you a hard time?

317
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,320
W- Work is great!

318
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,510
The salary is good too.

319
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,620
I'm working as financial manager

320
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,420
at Cheng Mu's sister's company.

321
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,840
She takes good care of me.

322
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,070
That's good.

323
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,460
This is the kind of stable job you should be looking for.

324
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,520
In the future, don't even think about

325
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,240
becoming a blogger,

326
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,390
doing social media,

327
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,730
or writing content.

328
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,150
Think about it.

329
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,940
There is no security in freelancing at all,

330
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,900
and no one pays for your insurance.

331
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,660
If something untoward happens,

332
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,980
what are you going to do?

333
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,850
Yes, you're right.

334
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,030
In the past, you were just a kid.

335
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,450
It's fine that

336
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,250
you treated blogging as a hobby then.

337
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,340
You're an adult now,

338
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,140
so you have to be down-to-earth.

339
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,600
Even if you can't become extremely rich,

340
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,750
you can at least have financial security.

341
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,080
Uncle, I'm sorry.

342
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,520
It's time for Sihan to go to work.

343
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,940
Yes.

344
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,700
Dad,

345
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,850
I'm the backbone of our company now.

346
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,580
They can't operate without me.

347
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,550
In that case, get going to work.

348
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,190
The guest room is ready,

349
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,070
please make yourselves at home.

350
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,540
We will bring the two of you out for dinner

351
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,300
after work.

352
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,500
Don't worry about us.

353
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,900
Your work is more important.

354
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,040
Go ahead.

355
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,300
Don't worry about us.

356
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,380
Okay. Be careful.

357
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,620
I'm so pitiful.

358
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,270
Now that my parents are here,

359
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,740
I can't even stay at home.

360
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,660
Isn't it good to have your parents visit you?

361
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,860
Are they visiting me?

362
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,580
They're clearly here for a spot-check.

363
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,300
They're doing it because they care about you.

364
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,340
Let's just placate them like this for the next few days.

365
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
After they leave,

366
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,200
I'll be free.

367
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,680
Are you really not going to tell them

368
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
what it is that you do?

369
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
I can't tell them.

370
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,820
You're not allowed to tell them either.

371
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,140
You don't know what they're like.

372
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,430
When I graduated,

373
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,930
I told my dad

374
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,510
I wanted to be a blogger.

375
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,980
He flew over the very next day

376
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,910
to bring me home.

377
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,130
I had to tell him that

378
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,180
I found a job in finance

379
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,750
to get him to go back.

380
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,270
We can't keep doing this.

381
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,140
What else can I do?

382
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,520
If I let him know,

383
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,410
he will blow up immediately.

384
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,110
Didn't you hear him?

385
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,600
"Don't do anything stupid."

386
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,490
"You must find a stable job."

387
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,660
I think

388
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,620
they don't care about what you do

389
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,800
as much as whether you are doing well.

390
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,430
You don't know them.

391
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,960
They only want me to find a stable job.

392
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,560
Whatever.

393
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,690
Just keep it a secret.

394
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll listen to you.

395
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,780
Don't let it slip.

396
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,300
I won't.

397
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,090
I didn't realize you were sending so much

398
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,350
while we were packing.

399
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,870
These sausages alone cost hundreds.

400
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,060
Surely sausages aren't worth so much.

401
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,040
It's the thought that counts.

402
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,200
Think about it.

403
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,780
She can't buy these here.

404
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,270
What if she misses home?

405
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,660
She will need these foods

406
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,740
to comfort herself.

407
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,590
Our daughter only has thoughts

408
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,860
for Cheng Mu.

409
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,760
She isn't going to miss us.

410
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,540
It seems I am losing her to him.

411
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,980
Jiang,

412
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,220
did you send this as well?

413
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,099
No.

414
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,380
What is this? Is it medicine?

415
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,319
Is there anything wrong with our daughter?

416
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,369
Don't worry.

417
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,940
Let me check.

418
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,980
Hurry up.

419
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,490
Oh no.

420
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,210
What's wrong? Let me see.

421
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,619
It's for depression.

422
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,610
Our daughter has depression?

423
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,130
No.

424
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,540
Calm down.

425
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,490
No, she doesn't look like she does.

426
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,690
How is that possible?

427
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,420
Look. It's Cheng Mu's.

428
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,560
[Qingjiang]

429
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,560
[Cheng Mu]

430
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,980
Why are you here?

431
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,740
Oh,

432
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,190
you worry about him while he's at work?

433
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,850
We'll keep an eye on him for you.

434
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,850
Don't talk nonsense.

435
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,710
I'll tell on you to Cheng Mu later.

436
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,540
Please don't. I'm sorry.

437
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,250
Be good.

438
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,540
If you're jealous,

439
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,650
you should find yourself a partner.

440
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,250
I- It's not that I don't want to.

441
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,730
But where can I find one?

442
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,380
Where?

443
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,650
Hello, can I add you on WeChat?

444
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,060
Sorry.

445
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,160
I don't swim, work out,

446
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,550
or buy products.

447
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,700
Okay.

448
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,020
Why isn't anyone noticing my charm?

449
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,510
Girls nowadays have bad taste.

450
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,950
Is it because they have bad taste?

451
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,150
I think the problem is with you.

452
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,260
Wan Jie,

453
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,020
I finally know why you're always single.

454
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,560
Forget it. I'll be off now.

455
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I'm going to work.

456
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,420
-Let your boss know later. -Bye.

457
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,330
Bye.

458
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,360
Go back by yourself tonight.

459
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,290
No- You're not sending me anymore?

460
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,150
I don't want to. You're too heavy.

461
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,460
Ning, I beg you.

462
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,390
I don't want to take the bus alone.

463
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,030
Send me. Send me.

464
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,750
Let's go.

465
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,060
Sihan,

466
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,750
what brings you here today?

467
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,450
Yu, I have nowhere to go.

468
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,580
What's wrong?

469
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,320
Did you quarrel with Cheng Mu?

470
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,600
Impossible.

471
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,650
Cheng Mu is like a block of wood,

472
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,670
it's impossible for him to get into a quarrel.

473
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,730
-Li Jingyang. -Li Jingyang.

474
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,340
I'm talking about myself.

475
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,530
Go on.

476
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,270
My parents are here.

477
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,860
I didn't tell them

478
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,300
I'm still a blogger.

479
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,260
I had to lie to them,

480
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,810
saying that I'm a financial manager here.

481
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,420
So from now on,

482
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,180
I will have to come in during office hours every day

483
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,550
to work.

484
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,060
Sihan,

485
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,970
you should have a proper conversation

486
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,340
with your parents instead.

487
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,420
It's not a good idea

488
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,100
to keep lying to them.

489
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,740
Let me think about it.

490
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,760
It's not easy for them to come all the way here.

491
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,010
I'll treat them to dinner tonight.

492
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,100
No, Yu.

493
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,540
It's too troublesome.

494
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,470
There's no need.

495
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,470
I should do this.

496
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,660
Just take it as you and Cheng Mu are meeting each other's parents in advance.

497
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,190
Exactly.

498
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,880
Congratulations.

499
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,740
Ms. Cheng,

500
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,450
when are you planning on meeting my parents?

501
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,100
The dress

502
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,620
I saw last time.

503
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,760
I heard they stocked it in my size lately.

504
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,200
Really?

505
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,060
Do you want to go try it on with me

506
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,940
after eating?

507
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,620
Sure.

508
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,050
Let's try it on later.

509
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,780
I heard that

510
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,860
they've released many new designs too.

511
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,320
Really?

512
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,530
Are you here about the debt again?

513
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,330
So what if I am?

514
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,750
Come with me.

515
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,030
Phone.

516
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,060
QR code.

517
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,140
I've transferred the money to you.

518
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't trouble Jian Yihang again.

519
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,170
Okay.

520
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,460
I must say,

521
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,330
Jian Yihang is really lucky.

522
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,940
He freeloads off a woman, and such a pretty woman at that.

523
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,660
Why don't you give up on Jian Yihang,

524
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,820
and consider me instead?

525
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,620
I like to be a freeloader too.

526
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,980
How dare you compare yourself to my boyfriend?

527
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,530
I don't want the likes of you,

528
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,760
even if you came free.

529
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm warning you,

530
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,590
don't tell Jian Yihang about this,

531
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,370
or I'll skin you alive.

532
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,760
You're pretty, but you're too bad-tempered.

533
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,370
I wonder how Jian Yihang

534
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,630
puts up with you.

535
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,990
Don't worry.

536
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,320
I won't tell him.

537
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,300
Don't worry.

538
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,970
Gosh, you scared me.

539
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,380
You're lucky.

540
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,500
We're even now.

541
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,550
I'm leaving.

542
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,830
You're quite tough.

543
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,950
You dare to come here alone.

544
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
What if something had happened to you?

545
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,620
Also,

546
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,020
who asked you to repay my debt for me?

547
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,460
I'll can settle my own business,

548
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,860
you should stay out of it.

549
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,880
Only I am allowed to bully you,

550
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,500
and no one else.

551
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
Don't go.

552
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,280
Any other man would be over the moon

553
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,140
to have a girlfriend as considerate as I am.

554
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,990
But why do you

555
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,500
look so unhappy?

556
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,160
By the way,

557
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,260
how did you end up so deep in debt?

558
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,200
My mom was very ill a few years ago,

559
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,160
and needed a large sum of money.

560
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,260
Boss had always been very generous to me,

561
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,060
so I felt bad asking him for more.

562
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,110
That's why I borrowed money from them.

563
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,260
Also, Ms. Han,

564
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,430
before I pay you back in full,

565
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,110
let's not meet anymore.

566
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,950
Why?

567
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,580
I don't agree.

568
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,970
It doesn't matter whether you agree or not.

569
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,300
I don't want to see you again.

570
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,630
I...

571
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,620
Fine!

572
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,960
It's not like I want to see you either!

573
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,170
You were happy when you left just now.

574
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,460
Why are you so angry,

575
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,980
now that you're back?

576
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,130
Let me ask you.

577
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,830
What are men thinking?

578
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,900
I helped him

579
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,530
because I felt bad for him.

580
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,390
But he said that

581
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,780
before he pays me back,

582
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,180
we shouldn't meet again.

583
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,100
I'm so mad.

584
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,390
Who did you repay a debt for?

585
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,280
Jian Yihang.

586
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,630
Lan Lan, you're the one who's in the wrong.

587
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,420
What did I do wrong?

588
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,640
I think he just doesn't like me,

589
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,850
so he found an excuse to get rid of me.

590
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,250
A man's pride is strong.

591
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,230
It's uncomfortable enough for him

592
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,180
that you saw a pathetic side of him.

593
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,440
What's more, you repaid his debt for him.

594
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,640
How can he tolerate this?

595
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,370
So, it's not that he doesn't like you,

596
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,550
he just can't face you.

597
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,190
So...

598
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,190
Do you think he likes me?

599
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,980
I don't know.

600
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,220
He definitely does.

601
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,120
You...

602
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,910
It hurts.

603
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,550
How long have you been back?

604
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,070
All you do is play.

605
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,080
It's time to get down to business.

606
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,950
I've got it.

607
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,410
Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

608
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
It's nice to meet you.

609
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm Cheng Mu's sister, Cheng Yu.

610
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,240
You can call me Yu.

611
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,100
Dad, Mom.

612
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,100
Yu is our company's boss.

613
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,920
Hello.

614
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,230
You're so young and beautiful.

615
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,190
Yu.

616
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,570
Did Sihan cause you any trouble?

617
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,090
No.

618
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,130
Sihan is very capable.

619
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,780
That's good.

620
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,110
Uncle, Auntie,

621
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,430
I didn't know what you liked to eat,

622
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,690
so I prepared some simple dishes.

623
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,420
They're all home-style dishes.

624
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,660
The chef ordered this fish

625
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,520
fresh from the dock this morning.

626
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,460
I'm not sure if it's to your liking.

627
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,350
If not,

628
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,670
I'll ask them to serve something else later.

629
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,990
Good. Good.

630
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,020
-It's good, Yu. -It's quite a feast.

631
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,380
Let Cheng eat first.

632
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,460
Young man, you eat first.

633
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,190
Here, Cheng,

634
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,900
take one.

635
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,300
Thank you.

636
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,830
Mom, he can't eat chili.

637
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,300
You go first.

638
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,640
-It's okay. -Eat something else then.

639
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,450
Auntie, have some.

640
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,020
Young man, cheers.

641
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:19,990
Okay.

642
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,940
Let our family first make a toast to Yu,

643
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,060
for preparing such a feast for us.

644
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,590
Okay. Cheers.

645
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,680
Here, Uncle Jiang.

646
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
I can't reach.

647
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,240
-Work hard. -It's too far.

648
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,070
Got it.

649
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,130
Yu.

650
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,790
Auntie, where are the rest?

651
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,020
They went down first.

652
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,180
Yu.

653
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,230
I want to ask you something.

654
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,620
Go ahead.

655
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,670
Does Cheng have depression?

656
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:17,990
