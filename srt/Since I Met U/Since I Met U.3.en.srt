00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,550
As her sister,

173
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,710
shouldn't you start considering

174
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,900
your own marriage?

175
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,690
What do you think of me?

176
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,690
My brother and Jiang Sihan are a good match.

177
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,160
But I'm still a little worried.

178
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,920
Don't think about that.

179
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,420
Focus on our date, okay?

180
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,540
OK. Have you figured out the time?

181
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,360
I’ll ask Shuang to add it into my schedule.

182
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,720
Schedule?

183
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,680
No, our date

184
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,170
is just a schedule for you.

185
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,640
What else?

186
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,890
Cheng Yu, I'm courting you.

187
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,380
Thank you.

188
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,620
We're not suitable for each other.

189
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,910
It's not up to you

190
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
to decide if we are suitable.

191
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,870
What are you doing?

192
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,710
I'm going to sell you heartless woman.

193
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,520
Boss, I saw it just now.

194
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,090
Is this a new dessert?

195
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,280
I'll try first-

196
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,990
It's not for you.

197
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,540
No-

198
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,950
Close the shop for me.

199
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,280
Guys, it's time to go home.

200
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,620
Boss.

201
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:29,980
Yes?

202
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,600
What are you looking at?

203
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,250
Where is Boss going in a hurry?

204
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,700
Going home.

205
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,680
No way.

206
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,200
It's the first time

207
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,380
I've seen him get off work on time since we opened.

208
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,960
Did you see the dessert in his hand?

209
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,480
I wanted to try it just now

210
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,550
but he refused.

211
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,420
Boss

212
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,040
hasn't developed new products for a long time.

213
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,780
There must be something amiss.

214
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,570
Boss is in a hurry.

215
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,180
He must be going on a date.

216
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,300
Don't talk nonsense.

217
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,980
I think Boss is worried about Rui Rui.

218
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,740
Didn't you see he came to work alone today?

219
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,470
He didn't bring Rui Rui, right?

220
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,320
It's different when you have a child.

221
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,860
A workaholic like boss

222
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,320
can become a great father.

223
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,810
He's so nice to Rui Rui.

224
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,710
Learn from him.

225
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,580
Call me daddy.

226
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,240
I'll be good to you too.

227
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,190
Sun Xianning.

228
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,840
Enough.

229
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,100
Enough.

230
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,310
If you

231
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,890
want to get off work early,

232
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,140
then finish your work.

233
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,010
Come to my house later

234
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,520
I'll make you some delicious food, okay?

235
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,540
-You said it.
-Bai is the best.

236
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,420
It's a deal.

237
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,550
Come on, get busy. Come on.

238
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,300
Come on.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,820
Come on, Ning.

240
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,420
I bought you something.

241
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,480
Remember to get it.

242
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,130
What is it?

243
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,110
It's a great tool for babysitting kids.

244
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,300
Watermelon.

245
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,480
Where is your wife?

246
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,280
She's on a business trip.

247
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
I have something to tell you.

248
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,420
I gossiped with Jingyang a few days ago.

249
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,170
Jiang Sihan who came to our restaurant

250
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,250
to interview our boss previously

251
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,600
is Rui Rui's aunt.

252
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,150
Bai.

253
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
I thought it was a big gossip.

254
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,840
That's it?

255
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,840
That's not it.

256
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Bai's gossip is pretty serious.

257
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,670
That's right. How can gossip from me

258
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,750
be that simple?

259
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,700
Anything else?

260
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,650
Look.

261
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,810
Don't keep us guessing. Hurry up.

262
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,610
It's said that

263
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,740
Boss is already living together with Rui Rui's aunt.

264
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,310
And the boss initiated it.

265
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,920
Boss is awesome.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,700
Looks like

267
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,210
I have to learn from Boss.

268
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,300
You don't have to.

269
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,210
Guys, there's more.

270
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,020
I saw the article Jiang Sihan

271
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,290
wrote for boss.

272
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,040
It was so sweet.

273
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,610
Are you envious?

274
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,020
No, I'm not.

275
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,860
I just think it's not simple.

276
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,420
Ning, aren't you envious?

277
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,090
All right, let's eat.

278
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,770
Okay.

279
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,260
You're back.

280
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,690
Godfather, you're back.

281
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,200
Is this my home?

282
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,130
You don't like it?

283
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,060
No, I'm just not used to it.

284
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,380
Godfather, you can't get married like this.

285
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,450
What is this?

286
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,600
Oh this.

287
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,010
This is useful tool for taking care of kids from Zhou Ming.

288
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,190
It seems to be a camera. Should I install it?

289
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,850
Install it.

290
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,180
It's dessert.

291
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,250
It's a leftover from the store

292
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,310
so I brought them back to not waste it.

293
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,070
I'll open it for you.

294
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,070
It's so beautiful.

295
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,260
I haven't seen it in your shop before.

296
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,140
I created this recently.

297
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,510
It's not finished yet.

298
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,360
It tastes so special.

299
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,940
Two cones,

300
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,360
crispy and tasty.

301
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,390
♫Take my hand♫

302
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,240
The taste of popping candy is interesting.

303
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,680
♫I know how cold the world is♫

304
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,790
And there is romantic chocolate.

305
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,900
♫Don't be frightened now♫

306
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,700
It feels like two people who have reunited after a long time,

307
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,460
♫Don't be frightened now♫

308
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,520
♫My precious love♫

309
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,250
who are elated to meet again.

310
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,160
This dessert has no name yet.

311
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:55,170
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,920
Why don't you name it?

313
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,760
How about

314
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,550
♫Please be my one My one and only♫

315
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,720
"Meeting."

♫Let me be the one♫

♫As true♫

319
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,580
Amazing.

320
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,240
Here.

321
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,050
Didn't we agree not to take off our shoes?

322
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,650
Am I different

323
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,000
from what you imagined?

324
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,880
I told you

325
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,420
I'm not as perfect as you think.

326
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,710
After knowing you tonight,

327
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,330
I realized

328
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,340
I like you more.

329
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,160
Beauty,

330
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,070
do you want to dance with me?

331
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,940
Why are you so stubborn?

332
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
I'll take it as a compliment.

333
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,550
Let me tell you.

334
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,620
If you weren't so young,

335
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,050
I would have promised you.

336
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,290
Cheng Yu.

337
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,120
Sometimes,

338
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,560
age is not a problem.

339
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,420
But it is to me.

340
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,800
So it's impossible for us.

341
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,220
Let me ask you one last time.

342
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,420
Do you want to dance with me?

343
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,260
♫I've prepared a gift for you♫

344
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,350
♫Singing a birthday song seriously♫

345
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,680
♫I hope you'll be with me in the future♫

346
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,270
♫With your heart, look at the farthest fireworks♫

347
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,390
♫It's worth the most beautiful passing by♫

348
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,700
♫Regret is the hardest to remember♫

349
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,880
♫Time never promises♫

350
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,340
♫I won't forgive, never remember the passing bys♫

351
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,990

354

356
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,590
Why roses again?

357
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,980
Does Cheng Mu like me?

358
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,910
Jiang Sihan.

359
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,410
What are you thinking?

360
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,720
Dessert is an irreplaceable art.

361
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,150
The ingredients are broken and reorganized.

362
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,550
The strange and destined encounter between them

363
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,460
bring about a wonderful taste.

364
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,270
Just like life.

365
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,760
The encounter between people

366
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,460
is an inexplicable fate.

367
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,490
Through a screen called life,

368
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,900
to filter all impurities

369
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,050
to leave an unbreakable beauty.

370
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,470
Rub off the dirt and shower.

371
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,730
Goodness.

372
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,340
Rui Rui.

373
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,850
Godfather, I'm teaching ducks how to swim.

374
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,860
Or they'll drown.

375
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,800
Rui Rui, stop splashing.

376
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Godfather will be angry.

377
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,420
Zhou Rui.

378
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,780
I lose, I lose.

379
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,770
-Come on. I lose.
-Aunt, Godfather is bullying me.

380
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,290
Rui Rui.

381
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,620
Who told you to splash at me.

382
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,450
Zhou Rui!

383
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,570
Cheng Mu! Zhou Rui!

384
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,200
Aunt, Godfather bullied me.

385
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,430
Rui Rui splashed first.

386
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,580
How old are you?

387
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,610
Why are you still messing with a kid?

388
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,820
Shower quickly

389
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,900
and clean up the bathroom.

390
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,430
I'm taking Rui Rui to sleep.

391
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,810
Godfather will skive.

392
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,470
That makes sense. I'll supervise you.

393
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,530
Are you sure?

394
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,390
Yes.

395
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,010
You are going to supervise me

396
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,950
taking a shower?

397
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,250
Hey!

398
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,220
No.

399
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,690
We're here to supervise you clean the bathroom.

400
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,130
Don't slack off.

401
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
You are going to supervise me

402
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,410
taking a shower.

403
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,000
Calm down.

404
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,080
Sweet is about to open.

405
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,190
Why isn't boss nervous at all?

406
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,630
Boss is having fun in love.

407
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,730
The he's creating new desserts like nothing.

408
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,260
Sweet is nothing.

409
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,190
I think so too.

410
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,910
Yes.

411
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,220
After all, Sweet is a chain dessert shop.

412
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,880
There's a difference between

413
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,650
chain and artisanal stores.

414
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,280
As long as the boss takes action,

415
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,890
we will definitely defeat them.

416
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,810
Don't worry, Bai.

417
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,680
That's true.

418
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,430
By the way, Bai,

419
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,310
when are you getting married?

420
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,650
I need a house to get married.

421
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,840
He's in a hurry to give you red packet.

422
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
Ning, you're right.

423
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,870
OK. Come on.

424
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,220
Give me all your red packets

425
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,350
to me.

426
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,570
It's late. Let's sing a song.

427
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,670
Guess which song it is?

428
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,240
Come on.

444
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,350
Cohabitation agreement?

445
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,860

♫Holding hands The street light suddenly goes out♫

453

all the cleaning in the public area

455
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520

Zhou Mingzhi asked me to take care of Rui Rui.

471
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,780
When I'm not at home,
