You're no match for Sweet.

Sol Dessert is much more important than Sweet.

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,180
A family.

232
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,000
I knew it's not that simple

233
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,980
if they're living under one room.

234
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
I think so too.

235
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,720
I think Boss and Miss Jiang

236
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
must be together.

237
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,130
Boss is doing something big silently.

Have you forgotten? Boss...

239

Forget it.

240
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,670
In that case,

241
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,200
I'll reluctantly tell it to you.

242
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
I think love

243
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,670
is a part of life.

244
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,450
It's inevitable to experience some bitterness and sadness.

245
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
And sweet and sour

246
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,740
is something you'd feel in a relationship.

247

251
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,060
Take Rui Rui home when you're done eating.

252
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,290
No, you're not done yet.

253

I'm done.

254
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,130
Did I offend you?

255
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,220
No.

256
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,160
Then why are you kicking me out?

257
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm not.

258
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,900
Don't you have

259
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,120
anything else to say?

260
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,370

Everyone has a scale in their hearts.

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,880
On the important side,

269
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,900
even the air is sweet.

270
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,960
We can't help but observe

271
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,740
and study every detail.

272

If you find anything wrong,

273
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,770
some emotions will amplify infinitely.

274
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,720
What's left is slight sourness.

275
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,270
It's like an egg and flour mixed with sugar.

276
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,220
Like in a sweet French cake,

277
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,480
where a tinge of sourness from lemon

278
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
upsets you.

279
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,580
But because you like it,

280
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,370
you tolerate it dancing on the tip of your tongue,

281
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,100
and it merges into a unique sweet and sour flavor.

282
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,850

283
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,310

285
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,650
I know you haven't eaten yet.

286

You can do your work anytime.

291
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,360
Or do you want me

292
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,890
carry you onto the car in public?

293
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,460

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,930
Why do you ask?

301
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,200
A producer came to our company

302
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,660
He wants you to try the supporting role.

303
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,740
I just read the project and the script.

304
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,930
I don't think it suits you.

305
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,340
But this

306
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,580
made me think about

307
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,060
whether being an actor

308
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,430
will be better for your future development.

309
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,070
But what's important is

310
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,020
if you like

311
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,360

You still have to think so much about me.

But what's the most important of it all is

315

you eat well and rest well.

I didn't mean to hear it.

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,470
But I won't tell anyone.

344
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,280
The shop is closing soon.

345
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:34,930
Shall we go?

346
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,910
Shut up.

347
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,270
I'm in a bad mood now.

348
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,980
You have to stay with me.

349
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,350
Wait till I feel better.

350
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,650
Try our dessert.

351
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,660
It's delicious.

352
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,720
I don't want to eat.

353
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,960
Let me tell you a joke.

354
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,940
In the past,

355
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,660
there were three heroes,

356
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,150
They are carp, goldfish and grass carp.

357
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,420
They are going to have a martial arts contest.

358
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,740
Who will win?

359
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,730
Carp.

360
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,250
Carp knows how to flap around.

361
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,990
Look.

362
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,570
Not funny?

363
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,950
Let me tell you one more.

364
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,510
I have a dream since I was young.

365
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,560
To wear sunglasses

366
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,360
and drive a Lamborghini.

367
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,470
After my constant efforts,

368
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,650
and hard work,

369
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,490
I was half successful.

370
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,490
I have sunglasses now.

371
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,440
See, you're laughing.

372
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,900
It's still effective.

373
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,030
Let me tell you more.

374
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,700
In the past,

375
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,380
there was a star

376
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,580
in the sky at night.

377
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,740
Sihan is here.

378
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,040
Sorry, I'm late.

379
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,820
Have a seat.

380
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,930
So many dishes.

381
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,430
Is anyone else coming?

382
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,580
-Yes, there is.
-Yes. Class president.

383
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,780
Class president?

384
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,950
He set up this round.

385
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,180
-He asked me to invite you too. -Right.

386
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,940
Class president, you're here.

387
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,980
You're late. You have to drink as a punishment.

388
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,240
Speaking of the devil.

389
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,210
Do you like these dishes?

390
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,220
Why does this sound...

391
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,820
-Something's up.
-Why don’t you ask if we like it?

392
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,260
It's just,

393
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,340
the article you wrote to promote Sweet,

394
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,800
had pretty good response.

395
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,380
But you refused to come out when I invited you.

396
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,310
I have no choice,

397
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,580
but to set this up and invite you.

398
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,500
No, it's nothing,

399
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,960
you don't have to treat me.

400
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,210
Class president, so

401
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,900
we can only come together today thanks to Sihan?

402
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,740
You can't just care about her.

403
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,670
We have so many ex-classmates here.

404
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,380
You should care about us too.

405
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,780
Of course class president cares about everyone.

406
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,580
Let's eat.

407
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,420
Shall we have a toast?

408
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,220
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

409
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,380
Let's drink.

410
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,500
Don't spoil the mood.

411
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,430
We must drink up.

412
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,830
Don't drink.

413
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,830
Sihan, why aren't you drinking?

414
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,490
How about I drink it for Sihan?

415
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,440
Class president,

416
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,490
there's no reason for you to drink in her stead.

417
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:50,860
It's okay.

418
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
-Exactly. -How can you make someone else drink for you.

419
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,280
Sihan, drink it yourself.

420
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,940
I'll drink.

421
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,860
Come on.

422
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,900
Come on. Cheers. Cheers.

423
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,740
Long time no see.

424
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,980
Cheers. Cheers.

425
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,010
Don't drink too much.

426
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,450
Forget it. He said I was thinking too much.

427
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,480
Then why should I listen to him?

428

Sihan.

442
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,260
Si Han, I missed the opportunity a year ago.

443
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,070
I really regret it.

444
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,850
I had decided to study abroad,

445
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,210
I didn't want to hold you up.

446
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,040
So after a year of hard work,

447
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,090
I came back to you.

448
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,300
I hope you can give me a chance

449
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,250
to express myself.

450
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,610
So, Sihan,

451
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,150
do you still like me?

452
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,030
Yes.

453
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,870
I like you.

[Cheng Mu]

456
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,100
Hello, Cheng Mu.

457
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,300
Jiang Sihan is drunk.

458
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,870
I'll give you an address.

459
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,800
Come pick her up.

460
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,630
Are you okay?

461
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,060
Sihan.

462
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,840
Sih\an.

463
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,860
Sihan.

464
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,990
Why did you let her drink so much?

465
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,150
I hope you can take good care of her.

466
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,200
I'll definitely take care of her better than you do.

467
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,330
Let's go home.

468
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,970
You're so willful.

469
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,930
You brought me somewhere so far

470
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,120
without telling me.

471
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,940
The signal here is unstable too.

472
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,420
I've told your colleagues.

473
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,810
They won't disturb you

474
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,140
for this period of time.

475
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,500
You're getting bolder.

476
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,230
How can a boss overwork herself.

477
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,850
Take a good rest for the time being.

478
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:03,970
Cheers.

479
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,740
You drove so long to bring me here

480
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,220
just to

481
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,740
to show me the stars here?

Three, two, one.

483
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,490
Look.

484
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,080
Why is it not falling yet.

485
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,210
What are you doing?

486
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,940
Let me sing you a song.
