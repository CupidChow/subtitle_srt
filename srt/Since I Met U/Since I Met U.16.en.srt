Why do you look so upset?

22
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,530
Shen Menglin,

23
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,110
if you have a problem,

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,940
you can come at me.

Why did you mess with my brother?

Fine, I'll tell you.

27

Cheng Mu is a burden.

If it weren't for him,

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,450
you wouldn't have broken up with me.

30

Shen Menglin, he's my brother,

31

not a burden.

32
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,520
Breaking up with you was my decision.

33
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,840
It had nothing to do with him.

I'm really sorry about what happened a year ago.

42
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,040
I didn't know that

43
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,940
it would be such a huge blow to you.

I really loved you.

But you

47
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,530
made me feel so guilty,

48
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,750
and that has all turned into resentment.

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,630
Don't worry about what's on the internet.

Due to some personal reasons,

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,450
I made the wrong decision

62
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,190

63
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,720

Hello, everyone.

219
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,060
I'm Cheng Mu, the manager of Sol.

220
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,920
I have many identities.

221
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,730
I am

222
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,220
a troublesome younger brother.

223
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:01,880

a troublesome boyfriend.

225
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,590
A troublesome store manager.

226
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,740
And a troublesome friend.

227
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,890
But you guys are

228
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,990
probably watching my livestreams

229
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,650
because of my other identity.

230
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,660
I am a patient of mental illness.

231
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,470
I suffer panic attacks

232
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,130
that are caused by

233
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
a post-traumatic stress disorder.

234
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,360
Because of this disease,

235
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,960
I suffered mild depression,

236
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,200
and had suicidal tendencies.

237
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,650
When I was 13,

238
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,930
I met my teacher.

239
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,160
He had the same symptoms

240
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,200
that I did.

241
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,230
He brought me into the world of desserts,

242
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,750
and introduced me to others like me.

243
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,940
He made me feel that

244
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,420
other than being a patient,

245
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,150
I could have other identities.

246
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,860
We organized an event

247
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,380
because my teacher wanted to help more patients

248
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,290
to provide for themselves

249
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,690
through their own labor.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,180
To enable them to retain some connection

251
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,240
with this society.

252
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,110
To prove that we are valuable.

253
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,160
He taught many patients

254
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,210
how to bake bread,

255
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,700

258

something important.

260
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,780
From now on, our store

261

will begin to recruit

262

263
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,260

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,270
and we will give you a chance to work.

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,080
there is something else I would also like to say.

267
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,240
If you're still willing to come to my store,

268

276
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,580

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,630

279

280
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Now that everything is settled,

281
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,320
you can stop worrying.

282
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,330
Yes.

283
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,660

284
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,830

blooms a sweet and refreshing taste.

297

Just like the infinite hope after rebirth,

and the vivacity after poverty.

299

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,930
to you than I am?

348
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,220
-You don’t need to pay me back. -No.

349
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,700
Take it as a gift.

350
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,380
No.

351
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,390
That's not what I meant.

352
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,580
Jian Yihang,

353
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,060
tell me,

354
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,010
do you like me or not?

355
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,820
When are you coming back?

356
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,840
Next Christmas.

357
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,020
I owe you

358
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,700
72,800 yuan in total.

359
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,690
I'll transfer 5,200 to you every month.

360
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,780
I'll try my best

361
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,040
to pay off all the money

362
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,850
before Christmas next year.

363
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:51,900
When the time comes,

364
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,280
please come back as my girlfriend,

365
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,650
okay?

366
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,420
Jian Yihang.

367
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,780
Say it again.

368
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,420
When the time comes,

369
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,180
please come back as my girlfriend,

370
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,510
okay?

371
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,370
Jian Yihang.

372
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,010
Before I come back,

373
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,270
you're not allowed to flirt with other girls.

374
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,360
I don't have the time.

375
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,100
I need to work.

376
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,340
I don't have time to flirt with other girls.

377
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,860
In the spirit of fairness,

378
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,280
I won't flirt with other boys either.

379
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:21,960
Okay.

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,430
The sea has a magical healing power.

381
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,750
Whenever you see it,

382
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,780
your worries disappear.

383
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,180
What other worries do you have?

384
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,930
Tell me.

385
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,400
My problem now

386
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,470
is that you're too popular.

387
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,930
I should strike first

388
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,730
and make you mine.

389
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,440
Where do you plan to start?

390
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,540
I-

391
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,820
From here？

392
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,990
♫Take my hand♫

393
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,240

394

♫I know how cold the world is♫

395

♫My precious love♫

399
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,300

♫As true♫

416
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,110
Sihan.

417
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,420
Will you

418
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,940
enter into a legally binding relationship with me?

419
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,400
What kind of legally binding relationship?

420
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,570
I mean...

421
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,210
Marry me.

422
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,880
Become a part of my family.

423
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,300
I will.

424
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,160
It's been a year.

425
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,550
Everything has changed.

426
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,300
Only the two of us haven't changed.

427
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,140
Didn't Boss give you a raise?

428
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:07,780
Yes.

429
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,360
Didn't he teach you how to make desserts?

430
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,800
Yes.

431
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,840
Didn't he put us in charge of the new store?

432
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,080
Yes.

433
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,430
You're right.

434
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,900
Contentment is happiness.

435
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,660
Everyone is happy now.

436
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,900
It's good.

437
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,930
Why are you siding with them?

438
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,130
How is this considered taking sides?

439
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,120
You two came to work together again?

440
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,820
How is it going?

441
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,020
The new store is opening soon,

442
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,950
are you nervous?

443
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,630
Impossible.

444
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,620
I have Ning,

445
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,580
I'm not nervous.

446
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,860
Ning will be the boss of the new store.

447
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,240
Stop it.

448
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,780
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,690
-Bai. -Bai.

450
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,830
I will miss our flagship store,

451
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,320
even though

452
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,700
the new store is not bad.

453
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,330
I have to remind you two

454
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,610
to take good care of the new employees.

455
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,390
Boss and Sihan

456
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,800
recruited them through the "Healing Project".

457
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,040
I've already trained them.

458
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,700
From now on,

459
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,750
we're counting on the two of you.

460
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,750
Don't worry, Bai.

461
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,410
Ning and I have got it.

462
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,660
Okay.

463
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,250
Jian Yihang.

464
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,240
It's been an hour.

465
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,480
I miss you already.

466
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,660
Why are you here?

467
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,220
Didn't we agree that

468
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,740
I'll pick you up from Sweet

469
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,560
after work?

470
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,300
You two...

471
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,420
Yes, he's my boyfriend.

472
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,900
I'm his girlfriend.

473
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,740
Congratulations.

474
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,280
Goodness. Another one.

475
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,280
You can go on vacation if you get into a relationship.

476
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,210
All the best.

477
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,050
I will try my best.

478
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,810
Forget it.

479
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,140
Just follow me to the new store

480
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,120
and work hard.

481
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,820
Ning, you're turning into another Bai.

482
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,470
What are you talking about?

483
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,970
You guys are cheery. What are you all talking about?

484
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,180
Boss. Boss.

485
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,060
They're a perfect match.

486
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,780
Boss, good for you.

487
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,190
You even bring Sister-in-law to work now.

488
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,240
Your hair is messy.

489
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,020
Be careful.

490
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,850
Your sister-in-law is not as easygoing as I am.

491
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,500
Cheng Mu,

492
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,940
you've been slacking off lately.

493
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,090
Are you not tending the shop

494
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,130
and earning money to support the family anymore?

495
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,050
Have you lost weight?

496
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,610
Really?

497
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Did I lose weight?

498
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,520
I weighed myself before coming out in the morning,

499
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,790
I'm supposed to have gained weight.

500
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,160
Doesn't that mean I'm supporting the family well?

501
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,820
Auntie, Uncle-in-law!

502
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,150
-Rui Rui. -Rui Rui.

503
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,580
My parents fought again.

504
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,280
They're so immature.

505
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,760
Can I stay with Auntie and Uncle-in-law?

506
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,050
Come here

507
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,500
♫I want to walk every long street with you♫

508
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,630
Rui Rui.

509
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,620
Did you miss me?

510
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,290
Yes.

511
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,310
Let Godfather hug you.

512
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,520
♫Hold hands as the street lights flicker♫

513
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,060
Come on.

514
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,930
♫I can't bear to read the chapters with you in them♫

515
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,760
You've grown taller.

516
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,250
You've gained weight.

517
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,180
♫How I wish I could freeze time♫

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,490
♫The night breeze blows through a sky dotted by starlight♫

♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

528
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,880
