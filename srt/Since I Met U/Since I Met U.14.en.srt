00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
why won't you get together with him?

172
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,300
To me,

173
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,910
nobody is more important than you.

174
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,680
I can break up with him tomorrow.

175
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,990
Yu,

176
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,380
be honest,

177
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,350
have you ever hated me?

178
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,790
No.

179
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,730
But I've hated you.

180
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,030
When I was about eight years old,

181
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,860
you told me you were going to a boarding school.

182
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,790
Do you remember?

183
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,810
And...

184
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,380
I didn't know

185
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
what "boarding school" even meant.

186
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,500
You said,

187
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,130
"I'm going to the boarding school tomorrow."

188
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,010
I said, "Okay."

189
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,420
Thinking about how you were going to a better place,

190
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
I felt very happy.

191
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,070
The next morning when I woke up,

192
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,310
you were gone.

193
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,360
You didn't come home from school in the evening.

194
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,190
You weren't home the next day either.

195
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,120
I was the only one

196
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,630
left in the house.

197
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,020
I hated you back then.

198
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,620
It feels much better to say it out loud. Try it.

199
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,120
I remember everything.

200
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,820
I was also young back then.

201
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,530
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,170
That's why I won't do anything like that

203
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,890
ever again.

204
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,890
I will never abandon you again.

205
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,860
No matter what happens,

206
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,170
I will be with you.

207
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,450
You really never hated me?

208
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,050
I really hate myself.

209
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,620
I hate myself.

210
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,060
Why am I like this?

211
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,340
Why do I need my sister?

212
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,100
The person I care about the most is telling me, crying,

213
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,890
that she will break up

214
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,380
with the person she likes.

215
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,780
Why am I like this?

216
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,150
Don't think about yourself like that.

217
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,050
Tell me the truth.

218
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,380
Do you like Li Jingyang?

219
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,340
Why can't you be with him?

220
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,330
Do you blame me?

221
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,210
I only blame you for

222
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,420
ruining your life for my sake.

223
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,340
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,740
So I beg you.

225
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,930
If you like him,

226
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,460
just be with him.

227
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,600
You can dump him in the future.

228
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,280
Eat.

229
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,200
It's called "Coexist", I made it for you.

230
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,050
Coexist?

231
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,960
Why are you still up?

232
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,300
What's wrong?

233
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,750
♫Take my hand♫

234
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,140

Okay.

248
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,410
Look at him. Isn't he stupid?

249
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,190
Morning. Dad, Mom.

250
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,940
Where did you sleep last night?

251
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,760
No, no.

252
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,500
Let me explain.

253
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,380
Last night,

254
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,730
we didn't do anything.

255
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,890
You mean to say,

256
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,100
yesterday, Cheng Mu fought with his friend,

257
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,470
and quarreled with his sister,

258
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,330
so you slept in that room with him?

259
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,860
No.

260
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,820
We didn't do anything yesterday.

261
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,680
We just slept together.

262
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
- Slept together. -Slept together.

263
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,900
What kind of girl have you become?

264
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,230
Is this how I taught you?

265
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,589
How did I raise you?

266
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,460
Is this how I taught you?

267
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,380
Don't hit my daughter.

268
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,060
I'll teach you a lesson today.

269
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,060
Don't hit my daughter.

270
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,589
How can a girl act like this?

271
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,099
Is this how I raised you?

272
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,869
Don't...

273
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,790
Why am I sleeping here?

274
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,060
Congratulations. You got what you wanted.

275
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,700
Jingyang.

276
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,180
Should I start calling you Brother-in-law?

277
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,980
What?

278
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,780
No way.

279
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,190
Jingyang, have't you seen Yu's Moments?

280
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,100
[He took it. I took it. Selfie.]

281
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,490
Oh no.

282

♫In your moment of glory♫

283
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,070

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
I can't sing anymore. Sorry.

287
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,420
Are you tired?

288
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,510
Let's go home.

289
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,150
We're fine.

290
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,370
We're not saying anything. We're just watching.

291
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,830
Yes, we're just watching.

292
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,700
Hello.

293
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,860
Cheng Mu.

294
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,020
You finally remembered me after a whole day?

295
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,980
Why didn't you wake me up

296
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,340
this morning?

297
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,940
Do you know

298
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,500
how embarrassed I was in front of my parents?

299
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,180
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,800
You can punish me when I get back.

301
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,530
I don't care.

302
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,580
I'm just so embarrassed.

303
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,100
I can't talk right now.

304
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Li Jingyang came to apologize to me.

305
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,890
Okay, I'm telling you, beat him up.

306
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,740
He damaged

307
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,470
my boyfriend's handsome face.

308
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,810
Of course.

309
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,190
Let's talk at home. I'm hanging up.

310
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,180
Okay.

311
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,810
I've been waiting all day.

312
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,460
Just talk to me.

313
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,450
Can't you talk to me?

314
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,820
Just talk to me.

315
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,580
Let's go.

316
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,710
To the beach.

317
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,500
♫Goodbye, friends♫

318
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
Go, go, go.

319
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,880
♫Goodbye, friends♫

320
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,440
Bye.

321
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,470
Don't worry. We'll clean up.

322
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:51,970
No, no, no.

323
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,680
What's wrong with them?

324
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,010
What do you think?

325
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,860
Women.

326
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,210
To the point.

327
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,280
Sorry.

328
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,740
I was drunk yesterday.

329
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,970
I didn't mean what I said. I'm sorry.

330
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,820
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,850
I'm selfish.

332
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,810
You're not sick, I'm the sick one.

333
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,060
You're not angry?

334
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,140
I am.

335
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,250
Don't you know

336
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,450
how hard you hit me yesterday?

337
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,810
Why don't you hit me back then?

338
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Sure.

339
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:41,900
Come on.

340
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,990
That's it?

341
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,010
Coward.

342
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,630
You owe me. You have to thank my sister.

343
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,560
Let me tell you something.

344
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,420
Shoot.

345
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,650
It's serious.

346
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,790
Okay.

347
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,700
Shoot.

348
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,190
Li Jingyang.

349
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,980
I'll leave my sister

350
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,220
in your care.

351
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,960
From now on, don't let her get hurt.

352
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,540
Don't make her sad.

353
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,830
Do you hear me?

354
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,060
Great.

355
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,020
Now that we're good again,

356
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,010
shouldn't someone call me Brother-in-law?

357
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,380
You two will have to get registered first.

358
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,910
Alright.

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,090
As your brother-in-law,

360
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,730
I won't argue with you anymore.

361
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,420
Cheng Mu,

362
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,480
don't worry.

363
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,160
I will treat your sister well.

364
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,500
I know very well

365
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,580
how much money you've saved over the years.

366
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,490
You can't say that.

367
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,760
When you propose to my sister,

368
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,710
don't you dare make any lies of omission.

369
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,380
Let me tell you.

370
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,780
We can't talk about this.

371
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,010
No.

372
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,030
Look at our Han Han.

373
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,330
She's not ladylike at all.

374
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,480
She doesn't fold her clothes,

375
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,900
and she leaves them everywhere.

376
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,710
She's too busy with work.

377
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,870
Jiang, look.

378
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
Look, what is this?

379
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,760
That's private, don't look.

380
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,900
Let me see.

381
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,300
These look like her expenses...

382
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,830
Let me see.

383
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,330
Han Han

384
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,070
always tells us about

385
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,950
how well she's doing.

386
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,320
But look at

387
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,310
how frugal she is.

388
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,120
That's because our daughter is sensible.

389
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Li Jingyang is hilarious.

390
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,100
Stupid and hilarious.

391
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,060
Did you go easy on him

392
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,800
so Yu can teach him a lesson?

393
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,850
Why are you getting smarter?

394
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,980
Smarter?

395
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,690
I've always been smart, okay?

396
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,870
No need. Let me carry it for you.

397
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,970
You have waist problems.

398
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,390
This is too heavy, you shouldn't carry it.

399
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,390
I can do it myself.

400
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,820
You really care about me.

401
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,170
Since when

402
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,210
did Dad and Mom grow old?

403
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,990
We'll all grow old.

404
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,330
I don't want to hide it from them anymore.

405
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,520
Okay, you make the decision.

406
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,950
I'll support you.

407
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,530
Okay.

408
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,390
Let's go.

409
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,300
Come on.

410
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,610
My dear daughter, it's time to eat.

411
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,780
What's wrong?

412
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,290
You've look upset.

413
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,620
Dad, Mom, I have something to tell you.

414
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,820
What's wrong with our precious daughter?

415
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,140
Sit.

416
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,610
Tell me.

417
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,250
I changed jobs.

418
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,930
I still ended up being a blogger.

419
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,290
What I said before

420
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,050
about being an accountant,

421
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,220
those were all lies.

422
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,540
I'm sorry.

423
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,270
I should have told you earlier.

424
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,790
But I was afraid you wouldn't accept it.

425
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,350
I didn't want you to worry.

426
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,640
Jiang Sihan,

427
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,770
you're getting bolder.

428
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,140
I'm sorry, Dad.

429
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,090
My dear daughter.

430
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,690
Don't cry.

431
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,490
Let me tell you,

432
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
actually, your dad and I

433
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,060
already knew about this.

434
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,260
Your dad was just kidding.

435
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,330
Cheng,

436
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,270
tell me the truth.

437
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,180
Is Sihan actually doing another job?

438
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,200
Uncle.

439
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,410
Don't lie to me.

440
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,550
I saw Sihan's account the other day.

441
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,230
Uncle, don't be mad at her.

442
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,370
She didn't mean to hide it from the two of you.

443
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Do you think

444
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,370
I shouldn't stop Sihan

445
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,370
from pursuing her dreams?

446
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,250
Uncle, here's the thing.

447
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,090
Sihan has talked about her work with me.

448
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,580
When she talks about it,

449
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,980
her eyes really light up.

450
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,780
She truly believes she can do this well.

451
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,790
She believes she can influence more people.

452
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,380
This gives her a sense of accomplishment.

453
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,890
Yes.

454
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,230
In life,

455
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,660
one needs to feel fulfilled.

456
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,000
In this matter,

457
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,200
we are quite alike.

458
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,100
When I first started making desserts,

459
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,520
I didn't think too much into it.

460
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,060
I just wanted to find something

461
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,130
I could pour

462
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,540
my time and energy into.

463
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,450
In the end, I truly fell in love with it.

464
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,020
After that,

465
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,500
I turned it into my career.

466
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,850
For ordinary families like ours,

467
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,430
pursuing what we like

468
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,210
is not that easy.

469
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,900
Her sister has always liked drawing,

470
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,480
and she has a gift for it.

471
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,150
But in the end,

472
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,720
she was still defeated by reality.

473
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,710
She's already in her thirties,

474
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,290
but she wants to switch professions and go abroad.

475
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,400
It's not that easy to live abroad.

476
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,690
It's a little tough on Siman,

477
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,500
but she's really happy.

478
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,310
Uncle, look.

479
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,900
On Sihan's account,

480
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,150
there are all these comments left by her fans.

481
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,470
She's really something.

482
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,420
One of my children has already hit a dead end.

483
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,570
As a parent,

484
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,810
how can I bear

485
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,710
to see the same happen to my second child?

486
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,650
Uncle, I'm going to be honest with you.

487
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,510
Don't be angry.

488
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,020
In our era,

489
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
in this city,

490
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,500
we won't starve no matter what our jobs are.

491
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,770
But whatever we do,

492
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,640
there will be difficulties.

493
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,720
I know a lot of people

494
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
who,

495
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,870
to look good in the eyes of others,

496
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,680
or for the sake of material things,

497
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,610
have gone back on what they believed in.

498
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,250
It's not easy for us to

499
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,350
get to do what we know we want to do.

500
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,260
Sihan was finally able to

501
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,720
build up her mental world.

502
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,210
Do you really want her to give it up

503
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,090
for your sakes?

504
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,310
I should have tormented you more.

505
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,350
It's my fault.

506
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,890
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

507
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,510
I shouldn't have lied.

508
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,500
Silly girl.

509
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,330
When have we ever been

510
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,900
unreasonable parents?

511
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,340
You're not angry anymore?

512
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,810
You won't force me

513
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,430
to be an accountant anymore?

514
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,360
No, no, no.

515
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,020
You have to understand where we're coming from too.

516
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,460
This is only the second time we are being parents.

517
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,500
We don't have much experience.

518
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,770
We just want to

519
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,380
to give you the best.

520
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,600
Who knew?

521
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,060
We neglected your feelings.

522
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm sorry, Mom.

523
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,250
I've made you worry.

524
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,560
Daughter,

525
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,810
let me make it clear.

526
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,240
If you fail at being a blogger this time,

527
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,970
you will still have to come back and find a stable job.

528
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,700
Understand?

529
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,020
Mom.

530
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,780
Enough, Jiang. Are you done?

531
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,430
Take it out.

532
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,770
What?

533
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,740
Daughter.

534
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,620
Your dad and I were cleaning up,

535
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,040
and we saw your list of expenses...

536
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,050
You've lost weight.

537
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,620
Daughter,

538
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,780
the other time

539
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,180
we noticed your computer

540
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,120
is really too old.

541
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,740
We thought about it,

542
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,130
and bought you a new one.

543
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,140
Although we can't help you

544
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,770
in other respects,

545
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,420
in terms of necessities,

546
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,350
we can give you as much as you need.

547
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,450
Take it.

548
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,530
Take it.

549
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,130
Thank you, Dad.

550
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,360
Daughter,

551
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,640
I didn't know anything.

552
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,060
Enough, little fool.

553
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,580
All right, stop whining.

554
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,510
Let's eat first.

555
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,900
The food is ready.

556
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,970
Cheng,

557
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,700
I didn't know what you liked to eat,

558
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,460
so we specially

559
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,480
cooked some home-style dishes.

560
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,090
Don't trouble yourself in the future, Auntie.

561
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,620
Just cook what Sihan likes.

562
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,240
She's not important.

563
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,380
Cheng,

564
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,860
From now on, you are the most important.

565
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,110
Mom, am I still your daughter?

566
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,530
Goodness.

567
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,820
Now, it seems like

568
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,430
I really wish you weren't.

569
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,880
If I had a handsome and obedient son

570
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,960
like Cheng instead,

571
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,950
it'd save me so much trouble.

572
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,660
You're right. Eat more.

573
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,840
Your mom and I

574
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,300
have booked tickets for tomorrow.

575
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,790
You're going back so early?

576
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,880
Stay a few more days.

577
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,120
Yes.

578
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,600
It wasn't easy for you to come all the way here.

579
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,000
No.

580
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,570
Your uncle

581
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,360
already misses all the neighbors

582
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,520
who play Go with him.

583
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,240
If you really miss us,

584
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,540
come back and visit us often.

585
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,040
Come back to visit us when you have time.

586
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,650
Mom, I don't want you to go.

587
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,620
Then come back with me.

588
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,930
We will never be apart again.

589
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,090
I'd better go back and visit you more then.

590
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,120
Looks like

591
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,560
we should start preparing her dowry.

592
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,780
- Right. -Dad.

593
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,890
Come on.

594
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,260
Let's have a grand celebration,

595
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,000
and down this cup together, shall we?

596
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,460
May all go well with your work,

597
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,320
and let us all be healthy. Come on.

598
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:45,340
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

599
