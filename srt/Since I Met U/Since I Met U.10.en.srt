♫That has kept my galaxy from falling apart♫

173
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,940
♫I wish I could see you again♫

174
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,900
Let me do it myself.

175
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,440
♫Even if I never see you again♫

176
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,010
♫It's just that they're tired♫

177
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,630
♫Riding in a boat made of the Moon♫

178
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,490
♫Sailing towards another planet♫

179
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,290
♫Walking alone during a vacation♫

180
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,900
♫Through the gaps of time♫

181
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,550
♫Fearless of the passing years and storms♫

182
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,320
Got it!

183
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,090
♫Embarking on this long vacation♫

184
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
What do you think?

185
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,570
Awesome, right?

186
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,660
♫Look at the sky, they're setting the clouds free♫

187
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,040
Let me think. Got it.

188
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
What good ideas could you guys have?

189
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,980
What's next?

190
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,660
Are you tired?

191
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,320
Yes.

192
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,940
Let's go then.

193
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,720
Where are we going?

194
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,470
You'll know when you get there.

195
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,390
Let's go.

196
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:14,940
Okay.

197
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,780
Boxing

198
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,380
is a very interesting sport.

199
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,240
There are many types of boxing.

200
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,050
Rather than a physical exercise,

201
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,560
it's more like a game that challenges your mind.

202
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,490
All your strikes

203
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,150
must be like a whip.

204
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,990
Both your jabs and your crosses

205
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,340
must engage the strength from your feet all the way to your hands.

206
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,620
Got it? Like this.

207
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,170
So, a date is archery, followed by boxing.

208
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,780
It needs you to use your core strength in the footwork,

209
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
to pull off all of its fancy stances.

210
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,560
After the jab,

211
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,650
block your opponent's sight,

212
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,780
and then step aside.

213
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,220
Now that I'm facing the side,

214
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll be able to land a solid punch,

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
and I can also step on you.

216
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,790
I quit.

217
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,660
Should I do something more artistic instead?

218
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,740
♫At the end of the day♫

219
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,850
♫I will come for you, run to you anyway♫

220
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,210
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫

221
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,270
♫When the sky seems so gray♫

222
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,150
♫I am yours to save♫

223
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,930

♫I am yours to save, always♫

225
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,170
there was such a side to him.

226
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:33,380
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

227
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:41,770

228

229
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,070

230

231
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,340
Thank you.

232
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,240
I've heard the steak here is delicious.

233
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,190
Do you want anything else?

234
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,000
No, no. These are enough.

235
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,050
Sihan,

236
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,100
actually, I-

237
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,830
Are you afraid of the dark?

238
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,330
My apologies.

239
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,480
There was a bit of a problem in the store,

240
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,810
so we had a power outage.

241
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,150
Our sincere apologies

242
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,910
for the inconvenience caused.

243
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,770
Cheng Mu.

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,380
I'm very happy today.

245
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,760
If you have anything to say,

246
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,630
just say it.

247
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,420
Sihan,

248
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm really happy

249
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,440
when I'm with you.

250
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,340
I hope you can get to know me better,

251
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,080
and see the other sides of me.

252
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,460
That's all?

253
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,260
No.

254
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,300
I- I have many other skills

255
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,100
that I haven't gotten a chance to show you.

256
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,700
We can go together next time.

257
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,260
Sure.

258
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,130
Sure.

259
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,390
It's getting late.

260
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,250
Let's go pick up Rui Rui.

261
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,390
Okay.

262
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,600
Hello, Mum.

263
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,030
Han Han, have you gotten off work?

264
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,920
Yes.

265
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm on my way home.

266
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,730
Work?

267
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,650
Work is going well.

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,810
There aren't any problems.

269
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,280
I won't make mistakes at work.

270
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,580
Even so, I'm worried.

271
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,220
Check your work a few more times after you finish it, okay?

272
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,990
Okay, I got it.

273
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,540
Your parents don't know what job you're doing?

274
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,960
I didn't dare to tell them.

275
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,340
My job isn't a real job

276
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,690
in their eyes.

277
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,320
How long are you intending to keep it from them for?

278
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,150
If I tell them now,

279
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,440
they will definitely force me to go back.

280
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,500
Then why did you

281
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,730
want to become a food blogger?

282
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,730
Because I like it.

283
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,579
You like it?

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,480
At first,

285
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,540
I simply liked it.

286
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,160
Only later, I found that

287
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,920
my words have healed many people.

288
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,280
Afterwards,

289
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,900
that simple sense of liking

290
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,470
became a little sense of responsibility.

291
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,290
I want to use words

292
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,700
to heal and encourage even more people.

293
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,670
Let me show you.

294
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:40,920
Look.

295
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,510
They sent me this.

296
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,260
These are their stories.

297
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,230
Isn't it meaningful?

298
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,640
Well...

299
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,780
Rui Rui is waiting for us.

300
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,120
Why don't we go back?

301
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,240
Okay.

302
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,680
Okay.

303
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,560
Rui Rui is finally asleep.

304
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Rui Rui is leaving in two days.

305
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,890
I can't bear it.

306
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,700
Me neither.

307
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,560
My sister is so lucky,

308
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,030
to have such a cute kid.

309
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,610
Your family has good genes.

310
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,290
The two of them

311
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,740
are so unreliable.

312
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,310
They indeed come from one family.

313
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,850
I know Zhou Ming

314
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,770
very well.

315
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,240
Although he doesn't say it,

316
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,730
he knows what he has to do.

317
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,540
He has always relied on his own effort

318
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,870
to give their little family a better life.

319
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,820
Don't worry.

320
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,220
He will prove himself to your sister, through his actions.

321
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,010
How would others know

322
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,220
if he doesn't say so?

323
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,160
There are some things you can't keep to yourself.

324
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,810
If you don't say it,

325
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,730
no one will ever know.

326
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,320
[Confession]

327
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,030
Jingyang, take a look.

328
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,500
It really hurts, Jingyang.

329
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,100
-Y- You should do it yourself -Come on. Help me.

330
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,220
No, I've been waiting for a long time,

331
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,420
and one could help me.

332
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,180
Please.

333
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
Blow on it for me.

334
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,100
-It really hurts. -Okay.

335
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,840
Where is it?

336
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,370
Here.

337
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,190
Thank you. My eyes feel much better now.

338
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,900
If there's nothing else, I'll get going first.

339
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,210
Jingyang, we've been working together for so long,

340
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,780
but we haven't had a meal together.

341
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,140
Let's have dinner together,

342
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,400
after tonight's event ends?

343
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,870
No, I have plans.

344
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,960
Jingyang, I haven't responded to your feelings for me,

345
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,330
even after so long.

346
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,320
It's my fault.

347
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,830
No.

348
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,880
When did I ever have feelings for you?

349
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,880
You weren't like this before.

350
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,710
You used to be so gentle and considerate to me,

351
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,370
you even said you liked me.

352
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,340
Tao Manman, are you serious?

353
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,010
When did I say that I liked you,

354
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,680
or that I wanted to pursue you?

355
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,390
How could you say that?

356
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,430
The woman I like-

357
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,210
The woman I like

358
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,280
is considerate, gentle, cute,

359
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,800
and ambitious.

360
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,270
In all of my life,

361
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,260
there will only be one person in my heart,

362
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,940
and not one more.

363
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,980
You're lying.

364
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,220
You definitely don't have a girlfriend.

365
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,960
If you did,

366
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,200
why has she never come to visit you?

367
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,420
And you have never posted about her on Moments.

368
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,000
Jingyang, even if you like someone else,

369
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,880
we can still be together.

370
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,780
Li Jingyang,

371
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,560
I've recorded everything

372
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,140
that happened just now.

373
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,830
If you don't get together with me,

374
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,830
I'll post it online immediately.

375
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,450
I'll say that

376
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,090
you are a scumbag who bullied me.

377
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,910
I'd like to see

378
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,850
how a popular star like you

379
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,480
will advance your career then.

380
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,610
Tao Manman, what do you want?

381
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,140
This is not what you think it is.

382
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,000
L- Listen to me.

383
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,110
You go out first.

384
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,240
Yu, I...

385
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,900
I...

386
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,860
Good idea.

387
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,340
Your execution's a little inexperienced, though.

388
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,140
As it happens,

389
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,040
I've also made a recording.

390
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,530
I can post it anytime too.

391
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,020
I'd also like to see

392
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,040
how a popular female model

393
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,020
will advance her career when that happens.

394
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,620
Yu.

395
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,430
Yu, I was wrong.

396
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,750
I beg of you,

397
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,380
please don't post it.

398
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,090
I swear

399
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,170
I will never appear in front of the two of you again.

400
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,100
I'll delete the video right now.

401
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,180
OK.

402
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,280
Please, Yu.

403
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,970
You can leave now.

404
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,130
Thank you, Yu.

405
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,020
Why are you looking at me like that?

406
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,340
My girlfriend was awesome just now.

407
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,530
You still have the cheek to say that.

408
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,460
Has Tao Manman bullied you before?

409
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,880
Are you stupid?

410
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,060
Don't you know how to retaliate?

411
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,000
It's not like I gave in to her on set.

412
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,630
Besides, it's not gentlemanly to fight with a woman.

413
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,490
Don't be angry.

414
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,100
I didn't know

415
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,300
you were so compassionate.

416
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,360
I was wrong.

417
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,140
Punish me.

418
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,360
You can punish me however you want.

419
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,700
Fine.

420
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,060
I'd need to think carefully about

421
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,900
how I will punish you.

422
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,380
Then, make the penalty

423
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,810
to not be able to leave you in this lifetime.

424
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's go home.

425
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,170
Give it to me.

426
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,810
The small hiccup between Cheng Mu and Taro

427
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,470
won't affect his confession.

428
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,790
Why are you so vexed?

429
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,570
What do you mean by "small hiccup"?

430
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,870
It's not small.

431
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,240
It's a big deal.

432
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,170
I'm just wondering,

433
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,970
is everyone in the Cheng family

434
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,440
so cautious about giving people a title?

435
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,840
Do you think everyone is like you?

436
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,020
This is the discipline of the Cheng family.

437
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
We don't give people titles easily.

438
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,720
If you want a title,

439
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,580
you'll have to watch my mood.

440
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,170
Godfather, how was your date yesterday?

441
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,370
Will I have to call you something different in the future?

442
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,980
No way.

443
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,510
I'm leaving soon. You haven't settled it yet?

444
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,430
Rui Rui,

445
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,910
Confessing is a serious thing.

446
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,940
You can't bring someone out on a date,

447
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,250
and confess just like that.

448
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,920
Besides,

449
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
if your Auntie

450
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,420
gets confessed to so casually,

451
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,020
she won't be happy either, right?

452
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,940
So you think that

453
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,740
Auntie hasn't been outside in a day

454
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,020
because she's happy?

455
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,870
Right, she hasn't been out in a day.

456
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,750
Forget it. I'll do it myself.

457
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,820
Auntie, I'm leaving soon.

458
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,070
I haven't gone out with you yet.

459
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,730
I want to go out. Bring me out.

460
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,180
Rui Rui, don't disturb your Auntie.

461
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,840
She's busy with her work.

462
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,150
It shouldn't be like this.

463
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,930
I've shown off so many skills.

464
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,310
Am I boring?

465
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,440
