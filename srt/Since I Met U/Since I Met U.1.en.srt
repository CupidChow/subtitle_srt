My sister doesn't like you.

346
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,700
You don't understand my charm.

347
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,960
I don't know if I can see

348
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,080
you be in a relationship in my life.

349
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,730
Thousand years old turtle.

350
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,300
You can see anything if you live long.

351
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,630
You're leaving so soon?

352
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,690
The dessert is still the same.

353
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,560
After you finish,

354
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,820
give me some comments.

355
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,190
I'm leaving.

Remember to ask your sister out for me.

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,360
By the way,

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,820
my phone is out of battery.

360
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,600
Do you have a charger in your car?

361
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
I have to monitor your sister.

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,570
My phone can't be out of battery.

363
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,450
Take it yourself.

364

The production date accurate to the time.

Yeah.

Right, Ning?

376
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,940
Yes.

377
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,090
Ning, you're spoiling him.

378
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,180
Sorry, we're taking a rest.

379

We meet again, Mr. Cheng.

380

Come here.

381
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,900
Another woman

382
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,630
who dares to approach our boss.

383
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
How long do you think she can hold on?

384
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,300
Three days.

385
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,420
I think at least five days.

386
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,200
Ning, what do you think?

387
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,260
Boring.

388
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,670

400
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,260
First question,

401
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,590
what kind of inspiration

402
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,010
allowed you to make this dessert?

403
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,460
It's a secret.

404
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
It's okay. Second question.

405
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,310
The second question.

406
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,190
Does desserts have any

407
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,340
special meaning to you?

408
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,340
No.

409
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Here's the thing.

410
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,900
If you are angry

411
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,120
because of the evaluation,

412
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,470
I can apologize to you.

413
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,200
It's my fault to stalk you.

414
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,180
But this publicity interview

415
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,900

A story with rose scent.

440
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,180
One year ago,

441
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,900
at the rut of my life,

442
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,830
I met a girl with a rose.

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,300
She drank a lot and was sad.

She wants to confess to the person she loves.

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,740
She got the wrong person.

447
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,040
She said a lot of brave words to me

448

But

453
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,920
why does this story sound so familiar?

454
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Rose.

455
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,470
Sounds similar to my confession.

456
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,780
But the sweeter it is for others,

457
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,150
the more bitter it is for me.

No.

It's okay. I have Plan B.

486
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,220
Well,

487
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,120
I can go to the place

488

where this girl confessed at,

489
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,940

happen?

I know Qingshan Fishing Village.

500
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,620
I went there on my graduation trip.

No.

I'm sorry.

Nope.

512
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,460
You need to book the peak season in advance.

513
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,660
This is common sense.

514
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,420
Why are you here?

515
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,620

Sir, please register your ID card.

517
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,790
How about giving my room to the lady?

518
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,550
Are you sure?

519
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,980
What about you?

520
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,560
Mind your own business.

521
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,440
Okay.

522
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,610

You're welcome.

524
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,360
Thank you.

525
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,050
What are you going to do tonight?

526
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,040
What else can I do?

527
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,500
Just find another hostel.

528
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,130
Give me your phone.

529
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,150

532
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,850
Wait.

533
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,770
Where is the exact location

534
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,200
in your story?

535
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
I want to check it out.

536
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,160
The reef in the west of the village.

537
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,300
See you in two hours.

538
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,940
Why does this place feel so familiar?

539
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,670
Cheng Mu,

540
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,860
Have you found a place to stay?

541
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,930
♫Take my hand♫

542
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,220
♫I know how cold the world is♫

543
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,850
They're all full.

544
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,230
I'll just stay in the car for one night.

545
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,440
♫Don't be frightened now♫

Do you know?

560
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,970
In the five senses,

561
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,070
the closest to our memory is the sense of smell.

562
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,560
♫I am yours to save♫

563
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,650

will become fresh.

568
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,350
Does it smell good?

569
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,580
The flowers smell good.

570
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,890
