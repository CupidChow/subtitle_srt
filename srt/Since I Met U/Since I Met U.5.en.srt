I wasn't looking to date.

175
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,410
But now,

176
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
I have.

177
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,020
Sihan,

178
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,610
I volunteered to come back.

179
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,140
I've been waiting for a year

180
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,380
to say-

181
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,820
President, what's past is past,

182
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,020
so let's not talk about it anymore.

183
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,020
Well, congratulations.

184
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,630
You've become the regional manager for Sweet.

185
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,390
That's awesome!

186
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,940
You're great too.

187
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,870
I'm glad to have met you,

188
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,260
let's get together more often.

189
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,040
Sure.

190
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,020
Getting over jet lag is such a chore,

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,690
I'm going to be late!

192
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,340
Are you blind?

193
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,300
Sorry.

194
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,680
There's a shop called Sol at the corner of the street.

195
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm the manager there.

196
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
Go find a man named Bai Bin,

197
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,410
and ask him to compensate you.

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,970
Wait.

199
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,740
I don't even know what Sol is,

200
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,850
what if you're lying to me?

201
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,140
What do you want?

202
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,140
Phone.

203
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,010
There are all sorts of people here.

204
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,060
To think there's someone more handsome than my brother.

205
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,660
Are these all your new products?

206
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,760
Yes, they are delicious,

207
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,280
try them.

208
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,430
Have some water.

209
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,540
Oh no.

210
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,340
Now that he's caught me in the act,

211
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,020
there's no explaining myself anymore.

212
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,460
Why are you here?

213
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,180
Can't I come?

214
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,910
Brother.

215
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,760
You know each other?

216
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,400
Are you a kid? Why are you so flustered?

217
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,700
Let me introduce you to each other.

218
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,040
This was the class president at my university.

219
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,140
We just met today,

220
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,410
so don't get me wrong.

221
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,620
I've heard a lot about you.

222
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,900
Class President, huh.

223
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,260
Regional manager of Sweet, Han Muzhou,

224
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,780
Mr. Han.

225
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,350
Hey, president,

226
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,650
we have something on today,

227
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,370
so we have to go now.

228
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,740
Let's keep in touch.

229
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,430
No hurry.

230
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,770
Hello, Mr. Han.

231
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,640
I'm Cheng Mu, the manager at Sol, next door.

232
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,720
I came today

233
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,450
because I wanted to discuss

234
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,200
the problem with your store's dessert

235
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,190
with copying and pasting.

236
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,400
Copying and pasting?

237
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,980
What are you talking about?

238
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,220
You're must be in a hurry to go back,

239
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,380
to cook for Rui Rui, right?

240
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,780
Rui Rui is my son.

241
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,600
Son?

242
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,060
Are you married?

243
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,580
No.

244
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,400
No, how is that possible?

245
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,560
-Well -The child's hungry.

246
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,130
He's not...

247
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,700
President, I-

248
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,340
I'll explain it to you next time.

249
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,900
The two of them...

250
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,180
I don't think so.

251
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,360
Good.

252
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,740
Otherwise, it will affect my enthusiasm

253
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,220
for shipping them.

254
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,510
You and your shipping, again?

255
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,020
You don't understand.

256
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm doing this for the hearts

257
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,830
of all the lonely girls out there.

258
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
Do whatever you want,

259
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,230
just don't make trouble for me.

260
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,060
Cheng Mu,

261
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,460
Is this interesting to you?

262
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,180
It's more interesting than

263
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:07,820
copying someone else's design, right?

264
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,630
No.

265
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,090
There are times when ideas happen to coincide,

266
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,780
how do you know he...

267
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,860
What if it's a coincidence?

268
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,430
Okay, I admit.

269
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,500
In this world,

270
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,940
unexpected coincidences do happen.

271
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,380
But Bai Bin has looked into this.

272
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,810
A side account once

273
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,340
sent an email to Sweet,

274
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,840
with our recipe attached.

275
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,930
I don't have a side account, okay?

276
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,250
I didn't say it was you.

277
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,910
Then why did you tell everyone

278
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,110
you didn't believe me?

279
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,340
When did I say I didn't believe you?

280
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,500
You did.

281
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,710
Anyway,

282
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,740
I was in such a hurry

283
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,820
to get the notebook to you.

284
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,900
But you still suspected me?

285
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,060
I felt so angry and wronged.

286
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,820
Also, until now,

287
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,790
I have no intention of forgiving you.

288
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,220
If there's nothing else,

289
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,120
I'll get going.

290
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,460
How is Rui Rui lately?

291
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,250
He's not been well.

292
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,010
Why don't you come back and see him?

293
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,080
Okay.

294
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,680
Auntie, you're finally back!

295
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,340
I've missed you so much.

296
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I miss you too.

297
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,220
Let me take a look at you.

298
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,660
Good boy.

299
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Rui Rui got better

300
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,130
all because he saw you.

301
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,340
Tonight, Godfather and Auntie

302
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,870
can read stories together to me again.

303
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,400
Rui Rui, I'm busy these days,

304
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,450
so I can't go to Godfather's house.

305
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,780
Aunt, are you going to abandon Rui Rui?

306
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,190
Of course not.

307
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,340
How could I abandon Rui Rui?

308
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,770
How about...

309
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,860
you come stay with me for a few days,

310
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,350
is that okay?

311
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:12,860
No.

312
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,300
I want to stay at Godfather's.

313
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,050
Well, okay.

314
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,020
Be good at Godfather's house.

315
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,340
Once I'm free,

316
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,670
I'll come see you.

317
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,420
Okay?

318
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,530
Okay, pinky swear.

319
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,800
No take backs.

320
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,130
I'm leaving.

321
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,700
Okay.

322
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,860
I'll get going.

323
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay.

324
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Auntie, Godfather has something to tell you.

325
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,370
Be careful on your way back.

326
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,370
♫We're at the end of this season again♫

327
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,020
Okay.

328
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,300
♫My heart fluctuates between warmth and cold♫

329
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,480
♫My old sweater no longer fits♫

330
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,560
♫Why doesn't last year's wind blow here anymore♫

331
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,400
♫Those cold memories tug at me♫

332
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,579
♫Only a whisper of warmth is left in my palm♫

333
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,990
Shall we play something else?

334
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,700
Let's call it a day,

335
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,860
I have an appointment later.

336
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,830
Actually, I...

337
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,600
Li Yunyang.

338
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,900
I agreed to go out with you,

339
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,100
on account of work.

340
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,060
From now on,

341
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,060
you're still just my younger brother's best friend.

342
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,780
My stomach hurts.

343
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,060
What's wrong?

344
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,270
I have a stomachache, and my head is dizzy too.

345

514
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,980
if he had to choose

515
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,020
between me and Zhou Ming,

516
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,020
who would he want to live with?

517
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,200
How can I

518
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,150
ask such a question?

519
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,630
It's too cruel.

520
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,580
When adults fight,

521
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,100
it's always the children who get hurt.

522
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,950
Why didn't you switch off the lights?

523
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,280
Mu Mu is still young,

524
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,550
can't you hang in there another year?

525
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,330
I'm begging you, just one year.

526
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,140
He's a burden.

527
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,920
No, I'm the burden.

528
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,180
You're not a burden. You're my wife.

529
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,830
You're Mu Mu and Yu Yu's mother,

530
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,060
they need you.

531
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,750
I'm a burden.

532
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,180
I am that burden.

533
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,780
I am that burden!

534
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,160
Let me die! Let me die!

535
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,750
What's wrong?

536
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,060
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

537
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,340
I don't switch off the lights when I sleep.

538
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,140
I'm sorry.

539
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,550
I was just passing by,

540
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,880
and saw that the lights were on,

541
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,820
so I switched them off.

542
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:35,280
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

543
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,910
♫Don't be frightened now, don't be frightened now♫

544
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,390
♫My precious love♫

545
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,610
♫Come to me, when you have run your miles♫

546
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,640
♫For the thousandth time, you are perfect♫

547
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,150
♫Just as you are♫

548
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:04,450
♫At the end of the day, I will come to you♫

549
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,350
♫Run to you anyway, when the sky seems so gray♫

550
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,650
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫

551
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,900

♫I will run to you however slowly♫

♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

554
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:45,690
