I knew it.

92

Not only do they look the same,

93

but they also have similar tastes.

94

But after I tasted it carefully,

95
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,340
I knew it's different from the one made by Cheng Mu.

96
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,780
But ordinary customers

97
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,580
can hardly tell the difference.

98
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
I've already told the headquarters

99
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,430
about the plagiarism problem Cheng Mu told me.

100
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,540
They said the dessert was purchased by the company.

101
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,870
So there's no possibility of plagiarism.

102
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,990
Could there be a misunderstanding?

103
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,380
Impossible.

Something is wrong.

131
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,580
What's wrong?

132
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,940
I think so too.

133
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,780
Our boss has never added acidity to his desserts.

134
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,580

135
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,220

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,550

137
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,220
There's something stranger.

138
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,840

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,700
She's been staring at the kitchen for the whole morning.

142
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,660
and furtive.

143
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,930
She's from Sweet.

144
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,730
Her brother is Han Muzhou, the person in charge of Sweet.

145
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,390
No wonder.

146
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,670
Is she trying to steal our ideas again?

147
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,420

148
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,020
No.

149
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,720

150
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,930
Don't underestimate me.

Yes.

159
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,710
I'll fulfil the task.

163
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,340
This is called Encounter.

164

165
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,020
it's very soft.

166

What's your boss's hobby?

167
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,100

169

Can you tell him

170
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,090
I want to make friends with him?

171
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,780
No problem.

172
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,460
As long as our boss takes action,

173
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,790
he will definitely win.

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,500
I'll just take some photos.

175
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,380
I won't do anything else.

176
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,659
We are both dessert shops.

177
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,919
My boss hopes that we can compete fairly.

178
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,980
Are you sure

179
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,510
no one has read the notebook

180
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,390
except you and Cheng Mu?

181
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,620
I'm sure.

182
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,770
I was holding the notebook,

183
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,830
then I gave it to...

184
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,060
To whom?

185
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Just give it to me.

186
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,680
Thank you.

187
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,290
Rui Rui!

188
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,670
Rui Rui!

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,490
Rui Rui.

190
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,340
You finally remembered to call me.

191
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,420
Hello, what's up? I'm busy.

192
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,260
Where are you?

193
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,680
You're tough.

194
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,380
You didn't cry at all.

195
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,970
This is a reward for a good kid.

196
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,460
Thank you, Uncle.

197
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,800
Although you hurt me when you patched me up,

198
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,170
I'll forgive you

199
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,660
for the sake of this candy.

200
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,990
Thank you, doctor.

201
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,150
You're welcome.

202
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,010
In the future,

203
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,410
when you take the kid out,

204
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,580
you must be careful.

205
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,250
We will.

206
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,700
We will.

207
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,670
Let me see.

208
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,380
Doctor, is he okay?

209
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,130
He's fine.

210
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,690
I've told the details

211
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,450
to his parents.

212
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,020
You can talk outside.

213
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,020
Next one.

214
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,220
Godfather, it doesn't hurt anymore.

215
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,970
His parents?

216
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,300
No.

217
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,150
Rui Rui, come with me. Be good.

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,420
No. Listen to me.

219
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,430
It's a misunderstanding.

220
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,150
Sihan, let's meet another day.

221
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,260
I'm sorry for today.

222
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,060
I didn't take good care of Rui Rui.

223
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,150
It's okay, Muzhou.

224
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,310
It's not your fault.

225
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,560
I didn't take good care of Rui Rui.

226
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,690
I'll write the article for you.

227
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,420
I'm leaving.

228
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,650
Take care.

229
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,160
See you, Uncle Han.

230
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,310
Okay.

231
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,480
Take the front passenger seat.

232
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,860
Mr. Shen.

233
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,850
I haven't had time to congratulate you

234
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,480
on getting promoted to the second-in-command.

235
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,390
There's no need

236
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,810
to be so polite with me.

237
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,440
Sit.

238
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,010
Nice environment.

239
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,180
Mr. Shen.

240
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,500
This is the information about our company's artists.

241
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,040
I've signed the business and agency contracts with them.

242
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,700
Have a look.

243
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
Are you this cold to your ex-boyfriend?

244
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,940
I just sat down,

245
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,310
and you started to talk about work.

246
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,230
How about this?

247
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,180
Let's have dinner together tonight.

248
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,320
Take it as a compensation for me,

249
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,880
who was abandoned by you.

250
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,900
Do you think

251
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,220
the long-term endorsement contract

252
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,010
I have in my hands

253
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,240
is not worth a meal?

254
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,150
You should know

255
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,970
what it means to sign it.

256
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,370
It equals

257
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,100
your company's business volume in a year.

258
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,300
Mr. Shen, that's not what I meant.

259
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,610
I just think

260
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
we don't need to

261
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,690
talk about the past.

262
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,500
After all these years,

263
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,210
you still

264
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,550
put your brother first.

265
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,900
You can choose to break up with your boyfriend

266
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,750
as long as your brother doesn't like him.

267
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,210
I don't understand. It's been so many years.

268
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,060
Does your brother know it?

269
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,080
I don't need him to know it.

270
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,830
This is what I should do as a sister.

271
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,610
Is your brother more important

272
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,820
than your lifelong happiness?

273
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,330
Yes. If he's not happy,

274
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,320
I won't leave him alone.

275
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,370
You are still the Cheng Yu I know.

276
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,130
I can trust you.

277
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,360
Take a look.

278
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,390
As for the contract,

279
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,420
I still need to discuss the details with you.

280
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,300
How about this?

281
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,700
Let's have a cup of coffee

282
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,340
and talk.

283
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,090
Please.

284
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,030
What's wrong with you?

285
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,660
What's wrong with me?

286
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,420
You don't look natural.

287
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,760
I don't look natural?

288
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,660
You are strange.

289
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,590
Both of you are strange.

290
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,820
Rui Rui, does it still hurt?

291
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,120
You're good.

292
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,860
You're not like her,

293
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,940
who didn't keep her promise.

294
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
What do you mean?

295
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,610
The Cohabitation Agreement.

296
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,670
Didn't I tell you?

297
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,810
I said I had an appointment with him.

298
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,780
Where did you go?

299
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,620
The park.

300
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,860
After that,

301
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,460
would you have a meal together?

302
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,660
After the meal, would you find a place

303
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,810
to have a drink, talk about the old days,

304
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,040
and reconnect?

305
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,550
I don't want to talk to you.

306
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,550
Ms. Cheng, you're really busy.

307
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,370
Since we sat down,

308
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,270
you've kept receiving messages.

309
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,810
You admirer?

310
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,250
Spam messages.

311
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,420
I wonder

312
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,030
if you're interested in

313
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,990
the artists of our company?

314
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,870
Whether I'm interested or not

315
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,560
doesn't matter.

316
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,340
You know,

317
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,090
after all these years,

318
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,720
I...

319
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,350
After all these years,

320
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,380
do you still like coffee?

321
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,540
Try this.

322
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,240
See if it suits your taste.

323
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,590
Cheers.

324
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,970
Stop pretending.

325
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,220
The story

326
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,460
about Miss Moon's previous life and current life

327
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,460
written by Taro, Jiang Sihan,

328
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,310
is about you two, right?

329
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,780
And the rose crystal ball

330
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,700
in your room.

331
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,390
The one you don't let me touch.

332
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,330
And

333
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,780
Miss Moon and the rose flavor

334
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,570
are all related to Jiang Sihan, right?

335
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,330
You're so affectionate.

336
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,730
You love her so much.

337
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,410
Your godson, Rui Rui, fell over today.

338
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,500
Jiang Sihan sent Rui Rui to the hospital with her class president.

339
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,860
Look.

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,530
Taro's crush is back.

341
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,500
They may get back at any time.

342
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,360
You haven't done anything yet. You're being overly relaxed.

343
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,460
No, bro.

344
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,490
You really have to do something.

345
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,630
I must help you.

346
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
No one can stop me.

347
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,020
Cheng Yu

348
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,260
is my one true love.

349
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,690
But I, Li Jingyang,

350
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,710
have been chasing after her

351
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,670
for so many years.

352
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,040
I'm better at pursuing girls

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,359
than you,

354
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,500
right?

355
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,780
We're almost the same.

356
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,079
You two are living together.

357
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,700
But you haven't done anything yet.

358
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,290
Bro, let me ask you one thing.

359
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,230
Did you kiss?

360
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
No way. You really kissed?

361
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,450
When?

362
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,220
A year ago.

363
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,010
A year ago?

364
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,890
You kissed a girl a year ago.

365
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,030
A year ago.

366
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,290
Now the girl went to the hospital with her class president.

367
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,190
We haven't finished drinking.

368
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,740
Where are you going?

369
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,800
I'm going to sleep.

370
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,890
You deserve to be single forever.

371
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,220
Cheng Mu, Jiang Sihan.

372
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,370
Cheng Yu, Li Jingyang.

373
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,970
Perfect.

374
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,470
You're back.

375
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,900
Where's Rui Rui?

376
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,050
He's asleep.

377
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,140
Did you drink?

378
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,830
A little.

379
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,010
♫Take my hand♫

380
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,300

My real first kiss is gone.

400
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,000
He is drunk,

401
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,190
but I am sober.

402
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,670

403

405
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:37,010
[Cheng Yu recalled a message]

406
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,100
Yesterday,

407
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,860
we...

408
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,700
Yesterday...

409
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,380
I was drunk yesterday.

410
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,310
Drunk?

411
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,140
Come to think of it,

412
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,150
I gave the notebook to Bai Bin.

413
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,310
You can ask him.

414
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,670
Okay.

415
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,870
