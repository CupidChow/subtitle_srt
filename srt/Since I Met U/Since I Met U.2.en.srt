who stayed in his car

because he didn't reserve a room.

he suffocated

68

Are you interested?

173
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,660
Yu,

174
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,790
You know

175
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,220
I don't take brand deals.

176
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,460
We need to focus on making food content.

177
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,400
Don't reject it so fast.

178
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,720
If this deal goes well,

179
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,040
the company will support you fully

180
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
in your food content.

181
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,250
And the money

182
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,430
is definitely better than

183
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,830
what you're getting now.

184
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,300
Yu,

185
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,100
I've got an idea for the script.

186
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,490
We can make

187
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,580
a "Black Angel and White Angel" series.

188
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,340
Don't worry.

189
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,860
Leave it to me.

190
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,680
Okay, go ahead.

191
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,030
Okay.

192
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,700
Hello?

193
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,460
Hello, this is the Airport Support Center.

194
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:42,940
What?

195
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,540
What?

196
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,530
I'll be right there.

197
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,770
[Airport Support Staff]

198
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,880
-Rui Rui. -Rui Rui!

199
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,210
-Why are you here? -Why are you here?

200
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,870
Godfather.

201
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,710
Auntie.

202
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,290
-Godfather. -Auntie.

203
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,180
Rui Rui, do you miss me?

204
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,820
Yes.

205
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,290
I bought you a lot of delicious food.

206
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,470
Come home with me, okay?

207
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,150
No.

208
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,660
I have some delicious food here.

209
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,380
Zhou Ming asked me to take care of him.

210
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,910
He came to my shop to find me.

211
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,210
My brother-in-law?

212
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,420
Your sister is Jiang Siman?

213
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,500
I'll make a call to confirm.

214
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,800
Auntie, don't call them.

215
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,640
My parents don't want me to know

216
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,630
they're getting a divorce.

217
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,740
Who is going to sign the handover document?

218
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,890
I won't bother you with Rui Rui anymore.

219
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,170
I'll watch him myself.

220
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,610
Rui Rui, come home with me, okay?

221
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm a boy.

222
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,150
I can't live with girls.

223
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,120
No, that's not true.

224
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,440
I bought a lot of delicious food for Rui Rui.

225
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,060
Let's go to my house, okay?

226
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,550
No.

227
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,730
Let Rui Rui stay here.

228
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,100
No, it's too troublesome.

229
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,420
Not at all.

230
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,100
Rui Rui is my godson.

231
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm Rui Rui's godfather.

232
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,850
Am I right?

233
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,820
If you're worried,

234
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,850
you can stay with Rui Rui at Godfather's house.

235
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,220
No.

236
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,420
I can't live with Godfather.

237
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,270
Auntie hates Rui Rui?

238
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,790
Of course not.

239
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,190
Rui Rui is my favorite.

240
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,810
Godfather is a boy.

241
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,480
I can't live with a boy.

242
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,760
I promise

243
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,540
I will visit you often, okay?

244
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,260
Promise.

245
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,710
Okay. It's a deal.

246
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,020
What's wrong with you two?

247
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,970
You really feel good about

248
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,500
letting Rui Rui return himself?

249
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,560
Rui Rui is so young.

250
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,850
If anything had happened to him,

251
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,380
what would the two of you do?

252
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,600
I didn't want to,

253
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,130
but I had no choice.

254
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,770
Right now,

255
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,670
we are fighting for Rui Rui's custody.

256
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,450
I'm afraid Rui Rui might see

257
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,310
what we look like when we quarrel.

258
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,830
That's why I sent him to Cheng Mu.

259
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,030
No, why didn't you just send him to me?

260
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,720
Doesn't that work?

261
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,180
Why did you send him there?

262
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,530
It's not me.

263
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,550
It's Zhou Ming who didn't agree.

264
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,900
You looked into Cheng Mu for so long,

265
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,160
and still couldn't find anything on him.

266
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,370
Maybe Cheng Mu is more suitable than you.

267
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,750
Look at you.

268
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,180
You don't have a real job.

269
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,140
Every month's rent is a problem.

270
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,920
If our parents video call you,

271
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,860
and find out Rui Rui is in China,

272
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,850
I'm doomed.

273
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,100
For now,

274
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,440
go to Cheng Mu's place more often.

275
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,900
Take care of Rui Rui for me.

276
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,540
Cheng Mu is a man after all.

277
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,180
He's not married

278
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,780
and has never raised a child.

279
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm really worried that he can't take good care of Rui Rui.

280
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,050
You really are my sister.

281
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,430
Don't worry.

282
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,150
I will take good care of him.

283
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,270
But you,

284
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,100
you and Brother-in-law

285
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,829
better sort this out properly.

286
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,200
Children can't be without their parents after all.

287
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,859
I know.

288
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,900
Thank you, Si Han.

289
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,960
So cute.

290
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,400
If I had such a good-looking son,

291
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,300
I'd be so happy I won't know what to do with myself.

292
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,940
First,

293
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,859
you'd need a girlfriend.

294
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,410
Second, your girlfriend must be pretty.

295
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,730
Then, she has to want to marry you.

296
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,090
Finally, she must be willing to give birth to a child like me.

297
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,810
Stop.

298
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,980
Which one of you has time to help look after him?

299
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,700
Boss,

300
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,230
I haven't finished taking inventory.

301
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,360
I need to go do it now.

302
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,920
I- I'll go help.

303
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,390
Don't go, Ning.

304
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,860
I...

305
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,890
Boss, I'm going to clean up the counter.

306
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,700
I...

307
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,700
I have a lot of orders today.

308
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,820
I'm quite busy.

309
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,380
I don't know when I can finish.

310
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,380
It's just a kid.

311
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,980
What's so hard about taking care of a kid?

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,660
Let's go make desserts.

313
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,950
Let's go.

314
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,420
Auntie,

315
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,220
will you visit me today?

316
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,940
It depends on how much you miss me.

317
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,340
The force of it can dry up oceans and erode rocks.

318
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,300
Your mom needs to stop watching romance dramas with you.

319
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,330
I'll visit you today,

320
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,020
okay?

321
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,970
I need to get back to work now. Bye.

322
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,970
Mission accomplished.

323
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,500
You must keep your promise.

324
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,630
Rui Rui, let me ask you something.

325
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
What does your Auntie like to eat?

326
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Instant noodles.

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,010
Mom says every time she calls Auntie,

328
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,760
she's eating instant noodles.

329
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,450
Isn't she a food blogger?

330
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,870
Why does she eat instant noodles every day?

331
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,000
Because she's poor.

332
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,610
She spends all her money buying desserts,

333
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,530
so there's none left for meals.

334
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,180
Mom said she can barely afford rent.

335
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,330
That is so troubling.

336
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,730
Godfather, do you like Auntie?

337
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,280
Precocious child.

338
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,580
Rui Rui.

339
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,830
Okay, look at the camera.

340
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,860
Two, one. Okay.

341
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,100
Okay, White Angel is done.

342
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,230
Next, let's change to the Black Angel.

343
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,590
Ms Cheng.

344
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,580
The photo of Li Jingyang's White Angel,

345
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,660
it's clean and pure.

346
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,720
It's exactly what the sponsor wants.

347
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,940
The most important one is still the Black Angel.

348
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,770
It doesn't matter how good White Angel is

349
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,370
if Black Angel isn't good.

350
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,980
It seems you do know what you're doing.

351
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,540
I wasn't expecting this,

352
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,570
you pulling off Black Angel.

353
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,350
Black Angel

354
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,880
isn't all that I can pull off.

355
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,180
I'm so diligent

356
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,870
and I work so hard all for a certain someone,

357
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,500
yet I receive no reward.

358
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,420
Tell me.

359
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,630
What reward do you want?

360
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,930
Go out with me.

361
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,340
Okay.

362
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,430
No problem,

363
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,540
little brother.

364
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,060
Here.

365
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,110
Have fun.

366
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,600
How can you play here?

367
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,620
Cheng Mu,

368
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,010
What is the weather now?

369
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,260
What if Rui Rui catches a cold

370
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,790
while playing in the water?

371
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,100
Rui Rui, come here.

372
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,260
Auntie doesn't allow us to play. Give it to me.

373
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,750
Auntie, it's time for me to play.

374
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,970
I have the right to decide how to spend it.

375
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,210
Let me ask you.

376
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,580
if you fall sick,

377
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,700
do you also have the right to decide

378
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,720
what kind of bitter medicine the doctor will give you?

379
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,810
I don't want medicine.

380
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,140
If you don't want to take medicine, you shouldn't get water all over yourself.

381
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,420
Take him back to change.

382
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,370
Okay.

383
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,820
Li Jingyang, where are you?

384
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,150
Why are you here?

385
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,710
I...

386
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:05,820
You...

387
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,180
No, no.

388
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,790
Don't get me wrong.

389
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,740
We are...

390
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,290
Enough.

391
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,270
Why are you standing at the door? Let's talk inside.

392
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,440
Where are we going?

393
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,790
This way.

394
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,830
You got the vegetables?

395
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,450
Put them here.

396
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,760
Tell me.

397
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,750
What happened?

398
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,680
What do you mean?

399
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,410
This is Rui Rui's Auntie.

400
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,400
While Rui Rui is here,

401
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,830
she'll come visit him often.

402
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,930
This is Li Jingyang.

403
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,060
Have you met before?

404
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,140
Are you Jiang Siman's sister?

405
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,660
Yes.

406
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,550
Wait.

407
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,110
You just said

408
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,980
you would come here often.

409
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,740
Where? Your house?

410
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,100
Yes. Is there a problem?

411
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,860
It's a big problem.

412
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,140
Cheng Mu never brings women home.

413
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,110
You're the first one.

414
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,330
Rui Rui likes it. It can't be helped.

415
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,740
If that's the case,

416
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,000
can I also visit Rui Rui often?

417
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,820
Especially when your sister is around.

418
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,040
Rui Rui.

419
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,500
I'll visit you often, okay?

420
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,150
No.

421
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,740
I just want Godfather and Auntie to visit me.

422
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:21,860
Okay.

423
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,260
Looks like I'm the extra one.

424
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,550
I'm leaving.

425
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,890
Don't stop me.

426
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,280
Let's finish the maze.

427
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,130
Where are we now, Rui Rui?

428
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,100
We're here, right?

429
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,500
Yes.

430
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,970
You just let him go?

431
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,900
It's okay. He's shameless.

432
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,020
It's how he is. Leave him alone.

433
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:43,970
Oh.

434
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,080
You're really not coming after me?

435
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,820
Heartless.

436
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,620
Don't blame me for being unjust.

437
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,540
Hello.

438
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,700
There is some breaking news. Do you want to hear it?

439
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,310
I'm busy.

440
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,420
It's about your brother.

441
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,760
He's hiding a beauty.

442
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,290
I'm in the office.

443
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,010
Okay, I'll be right there.

444
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,220
Godfather, Auntie.

445
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,680
Now that Uncle Li has left,

446
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,200
do we still have anything to eat tonight?

447
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,900
You don't want me to cook, do you?

448
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,980
You don't know how to cook?

449
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,460
How is that possible?

450
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,550
I've lived alone for so many years.

451
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,140
This is not a problem at all.

452
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,740
Much obliged then, Chef Jiang.

453
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,140
Thank you, Auntie.

454
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,110
I haven't done this in a while.

455
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,340
Rui Rui, here's your steamed egg.

456
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,920
Is this food for humans?

457
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,040
You can't judge a book by its cover.

458
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,700
Rui Rui.

459
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,420
Try the steamed egg I made.

460
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,260
Here.

461
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,360
You don't have to eat if you don't want to.

462
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,640
Godfather, I have a stomachache.

463
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,660
I...

464
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,250
It's all my fault. Why did I stick my neck out?

465
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,560
I should have let you cook.

466
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,380
If anything happens to Rui Rui,

467
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,340
what should I tell my sister?

468
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,890
Rui Rui's parents.

469
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,980
Your child

470
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
has a slight diarrhea

471
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,330
because he caught a cold.

472
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,700
He'll be fine after getting an IV.

473
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,670
Don't worry.

474
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,880
Okay, thank you, doctor.

475
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,420
You're welcome.

476
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,750
Okay.

477
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,850
Nurse,

478
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,460
I want to ask

479
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,260
if it's because he ate something he shouldn't have,

480
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,860
that he...

481
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,100
It has nothing to do with eating.

482
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,700
Anyway, you young couple

483
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,540
should pay more attention

484
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,820
your child's health.

485
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,880
The temperature fluctuates between day and night.

486
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,990
Don't let him play with water, or walk around barefoot.

487
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,170
He can easily catch a cold and get diarrhea.

488
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,170
You young people

489
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,730
don't know how to take care of children.

490
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,580
You all think that children are a burden,

491
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,490
especially to work,

492
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,020
so you don't do it properly.

493
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,860
In the future, do pay more attention.

494
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,640
Thank you.

495
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,810
I'm a burden.

496
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,040
I am that burden.

497
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,800
I am that burden.

498
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,540
What's wrong?

499
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,230
I'm fine.

500
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,290
Don't blame yourself.

501
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,310
You didn't know Rui Rui shouldn't play in water.

502
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,220
Let's go in.

503
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,310
Okay.

504
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,320
You go first. I'll be right there.

505
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,710
Why don't we move in together?

506
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,410
What?

507
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:13,670
♫Hold my hand. I know the coldness of the world.♫

508
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,300
♫Don't be afraid, don't be afraid♫

509
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,770
♫My love♫

510
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:29,150
♫Come with me, when you walk alone♫

511
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,090
♫Countless times, you're so perfect♫

512
