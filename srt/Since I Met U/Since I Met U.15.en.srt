175
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,180
If you

176
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,550
don't write me a love letter today,

177
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,210
you'll have no excuse, right?

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,020
I'm looking forward to it.

179
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,330
Why did I write a love letter?

180
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,390
Jiang Sihan.

181
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm wondering if you really like me.

182
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,190
I've written

183
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,410
so many love letters for you.

184
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,500
You're still not satisfied.

185
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,860
Does the quantity

186
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,940
matter?

187

188

Mountains are mountains, and the sea is the sea.

189
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,810
But only when I see you...

190
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,170
Are you jealous again?

191
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:22,830
No.

192
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,110
You're jealous.

193
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,310
Will you write it or not?

194
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
I'll write it.

195
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,960
Jian Yihang.

196
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,310
Why are you here?

197
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,780
To go to work with you.

198
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,710
I took today off.

199
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,100
Don't lie to me.

200
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,300
Last night,

201
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,630
I saw you doing part-time work as a waiter.

202
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,740
So?

203
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,660
You don't have to pay back the money in a short time.

204
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,590
It'll be fine if you don't pay me back.

205
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,590
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

206
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,160
Go back.

207
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,340
I just don't want you to work too hard.

208
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,060
Jian Yihang, you're so nice.

209
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,240
You wear it too.

What's wrong? Why are you in a hurry?

214
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,740
Look.

215
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,760
There's a blogger

216
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,020
with millions of fans.

217
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,500
He said in his live broadcast

218
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,180
that our store has a big secret.

219
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,910
What secret?

220
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,620
He said

221
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,390
we could open the store

222
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,860
and remain top of the list of popular stores

223
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,720
because we have capital support.

224
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,860
It sounds right.

225
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,630
Isn't Yu the symbol of strength?

226
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,580
Yu is the symbol of strength.

227
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,300
It's true.

228

But don't you think

229
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,430
it sounds awkward?

230
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,980
It's nothing.

231
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,130
You don't want others to talk about it?

232
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,850
No.

233
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,940
They attacked us for no reason.

234
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,940
Don't you think it's strange?

235
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,830
I don't think so.

236
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,210
It means we are popular.

237

It's likely to be in dispute when we're popular.

Did you know

243
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,510
this KOL called Yi Qianwan before?

244
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,470
Yi Qianwan is famous for speaking rudely.

245
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,460
He often does shameless things

246
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,500
to get attention.

247
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,210
Many companies' promotion teams

248
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,470
have long blocked him.

249
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,480
But since he can confuse right and wrong

250
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,410
and is eloquent,

251
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,110
he has many followers online.

252
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,590
I think

253
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,020
this won't end so easily.

254
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,740

He's right.

269

At the beginning,

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,780
I opened Sol with my sister's money.

271

But it turned profitable

272
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,590
in just over 2 months.

273
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,920
I paid her back long ago.

274
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,580
I didn't expect my boyfriend to be not only talented

275
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,780
but also rich.

276
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,450
I'm not rich.

277
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,290
But it's quite easy for me to feed you.

278
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,420
You're easy to feed.

279

A dessert a day can make you happy.

280
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,690
You're right.

281
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,420
But I won't pay you.

282
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,550
Let me taste it.

To reveal this secret,

286
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,940
I offended

287
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,290
Cheng Yu, the real boss behind Sol.

288
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,380
Do you think

289
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,370
my account will be banned?

290
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,570
Just now,

291
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,930
I heard a bigger secret.

292
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,040
It is said that Cheng Yu

293
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,210
often gets Li Jingyang, an artist in her company,

294

on the casting couch.

295
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,860
She forced him

296
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,020
to become her boyfriend.

297
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,540
Look.

298
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,010
The blogger is gossiping about Sol again.

299
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,070
He'e even involving Jingyang and Yu.

300
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,180
Will he stop it?

301
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,530
Otherwise, how could she become the boss?

302
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,960
What's wrong, Hua?

303
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,680
Did something happen?

304
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,280
Your relationship has been exposed.

305
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
What do you think?

306
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,900
That's good.

307
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,560
Now I'm not worried that Cheng Yu will regret it.

308
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,250
My silly boy.

309
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,770
They all say that Cheng Yu gets you on the casting couch.

310
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,770
How can you laugh?

311
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,680
Rumors stop at the wise.

312
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,660
I...

313
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,090
You're here.

314
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,260
You came at the right time. Talk to him.

315
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,130
What do you think about the news online?

316
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,530
Don't try to persuade me.

317
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,540
I won't agree to break up with you.

318
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,060
Fine.

319
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,770
I don't want to break up anyway.

320
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,200
Why don't we just make our relationship public?

321
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,120
Why don't you play by the book?

322
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,400
I already

323
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,660
prepared a speech.

324
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,460
Now I have nothing to say.

325
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,130
Do I need to

326
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,260
get you on the casting couch?

327
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,040
Didn't I steal your heart long ago?

328
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,940
I've asked Shuang to arrange it.

329
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,690
She has drafted the statement.

330
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,800
But I'm still wondering

331
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,490
how

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,100
Yi Qianwan

333
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,210
got to know it.

334
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,340
I'm also looking into it.

335
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,170
But

336
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,450
there's been little progress.

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,070
I've asked someone

338
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,100
to delete

339
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,590
all the posts about Cheng Mu on the Internet.

340
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,670
But I'm still a little worried.

341
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,020
Don't worry.

342
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,500
It will be fine.

343
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,970
Besides,

347
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,369
often recommends Sol Dessert.

348
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,270
She is Cheng Mu's girlfriend.

349
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,950
Both of them

350
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,470
are packaged by Cheng Yu.

351
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,620
Today,

352
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,150
I prepared this for you.

353
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,040
Take a look.

354
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,050
[Big news: The owner of the popular dessert store is a psychopath]

355
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,550
[It is said Cheng Mu's mother was a psychopath. He probably inherited it from his mother]

356
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,410
[The master taught his students to continue harming us. They deserve to die]

[His life is a waste of air. I'm angry]

358
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,230
Ms. Cheng, I've asked the PR department

359
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,760
to delete the news about Mu.

360
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,500
It will all be deleted later.

361
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,630
That's good.

362
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,630
Thank you for your hard work.

363
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,570
Keep an eye on the Internet.

364
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,300
After this is completely over,

365
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,570
I'll give everyone a big red packet.

366
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,180
Keep an eye on Sol as well.

367
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,390
Don't let Cheng Mu see the news.

368
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,030
Got it, Yu.

369
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,580
I've contacted Bai Bin.

370
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,780
I asked you to investigate.

371
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,640
How is it going?

372
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,640
I haven't found anything.

373
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,970
Hurry up.

374
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,670
I want to know

375
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,950
who is attacking me and Sol secretly.

376
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,060
OK.

377
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,700
[No. 73 Yard]

378
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,790
This is the store of Cheng Mu's master.

379
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,250
Let's take a look.

380
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,430
-Mr. Xu. -It's here.

381
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,900
Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

382
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,980
-Mr. Xu. -He's out.

383
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,820
How many students do you have

384
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,460
who're patients like Cheng Mu?

385
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,500
Can you tell us?

386
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,240
How many such stores

387
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,500
are there?

388
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,510
Please tell us.

389
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,220
Mr. Xu, I heard

390
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,340
you used to be a psychopath.

391
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,540
You're a psychopath.

392
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,340
How do you feel when you're teaching students?

393
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,960
Leave. Leave.

394
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,040
Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

395
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,440
Mr. Xu, don't be angry.

396
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,090
Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

397
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,600
Open the door.

398
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,860
Don't be angry, Mr. Xu.

399
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,100
Hello, you're here again.

400
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,600
Thank you.

401
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,780
Everyone, look.

402
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,370
I'm now

403
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,820
in the popular dessert store.

404
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,200
Today,

405
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,710
let's take a look at the boss.

406
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,470
Hello, sir.

407
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,470
Sorry, live streaming is not allowed in our store.

408
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,940
-You're bullying us, aren't you? -Yes.

409
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,790
We'll do it.

410
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,590
Yes, we'll do it.

411
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,650
What's wrong, Bai?

412
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm sorry. Live streaming is not allowed here.

413
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,640
I said no live streaming.

414
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,380
How many times have I told you?

415
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,090
Can you be reasonable?

416
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,180
Why don't you let us live stream?

417
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
We'll do it. That's right.

418
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,110
What's going on?

419
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,610
Don't let Boss know it.

420
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,940
Ask Yihang and Xianning

421
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,050
to come back soon.

422
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,630
Hello, guys.

423
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
The posts about Sol are being deleted.

424
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,440
Today, let me show you

425
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,940
what it really looks like.

426
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,050
I heard

427
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,370
the owner of this store is a psychopath.

428
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,240
His parents died because of him.

429
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,340
Hey, something is wrong in the store.

430
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,400
Come back quickly.

431
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,420
Stop filming.

432
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,020
Put your phones down.

433
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,900
What are you doing? What are you talking about?

434
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,580
You are not allowed to film here.

435
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,700
I'm sorry.

436
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,460
Don't push. Don't film.

437
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,940
Can you put your phones down first?

438
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,330
Can you put your phones down?

439
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,580
Live streaming is not allowed here.

440
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,940
Come on. You all want to film me?

441
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,000
Look at your faces.

442
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,060
Come on.

443
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
I'll send the video to the police.

444
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,900
None of you can escape.

445
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,700
Stop filming.

446
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,140
They don't let us in.

447
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,520
What are you doing?

448
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,100
I heard

449
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,480
the owner of this store is a psychopath.

450
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,280
His parents died because of him.

451
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,050
Put your phones down.

452
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,660
Stop filming.

453
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,690
Stop filming.

454
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Put your phones down.

455
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,900
Stop filming.

456
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,180
We have the right to know the truth.

457
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,100
The owner of this store

458
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,900
might have an attack at any time.

459
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,230
Put down your phones.

460
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,290
Boss! Boss!

461
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,170
Why are you pusing? Why is he running away?

462
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:22,690
Boss.

463
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,500
He's not answering?

464
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,000
How about calling Taro?

465
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,100
Yes. Taro.

466
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,260
Hello, Yu.

467
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,130
Sihan, how is Cheng Mu?

468
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,060
I don't know.

469
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,940
His phone is broken.

470
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,570
I don't know where he went.

471
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,090
Where are you now?

472
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,330
I'll go to you now.

473
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm at home.

474
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,910
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

475
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,430
OK.

476
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,330
Go to Cheng Mu's home.

477
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,740
OK.

478
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Sit tight.

479
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,120
Yu.

480
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,040
Cheng Mu...

481
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,570
Yu, well,

482
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,970
apart from Sol,

483
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,530
is there anywhere else Cheng Mu usually goes?

484
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,150
When he's in a bad mood,

485
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,650
he suddenly disappears.

486
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,660
-No...
-If anything happens to him,

487
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,100
how should I face our parents?

488
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It's OK, Yu.

489
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,290
Don't worry.

490
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,090
I will find him.

491
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,430
I'll bring him back.

492
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,760
♫There is no clamour in the gray corner of the city♫

493
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,510
♫Like how I become unseen when I hide in the dark night♫

494
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,170
♫Isolated from the bustle of the crowd♫

495
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,200
♫My tears can't bear the loneliness, so they escape me♫

496
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,610
Cheng Mu was standing here

497
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,930
because he wanted to commit suicide.

498
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,460
♫The rain fears it can't reach me♫

499
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,450
♫It makes the wind keep blowing in my direction♫

500
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,040
♫I came for you, but was pushed away♫

501
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,450
Cheng Mu.

502
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,770
For them,

503
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,690
♫I deserve it♫

504
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,920
you're just like me,

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,860
♫I thought you were my future, but you were an accident♫

506
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,910
a burden.

507
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,530
♫I can't change my habit of relying on you♫

508
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,180
Mu.

509
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,430
This is the symbol of courage.

510
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,770
♫I understand, but I can't let go♫

511
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,260
Now I gave it to you.

512
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,990
With this necklace,

513
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,860
you don't have to be afraid.

514
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,290
I'll always be with you.

I have to stand up and stop you.

687
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,370
Don't go against your conscience

688
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,060
because of me.

689
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,190
I've contacted

690
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,360
a team of foreign doctors in this field.

691
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,600
I believe it will help

692
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,330
improve Yuanyuan's condition.

693
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,570
If you have any concern about the treatment fees,

694
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,700
I can cover them all.

695
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,150
Can you tell us now?

696
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,390
After what I've done to you,

697
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,340
why would you help me?

698
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,610
You already caused harm

699
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,140
to me and my brother.

700
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,310
But Yuanyuan is innocent.

701
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,300
However, you must pay

702
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,260
for what you did.

703
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,180
Apologize to my brother in public

704
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,830
and close your account.

705
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,100
I will apologize to Cheng Mu in public.

706
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,550
There must be someone else

707
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,600
behind this.

708
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,680
Tell me. Who is behind this?

709
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,880
It's Shen Menglin.

710
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:25,100
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

711
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,730
♫Don't be frightened now, don't be frightened now♫

712
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,200

♫At the end of the day, I will come for you♫

717
00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:00,160
♫Run to you anyway, when the sky seems so gray♫

718
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,470
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫
