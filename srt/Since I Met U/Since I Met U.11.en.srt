172
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,460
These are the types I dislike.

173

Hurry up, clear the table.

174

Okay.

175
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,170
Boss,

176
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,880
Haven't you been developing this new recipe

177
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,160
for a long time?

178
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,200
Still not satisfied with it?

179
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,150
I keeping thinking it can be better.

180
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,380
I think you're too much of a perfectionist.

181
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,000
I think it's good enough.

182
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,580
And I think

183
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,380
there is another, more important, thing.

184
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,940

188
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,110
How has the training been going for our employees?

189
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,780
If we open another branch,

190
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,600
where will we get the manpower from?

191
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,180
We can't guarantee quality as it is.

192
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,960
For now, I won't consider

But Boss,

195
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,690
I think this is a rare opportunity.

196

Also, I've heard

199
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,670
They've already become tourist attrations.

200
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,060
They're getting more customers too.

201
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
Are we really not considering it?

202
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:02,990
We'll talk about it later.

203
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,250

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,580
But I've thought about it,

511
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,380
and decided to move out of Cheng Mu's house first.

512
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,440
Where are you going in such a hurry?

513
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,190
To find Taro.

514
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,390
Why are you in such a hurry to find her?

515
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,690
My sister-in-law is running away.

516
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
I have to get her back.

517
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,700
You mean

518
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,140
Jiang Sihan is giving up on Cheng Mu?

519
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,970
I think she's giving up.

520
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,990
If I don't tell her now,

521
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,480
there might not be another chance.

522
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,700
I have to tell her everything about Cheng Mu.

523
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,260
After all, they'll have to

524
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,400
spend their future together.

525
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,600
What do you think, Jingyang?

526
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,900
Me?

527
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,260
Babe,

528
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,010
this is the first time

529
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,670
you've asked for my opinion so seriously.

530
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,840
I'm so happy.

531
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:40,710
Don't worry.

532
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,800
I'll support whatever decision you make.

533
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,210
I'll go with you

534
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,350
to find our sister-in-law.

535
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,020
Yu.

536
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,860
Why are you here so suddenly?

537
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:01,890
Sihan,

538
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,490
I have something to tell you

539
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,940
about Cheng Mu.

540
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,220
Cheng Mu?

541
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,940
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

542
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,570
♫Don't be frightened now, don't be frightened now♫

543
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,050
♫My precious love♫

544
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:44,340
♫Come to me, when you have run your miles♫

545
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,290
♫For the thousandth time, you are perfect now♫

546
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,810
♫Just as you are♫

547
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:58,110
♫At the end of the day, I will come for you♫

548
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,010
♫Run to you anyway, when the sky seems so gray♫

549
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,310
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫

550
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,550
♫Always♫

551
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:20,280
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

552
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:28,820
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

553
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:39,350
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

554
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,660
♫As true♫

555
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:56,830
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

556
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:05,140
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

557
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:15,750
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

558
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,040
♫As true♫
