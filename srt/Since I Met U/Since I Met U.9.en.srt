But Miss Moon has a limited supply everyday,

169
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,010
so it's not viable for the profit

171
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,790

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,410
should we do away

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,270
with the daily limited supply?

174
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,990
Rose dessert Miss Moon

175
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,480
is freshly made every day.

176
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,140
If we want to increase the supply,

177
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,530
it means we have to prepare it in advance

178
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,260
to be frozen.

179
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,570
The taste will not be as good.

180
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,610
I don't think everything

181
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,010
can be measured by money.

182
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,540
Our top priority is reputation.

183
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,100
I hope every customer

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
can have the best and freshest dessert.

185
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,020
Got it.

186
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,100
Then I

187
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,780
a good news to announce.

188
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,620
Since the new product was launched,

189
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,260
our store has attracted many influencers to check us out.

190
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,860
We

191
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,260
have finally returned to

192
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,050
the top of the

193
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,880
Most Popular Dessert Place

194
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,750
in our city.

195
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,860
Sweet.

196
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,960
Isn't that normal?

197
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,990
Understood, boss.

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Anything else?

199
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,660
Not for now.

200
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,550
How about this?

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,860
I know

202
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,320
our sales have increased,

203
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,220
and we have gained more customers.

204
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,380
Everyone has worked hard.

205
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:35,940
This afternoon,

206
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,860
we can close the shop early.

207
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,390
Everyone can get more rest.

208
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,380
Bin, make the arrangements.

209
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:40,850
Okay.

210
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,930
Say, why...

211
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,510
is boss suddenly giving us a holiday.

212
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,150
I don't even know what to do.

213
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,460
Are you stupid?

214
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,970
Isn't it good to have a break?

215
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,840
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

216
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,610
Right...

217
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,930
Boss has been mysterious recently.

218
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,620
He must be busy pursuing Jiang Sihan.

219
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,080
When the boss is attached,

220
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,230
I'll be the only eligible bachelor

221
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,180
left in the store.

222
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,870
What are you saying.

223
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,090
The operations team has shown you

224
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,620
you recent numbers, right?

225
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,260
What thoughts do you have? Tell me about it.

226
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,060
Thoughts...

227
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,110
I think

228
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,940
maybe it's because I didn't write much.

229
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,920
I've taken a look at your numbers.

230
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
It's getting better these days.

231
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,630
But it's far from enough.

232
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,500
There are many food bloggers.

233
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,780
How are you going to stand out?

234
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,910
This is the problem.

235
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,020
Look.

236
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,670
Your previous content

237
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,460
focused on the stories

238
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,900
behind desserts.

239
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,010
And the frequency of updates is not fixed.

240
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,820
Yu, I've been thinking

241
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,150
about this problem too.

242
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
The content of my food blog

243
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,800
has way too many content

244
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,660
and branches out to too many aspects.

245
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,380
So,

246
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,840
I have asked Cheng Mu

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,490
to teach me how to make desserts.

248
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,350
I'll focus on dessert from now on.

249
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,790
Sounds good.

250
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,000
If there's nothing else,

251
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,190
you can go back first.

252
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,180
Okay.

253
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,080
By the way,

254
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,780
have you made any progress with my brother?

255
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,820
Progress...

256
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,580
We're still the same.

257
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,280
I know my brother.

258
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,110
He is

259
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,040
not good at expressing himself.

260
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,600
But he treats you and others differently.

261
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,870
So I think

262
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,420
you can give him more time.

263
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,900
Don't give up.

264
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,440
Got it.

265
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,980
Thank you, Yu.

266
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm leaving.

267
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,580
My phone.

268
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:25,150
[Li Jingyang]

269
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,160
Honey,

270
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,170
can I come earlier?

271
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,940
I miss you.

272
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,610
I want this.

273
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,900
Hi, can I take a look at this?

274
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,500
Okay, I'll wrap it up for you.

275
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,270
You can scan here.

276
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,970
Stand here.

277
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,740
Okay.

278
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,940
This one, too.

279
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,890
This one is so beautiful.

280
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,580
Right?

281
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,830
It'll look so good if you photoshop it.

Wait.

You saved me just now,

I need to repay you.

290
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,740
No need.

291
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,180
Why didn't I notice

292
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,510

Then eat it.

My goodness.

317
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,100
Jesus!

318
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,970
Do you know

319
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,790
what I saw at the back just now?

320
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,620
I guessed it.

321
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,170
Boss is teaching Jiang Sihan to make puff.

322
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,460
They look like they were doing a whole photoshoot.

323
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,220
I think

324
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,780
the puffs don't even need sugar

325
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,040
and it will be way too sweet.

326
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Don't make a fuss.

327
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,540
Say, boss has been

328
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,350
telling us to leave after work,

329
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,220
is because he wants to teach her?

330
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,600
You just found out?

331
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,180
Bai said

332
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,460
we can leave if there's nothing else.

333
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,120
He brought Rui Rui out to play.

334
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,180
Where's Jian?

335
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,940
Let's go. Let's go eat hotpot.

336
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,620
You've ordered a lot.

337
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,180
Would you like to leave some for other customers?

338
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
If you're making it difficult for us

339
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,110
because our boss

340
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,390
has someone he likes,

341
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,740
I advise you not to waste your time here.

342
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,300
Jian Yihang,

343
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,980
Don't you understand?

344
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,950

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,040
Rui Rui.

519
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,470
What's wrong?

520
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,340
Did you have a nightmare?

521
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,360
Aunt, I dreamed about going home.

522
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,050
And no one was home.

523
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,260
Dad and Mum are gone.

524
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,270
Rui Rui, that was a dream.

525
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,070
It's all fake.

526
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
It's fine when you're awake.

527
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,590
They don't want me anymore, right?

528
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,650
How can they abandon Rui Rui?

529
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,230
They love Rui Rui the most.

530
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Here's the thing.

531
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,000
Because Rui Rui is on school holiday,

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
and Aunt and Godfather

533
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,600
miss Rui Rui very much,

534
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,630
so your mom sent you here to accompany us.

535
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:06,970
You're lying.

536
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,570
They think I'm a burden.

537
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,100
I'm their burden.

538
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,910
It's not like that.

539
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,350
Let me tell you.

540
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,910
This is a dream.

541
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,580
A nightmare.

542
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,850
When we wake up, it's all fine,

543
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,550
right?

544
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,650
Rui Rui will always be

545
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,110
your Dad and Mum's baby.

546
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,420
You're a burden.

547
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,500
You are a burden.

548
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,390
We are all burdens,

549
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,380
you know?

550
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,850
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

551
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,480
♫Don't be frightened now, don't be frightened now♫

552
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,960
♫My precious love♫

553
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,250
♫Come to me, when you have run your miles♫

554
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,210
♫For the thousandth time, you are perfect now♫

555
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,720
♫Just as you are♫

556
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,020
♫At the end of the day, I will come for you♫

557
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:49,920
♫Run to you anyway, when the sky seems so gray♫

558
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,220
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫

559
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,460
♫Always♫

560
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:06,190
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

561
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,730
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

562
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:25,260
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

563
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,570
♫As true♫

564
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,740
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

566
00:29:51,320 --> 00:30:01,660
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

567
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,950
♫As true♫
