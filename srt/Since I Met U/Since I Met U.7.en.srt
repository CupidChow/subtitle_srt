74
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,690
it launched a rose dessert.

75

It's good to have competition.

00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,760

83

I'm not suspecting you.

I just need to confirm it.

85

I admit it.

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,420
I was curious

87
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,150
and I had a look at the notebook.

88
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,980
But I would never betray you.

89

90
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,590

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,500
No.

93

I was just curious.

94
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,460
I tried it at home

95
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,670
and made it for my girlfriend.

96
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,470

Having a cake at night

100
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,310

101
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,170
Just take a bite.

102

I'm still far behind our boss.

108

it would definitely be popular.

The ingredients are totally different this time.

118
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,340

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,090
Boss,

121
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,909
I will look into this matter.

122
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,710
If Weiwei really did it,

123
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,280
I will give you and everyone else in the shop an explanation.

I'm sorry. I apologize.

163

I shouldn't have hit him.

164

You stay.

Okay.

You didn't come to me, a relationship expert.

233
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,700
she can be immature.

252
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,590
Let's say a boy is drunk

and kisses a girl,

254
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,260
but there's no follow-up.

255
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
What does it mean?

256
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,830
He must like the girl.

257
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,730
Does the girl like the boy?

258
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,100

No way.

Nothing he does

261
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,500

262
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,140
Then what do you think

263
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,400
is a sign of affection?

264
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,340
First,

265
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,360
if he likes the girl,

266
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,030
he won't pull a long face every day.

267
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
At least he should smile at the girl,

268
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,170
which may be a sign of affection.

269

What's the difference between a father's love and a mother's love?

a father's goodness is higher than the mountain,

289
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,780
and a mother's goodness deeper than the sea.

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,560
so she can create a new column.

347
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,670
By the way, Yu,

348
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,620
Li Jingyang and Tao Manman

349
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,890
are filming an ad for a clothing brand today.

350
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,680
After that,

351
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,250
they can take a short break.

352
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,460
In the future,

353
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,390
we will cooperate with new brands.

354
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,610
You can arrange more work for Li Jingyang.

355
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,620
Yu.

356
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,780
The other day, a producer wanted to

357
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,640
invite Jingyang to shoot a movie.

358
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,560
But the pay was too low.

359
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,060
So I rejected it.

360
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,520
How about this?

361
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,610
Send me the project plan

362
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
and information.

363
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,840
And send me the producer's contact information.

364
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,190
Okay.

365
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,290
This one is also good.

366
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,760
Which one should I choose?

367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,830
Director Li, thank you and Mr. Wang

368
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,910
for your love.

369
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,740
Jingyang is so popular now.

370
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,150
Please hold on. I'm sorry.

371
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,230
Jingyang, I spared the day for you.

372
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,430
The rest is up to you.

373
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,220
Thank you, Hua.

374
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,820
Keep it up.

375
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,010
Great!

376
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,750
Who's celebrating his birthday?

377
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,680
You?

378
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,180
But I think your birthday

379
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,380
is not in this month.

380
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,080
A friend of mine.

381
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,590
A female friend? The one you like?

382
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,430
You have a girlfriend?

383
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,370
What's her name?

384
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,870
What does she do?

385
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,390
It's none of your business.

386
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,330
Yes. Hello.

387
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,410
Did I interrupt your work?

388
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,260
No.

389
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,730
Are you free tonight?

390
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,420
Yes.

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,970
Jingyang.

392
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,770
Our photographer just told us

393
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,570
we'll get off work late tonight.

394
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,780
Let's leave together, okay?

395
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,310
I have nothing to say, then.

396
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,620
What are you doing?

397
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,840
Boss, what delicate dessert are you making?

398
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,560
Boss, what flavor do you want

399
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,750
with so many lemons?

400
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,560
I think

401
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,390
it's the sour taste of love.

402
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,520
I don't care what flavor it is.

403
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,960
I just want to see our boss defeat Sweet as soon as possible.

404
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,690
Sol will win!

405
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,420
You guys

406
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,630
have nothing to do?

407
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,700
Let's go. Stop being garrulous.

408
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,360
Let's go and clean up the shop.

409
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,730
What are you cooking?

410
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,070
I made your favorite rib soup.

411
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,490
Try it.

412
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,020
Let me try.

413
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,100
Boss, the customers are gone.

414
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,150
And I asked them to get off work.

415
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,260
What's up?

416
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,030
I have something to tell you.

417
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,390
Go ahead.

418
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,270
I want to resign.

419
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,380
Resign?

420
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,290
Why?

421
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,810
Our new product, Childhood, was leaked

422
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,820
because of me.

423
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
Our business was hit.

424
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,480
I...

425
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,460
I'm too ashamed to stay.

426
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,830
You've found out about it?

427
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,650
Yes.

428
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,360
The owner of the secret account is indeed Weiwei.

429
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,630
She actually

430
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,690
sold the recipe for Childhood to Sweet

431
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,650
for money.

432
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,840
Because of this,

433
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,950
I had a big row with her

434
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,150
and broke up with her.

435
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,980
Sorry, Boss.

436
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,100
Bin,

437
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,120
you are my first employee

438
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,980
and my partner.

439
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,460
Sol was founded by the two of us.

440
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,420
I know how important this shop is to you.

441
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,560
Our business philosophy

442
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,110
is different from that of Sweet.

443
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,640
As long as we are still here,

444
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,750
we will always make better desserts.

445
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,030
So don't blame yourself

446
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,050
for this.

447
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,220
But I need you to do something

448
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,150
more important.

449
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,090
You need to apologize to another person.

450
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,300
I understand.

451
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,050
I will apologize to Miss Jiang personally.

452
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,670
Well, about my resignation...

453
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,600
I don't approve it.

454
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,910
I have something important to do recently.

455
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,270
So the launch of Sweet and Sour will be your job.

456
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,710
Also,

457
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,980
give Yihang

458
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,200
more procurement tasks.

459
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,650
Give him more red packets.

460
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,050
He seems to be on a budget.

461
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,820
Boss.

462
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,800
I want to stay with you forever to repay you.

463
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,070
Out with the old, in with the new.

464
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,860
Sweet and Sour is now mature.

465
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,590
Try it for me.

466
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,350
Okay.

467
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,120
There's a sour taste of lemon.

468
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,130
But after a careful taste,

469
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,070
there's a hint of sweetness.

470
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,470
Just like its name.

471
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,690
Boss.

472
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,740
Leave this dessert to me.

473
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,030
Exactly.

474
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,090
If I hadn't gone through these things,

475
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,230
I wouldn't have had such good inspiration.

476
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,090
Don't worry about it. Do your job.

477
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,180
Jiang Sihan, remember, you are a lady.

478
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,340
Sihan.

479
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,140
I talked to Bai Bin

480
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,310
about the notebook.

481
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,920
He accidentally told it to his girlfriend,

482
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,760
and his girlfriend leaked it.

483
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,690
So it has nothing to do with you.

484
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,230
He will apologize to you.

485
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,690
Godfather, I'm done.

486
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,790
OK.

487
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,250
Let me do it.

488
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,460
Are you sure?

489
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,020
No need.

490
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,250
Play with Rui Rui.

491
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,300
I'll do it.

492
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,980
Aunt,

493
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,020
don't you hate washing dishes?

494
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,800
You told me before

495
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,190
that you'd leave the dishes to Godfather.

496
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,270
When did I say that?

497
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,830
What are you talking about?

498
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,510
Aunt.

499
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,280
Why do you keep peeking at Godfather today?

500
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,580
Is it so obvious?

501
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,190
But I won't tell him.

502
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,420
Good.

503
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,210
You're a grateful boy.

504
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,620
I'm usually too casual.

505
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,190
Don't move.

506
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,290
I'll wash your clothes.

507
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,850
No need.

508
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,650
I'll do it.

509
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,230
No.

510
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,090
You work so hard.

511
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,970
Let me wash them for you.

512
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,040
No, it's harder to take care of a child.

513
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,960
Business women's work is the hardest.

514
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,680
Let me do it.

515
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm not tired.

516
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm not tired at all.

517
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,110
You are more tired.

518
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,750
Forget it.

519
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,870
I usually do it.

520
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,610
You're not used to using the washing machine.

521
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,070
How come I'm not used to it?

522
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,310
-Let me do it.
-Stop.

523
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,400
No, you...

524
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,990
Don't move.

525
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,760
Let me move first.

526
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,940
-Aunt, what are you doing?
-Don't look. Don't look.

527
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,440
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

528
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,070
♫Don't be frightened now, don't be frightened now♫

529
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,550
♫My precious love♫

530
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,760
♫Come to me, when you have run your miles♫

531
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,800
♫For the thousandth time, you are perfect now♫

532
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,310
♫Just as you are♫

533
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,610
♫At the end of the day, I will come for you♫

534
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:37,510
♫Run to you anyway, when the sky seems so gray♫

535
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,810
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫

536
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,050
♫Always♫

537
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,780
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

538
00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:02,320
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

539
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:12,850
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

540
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,160
♫As true♫

541
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:30,330
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

542
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:38,640
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

543
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:49,250
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

544
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,540
♫As true♫
