my brother

118
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,180

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,250
He's already let you into his house.

129
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,940
That's because he wants me to take care of Rui Rui.

130
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,670
From what I know about Cheng Mu,

131

Cheng Mu doesn't mean anything like that.

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,810
And this isn't only one person's matter, right?

Ask someone else to get it.

156

I'll keep Rui Rui company. You go ahead.

Okay, I'll bring it to you later.

when it comes to making desserts,

167
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,380

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,520
Sorry for the trouble.

172
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,120
It's okay.

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,500
What's up with your boss?

174
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,140
He sounded so flustered on the phone.

175
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,540
Exactly.

176
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,580
Boss has been in a trance

177
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,740
because of the new products.

178
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,060
See,

179
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,220
he even left the notebook at home.

180
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,570
And we had to trouble you to come all the way here.

181
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,190
It's okay.

182
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,020
Give him the notebook.

183
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,280
I'll make a move first.

184
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,710
Okay.

185
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,660
Where did this come from?

186
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,940
[Childhood]

187
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,650
Sweet

188
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,510
is definitely no match for us now.

189
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,540
Boss.

190
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,480
Where is she?

191
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,430
She left.

192
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,240
If there's nothing else,

193
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
I'll get back to work.

194
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,000
Shuang.

195
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,190
Darling,

196
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,180
what do you want to eat tonight?

197
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,420
I'll take you.

198
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,260
Come here.

199
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,190
Why are you here?

200
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,260
I remember you told me yesterday,

201
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,830
that you will compensate me in other ways.

202
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,590
That's why I came to you.

203
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,830
Li Jingyang.

204
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,310
You did this on purpose.

205
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
I learned it from my darling.

206
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,630
Let's go.

207
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,460
Tell me.

208
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,860
What kind of compensation do you want?

209
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Be my girlfriend.

210
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,300
Li Jingyang, I have no time to talk nonsense with you.

211
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,160
Let's go. I'll take you to dinner.

212
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:12,560
I...

213
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,340
It's bad for your stomach if you don't eat at regular mealtimes.

214
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,800
Let's go

215
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,330
♫I want to walk every long street with you♫

216
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,360
♫Hold hands as the street lights flicker♫

217
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,770
♫I don't bear to read the chapters with you in them♫

218
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,690
Rui Rui, you're forgetful.

219
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,010
♫How I wish I could freeze time♫

220
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,370
You came to play at the fountain again.

221
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,300
Godfather, you're back.

222
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,620
You're back

223
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,460
♫You said you love long nights the most♫

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,860
Yes, I'm back.

225
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,320
Why are your clothes wet?

226
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,390
♫My love is never cowardly♫

227
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,820
If I say

228
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,660
this bubble hit it all by itself,

229
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,130
would you believe me?

230
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,120
♫Every season with you♫

231
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Okay, stop playing.

232
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,400
You got sick after playing here last time.

233
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,760
Give it to me.

234
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,190
♫Even the wind is gentler♫

235
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,460
-Give it to me. -Be good.

236
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,030
Rui Rui.

237
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,690
♫The night breeze blows through a sky dotted by starlight♫

238
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,500
♫I ask it to bring you my overflowing longing♫

239
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,890
Okay, let's bring Rui Rui home and get him changed.

240
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:13,950
He fell sick last time,

241
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,830
but he still didn't learn his lesson.

242
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,330
♫Snowflakes suspended in the air, drifting happily♫

243
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,030
♫You gradually notice all of my love♫

244
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,980
You're living in Cheng Mu's house?

245
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,620
I've heard Cheng Mu is pretty eligble.

246
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,090
You've been single for so many years,

247
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,520
maybe you could try going after him.

248
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,580
It'll be worth it.

249
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,780
I have no strengths,

250
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,970
other than knowing my own place.

251
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,890
Who's to say?

252
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,060
What if love grows over time?

253
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,030
Got it, Big Sis.

254
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,770
I'm tired.

255
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,170
Can you let me rest?

256
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,060
Go.

257
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,020
My son is so cute.

258
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:58,890
By the way,

259
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,780
send me the password for the security camera.

260
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,140
So that when I want to see my son,

261
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,670
I won't have to trouble you.

262
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,380
No.

263
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,980
Why not?

264
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,270
That's my son.

265
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,690
Protecting privacy.

266
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,350
We can launch "Childhood" tomorrow.

267
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,410
Excuse me.

268
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,040
Would you like to try

269
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,190
our new product?

270
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,100
No need.

271
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,780
Sweet has already released the same product.

272
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,410
I tried it,

273
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,310
it's not bad.

274
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,900
Boss.

275
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,310
Sweet's new product

276
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,400
is launching at the same time as ours.

277
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,320
Godfather.

278
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,500
How dare you come here?

279
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,340
Bin.

280
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,180
What's wrong with me?

281
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,150
Why can't I come?

282
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,900
You can't be sure yet,

283
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,710
don't make a fuss.

284
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,110
Boss, it must be her.

285
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,720
She asked me about your dessert

286
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,090
that day she came to drop off your notebook.

287
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,220
Not long after,

288
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,010
Sweet released a new product exactly like ours.

289
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,420
What?

290
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,630
What's wrong with your new product?

291
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,450
The new product I told you about last time,

292
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,180
I've made it.

293
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,260
That's good.

294
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,710
In theory, yes.

295
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,730
But today,

296
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,340
Sweet released something exactly like ours.

297
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,020
Wait.

298
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,170
So you mean to say

299
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,620
Sweet's new product

300
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,250
is exactly the same as yours,

301
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,870
and he suspects I leaked it to them?

302
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,650
No need to suspect. It was you.

303
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,620
Except me and Boss,

304
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,260
-No one else has touched that notebook. -Bin.

305
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,790
-Who else could it be? -Bin.

306
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,520
Stop it.

307
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,290
Cheng Mu.

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,680
You asked me to bring the notebook to you.

309
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,400
Yes, I dropped it on the way.

310
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,350
Then, because the bookmark dropped out,

311
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,880
I accidentally took a look.

312
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,070
But I put it back in its original place

313
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,860
immediately.

314
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,700
What does it have to do with me,

315
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,110
whether or not your product gets leaked?

316
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,550
Boss, look.

317
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,840
She admitted that she read the notebook.

318
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,380
Cheng Mu, do you believe me?

319
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,230
This is not the time to talk about this.

320
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,720
Okay?

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,400
Let's solve the more pressing issue first.

322
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,590
So you suspect me too?

323
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,850
I...

324
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,440
Godfather.

325
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm convenient when you need me.

326
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,980
If you don't trust me,

327
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,320
just find someone you trust instead.

328
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,670
To think that I was interested in him.

329
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,300
I shouldn't have drunk that wine.

330
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,660
Otherwise, I wouldn't have mistaken him for someone else.

331
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,320
Godfather,

332
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,640
When boys fight,

333
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,830
they should give in to girls.

334
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,150
Look how angry you've made Auntie.

335
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,320
I think I did made her angry.

336
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,580
When dad makes mom angry,

337
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,800
he just has to act a little cute,

338
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,210
and she'll forgive him.

339
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,130
Why don't you try that?

340
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,100
Act cute.

341
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,060
But your godfather's situation

342
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,860
is different from your parents.

343
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,810
A man should be brave enough to admit when he's wrong.

344
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,910
It's raining. This is your opportunity.

345
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,400
I will wait for you in the shop.

346
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,780
Are you sure?

347
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,460
Yes.

348
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,260
Only one.

349
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,660
That's enough.

350
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,620
♫It is silent in the gray corner of the city♫

351
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,580
What are you doing?

352
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,340
Haven't you had enough of fighting in the shop?

353
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,020
I'm here to apologize to you on behalf of Bin?

354
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,810
Don't. I can't stand it.

355
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,210
♫Like how I become unseen when I hide in the dark night♫

356
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,870
Before I prove my innocence,

357
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll move out of your house.

358
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm not suspecting you.

359
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,900
There are so many traps in your house.

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,640
♫Isolated from the bustle of the crowd♫

361
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,730
How would I know?

362
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,340
If I accidentally trigger another one of them,

363
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,450
then I will never be able to clear my name.

364
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,050
No.

365
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:08,070
♫My tears can't bear the loneliness, so they escape me♫

366
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,730
If you want to read that notebook,

367
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,060
you can read it anytime.

368
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,900
I don't want to.

369
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,190
♫The rain fears it can't reach me♫

370
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,630
If you insist on moving out,

371
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,660
what will happen to Rui Rui?

372
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,400
Tell him I'm on a business trip.

373
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,760
♫It makes the wind keep blowing in my direction♫

374
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,060
But I promised Rui Rui to bring you back.

375
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,780
♫I came for you, but was pushed away♫

376
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,270
Do you want me to break my promise to him?

377
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,370
Yes.

378
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,300
♫I deserve it♫

379
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,360
Sihan!

380
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,970
Don't follow me!

381
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,940
♫I pace in the heavy rain, crying my heart out♫

382
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,000
♫Let the rain hide my tears♫

383
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,360
♫I await in the dark nights, only dreams are waiting for me♫

384
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,630
♫You will be by my side, never having left♫

385
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,830
♫I thought you were my future, but you were an accident♫

386
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,080
Don't follow me.

387
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,520
Do you want to die with me?

388
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,340
♫I can't change my habit of relying on you♫

389
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,440
♫I understand, but I can't let go♫

390
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,910
Rui Rui, come out and eat.

391
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,790
I have to go.

392
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,740
I have to go to work.

393
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,600
Sit there later with your Auntie-

394
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,650
Sit there.

395
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,460
Rui Rui, I have something to discuss with you.

396
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,340
I have to go to work today.

397
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,730
Uncle Li Jingyang will come keep you company.

398
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,780
He is

399
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,480
is not very bright.

400
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,510
So please take good care of him for me.

401
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,910
OK?

402
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,060
Godfather,

403
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,860
When will Auntie come back from her business trip?

404
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,930
She's busy with work,

405
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,220
I don't know when she'll be back either.

406
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,180
Be good.

407
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,890
Is this how you treat me?

408
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,350
What do you think? Am I handsome?

409
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,130
Rui Rui, I'll leave him to you.

410
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,290
Leave it to me.

411
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,510
I will take good care of Uncle Jingyang.

412
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,620
Usually, at this hour,

413
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,870
our shop is bustling.

414
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,500
Sweet has a big promotion for their opening,

415
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,010
so everyone must have gone there.

416
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,580
I saw many bloggers

417
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,860
recommending Sweet's desserts.

418
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,210
Keep your voices down.

419
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,580
They'll come back

420
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,110
once the novelty wears off.

421
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,020
Besides, Boss

422
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,650
doesn't want to start a price war.

423
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,930
We just need to

424
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,100
focus on our own desserts.

425
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,140
Since there are few customers,

426
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,700
we can all practice baking

427
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,690
in the kitchen.

428
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,530
Xianning, take everyone there.

429
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,340
Let's go.

430
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,860
Boss.

431
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,740
I looked into it.

432
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,480
It seems that the dessert chef at Sweet

433
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,430
received an email about our new product.

434
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,550
They tested it out,

435
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,960
and thought it was good,

436
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,420
so they tweaked it a little and used it.

437
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,100
Who sent this email? Did you find it?

438
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,180
It seems to be

439
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,780
a side account that hasn't been used in a while.

440
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,310
Jiang Sihan really is not stupid.

441
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,820
She was a step ahead of us

442
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,340
by using a side account.

443
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,570
We can't find out for sure

444
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,370
any time soon.

445
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,100
She didn't do it.

446
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,540
Boss, can you be so sure?

447
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
Do you have evidence?

448
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,100
No.

449
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,710
Then, why are you so sure?

450
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,310
Because I trust her.

451
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,990
Luckily, it's just a low fever.

452
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,560
Why does Sweet

453
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,350
have the same dessert as Sol?

454
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,090
I need to figure out

455
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,300
that newly opened dessert shop...

456
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,470
Why are you two here?

457
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,850
Ask him.

458
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,310
What's wrong, Rui Rui?

459
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,010
Did Uncle Jingyang bother you?

460
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,670
Godfather, Auntie didn't go on a business trip,

461
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,490
she really moved out!

462
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,100
You lied to me!

463
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,750
Rui Rui.

464
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,460
Auntie really is busy lately,

465
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,250
that's why she can't live with us.

466
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,150
You're lying!

467
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,630
Uncle told me everything.

468
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,490
Uncle, did Auntie move out?

469
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,550
Her slippers are gone,

470
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,470
she can't be on a business trip?

471
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,180
He asked.

472
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,590
Here.

473
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,570
I have no choice. I don't like lying.

474
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,250
Rui Rui.

475
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,470
Godfather and Auntie

476
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,050
didn't mean to lie to you.

477
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,060
Auntie really has something to do

479
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,180
during this time.

480
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,150
So, it's inconvenient for her to live with us.

481
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,730
Will Auntie come back?

482
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,020
Yes.

483
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,860
I promise you.

484
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,620
When I'm done,

485
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,790
the first thing I do is to get her back.

486
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,170
OK?

487
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:53,580
OK.

488
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,090
Come on, good sir.

489
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,450
Godfather, what are we eating today?

490
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,260
What do you want to eat?

491
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,370
I want steamed eggs made by Auntie.

492
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,840
She isn't here now.

493
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,310
I can call her,

494
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,010
and ask her to cook for me.

495
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,790
No answer.

496
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,220
Call her again.

497
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,660
Is anyone answering?

498
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,370
No.

499
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,190
Why are you here?

500
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
Who else could it be?

501
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,870
Taro?

502
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,300
Jiang Sihan just left,

503
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,660
and you're already abusing her nephew.

504
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,410
How can you feed a child junk food?

505
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,960
These are all my favorites.

506
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,770
What's up?

507
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,000
Nothing to do with you. I'm here for Taro.

508
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,240
The company can't get hold of her,

509
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,980
and she's supposed to post, but hasn't.

510
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,420
I'm a little worried about her.

511
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,550
You can't reach her?

512
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,210
I know Auntie's address and passcode.

513
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,160
Since Rui Rui is so worried,

514
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,830
I'll make a trip there.

515
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,890
Rui Rui is the only one who's worried?

516
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,810
What's there to pretend in front of me?

517
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,050
Tell me the address.

518
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,710
Watch him for a while,

519
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,660
I'll take a shower.

520
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:13,990
Okay.

521
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,290
Here.

522
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,940
Why am I so unlucky?

523
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,140
I see you even in my dreams.

524
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,120
I shouldn't have let you move out.

525
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,400
You can't even take care of yourself.

526
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,570
How can you say that?

527
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,820
If it weren't for you,

528
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,310
would I get drenched in the rain?

529
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,250
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,650
If you were even half this gentle

531
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,930
in real life,

532
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,140
you'd be so much cuter.

533
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,300
I'm a man.

534
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,730
Why should I be so cute?

535
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,320
Who will love you if you're not cute?

536
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,480
You want to die alone?

537
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,940
Are you worried about me?

538
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,070
Don't move.

539
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,180
We've already kissed.

540
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,970
What's wrong with touching?

541
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,060
This is my dream.

542
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,310
I can touch whatever I want.

543
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:20,530
♫Take my hand, I know how cold the world is♫

544
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,160
♫Don't be frightened now, don't be frightened now♫

545
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,630
♫My precious love♫

546
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:35,850
♫Come to me, when you have run your miles♫

547
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,890
♫For the thousandth time, you are perfect♫

548
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,400
♫Just as you are♫

549
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,700
♫At the end of the day, I will come to you♫

550
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,600
♫Run to you anyway, when the sky seems so gray♫

551
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,900
♫I am yours to save, yours to save♫

552
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,140
♫Always♫

553
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:11,860
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

554
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:20,410
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

555
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:30,940
♫Let me be the one whose heart you take as true♫

556
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,250
♫As true♫

557
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:48,420
♫I will run to you however slowly♫

558
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:56,730
♫Please be my one, my one and only♫

559
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:07,330

560
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,620
♫As true♫
