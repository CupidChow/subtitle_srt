♫Hold hands as the street lights flicker♫

[Since I Met You]

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,039
You mean Cheng Mu has depression

19
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,850
and panic disorder?

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,060
That's why he hasn't confessed to me yet

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,030
because he didn't want to be a burden to me.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,289
Yes.

23
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,410
Sihan, I'm telling you this

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,380
not to make you pity him

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
and to be with him.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,669
But to let you know

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,430
there's a reason why he hasn't confess to you.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
I hope you won't give up on him so soon.

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,780
Also,

30
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,920
think about

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,370
if you can

32
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,380
accept someone like this as your lover.

33
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,579
Yu,

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,750
let me think about it.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,730
You've said enough.

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,120
I...

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,780
Let her think about it.

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,710
Let's go.

39
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,990
We're leaving first then.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,350
Li Jingyang.

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,800
What are you doing?

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,500
Why didn't you let me finish?

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,410
You've said enough.

44
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,010
No.

45
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,820
I must help Cheng Mu

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,760
get Jiang SIhan.

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,390
Cheng Mu can't shoulder this pain now.

48
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,260
I didn't force her.

49
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,820
I just want her to think about Cheng Mu.

50
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,470
Cheng Mu has had it difficult all these years.

51
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,240
It's not easy to meet someone like her.

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,460
I don't want my brother to miss it.

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,260
Is that wrong?

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,430
Alright.

55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,820
I know

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,290
all these years,

57
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,730
you and Cheng Mu have had a hard time.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,780
But you've done enough.

59
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,940
And Cheng Mu is an adult.

60
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,110
Everyone can make their own decision.

61
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,380
Jingyang.

62
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,960
Since my brother met Jiang Sihan,

63
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,140
I feel like

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,290
he has come alive.

65
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,820
He is full of energy and vitality.

66
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,930
What should Cheng Mu do

67
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,550
if Jiang Sihan doesn't accept him?

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,260
It's okay.

69
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,060
Everything will be fine.

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
They will make their own decisions.

71
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,909
Don't worry.

72
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,720

[You'll be my first choice]

74
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,720
[Episode 12]

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,900
How have you been?

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,780
How's your business?

77
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,080
Not bad.

78
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,120
Master,

79
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,100
tell me,

80
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,910
what does it mean to have lived a life?

81
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,990
Tell me first

82
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,480
why do you want to live?

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,460
Because I don't want my sister to be sad.

84
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,320
Anything else?

85
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,230
Anything else?

86
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,820
I know.

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,580
You must have found

88
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,800
something you think is worth it.

89
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,260
But you're afraid.

90
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,740
Am I right?

91
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,510
I'm right.

92
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,650
It's someone.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
When I'm with her,

94
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,530
I feel happy,

95
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:43,980
jealous,

96
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,980
upset,

97
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,840
and sad.

98
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
But sometimes,

99
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,860
I feel very happy when I look at her.

100
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,620
Does she love you?

101
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,820
Did you ask her?

102
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:01,570
No.

103
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,760
Why didn't you ask?

104
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,760
Are you afraid that she doesn't like you?

105
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,020
No.

106
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,650
I'm afraid that she would

107
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,370
agree with me.

108
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,360
When you like someone,

109
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,250
I just want her to be well.

110
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,350
You used to say

111
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,800
we are half candles.

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,720
People like us

113
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,430
might go out one day.

114
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,710
This is unfair to her.

115
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,040
You

116
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,240
are really like me.

117
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,850
I had a family when I was young.

118
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,600
When I wasn't sick,

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,190
I wanted to make Xu's

120
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,530
the biggest chain store in the country.

121
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,750
So I borrowed a lot of money

122
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,710
to advertise

123
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,930
for franchising.

124
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,660
In the end, I was cheated, lost all my money

125
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,540
and fell sick.

126
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,820
Master,

127
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,550
you never told me these when I asked before.

128
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,670
Let me finish.

129
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,050
At that time,

130
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,900
we were going to get married right away.

131
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,420
When her parents saw my current state,

132
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,580
they think I'm very useless.

133
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,020
So I told her secretly

134
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,520
to break up with me.

135
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,910
If you love someone,

136
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,230
you only want the best for them.

137
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,430
So,

138
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,780
I moved out of

139
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,840
the small house we rented overnight.

140
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,220
And I left a break up letter.

141
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,300
But I didn't tell her about my illness.

142
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,620
I admitted myself to the hospital

143
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,740
and was there for many years.

144
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,700
During this period,

145
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,690
no one knew where I went.

146
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,210
What happened next?

147
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,760
Later,

148
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,780
I learned about her recent whereabouts from a friend.

149
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,280
She got married

150
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
and had a baby,

151
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
and is very happy.

152
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,710
Actually, I'm very happy too.

153
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,020
I think

154
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,100
I did the right thing.

155
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,050
Later, I gradually recovered.

156
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,340
When I first came home,

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,380
I learned from my parents

158
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,950
what happened these years.

159
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,060
My parents took out a thick bunch of letters.

160
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,020
She has been writing to me.

161
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,300
She was crazy,

162
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,510
and didn't understand.

163
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,460
Then it became a plead and filled with grievance.

164
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,060
In the end,

165
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,100
she said she hated me.

166
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,659
She hates you.

167
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,980
She must hate you for leaving without saying goodbye.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,390
Because she doesn't know you had your reasons.

169
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,039
No.

170
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,510
She learned everything

171
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,100
from my parents.

172
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,080
She hates me

173
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,040
for helping her make a choice.

174
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,420
She hates me

175
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,600
for not caring about her feelings at all.

176
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,060
She said everything I did

177
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,650
is selfish.

178
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,140
The kind of selfishness that stems from pride.

179
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,560
She said, though I'm saying I did it for her good,

180
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,260
in reality,

181
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,710
I actually took away her right to love someone properly.

182
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,320
What appeared the most in her letters

183
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,820
were, "Who do you think you are."

184
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,030
Just because you love her,

185
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,760
and want her to live a good life?

186
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,740
That's not love.

187
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,460
It's self-pity,

188
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,150
pretending to be benevolent.

189
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,620
That's what people do when they want to hide their cowardice.

190
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,060
Who are you to decide for her?

191
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,820
You don't even give her

192
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,780
basic respect.

193
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,300
How can you say you love her?

194
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,010
-I just think…
-What? I'm not finished yet.

195
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,980
No.

196
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,620
I think you are right.

197
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,620
I have to talk to her.

198
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,700
Wait.

199
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,130
Wait for my new desert,

200
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,440
called Confession.

201
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,520
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

202
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't turn off the lights when I sleep.

203
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,610
Sihan, I remember one year ago,

204
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,070
we were here too.

205
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,330
Class president.

206
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,750
Actually, a year ago,

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,860
I confessed to you.

208
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,230
At that time,

209
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,660
I prepared a love letter

210
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,350
to confess to you.

211
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,910
But when I was about to give it to you,

212
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,540
I heard that you were going abroad.

213
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,390
Then I stepped back.

214
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,520
Yet, I couldn't accept it.

215
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,660
So I took the courage

216
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,620
with the help of alcohol

217
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,670
to confess my love to you,

218
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,300
and put an end to my four-year crush.

219
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,580
Then why didn't I hear it?

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,200
Because I mistook someone else for you.

221
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,660
At that time,

222
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,750
I didn't expect

223
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,940
this person would become

224
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
so important to me in the future.

225
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,820
This time,

226
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,380
as usual,

227
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,080
I want to give myself some time

228
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,190
to sort out the feeling of breaking up

229
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,050
and start a new life.

230
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,810
Is he Cheng Mu?

231
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,650
But it doesn't seem to work.

232
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,940
You like him, don't you?

233
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,540
I can tell his mood from his dessert.

234
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
Isn't it amazing?

235
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,210
His happiness

236
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,270
and sadness,

237
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,180
I can feel it.

238
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,130
He is a complicated person.

239
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,740
But

240
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,180
he is also very simple.

241
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,770
I don't know when

242
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,170
I fell in love with him.

243
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,690
Class President,

244
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,780
I used to really like you.

245
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,420
But

246
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,180
let's move on with the past

247
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,930
and look forward.

248
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,540
Thank you for telling me these, Sihan.

249
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,470
It's a pity that I missed out on you.

250
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,150
But I hope you can have an even better life

251
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,310
in the future.

252
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,770
You too.

253
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,900
Do what you have to.

254
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,700
Just like how you did a year ago.

255
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,020
I don't know what I should do.

256
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,200
But one thing I'm sure is

257
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,550
I hope he is there

258
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,440
in my future.

259
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,030
Dr. Lin, I want to reduce the dosage of my medication again.

260
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,720
Again?

261
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,020
Didn't you reduce it once before?

262
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,880
Why do you want to reduce it again?

263
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,360
I want to try again.

264
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,360
Have you had any relapses lately?

265
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,270
Actually, in this year,

266
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,690
it doesn't happen as frequently anymore.

267
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,540
You know the previous few occurrences.

268
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,550
And it's getting more and more controllable.

269
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,660
Recently, I can actually stabilize my condition on my own.

270
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,920
It's indeed happening less than before.

271
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,700
I'll consider reducing the dosage for your medicine.

272
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,970
If your condition can remain stable

273
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,250
after this reduction,

274
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,860
we can consider

275
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,320
stopping the medication.

276
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,160
That'd be best.

277
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,240
But be careful.

278
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,180
You must control your emotions.

279
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,330
Don't be stimulated anymore.

280
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,140
If

281
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,730
your condition relapses,

282
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,020
it will be even worse than it is now.

283
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,390
Okay, thank you, Dr. Lin.

284
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Hello, Cheng Mu.

285
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,060
Sister.

286
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,880
I want to live a normal life.

287
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,170
What?

288
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,500
Say it again.

289
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,300
I said

290
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,970
I want to live a normal life.

291
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,100
Did you visit Dr. Lin?

292
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,950
I've talked to Dr. Lin.

293
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
If Sihan believes that I'm worth it,

294
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,660
I have no reason not to believe in myself.

295
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,200
