PRESENTATION CEREMONY OF EXCELLENT WORK
CERTIFICATION CEREMONY

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,910
We look forward to your film.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,580
Thank you.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,080
I'll do my best.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,120
We're here to audition
for the child actress.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,250
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,660
Si-won, pick one already.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,660
I'm going with him.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,580
I believe you'll be picking this one.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,540
Stop forcing him.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,450
- I'm not.
- It's up to him.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,450
Are you going to use narration?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,330
Hey, Lee Ji-hye!

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,910
You shouldn't be this way.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,120
Hey, what's your MBTI?

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,410
Why are you bringing that up here?

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,870
- Are you E or I?
- I'm normal.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,750
There's no such thing as "Norma."

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, where are you going?

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,120
- Hey!
- Sit down.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
- Choose one.
- Choose one.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,540
Isn't he better?

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,500
Was the scenario you sent yesterday
the completed version?

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
No.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,539
When are you going to send it to me then?

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,950
About shooting the living room.

27
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,950
There's an artist called Kang Han-bit.

28
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,120
I'll include some of her work
for you to choose

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,039
so you should make a choice.

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,039
Was it 8.25?

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello.

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,370
Oh, you're the handsome student,
aren't you?

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,700
- Yes...
- My wife said she can't do it.

34
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,580
She said she doesn't film
movies anymore. Sorry.

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,039
I'm coming.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,250
Jeez.

37
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,250
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Let's go somewhere.

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,079
Huh?

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,579
Where?

41
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,660
Great movie directors

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,700
work on their scenarios in hotels.

43
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,910
What?

44
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,950
Are you crazy? Sorry.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,660
Why are you so surprised?

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,250
I'm not surprised.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,660
You're dirty-minded.

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,040
I thought no such thing.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,790
Okay, let's go.

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,450
Let's go.

51
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,329
EP 08. WONDERFUL LIFE

52
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,790
This is what it's like to be an adult.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,500
Being able to go to places on impulse.

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,000
I came here in my last year
of high school.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Alone?

56
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Why?

58
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't remember.

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,750
You'd come this far. Something
must have happened.

60
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,870
I guess I'd come to see the sea.

61
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,500
You're lying.

62
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm not lying.

63
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,329
Do people remember things like that?

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,660
Not everything,

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,040
but when someone comes to a place
like this, they tend to remember.

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,450
You remember things when you're on a trip.

67
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,200
Things like the temperature,
the humidity, and the air.

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,500
Let's enjoy the roasted clams.

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,330
Have some.

70
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,830
How are they? Are they good?

71
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes, they're good.

72
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,580
What are you doing in Incheon?

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
No. Have fun.

74
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
Okay.

75
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,790
Yun-jeong.

76
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,120
Hello.

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,080
I didn't know Si-won had poor eyesight.

78
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,830
Yes.

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,910
That's why he's acting so ignorant.

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,580
He kept asking me to bring his glasses.

81
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,160
Yun-jeong.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,870
These...

83
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,409
I made these.

84
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,790
I thought you'd like them.

85
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,870
Ta-da.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,500
Did you really make them yourself?

87
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,830
You can have them if you want.

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,080
Thanks.

89
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,250
Can I have all of them?

90
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,870
Oh, that's...

91
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,450
I'm joking. You can have them all.

92
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,250
Shall we stay here a little longer?

93
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,160
Let's stay till late, and
grab a taxi back home.

94
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,160
Are you loaded?

95
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,000
About my scenario...

96
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,620
It's completely biographical.

97
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,250
I'm still confused.

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,660
I don't have confidence in my work,

99
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,040
and I'm not even sure if it's interesting.

100
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,750
But I still should do my best
since I got the support fund, right?

101
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,370
It takes so much to film a movie.

102
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,040
Money, time, and the people...

103
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,120
There's nothing I can do alone.

104
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,080
Shall we sit down for a bit?

105
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,040
I saw one in your room.

106
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,000
It seemed that you liked it.

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,250
I found it on the street.

108
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,080
What?

109
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,040
I told you everything about me.

110
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,790
I thought you might tell me
if I stare at you like this.

111
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,700
About me?

112
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,410
There's nothing to tell.

113
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,620
What do you mean?

114
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,700
There are many people who
are struggling more than me.

115
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,040
I shouldn't whine over small stuff.

116
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,540
That's nonsense.

117
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,790
Something that doesn't bother me
could be someone else's huge burden.

118
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,290
About pain...

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,789
It's an absolute thing for a person.

120
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,289
It's not something you can compare.

121
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,539
If I feel pain, then it is pain.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,539
Nobody can judge you.

123
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,200
Everyone has different tastes in film too.

124
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,040
Nobody can force a taste on someone.

125
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,410
That was the wrong metaphor.

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,580
Whatever. You know what I mean.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm not sure if I can even
give you any advice.

128
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,950
I always forget and hurt people.

129
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,950
Wait.

130
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

131
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,910
Relax.

132
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,580
Shall we spend a night here?
