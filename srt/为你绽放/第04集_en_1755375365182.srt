S#1. YUN-SEOK'S HOUSE
YUN-SEOK'S FATHER GETS UP HYEONG DA-WOON

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,570
What is it?

3
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,360
Hey.

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,490
What?

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,150
Hey, you.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,190
What are you going to do about
the painting you ruined the other day?

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,490
What do you mean?

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,030
She uploaded it on her 'Story.'

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,900
'I need to work again.'

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,490
- Really?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,450
She said it was okay.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,030
How did you see her 'Story?'

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,030
She uploaded it so I saw it.
Are you stupid?

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,860
Let me see.

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,610
Don't bother.

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,400
Anyway, from what I see,

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,450
treat her with something yummy.
You're more than welcome to invite me.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,400
My ass.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,990
I'm talking bullshit.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,950
Hey! Get out.

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,400
Hey, what's up?

22
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,610
Hey.

23
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,450
I was wondering if you forgot
about the trip tomorrow.

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,950
I didn't forget.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,110
We're going after our morning class.
I remember it.

26
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,360
Okay.

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
See you tomorrow.

28
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,990
Yeah.

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,690
Have a sweet dream.

30
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,780
What?

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,950
I wish you don't get a nightmare
and have a good night.

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,070
Oh.

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,360
Same to you. Whatever.

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,820
See you tomorrow. Good night.

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,280
Yeah.

36
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,490
EP 04. THE SECRET THAT CANNOT BE TOLD

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,860
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,610
Yun-jeong.

39
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,650
- You came early.
- Yes.

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,070
Take this.

41
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,490
What is it?

42
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,950
I'm sorry that I ruined your painting.

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,400
You shouldn't feel that way.

44
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,950
No way.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,070
If I were you, I'd have been annoyed.

46
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,570
I heard you like bread.

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,110
How did you know that?

48
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,230
Huh??

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,230
Eun-ha told me.

50
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,230
What a surprise.

51
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,530
Thank you so much.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,900
Don't mention it.

53
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,070
I'll get going then.

54
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,230
Good luck with your work.

55
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,610
Thanks.

56
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,320
Si-won.

57
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,230
What are you doing today?

58
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,690
I need to go somewhere for my assignment.
Why do you ask?

59
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,900
It's nothing. I'll see you later.

60
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,070
Sure.

61
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,529
Oh, that's...

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,740
I'm not sure if I'll submit mine.

63
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,280
Okay.

64
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,860
Was that Yeong-hwan?

65
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,690
Yeah.

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,610
He wants me to give him
feedback on his scenario.

67
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,230
Aren't you submitting yours?

68
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,610
I'm only a freshman. I don't think
I'll have a shot at it.

69
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,650
Is that so?

70
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,780
You never know though.

71
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,690
How about you? Are you submitting yours?

72
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,030
I'm not interested in direction.

73
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,990
I've never been to a 'book cafe.'

74
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,360
I went there because my dad took me.

75
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,150
It's just...

76
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,690
It's good to spend a long time there
since there are books.

77
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,780
Good.

78
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,740
The weather is good.

79
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,110
If you make a mistake on me,
will you buy me bread too?

80
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,190
What?

81
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,490
Just kidding.

82
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,110
I don't like bread.

83
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,450
Oh, this is it?

84
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,150
Yes.

85
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,900
Si-won.

86
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,740
Si-won!

87
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,490
I'm going to ride a bike now.

88
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,030
SI-WON BRO

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,860
MY RUNNING BIKE

90
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,950
BEADS BOY
Hello, everyone.

91
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,860
Following our last session,

92
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,570
we'll use materials like fresh-water pearls,
crystal beads, and silver balls.

93
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,190
We'll be making accessories...

94
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,570
- Si-yeong.
- Mom.

95
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,280
Look what your dad said.

96
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,570
I THINK I SAW SI-WON TODAY. CAN YOU SET
SOMETHING UP SO I CAN SEE THE KIDS?

97
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,190
There's no way you guys want to see him.

98
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,190
It's called karma.

99
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,530
Anyone wants to go
grocery shopping with me?

100
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,950
Don't you know how to ride a bike?

101
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,990
Huh?

102
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,110
No, it's not that.

103
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,570
It's been a while. That's why.

104
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,690
I'm embarrassed.

105
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,650
Sorry.

106
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,190
I just ran off.

107
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,190
Riding a bike makes me feel better
when my head is full.

108
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,450
I bet a person like you
wouldn't understand that.

109
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,650
Okay.

110
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,950
I don't know about now,

111
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,650
but I'll try it next time.

112
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,820
When I feel like my head is full.

113
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,230
Yeah.

114
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,230
Let's look for some other place
for the assignment.

115
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,450
I don't think I can go to that place.

116
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,820
You're not laughing today.

117
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,490
Do I laugh that often?

118
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,400
It's not 'often.' You laugh
every time I see you.

119
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,030
As if you're laughing at me.

120
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,230
I'm just saying.

121
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,990
Si-won, hold on.

122
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,490
At first,

123
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,780
I did that photo shoot once

124
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,900
for my friend who recently
opened his online clothing business.

125
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,030
And not greeting you

126
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,110
was because I have poor eyesight.
I probably didn't recognize you.

127
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,610
I can't greet someone I don't know, right?

128
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,110
And the reason why I kept laughing was...

129
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,780
It's because I find you cute.

130
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,820
What?

131
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,950
Don't ever laugh then.

132
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,530
Why not?

133
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,820
Why would you find me cute?

134
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,400
Leave me alone.

135
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,900
What a weirdo.

136
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,030
I told you to stop laughing.

137
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,360
When you laugh, my mind goes blank.

138
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,320
And I get quizzy so quit laughing.

139
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,950
I didn't mean anything bad.

140
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,320
I'm just kidding.

141
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,780
I know you don't mean bad.

142
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,990
What?

143
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,400
What was that?

144
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,610
Let's go.

145
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,450
Hey.

146
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,230
What was that?

147
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,780
What do you think about this place
for our assignment?

148
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,740
It's good, but tell me
what was that about.

149
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,610
It feels so nice to ride a bike.
It's been a long time.

150
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,450
Stop changing the subject.
What was that about?
