1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,820
Yun-jeong!

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,940
How did you know I was here?

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,570
I had a drink with Yu-jin today.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,780
She told me you're still working.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,530
I wanted to drop you off to your house.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,150
It's okay.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,280
You don't need to do that.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,980
I'll get going then.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,280
I...

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,070
Did I upset you in anyway?

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Sorry?

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,730
I just find it hilarious.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,110
I heard you're the art director
for Si-won's project.

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,900
When I asked you, you kept refusing.

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,030
I read Si-won's scenario
and decided to do it.

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,780
I sent you my scenario too.

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,820
Did you read mine?

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,650
Were you being choosey?

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,940
I did read yours.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,530
Sorry.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,440
Maybe you found my scenario difficult.

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,030
Maybe you couldn't analyze it properly.

23
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,730
The balloon wasn't the balloon that
you were thinking of,

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,900
but it was metaphor that represented
the character's emptiness...

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,030
I felt it was unnecessarily provocative.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,360
What?

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,900
What's provocative is Si-won's.

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,729
There's no depth to it,

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,610
and he just used his own story because
he's got nothing to talk about.

30
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,479
About the contest exhibit...

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,610
Putting aside Si-won's work, you didn't
even make it to the fifth place.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,360
So stop harassing both Si-won and me.

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,610
I'll go now.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,229
Hey.

35
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,320
You're going out with Si-won, aren't you?

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,780
Is this what it's about?

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,730
Are you two trying to
screw me over or what?

38
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,360
You're making me feel
unpleasant and scared.

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,320
What are you talking about?
We're at college.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,110
Did I hit you or curse at you?

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,150
Why do you hate me so much?

42
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,940
Yun-jeong, you're hurting me. Ouch!

43
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,230
I told you I'm scared.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,110
I envy you that this isn't a big for you.

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,320
Yun-jeong, you're hurting me. My hands!

46
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,980
What?

47
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,150
Hey, Do Ba-wu, you guys
set me up, didn't you?

48
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,900
You can think whatever the way you want.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,280
I knew it. You were the one
who uploaded Si-won's picture.

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I'll go ahead and delete it.

51
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,480
One more thing.

52
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,150
This.

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,610
You'd better keep quiet if you
don't want this to be leaked.

54
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,110
EP 07. AN ELEGANT LIE

55
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,480
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,650
RECORDED ITEMS
Did I hit you or curse at you?

57
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,070
I'll kick his ass if he harasses me again
since I have the recording now.

58
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,730
You kicked his ass enough.

59
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,110
Right.

60
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,440
I did that because I knew you were there.

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,780
If not, I couldn't have done that.

62
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,980
Are you okay?

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,070
Huh?

64
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,780
My heart is beating a little faster.

65
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,110
But I'm okay.

66
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,940
I can't believe these things are
actually happening in my life.

67
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,030
Is it that much fun to talk about others?

68
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,820
It will be okay.

69
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,280
Hyeong Da-woon and Cha Si-won
will be okay.

70
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,900
They have each other.

71
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,570
I guess.

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,150
Didn't you have feelings for Si-won?

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,860
Was it obvious?

74
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,070
Yeah.

75
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,230
It's not that I have feelings for him,

76
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,440
but it's just I like him as a person.

77
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,110
I'll sort my feelings out.

78
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,940
We didn't really do much together.

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,400
Yeah.

80
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,150
It would've be easier if there was
no memory between you guys.

81
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,030
It sounds like you have someone.

82
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,780
I do.

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,730
Someone who really doesn't get it.

84
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,440
It's not someone you know.

85
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,570
That's why you noticed it
earlier than others.

86
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,690
The comradeship that can't be explained.

87
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,900
I wish I can be good friends of you guys.

88
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,980
I guess you already are.

89
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,530
You supported me today.

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,400
I should've twisted his arms harder.

91
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,070
He could die.

92
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,110
Don't you feel sorry toward the chickens?

93
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,650
I know you guys need to have
chicken breast anyway.

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,190
I'll get you some plates.

95
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll give you a hand.

96
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,900
I read it all.

97
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,110
You deserve to win the contest.

98
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,150
It's really good.

99
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,650
I'm serious.

100
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,900
Do you see me teared up?

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,150
It's moving,

102
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,400
fun, and there are twists.

103
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,860
Really?

104
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,070
Are you sure you're okay?

105
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,360
We'll sleep here together, won't we?

106
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,150
What's that?

107
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,690
Huh?

108
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,650
What are you doing?

109
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,070
Why are you hiding here?

110
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,820
Why are you hiding here?

111
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,400
It's fun, isn't it?

112
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,570
My goodness, it's so fun.

113
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,730
Why are you showing it to me now?
I could've copied yours.

114
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,280
Thanks, you guys.

115
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,110
I heard it's his childhood story.

116
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,650
Is the purpose of production
important for a contest?

117
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,690
His work will make it to
the film festival no matter what.

118
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,480
Da-woon is filming it,
so there's no doubt.

119
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,900
One word from his parents,
it will make it to the film festival.

120
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,570
No way. Do you think so?

121
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,480
Do you think it's worked out well?

122
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,570
Everyone gave you the credit.

123
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,150
Some of them didn't like it.

124
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,110
You shouldn't worry too much.

125
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,530
Okay.

126
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,150
It's not like I'm aiming for
ten million audience.

127
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,150
Cha Si-won.

128
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,280
Do you have time?

129
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm Jeong Yu-jin from
Jungjang elementary school.

130
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,530
I honestly don't get it.

131
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,730
I should report it to
Korean Film Council. Damn it.

132
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,320
That's bullshit. It was all
because of Hyeong Da-woon.

133
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,570
It's not good at all.

134
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
What the...

135
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,150
Hey.

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,980
Have you lost it?

137
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,070
I'm sorry. I have bad eyesight.

138
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,860
Are you showing off because
you have rich parents?

139
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,360
Give me your account number.

140
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,900
Would one million won cut it?

141
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,570
You can spend the rest on
your production fee.

142
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,820
You little...

143
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,030
Call me when you know how much
the repair fee is.

144
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,440
I just really wanted to prove
that you and I were alumni.

145
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,690
Those guys didn't believe me.

146
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,400
It's okay. I understand.

147
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,280
You're Yun-jeong's friend as well...

148
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,320
I owe you one.

150
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,940
I...I was cute and cool back then too.

151
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,650
Right?

152
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,730
Yeah.

153
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Right.

154
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,650
It's good to meet you.
Let's stay in touch.

155
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,230
Sure.

156
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,320
Have you got an umbrella?

157
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,900
I haven't. How about you?
