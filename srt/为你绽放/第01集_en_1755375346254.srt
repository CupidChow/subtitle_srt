00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,010
Although lookism and appearance-oriented
views should be eliminated,

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,390
as long as humans exist on earth,
the concept will last forever.

AWARD CERTIFICATE

5
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,060
Hey, when did you come?

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,430
You look fine.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,390
Hey! Cha Si-yeong!

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,970
Do you want one?

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,260
Which one do you want?

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,060
Get lost.

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,470
What do you mean get lost?
I'm your older brother.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,970
I'll give you one. Hey!

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,100
- Get lost.
- Get lost?

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,310
Hey!

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,890
Are you pissed because you
didn't get any chocolate sticks?

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,970
People judge others based on their looks.

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,810
So did I,

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,720
and so did my mom.

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,470
- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,100
Welcome to Department of Film Studies
at Bareum University.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,890
Everyone's here today.

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,680
Nice to meet you all.

23
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,720
Before we start, I need
to hand out these documents.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,220
FRESHMEN ORIENTATION
AT DEPARTMENT OF FILM STUDIES

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,470
I'll do it.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,509
Oh, thank you, Si-won.
You can hand them out in a bit.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Sure.

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,640
Before we start, we need to elect
a leader of class of 2021.

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,930
Okay, why don't Si-won become the leader?

30
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,760
Give him a round of applause.

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,350
I wanted you to become the leader
from the beginning.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,640
Leadership and one's appearance
are in proportion.

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,350
Oh, the one who was missing today,
Hyeong Da-woon.

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,350
I heard he's handsome too.

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,180
This year's kids are good.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,930
No way. I'm flattered.

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,430
I'm telling you. You have a small face,

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
and you're so handsome.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,560
Thank you.

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,470
- Keep it up.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,810
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

42
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,220
A popular person himself just shines.

43
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,220
EP 01. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH BEING POPULAR

44
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,310
BLUEMING
'COLORED BY YOU'

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,640
Aren't you going to school?
Do you know what time it is?

46
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,680
- Shut it.
- Hey.

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,510
Look at the state of you.

48
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,760
It's been a few days. You can't
even hold your drinks that well.

49
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,600
I told you to throw things like this
as soon as you're done.

50
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,850
Who did this?

51
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,970
Cha Si-won did.

52
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,180
Come on.

53
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,060
I know it was you.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,390
You can consider I started my career.

55
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,260
You know what it's like at the movie scene.
It's all about connections.

56
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,140
Now that I'm the leader of my class,
I know a lot of senior students.

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,350
Everyone knows who I am though
the semester hasn't even begun.

58
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,680
A leader of the class?

59
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,810
Doesn't it cost a lot of money?

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,640
No. I got it covered.

61
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,140
He's worked day and night during
the vacation. He should have enough.

62
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,220
Jeez. Don't we have soda or orange juice?

63
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,430
Have you forgotten how you've lost weight?

64
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,310
By the way, didn't you cry yesterday?

65
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,720
Hey, it just happened once.

66
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,510
'Cha Si-yeong, don't you think
my triceps have gone soft?'

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,260
They're still there.

68
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,970
'I should stop drinking.'

69
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,970
Who do you take it after crying
like that every time you drink?

70
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,140
I guess there's only one person
who doesn't know the answer.

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,470
Si-yeong, I told you to drink
the protein shake instead of that.

72
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,930
I'm sick of it.

73
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,010
There's coconut flavor launched this time.
It's popular.

74
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,010
Strawberry coconut
and chocolate coconut...

75
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,850
Banana coconut and plain coconut.
There's coconut everywhere.

76
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,310
- I'm off. See you later.
- Bye.

77
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,220
Mom.

78
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,390
Right.

79
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
- See you this evening.
- Bye, mom.

80
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,510
Bye.

81
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,260
Hey, can you trim my eyebrows?

82
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,470
Who are you going to meet?

83
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,470
CLASS OF 21, HYEONG DA-WOON

84
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,850
Hello.

85
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,180
I'm sorry, but my shooting
has been delayed.

86
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,350
I think it will be done in an hour time.

87
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,390
What do you think we should do?

88
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,850
Can you set up the lights here?

89
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,640
Sure.

90
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,760
Okay.

91
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,600
Everything's been great so far.

92
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,930
This time, let's not look at the camera.

93
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,850
Let's take the trial shot first.

94
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,310
Would you like to take a seat
and wait for a bit?

95
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,010
I'll be done soon.

96
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,640
Here we go.

97
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,390
Once you put all the subjects
in the 'basket,'

98
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,060
and make your priority then
click on them, you're done.

99
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,970
I'm off now. Thank you for everything.

100
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,260
Thank you.

101
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,350
You did well today. Good-bye.

102
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,220
Sorry.

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,810
It's cool.

104
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,640
- So...
- Yes.

105
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,220
According to the seniors, it's
good to have an external hard drive.

106
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,310
Right.

107
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,890
Is there anything else you want to know?

108
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,640
I was worried since I missed
the orientation. Thank you.

109
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,680
Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal.

110
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,220
By the way,

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,470
do you have shootings like this often?

112
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,850
Not really. It's for the photo shoot
for my friend's online shopping mall.

113
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,760
I just helped him for a bit.
I didn't know it would take this long.

114
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,600
- Do you want to have lunch together?
- Huh?

115
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,720
I feel bad that you came all the way here.

116
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,470
It's okay. I'm meeting someone.

117
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,890
Oh, that's right.

118
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,060
I have a photo shoot to get to.

119
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
Okay.

120
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,850
- Thank you.
- Sure.

121
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,010
- See you later.
- Sure.

122
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,430
Good-bye.

123
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,220
COMMENCEMENT OF LECTURES
