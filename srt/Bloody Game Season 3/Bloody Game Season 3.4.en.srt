1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,950
The player who placed last
in the Money Challenge today was...

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,750
Joo Eon Kyu.

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,660
I blamed myself.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,000
- Pani placed 2nd to last.
- Did you say 2nd to last?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,160
Si Yoon placed last.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,929
- Did you say that Si Yoon placed last?
- Yes.

7
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,000
At that moment, my head went blank.

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,439
I need to put my brain to work.

9
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,070
Why can't I divert my thoughts?

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,509
Why can't I stretch my imagination?

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,350
I told myself to focus on the game,

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,920
but I couldn't control my mind.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,219
I'll ask this one about Leo.
I'll ask if Leo was murdered.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,920
I'll ask another question.

15
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,490
- Let me connect these.
- Okay.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,759
For me, Eon Kyu asked...

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,130
a lot of questions on purpose.

18
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,399
He didn't tell me about
the ones he got wrong.

19
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,229
He only shared the correct information.

20
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,140
I feel bad for Eon Kyu
because I played badly.

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,609
I'm sorry, Eon Kyu.

22
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,480
What?

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,219
Before shedding tears,

24
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,920
he should've done more
for the victory of the team...

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,689
and played with the determination
to shed tears of blood.

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,890
It was unexpected.

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,129
The player who played last
in the Money Challenge, Joo Eon Kyu...

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,670
will automatically become
the elimination candidate...

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,370
and participate in the Deathmatch.

30
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,069
Joo Eon Kyu, please enter
the voting room immediately...

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,640
and pick two elimination candidates
aside from Heo Seong Beom...

32
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,579
and Jang Dong Min who'll participate
in the Deathmatch with you.

33
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,549
It didn't take me long to decide.

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,959
I think I made the choice in five seconds.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,099
You startled me.

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,830
The results will be announced.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,509
The first player
who was chosen by Joo Eon Kyu...

38
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,870
for the Deathmatch was...

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,780
Pani Bottle.

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,620
For goodness' sake.
I told him not to do that.

41
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,650
If you get chosen
for the Deathmatch two days in a row,

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,590
you're bound to have a mental breakdown.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,460
Even the optimistic Pani was
a bit annoyed.

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,159
Since yesterday,
Pani has been going around...

45
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,270
saying, "I'm not good at playing games."

46
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,039
I think he got chosen
because he was an easy target.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,169
The second player
who was chosen by Joo Eon Kyu...

48
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,509
for the Deathmatch was...

49
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,419
Hong Jin Ho.

50
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,719
Why did he choose me?
I might get all the votes.

51
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,719
Why did he choose me?
For goodness' sake. It isn't okay.

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,229
"Is Eon Kyu really trying..."

53
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,930
"to take me on as an enemy?"

54
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,500
I had that thought.

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,300
To be honest,
I wasn't very happy that he chose me.

56
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,969
Why isn't Jin Ho sending a message?

57
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,939
Is he busy playing games?

58
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,680
Which penalty does a spy get...

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,979
for not being involved in espionage?

60
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,310
If the raid fails,
he needs to come back out.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,550
Does the spy need to return
if the raid fails?

62
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,620
Yes.

63
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,250
In that sense, we have...

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,159
the same interests.

65
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,030
I don't know if our spy collapsed,

66
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,030
forgot about us, or became a double agent.

67
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,539
He hasn't kept in touch.

68
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,939
We didn't receive a single message
from the spy, Jin Ho.

69
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,110
Perhaps he's having...

70
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,110
a fun time in Paradise.

71
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,680
Perhaps that's why he forgot about us.

72
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,979
Perhaps he switched to Team Paradise.
I had various thoughts.

73
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,520
What is it?

74
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,159
Is it a message from Jin Ho?

75
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,259
- Please.
- Let's see.

76
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,699
(The results of the Money Challenge
in Paradise have arrived.)

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,639
What?

78
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,639
(The player who placed last, Joo Eon Kyu)

79
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,839
(Deathmatch candidates,
Pani Bottle and Spy Hong Jin Ho)

80
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,410
- Jin Ho must be under suspicion.
- Yes.

81
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,879
That might be the case.

82
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,620
If the Deathmatch is like
what we had yesterday,

83
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,120
Jin Ho...

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,129
won't get eliminated
even if he comes here.

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,360
I hope the spy...

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,170
hasn't changed his mind.

87
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,529
We didn't receive any messages from him...

88
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,170
before that happened.

89
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,209
If he had done something suspicious,

90
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,410
he should've messaged us.

91
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,579
Seriously.
He isn't doing his job as a spy.

92
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,620
I mean, he should've been more useful.

93
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,389
All players, please vote...

94
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,329
for one player...

95
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,829
for the Deathmatch.

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,439
The vote will end in an hour.

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,670
An hour?

98
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,509
Shall we talk by ourselves?

99
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,079
Two of us got chosen.

100
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,480
We can do that.

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,079
- Shall we talk?
- Okay.

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,019
- I'm sick and tired of this.
- An hour is a lot.

103
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,949
It's unfair that he chose
two members of the same team.

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,490
Jin Ho, what should I do...

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,689
to make everyone vote for me?

106
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,069
I'll participate in the Deathmatch today.

107
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,540
Let's talk for a second. It won't be long.

108
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
(Before Round 2 began,
Pani Bottle talked to the teammates.)

109
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,810
Jin Ho, since yesterday,

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,279
- you said this jokingly.
- What?

111
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,250
"Go and see if you're curious about
whether or not there's a team outside."

112
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm curious about whether or not
they actually got eliminated.

113
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,920
You should go and see tomorrow.

114
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,759
When someone gets eliminated tomorrow...

115
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,019
Don't decide on it now.

116
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,959
It was just a question.

117
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,529
Tomorrow, I'll be like,
"You heard him yesterday, right?"

118
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:30,860
"Vote for Pani today."

119
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,769
I never said that I'd actually go.

120
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,569
To be honest, I said back then
that I was joking around.

121
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:37,800
But I was serious.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,870
There's something that's hidden.

123
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,610
I bet the eliminated members
didn't go home.

124
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,509
I bet they're somewhere and making a move.

125
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,050
Curiosity is driving me crazy.

126
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,750
"What is it? What's the secret?"

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
My anus is itching.

128
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,750
I feel like I'm missing something.

129
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,149
"I must scratch this itch."

130
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,290
I like Dong Min a lot.

131
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,360
But I don't want one person to go,

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,259
"You do this and you do that."

133
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,459
I don't want to see someone
move up like that.

134
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,170
I don't know if I can say this,
but I want to get eliminated.

135
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:10,670
Being in this group
and getting played by Dong Min...

136
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,569
doesn't satisfy me.
That's why I don't want to stay here.

137
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,470
I want to do whatever I can...

138
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,240
to eliminate Dong Min
or take him on at the very least.

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,439
Judging by what we've seen
yesterday and today,

140
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,949
it's obvious
that he can't be beaten in games.

141
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,980
There must be something we can use
other than our brains.

142
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,480
I need to go to another team.

143
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,389
I don't know what the method is just yet,
but there's a high possibility...

144
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,519
that an elimination will get me there.
That's why I want to go there.

145
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm no match inside.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,389
If something is outside,

147
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,490
I want to go there and take Dong Min on.

148
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,230
I'm like a whale catcher...

149
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,370
who really wants to take on a whale...

150
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,040
with a single harpoon out of respect.

151
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,269
- If you can put up with it...
- I'll do it.

152
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,879
It was a good situation for me.

153
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,750
When I talked to the members
before coming here, it was like,

154
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,579
Who do you want? Someone smart or strong?

155
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,920
The two of you are smart,
so we need someone strong.

156
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,959
Pani is the type to play the games
with his body, not his brain.

157
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,360
So I think he's a good candidate.

158
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,699
Let me give you advice as someone...

159
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,360
- who has been there.
- Okay.

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,730
If you're determined to go there
out of curiosity,

161
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,639
it's better to go there
because you got picked,

162
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,170
not because you placed last.

163
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,110
I don't know what it is,
but there must be something.

164
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,779
Eon Kyu.

165
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,139
(He approached Eon Kyu before he chose
the Deathmatch candidates.)

166
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,350
Let's have a match.

167
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,149
I'm serious. Eon Kyu.

168
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,580
Eon Kyu!

169
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,049
Make sure to pick me. I'm serious.

170
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,690
If Dong Min hadn't received
the Immunity Pass,

171
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,919
I would've picked him.

172
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,159
But Pani suddenly said something strange.

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,960
He asked me to pick him
without asking him why.

174
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,370
His facial expression was so solemn.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,610
It was my first time seeing Pani Bottle
make such a scary facial expression.

176
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,279
I was like, "Is something going on?"

177
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,009
Then we entered the Main Hall.

178
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,649
My goodness.

179
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,419
- What?
- Don't pick me.

180
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,419
(He acted like he didn't want to go
to the Deathmatch.)

181
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,850
- I mean...
- I'll stab you.

182
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,620
He said, "I'll stab you if you pick me."

183
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,720
I was like, "What's going on?"

184
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,759
The first player who was chosen
for the Deathmatch was...

185
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,559
Pani Bottle.

186
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,059
(He became a Deathmatch candidate
as he intended.)

187
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,769
I was happy,
but I pretended to be unhappy.

188
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,940
The second player who was chosen
for the Deathmatch was...

189
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,840
Hong Jin Ho.

190
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,610
I didn't think of that.

191
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,240
I should've given him
the second player as well.

192
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,679
I only told him about myself.

193
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,820
Why did he make Jin Ho a candidate?
For goodness' sake.

194
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,549
For goodness' sake. Why?

195
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,490
I can't believe Eon Kyu.

196
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,990
For goodness' sake.

197
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,860
I think it'll be best if you go, but...

198
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,230
It isn't a matter of what'll be best.
I have to go.

199
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,669
And I'm worried about Dong Min.

200
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,500
He's too quick-witted.

201
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,610
I hid the fact that I wanted to go...

202
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,379
to the Deathmatch from Dong Min...

203
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,110
because it was my desire
to challenge Dong Min in a different way.

204
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,009
He's quick-witted,

205
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,419
so he might raise his guard...

206
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,220
if I talk too much.

207
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,419
Shall we talk for a second?

208
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,169
- Can I go?
- Would you please go...

209
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,539
and tell them to vote for me?

210
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,700
I'll tell them.

211
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,039
- Not Jin Ho.
- Okay.

212
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,409
I'm pretty sure they'll vote for me,

213
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,279
- but Dong Min is quick-witted.
- Yes.

214
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,509
He might say, "Let's send Jin Ho instead
since Pani actually wants to go."

215
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,220
- I had that thought.
- I'm really worried about that.

216
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,220
- I think that might happen.
- He took people outside to talk.

217
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,620
Seriously.
Why would he talk to them about this?

218
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
- What do you mean?
- This isn't important to them.

219
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,830
Why do they need to talk?

220
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,559
I think they want to send Jin Ho.

221
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,629
Seriously. Would you please go
and tell them to vote for me?

222
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,570
- Me? Shall I do that?
- Just go and read the room.

223
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,529
- If it's obvious...
- Just go and read the room.

224
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,039
- Just listen.
- Shall I just listen?

225
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,269
- Okay.
- Okay.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,440
For goodness' sake. Why...

227
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,840
Why did he choose you? For goodness' sake.

228
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,879
My goodness.

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,879
May I... May I join?

230
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,919
Sure.

231
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,149
Whom should I vote for?

232
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,490
I really don't know.

233
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,700
If the two of them talk...

234
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,830
and decide on who should go,
would you oblige?

235
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,000
- If that's the case, we'll oblige.
- Then we'll oblige.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
In that case, Pani decided to go.

237
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,409
- Pani decided to go? Why?
- Yes.

238
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,610
Jin Ho doesn't want to go.

239
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,850
And Pani wants to?

240
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,679
I don't know how
they reached the conclusion.

241
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,750
They just told me that much.

242
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,450
No one would want to go.

243
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,559
There was no reason.

244
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,590
I was a bit confused.

245
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,230
- Let's listen to them first.
- Okay.

246
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,730
They want to hear it from you guys.

247
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,100
We just came to listen.

248
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,500
- Is that so?
- Yes.

249
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,240
- There's nothing.
- What do you mean?

250
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm annoyed that I got picked again.

251
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,009
Pani is like, "I'll go if I get picked."

252
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,080
But both of you are in the same situation
as yesterday.

253
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,049
Pani was a Deathmatch candidate...

254
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,320
- yesterday,
- Yes.

255
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,720
- You became a Deathmatch candidate today.
- Yes.

256
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,389
So what's your thought?

257
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,629
Jin Ho is the type...

258
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,360
who's sincere.

259
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,830
You need to talk.

260
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,799
Right?

261
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,169
Just vote for whoever you want.

262
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,840
Shall we vote for someone we like?

263
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,080
Is he really a spy?

264
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,549
Otherwise, why would he...

265
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,279
I didn't think that Eon Kyu would pick me.

266
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,490
It's so annoying.

267
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,549
- I know. It was unexpected.
- I had the same thought.

268
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,129
Eon Kyu and I talked a lot upstairs.

269
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:11,200
He said that he wanted to pick someone...

270
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,529
he could have a cool showoff with
for the Deathmatch.

271
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,200
I think it's...

272
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
a total nonsense.

273
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,509
It's the kind of talk I absolutely hate.

274
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:25,679
He just sugar-coated his intention
with nice words.

275
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,649
It means that he'll be hostile toward me.

276
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,820
Then he shouldn't have asked me
to team up with him today...

277
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,980
in the first place.

278
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,350
He was supposed to team up with me.

279
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,090
It changed because he suddenly teamed up
with you.

280
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,190
- Really?
- Yes.

281
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,190
Eon Kyu and I had beef...

282
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,860
over things like this when we met
on another game show.

283
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,129
There are no interests between us,

284
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,000
but he challenges me because
he thinks victory will be incredible...

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and defeat won't make him look bad.

286
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,370
I hate it so much.

287
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,139
When I heard that Eon Kyu picked me again
with such an excuse,

288
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,009
I thought to myself,
"There's no hope for Eon Kyu."

289
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,779
If I go to the Deathmatch,
I'll end Eon Kyu with my own hands.

290
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,210
Jin Ho.

291
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,080
Let's stop talking...

292
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,250
and tell them to do what they want to do.

293
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,149
- Just...
- Yes. Let's do that.

294
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,690
do what you want, you punk.

295
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,190
Let's stop wasting time
and get this over with.

296
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,789
Do what you want to do.

297
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,429
Voting is over.

298
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,370
Please gather at the Main Hall
on the second floor.

299
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,139
Between Pani Bottle and Hong Jin Ho
who have been selected...

300
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,210
by Joo Eon Kyu,

301
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,850
the player voted for the Deathmatch is...

302
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,059
Pani Bottle.

303
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,230
I needed to deceive Dong Min...

304
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,059
and make him vote for me.

305
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,370
I wanted to keep him from finding out
about my true intention.

306
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,299
I was wary about that. I was wary...

307
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,070
that Dong Min would see through my act.

308
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,009
Shall I tell you honestly?

309
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,610
- Yes.
- I...

310
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,779
I avoided the Deathmatch yesterday, right?

311
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,190
Today, to be honest,

312
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,519
I want to go and check.

313
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,960
I want to know what I can do.

314
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,159
I can't avoid it forever.

315
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,529
The run will end someday.

316
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,200
I acted passionately.

317
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,799
I told Dong Min, "I'm upset..."

318
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,039
"that I keep getting picked
as a candidate."

319
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,299
"So I want to show everyone."

320
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,610
In a second,

321
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:40,080
many thoughts flitted through my mind.

322
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,210
"Am I going overboard?"

323
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,220
"If I trust Pani today,"

324
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,320
"he'll be truthful to me
for once or twice in the future."

325
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,759
I had that thought.

326
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,230
You have the capability to win.
I'm certain that you'll win.

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,470
Dong Min told me...

328
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,669
that he hated backstabbing people.

329
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,100
I think backstabbing is...

330
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,940
a method in this game.

331
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,379
I'll even use the method...

332
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,879
Dong Min hates...

333
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,950
and defeat the raid boss.

334
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,649
I'll do anything.

335
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,649
I'm certain that there'll be something.

336
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,820
What will I do if there's nothing?

337
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,730
Then I'll become a fool
who died due to his curiosity.

338
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,990
People will call me a fool
who got eliminated...

339
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,159
due to a stupid belief,

340
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,299
but it can't be helped
since this is my choice.

341
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,539
The result must be out.

342
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,009
- Pani is coming.
- I see.

343
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,309
The result of the vote at Paradise.

344
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Eon Kyu, Pani,

345
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,549
- Xitsuh, and Steve Yea.
- The two of them.

346
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
Okay.

347
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,980
Then the spy is still in.

348
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,259
My goodness. Who will join us today?

349
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,389
My goodness.

350
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,359
What's this?

351
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,630
This is a place for a 1-on-1 match.

352
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,829
What's this?

353
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,069
For goodness' sake.

354
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,940
Today's Deathmatch is...

355
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,309
the 2-on-2 Deathmatch.

356
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,279
The players who will play the Deathmatch
against the two of you will be revealed.

357
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,289
Pa...

358
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,450
- Pani Bottle?
- What?

359
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
What?

360
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,259
- What?
- What's going on?

361
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:38,000
There are two players from Mansion.

362
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,259
When I heard that it was a 2-on-2 match,

363
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,769
I thought that we might go against
the outside players we imagined.

364
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:47,369
When I saw Pani Bottle, I thought,

365
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,279
"They were actually here." I also thought,

366
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,609
"We have a chance."

367
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,609
Wasn't he on Season Two?

368
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,220
I saw Xitsuh. Next to him was...

369
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,819
an older man who looked like a loan shark.

370
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,150
I heard that he was a poker player.

371
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,359
The combination was so charismatic
that I thought, "This won't be easy."

372
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,690
But I decided not to be intimidated.

373
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,200
Team Paradise's elimination candidate...

374
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,700
is the player who placed last
in the Money Challenge, Joo Eon Kyu.

375
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,769
Team Mansion's elimination candidate...

376
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:21,269
is the player who placed last
in the Money Challenge, Xitsuh.

377
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,869
Are you guys Team Mansion?

378
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,779
- Are you guys Team Paradise?
- Yes.

379
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,839
Paradise sounds better.

380
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,009
Today's Deathmatch will be revealed.

381
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,819
Today's Deathmatch is...

382
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,319
the Balance Match.

383
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,160
For the Balance Match,

384
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,289
teammates must work together for a mission
that requires a specific talent...

385
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,359
and carry it out successfully
in the number of times that was bet.

386
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,470
There will be a total of five rounds.

387
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,130
Once each round begins,

388
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,000
the mission will be revealed.

389
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,109
Each team will discuss the number
each player can successfully carry out...

390
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,240
the mission for ten minutes.

391
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,940
After checking the opposing team's number,

392
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,210
you can change your team's number.

393
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,750
Between the two teams,

394
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,950
the team that claimed to carry out
the mission more or faster...

395
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,390
will get a chance
to try the mission first.

396
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,130
The team must carry out the mission
in the same number they bet...

397
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,490
or higher.

398
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,930
If the team succeeds in it,
they will acquire two points.

399
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,529
If the team fails,

400
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,039
the other team gets a chance to try.

401
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,170
If the other team succeeds,

402
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,240
that team wins a point.

403
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,609
If they fail, they win zero points.

404
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,009
After the end of five rounds,

405
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,950
the team with more points wins.

406
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,250
First, with someone like Steve Yea,

407
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,089
he's an expert in betting.

408
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,589
Psychological warfare is important.

409
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,490
I just have to call out
the maximum I can do...

410
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,099
in a balance match.

411
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,359
In the end, it has nothing
to do with the opponent.

412
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,529
I'll just go for the maximum I can do.

413
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,900
I think that was my basic strategy.

414
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,170
Round One will now begin.

415
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,569
Round Two will now begin.

416
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,380
The mission for Round One is...

417
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,180
Find the Difference.

418
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,710
The mission for Round Two is...

419
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
Move the Blocks.

420
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,019
Xitsuh, Steve Yea.

421
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,990
You have succeeded in Round One.

422
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:18,160
Joo Eon Kyu, Pani Bottle.

423
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,289
You have succeeded in Round Two.

424
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,960
(They are tied 1 to 1.)

425
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,200
Round Three will now begin.

426
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,400
The skill required
in Round Three's mission is...

427
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,170
spatial recognition.

428
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,470
The mission for Round Three
will be revealed.

429
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,670
It is a Maze Code.

430
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,079
In Maze Code, you must figure out
the location of the question mark...

431
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,150
in the 3D maze and find the coordinates
on the maze image.

432
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,019
The teams will compete to see
how long it will take you to solve...

433
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,920
a total of three Maze Code problems.

434
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,160
Do you want to go 1st or 2nd?

435
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,160
I think the number I can do
is more important.

436
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,259
- Really?
- Going 1st or 2nd doesn't matter.

437
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,359
The more I think about it,
I should play like an actual card game.

438
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,730
Since we have a pro poker player,

439
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:05,700
if I play this in a fake way,

440
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,539
I might become humiliated.

441
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,769
But this is better to go first.

442
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,640
- Definitely.
- If you go 1st, it's 2 points.

443
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,980
It's definitely better to go first.

444
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,980
Let's estimate 15 minutes
which should be plenty of time.

445
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,380
Let's see how the other team does
and reduce the time from there.

446
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,950
What's important in this game...

447
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,549
is to get the question right
in the most stable way...

448
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,890
and to get a higher number
than the other team.

449
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,089
So, it's important for us to predict
the number from the other team...

450
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,559
and make a bet.

451
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,400
I felt that if we call
too high a number for the bet,

452
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,069
this might become difficult.

453
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,369
Let's make a good enough bet.

454
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,440
Let's not go too high.

455
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,170
This is really hard.

456
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,980
Why is it so hard? I can't find it.

457
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,380
I can't find this either.

458
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,250
Gosh, what do we do?

459
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,549
At first, this was just in 3D.

460
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,190
Thinking about this
while looking at it in 3D,

461
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,450
it was way too hard.

462
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,720
- We don't have time.
- Quickly.

463
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,660
Should we just talk the first one through
since we don't have time?

464
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:00,920
- Five minutes.
- Fifteen minutes.

465
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,430
Five minutes? What's this?

466
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,460
- Is that so?
- Are they faking?

467
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,529
I think so.

468
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:08,299
But changing the 3D into 2D...

469
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,099
and finding the parts that overlap,

470
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,339
it became doable.

471
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,740
You have 30 seconds left.

472
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,910
One more time, then. Let's write it down.

473
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,410
It could be a fake.

474
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,910
What do you say? Just ten minutes?

475
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,450
Twelve minutes? Ten or eleven...
I think ten would be fine.

476
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,680
Or let's say ten minutes
so we don't get tied.

477
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,819
Okay.

478
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,549
- I wrote it on my palm.
- Okay.

479
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:28,849
- You can go first.
- We'll go.

480
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,220
Ten minutes.

481
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,089
- Eight minutes.
- Okay.

482
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,619
The betting is over.

483
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,990
We didn't expect eight minutes.

484
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:42,500
Pani Bottle and Joo Eon Kyu,
you will try for eight minutes.

485
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,279
I thought, "Did we call
too low a number for our bet?"

486
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,980
But then...

487
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,549
My gosh.

488
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,920
It was pretty doable once we got started.

489
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,220
So, I solved it.

490
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,759
U6.

491
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,259
They can really do it quickly.

492
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,859
U6 is correct.

493
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,269
Genius.

494
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,470
E18.

495
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,779
E18 is correct.

496
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,039
What is this?

497
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,710
Gosh, we got it wrong.

498
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,279
Goodness.

499
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,490
H1.

500
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,589
H1 is correct.

501
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,930
(Joo Eon Kyu and Pani Bottle
succeed in their first attack.)

502
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,660
We were close.

503
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,230
"Hey, I'm pretty good
at this kind of thing."

504
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,900
That was what I thought.

505
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,569
I didn't know.

506
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,339
This time, really...

507
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,579
Joo Eon Kyu and Pani Bottle.

508
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,180
You've succeeded in the mission.

509
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,410
(Xitsuh, Steve Yea: 1,
Joo Eon Kyu, Pani Bottle: 3)

510
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,349
We were lagging behind 3 to 1.

511
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:11,019
If we want to overturn this game,

512
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,519
we had to win two points at least once.

513
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,990
The game could end in Round Four too.

514
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,660
Round Four will now begin.

515
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,329
The skill required
in Round Four's mission is...

516
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,430
memorization.

517
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,839
The mission
for Round Four will be revealed.

518
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,579
It's Card Memory.

519
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:34,109
Card Memory has two sets of cards.

520
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,109
A set of 50 cards with numbers on them
between 0 to 9 mixed randomly...

521
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,220
and two sets of alphabet cards
with letters on them from A to Z.

522
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,619
This game is about predicting
how many cards the player can memorize...

523
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:45,289
in order.

524
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,029
Should we make bets like earlier again?

525
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,829
- We're going twice.
- At the same time.

526
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,470
This is what I think. Honestly,

527
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,569
it might be wrong to do this
without even trying first,

528
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:02,269
but he's a poker player.
He can count cards.

529
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,640
From a regular person's stance,
you could get 20 cards if you try hard.

530
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,009
If you try harder,
it would be about 30 cards.

531
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,210
But as a pro poker player,
he could get about 50 cards.

532
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,480
We can't do that.

533
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,450
Right. That's impossible.

534
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,819
That's impossible for us.

535
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,490
It won't be easy to beat that.

536
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,160
- So, let's just call a very high number.
- Right.

537
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,089
Let's lose and only give them one point.

538
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,759
- That would be better.
- Three to two.

539
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,460
Yes, right.

540
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,700
That's not bad.

541
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,900
In the Balance Match, you win 2 points
if you attack 1st and succeed.

542
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,970
If you attack 2nd and succeed,
you win 1 point.

543
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,210
In Joo Eon Kyu and Pani Bottle's case,
you succeeded in attacking 1st in Round 3.

544
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,680
As long as you don't lose
the initial attack in Round Four,

545
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,410
you can maintain your lead with 3 to 2...

546
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,950
even if Xitsuh and Steve Yea
succeed in attacking second.

547
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,480
This won't work in a memorization game.

548
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,220
Our opponent is a poker player.

549
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,190
It's his job to memorize cards.

550
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,019
But we're playing a game
where we memorize cards.

551
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,259
We're at a big disadvantage.

552
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,460
At first, let's call 20 cards.

553
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,099
Second, let's call 80 cards.

554
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,160
Let's do that.

555
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,269
Well, I'll go with what you decide.

556
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,599
Let's just throw this game.

557
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,470
Unless they're fools,
they have to call 102.

558
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,950
If not 102,
they at least have to call 60 to 70.

559
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,980
When we thought about...

560
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,180
what the other team might do
from their perspective,

561
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,089
they might just take the first attack.

562
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:26,619
Even if I get 0 points,
we'll only give the other team 1 point.

563
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,690
They'd probably try that.

564
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,099
As we talked it over,
we kept getting that thought.

565
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,000
We could just call
a really small number now.

566
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,000
I think we can just go for it, though.

567
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,069
I think we can go for it.

568
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,839
I think they'll call 102, no matter what.

569
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,710
We could just call about 30,

570
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,970
then when they switch for the 2nd,
they'll go for 102.

571
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,710
How many should we do?

572
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,180
Honestly, just one is fine too.

573
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,480
But I think 30 should be doable.

574
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,750
Or just a number that I can do.

575
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,819
Let's just do one.

576
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,359
- One? But...
- That's cool.

577
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,890
We don't even need memorization?
We'll win with one?

578
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,630
But if we're going to do that,

579
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,329
rather than think about
how cool it would be to call one...

580
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,460
Calling one is cool.

581
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,269
It's just cool.

582
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
- Winning with strategy?
- Yes.

583
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,869
In a situation
where this could be the last round,

584
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,579
it's either go big or go home.

585
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,910
I made the suggestion
that we should go with one.

586
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,250
I guess it was rather romantic?

587
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,779
Or showing off?

588
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,180
Or provoking them?

589
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,390
I think those things came together.

590
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,589
We wrote down our bet.

591
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,559
Then, we'll say it first.
Go ahead, Eon Kyu.

592
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,390
Twenty-five.

593
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,599
We wrote 38.

594
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,269
- Okay.
- Let's talk more and bet again.

595
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,799
Should we just go with
what we said earlier?

596
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,640
Just go with the same?

597
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,569
Should we just go with
what we said earlier?

598
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,539
- I'll just do what I think is right.
- Okay. Sounds good.

599
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:56,750
Good luck.

600
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,980
If they know how to think,
they'll call 102 for sure.

601
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,220
Let's trust that.

602
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,049
It's your choice.

603
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,759
Let's go. Being romantic is cool.

604
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,299
If there is a poker player...

605
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,869
and a guy who is all about romance,

606
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,839
we should go for it.

607
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,240
We wrote down our bet.
If you tell us your bet first...

608
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,009
Deciding to bet one was...

609
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,279
based on the assumption
that the other team...

610
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,680
would definitely try a high number.

611
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,250
We twisted it around several times,

612
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,690
but that was the final decision.

613
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,220
We'll bet one.

614
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,829
We'll bet three.

615
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,269
- Gosh, we fell for it.
- We fell for it.

616
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,680
If we want to give them the 2nd attack,
there are 102 cards.

617
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,740
We have to bet the maximum.

618
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,579
Then, that would give them
the second attack for sure.

619
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:08,279
But I figured they'd think about
the fact that I'd think this way.

620
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,519
So, they would call...

621
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,390
a really low number...

622
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,160
and take the game.

623
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,089
Unless they're fools,
they have to call 102.

624
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,930
If not 102,
they at least have to call 60 to 70.

625
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,700
We could just call
a really small number now.

626
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,970
I think we can just go for it, though.

627
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,599
I think they'll call 102, no matter what.

628
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,769
My gosh.

629
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,509
The betting is important.

630
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,940
Hey.

631
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,410
Let's bet one card.

632
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,250
But the moment we bet 102,

633
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,589
they'd know we were trying to win
through the betting.

634
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:47,160
I didn't want them to know that.

635
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,190
So, for the 1st bet, I called 25.

636
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:52,859
(Joo Eon Kyu and Pani Bottle, 25 cards)

637
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,029
Twenty-five.

638
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:55,869
We wrote 38.

639
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,069
(Xitsuh and Steve Yea, 38 cards)

640
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,640
But the other team wrote 38.

641
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,839
I felt it then.

642
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,339
"This means..."

643
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,380
"we should follow them."

644
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,950
"If things go right,
we could bet a low number."

645
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,990
So, I thought about betting one,

646
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,559
but they seemed like
they wanted me to follow them...

647
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,059
and bet 1 too. So, I bet 3.

648
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,799
Actually, we just lost
in the psychological warfare...

649
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,500
and the betting game.

650
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,200
The moment they bet three, we lost.

651
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:36,609
Please tell us the cards in order.

652
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,640
F.

653
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,309
- F is correct.
- Z.

654
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Z is correct.

655
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Eight.

656
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,150
Eight is correct.

657
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,920
Joo Eon Kyu, Pani Bottle.

658
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,490
You've succeeded in the mission.

659
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,829
The other team wasn't an easy match.

660
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:03,470
Xitsuh has lots of experience
in survival games.

661
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,440
And in Steve Yea's case,

662
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,170
he's a world-class poker player.

663
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:12,910
But the fact that we beat a team
with that combination of players,

664
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,339
it's so...

665
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,950
My heart feels so full.

666
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,750
The Deathmatch results will be announced.

667
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,859
The eliminated player is
the losing candidate from the Mansion,

668
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,460
Xitsuh.

669
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,730
(The 2nd eliminated player
of Bloody Game 3 is Xitsuh.)

670
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,000
Xitsuh must go outside immediately...

671
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,559
and leave this place.

672
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,740
- Get revenge for me.
- Okay.

673
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,809
If you get eliminated in a survival game,
it's your own fault.

674
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,750
Whether you lost in politics
or there was a game that wasn't for you,

675
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,549
it means an area of your skills
was lacking.

676
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:58,519
Honestly, it wasn't my first time
being eliminated from a survival game.

677
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,890
Mostly, when I got eliminated,

678
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,430
I used to say things like,

679
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,430
"I did my best
and don't have any regrets!"

680
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,230
But this time,

681
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,769
I feel rather disappointed.

682
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
In Bloody Game 2,
I played enough not to have any regrets.

683
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:17,039
But this time, I feel like I got shut down
as soon as I started my engine.

684
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,279
That's how I feel.

685
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,619
The Deathmatch is over.

686
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,019
I just wanted to go and get washed up.

687
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,059
Because, since morning,

688
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:39,529
I was drenched in sweat...

689
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,930
from exploring around Paradise
and started the main match like that.

690
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,269
In that state, I came to the Deathmatch.

691
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,910
And since there were four games
in the Deathmatch,

692
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,440
it got so long. I was like,

693
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,849
"I can't put off washing any longer."

694
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,609
"This is my final line of defense."

695
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,119
Survivors of the Deathmatch,

696
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:05,359
Joo Eon Kyu, Pani Bottle, and Steve Yea.

697
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,160
You may not return
to the original survival ground.

698
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,730
- We can't?
- We can't?

699
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,829
But they suddenly announced
that we couldn't return.

700
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,539
"What is this?"

701
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:21,369
Goodness.

702
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,210
"Are we switching spots?"
That was my last hope.

703
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:28,180
From the Mansion to Paradise
and vice versa.

704
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,549
"Are we switching spots?"

705
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:31,980
From now on,

706
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,680
you will become one team...

707
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,549
and continue your survival here,
in the Remaining.

708
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,690
- What? Where?
- What...

709
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,799
Immediately, take the stairs...

710
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,670
and go down
to the basement outdoor survival ground.

711
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Darn it. We can't go back?

712
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,109
Gosh, we're doomed.

713
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,279
Seriously, it made no sense.

714
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,250
I was super angry then.

715
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,860
"Gosh, what is this?"

716
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,659
"What on earth is this?"

717
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,760
It was so complicated and subtle...

718
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,429
that I was confused.

719
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,969
I don't even know what to say now.

720
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,769
We're going down to the basement?

721
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,170
(They move
to the basement outdoor survival ground.)

722
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,340
We're going down even farther?

723
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,639
Can we sleep there?

724
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,250
We were in this abandoned building.

725
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,519
The space was so big.
And the sound was ringing.

726
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,849
It's all rubble, like a construction site.

727
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,320
This is too harsh.

728
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,260
- Goodness.
- What's this?

729
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,360
Is anyone here?

730
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,230
Will someone rub their eyes and get up?

731
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,679
Over there.

732
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,550
- Where?
- Over there, where it's bright.

733
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,619
I feel like there will be...

734
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,949
a third area over here.

735
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,590
Is no one here?

736
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,389
Shouldn't someone be here?

737
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,099
I thought, "Come on. No way."

738
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,510
No way.

739
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,280
- Hello.
- No way.

740
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:46,719
- Hello.
- You had a hard journey.

741
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,550
You'll have to work even harder here.

742
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,050
- Did you sleep here?
- No way. Yes.

743
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,059
You will be sleeping here.

744
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,929
Goodness. This is...

745
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,059
They were in an awful state.

746
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,369
I felt a mix of emotions.

747
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,510
(The Remaining)

748
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,980
Let's have a party to celebrate.

749
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,289
It's an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

750
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,159
I wanted to drag down Dong Min
in any way possible.

751
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,590
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

752
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,260
I said I'd go to the wild...

753
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,860
and come back to kill.

754
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,260
Darn, it's too bright.

755
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,199
It's too bright!

756
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,269
If we maintain this nastiness,

757
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,170
I'll just say,
"Darn it. Get lost. I'll kill you all."

758
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,670
(18 hours later)

759
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:49,409
Today is the Day of the Raid.

760
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,780
If you raid Bloody Paradise
and destroy their symbol,

761
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,449
you can become the new owner
of the Bloody Paradise.

762
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,320
Darn it! What's this?

763
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,489
Hey! Darn it! What is that?

764
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,389
They're coming!

765
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,800
- Stop them!
- Hurry!

766
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,269
Darn it. Are they crazy?

767
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,269
They made this so annoying.
They must be psychos.

768
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,429
Who are you?

769
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:43,230
My name is Yurisa.

770
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,780
The weather is so hot today.

771
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,010
- Jin Ho.
- Yes?

772
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,550
Let's talk.

773
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,750
I woke up,

774
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,250
but Pani Bottle and Eon Kyu aren't here.
What's going on?

775
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,150
- During the Deathmatch,
- Yes?

776
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,260
you went with a guy, right?

777
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:08,989
I went with Hye Seon.

778
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,699
Was it just you and Hye Seon?

779
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,429
- Yes. Why?
- Okay.

780
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,400
What do you mean all of a sudden? A guy?

781
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,269
I went to the prison last night.

782
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,369
What?

783
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,039
What are you talking about?
Did you have a dream?

784
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,070
What do you mean,
you went to the prison last night?

785
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,539
- So... To the prison.
- Where is it?

786
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:30,880
It's somewhere. I went there.

787
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,780
"You went with a guy
for the Deathmatch, right?"

788
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,050
What is she saying?

789
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,150
She went to the prison,
and a guy was dying.

790
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,590
What does that mean? I just...

791
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,389
She talked with that guy,

792
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:42,019
and he said he played a game against me.

793
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,230
A card game.
So, he lost and ended up there.

794
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,230
But this is also right.

795
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,460
There really is a prison?

796
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,400
They said
there were an altar and a prison.

797
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,699
I thought they were lying.

798
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,699
I saw a dagger.

799
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,539
It's on an altar.

800
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,440
I thought it was a lie
that there was a prison as well.

801
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,679
But it was true.

802
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,079
Then I'd be ruined.

803
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,650
Where is the prison? Can I go there too?

804
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,480
I can't take you.

805
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,019
- You can't take me?
- I can't.

806
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,090
You found it?

807
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:13,960
Does this make sense?

808
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,960
All right.

809
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,329
Goodness.

810
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,170
What does that mean? There's a prison?

811
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,739
I was so annoyed because she did that.

812
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,639
I'd become an idiot...

813
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,909
once people really get going to prison.

814
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,840
What's going to happen?
Is there really a prison?

815
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,510
Do I have to look for it?
What do I do if I find it?

816
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,880
I can't kill that person.

817
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,619
I need to communicate...

818
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,920
with the remaining teams and tell them.

819
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:45,619
It was hot, but I went out...

820
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,460
to find where the prison was.

821
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,889
Where the altar was.

822
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,789
I needed to find
where the man was locked up in...

823
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,699
because I needed to talk to him
when I saw him.

824
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,570
So I kept roaming around.

825
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:00,940
Every day is like a torture.

826
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,650
- Something is here.
- Something is here.

827
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,750
I hope it's Jin Ho's message.

828
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,679
I've been waiting for that.

829
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,349
Food.

830
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,190
It's food.

831
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,389
There are Basic Rules of Remaining.

832
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:21,389
(The item box arrived.)

833
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,159
"Basic Rules of Remaining."

834
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,130
"Remaining players will be given food
once a day."

835
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,230
"Remaining players can steal things."

836
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:31,869
Stealing is possible 24 hours...

837
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,139
- We can go now.
- It's possible to steal all day.

838
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,570
They're definitely sleeping now.

839
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,840
The mansion is my main enemy.

840
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,539
I should destroy the mansion.

841
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,010
- Have you stolen before?
- No. It's my first time.

842
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,110
It's my first time.

843
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,949
- It's your first offense?
- First offense.

844
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,380
If you look at the first one,

845
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,250
I think we all have to go to one place.

846
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,920
- Only one place.
- We can only go to one place.

847
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,190
(Paradise)

848
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,760
(Mansion)

849
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,059
(They can steal from only one place.)

850
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,530
I think we should deceive them.
We're at a disadvantageous position.

851
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,599
Mansion is just open for stealing.

852
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,170
They have so many things.

853
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:08,570
The snacks are just displayed.

854
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,510
It's easy to take things
from Paradise too.

855
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,610
It's not easy.

856
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,840
- We can go to the Mansion then.
- We can go to the Mansion.

857
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,610
We don't need to go to Paradise.

858
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,210
The things in Mansion are better.

859
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,409
- There are more things.
- It's easier.

860
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,280
They have kitchen tools too.

861
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,250
Mansion had a separate entrance
to the pantry.

862
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,760
(The structure of Mansion)

863
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,960
(If you go downstairs
from the 1st floor...)

864
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,860
(and head outside,)

865
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,699
(you can find a separate building...)

866
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:42,539
(which is used as the pantry.)

867
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,269
When we heard from the people
from Paradise,

868
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,309
there were no reasons to steal
from Paradise.

869
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,610
Mansion was like a drive-through
of a fast-food store.

870
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,010
But it was a drive-through
where you didn't need to pay.

871
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,280
You can just grab whatever you want.

872
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,679
And there weren't many people
who would resist.

873
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,050
We went to steal after such calculations.

874
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,119
(They arrived at Mansion.)

875
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,489
They would be fast asleep.

876
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,619
Please.

877
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,230
Don't even think about getting up.

878
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,639
(They reached the door of the pantry.)

879
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,480
(Tip-toeing)

880
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:28,920
(Acau is in the kitchen.)

881
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
(He got startled.)

882
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,329
(Rushing)

883
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,360
Wasn't there someone inside?

884
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,500
Acau.

885
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,199
Why isn't he sleeping?

886
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:44,000
We went in the morning,
but Acau was awake.

887
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:48,099
People aren't normally awake at that time
because people there...

888
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,269
drink every night.

889
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:51,869
So they sleep until lunchtime.

890
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,780
I thought no one would be awake.

891
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,050
But Acau was awake.

892
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,150
(Lim Hyun Seo walks near the pantry.)

893
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,050
(Steve Yea calls Hyun Seo.)

894
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:09,190
- Acau is awake.
- What?

895
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,960
They told me Acau was inside.

896
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,760
I looked inside.

897
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,199
I peeped through the window
and saw Acau there.

898
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,239
It wasn't going to be easy to steal.

899
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,409
Why is he awake?

900
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,650
(Tip-toeing)

901
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,960
(He checks inside...)

902
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,329
(and enters the pantry.)

903
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,099
(He checks the items in the Mansion.)

904
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:01,280
(Lim Hyun Seo first gets water.)

905
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,679
An intruder has broken into the house.

906
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,679
(The siren suddenly goes off.)

907
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:06,179
An intruder has broken into the house.

908
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,480
(The hidden rule for stealing: A siren
will go off when you attempt to steal.)

909
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,920
An intruder has broken into the house.

910
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:10,820
An intruder has broken into the house.

911
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,460
An intruder has broken into the house.

912
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,329
An intruder has broken into the house.

913
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,360
(Turning)

914
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:22,329
(They can't hear the siren
inside the pantry.)

915
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,269
(Lim Hyun Seo keeps taking things
without hearing the siren.)

916
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:27,769
Is it the basement?

917
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:29,300
Could you check the basement?

918
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,449
Tell him to come. There's an alarm.
It's saying there is an intruder.

919
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,280
(Chungju-Man came to the basement.)

920
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,920
There is an intruder?

921
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:46,789
Who is it?

922
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,820
There's no one.

923
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:53,329
(Hyun Seo comes out of the pantry.)

924
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,099
(Turning)

925
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:01,869
(Acau heads outside.)

926
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,070
Hurry up.

927
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:10,849
The alarm went off
saying there was an intruder.

928
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:20,659
Let's run.

929
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:21,920
Go.

930
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:26,599
This is so funny.

931
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,960
(This is so funny.)

932
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,130
There's no one downstairs.

933
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,670
There's no one upstairs.

934
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,340
It's so bright.

935
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,840
(They return to Remaining.)

936
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,710
This is reality.

937
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,179
Hi.

938
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,679
- What is it?
- What is it?

939
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,619
(He goes barefoot to welcome them.)

940
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:54,820
Okay.

941
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,489
It's amazing.

942
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,260
It's good.

943
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:02,000
We would have brought more
if the alarm didn't go off.

944
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,969
I'm worried.

945
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,469
What do we do during the raid?

946
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,769
Right. I heard this.

947
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,469
There will be a sacrificial player.

948
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,110
How do you know that?

949
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,179
Hyun Seo and I knew about
the sacrificial player...

950
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:19,409
because it was written in the rule book.

951
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,519
In the rule book that came...

952
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:23,949
after Eon Kyu, Pani, and Steve arrived,

953
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,949
there was no mention
of the sacrificial player.

954
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,019
I thought...

955
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,059
Hyun Seo and I suffered a day more...

956
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:32,559
and were more desperate,

957
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,599
so we should be excluded
from being the sacrificial player.

958
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,929
That's what I thought.

959
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,500
But it seemed like Hyun Seo thought...

960
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,739
it would be beneficial for everyone...

961
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:45,869
to tell the three everything...

962
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,739
and make me the sacrificial player.

963
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,809
That was an uncomfortable discussion...

964
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:52,280
for Hye Seon.

965
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,219
I noticed
she didn't want to talk about it.

966
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,690
It felt like the information
about the sacrificial player...

967
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,190
was intentionally being hidden.

968
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,889
So I talked to everyone in person.

969
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,590
The most important thing
isn't written in the rule book.

970
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,730
We have to offer one person from here...

971
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,360
during the raid.

972
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,199
It's rational to keep the person...

973
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,300
with the least combat capabilities here.

974
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,369
I think she isn't talking about it
because she thinks it would be her.

975
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
I told them to keep that in mind but
pretend like they didn't know about it.

976
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,210
So eventually,

977
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:21,909
we shared the rule
about the sacrificial player...

978
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,710
with everyone.

979
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,349
From that moment,

980
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:26,880
I tried to avoid
becoming the sacrificial player...

981
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,219
as much as possible.

982
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,119
This is the rule book
that you didn't read.

983
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,389
We got this when we first came.

984
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,889
For that day...

985
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,260
If the raid is today,

986
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:37,389
It shouldn't be today.
There's too little time to prepare.

987
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:40,159
The geographic features
are not advantageous for us.

988
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,269
I thought a lot about it, but there is
no way unless we break the windows.

989
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,829
We will definitely break the windows.

990
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,070
We have to enter
after breaking the windows.

991
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,199
But you said
the windows were on the third floor.

992
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,739
- Yes.
- But the third floor...

993
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:51,170
- The third floor...
- It's an uphill.

994
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,239
So the building is buried
from the outside.

995
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,139
So we can find the windows
if we walk outside?

996
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,480
- Okay then.
- It can be confusing. I'll explain.

997
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,949
- Come here.
- It's around the hill.

998
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,449
There are stairs from the swimming pool.

999
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,820
They go around from both sides.

1000
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,159
These aren't stairs now. It's a hill.

1001
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,659
You go up and walk here.

1002
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,699
Then this is the back of the window.

1003
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:15,730
You can walk up here.

1004
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,699
- So we can break it from here.
- Right.

1005
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:19,869
We can walk. But...

1006
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:21,739
Dong Min knows that too.
But this is what he said.

1007
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:23,610
"Will those crazy people enter
after breaking the windows?"

1008
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,739
- We have to break the window.
- They said they should defend the door.

1009
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,010
I heard him say that.

1010
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,880
He's crazy about the door.
He's thinking about drilling it.

1011
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,510
But it's not easily breakable.

1012
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,619
So we have to be prepared
before breaking it.

1013
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,280
- We could get hurt.
- We could get hurt.

1014
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,690
It's a very thick glass.

1015
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,550
(Meanwhile, at Paradise)

1016
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,019
They both didn't come.

1017
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,260
What's happening?

1018
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:45,159
Two people went yesterday.

1019
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,230
One person should come back.

1020
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,730
I think...

1021
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,670
one of them was eliminated...

1022
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,440
or was held captive...

1023
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,239
or became one of them.

1024
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,739
We only have six people.

1025
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,409
I know. Our team became smaller.

1026
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:02,409
We only have six people
who can fight today.

1027
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,880
Let's do the repair work more perfectly.

1028
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:10,420
Yesterday and today,

1029
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:15,059
there are a lot of things happening.

1030
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:18,059
The survivor from Deathmatch
will be revealed.

1031
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:22,130
(It felt suspicious from the first day.)

1032
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,199
What is this?

1033
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,030
The parasites would be coming from here.

1034
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,800
That's right.

1035
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,869
I sensed something
that I haven't seen before.

1036
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,840
I am certain that there is a team outside.

1037
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,679
I think the Day of the Raid will happen.

1038
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,380
There are plenty of reasons.

1039
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,880
I don't know about the rest.

1040
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,519
But we have to defend our home.

1041
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,420
It would be useless to regret it...

1042
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,789
after we lose and get a penalty.

1043
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:51,960
That's right.

1044
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,400
We should lock the place down now.

1045
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,929
Yes. I think that would be better.

1046
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,070
The symbol of Bloody Game is the pyramid.

1047
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,469
(The symbol of Bloody Game
is the pyramid.)

1048
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,710
(There are three pyramids
placed in Paradise.)

1049
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,139
(Lounge)

1050
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,280
(Sky Garden)

1051
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,010
(Main Hall)

1052
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,710
We can protect just one of them.

1053
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:14,679
- Just one.
- In the end.

1054
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,420
A way to protect that.

1055
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,090
I'll think of a way to do that.

1056
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,090
How...

1057
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,989
can we protect it...

1058
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:27,199
like a fort?

1059
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:29,699
I have so many thoughts.

1060
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,469
We need a gateway.

1061
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:35,769
This is the final place.

1062
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:40,780
This is the easiest place to protect.

1063
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,909
Let's have this place
as the final frontier.

1064
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,780
What's important here?

1065
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
It's to stop them from opening this door.

1066
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,550
We can tie this strongly with a rope
or a cloth.

1067
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,920
We can fix something T-shaped there
and hold it from inside.

1068
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,429
Then they can't open it.

1069
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:00,059
We can keep looking for items.

1070
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,760
Okay.

1071
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,429
Okay. This board...

1072
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:05,869
can be joined.

1073
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,269
We have ropes too.

1074
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:11,639
Are we preparing for war?

1075
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,179
I just wanted to protect our home.

1076
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,119
More than that, I didn't want to lose.

1077
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,949
This was one of the games.

1078
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,019
Even if they raided us,

1079
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:27,760
if we set up a good defense, we'd win.

1080
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:31,989
I can't bear losing.

1081
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,260
This will be completed this evening.

1082
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,599
We will block this part completely...

1083
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,829
this evening.

1084
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,369
They can't get through this.

1085
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:43,039
We'll place the mattresses here.

1086
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,869
I measured a mattress.

1087
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,210
It's exactly this size.

1088
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,840
- It fits perfectly?
- Yes.

1089
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,480
I checked the pillar,

1090
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,489
and there was just enough space
for a person to pass through.

1091
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,349
We will definitely block that part.

1092
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,719
We will find a mattress...

1093
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,260
that fits perfectly...

1094
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:04,889
and block it.

1095
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,929
It's perfect.

1096
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,260
It was customized.

1097
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,269
If we place things that can fill the gap,

1098
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:14,239
they won't be able to enter.

1099
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:16,199
- Could you try pushing this?
- Okay.

1100
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,469
We should push it down.

1101
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,440
You can't do this.

1102
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,480
We plan to set up a strong line
of defense...

1103
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,849
and close down the building.

1104
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:27,980
Is it even?

1105
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,219
It is.

1106
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,460
It was like they were all bewitched.

1107
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,659
It was weird.

1108
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,530
I thought it would be better to prepare
accordingly...

1109
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,800
when we receive instructions.

1110
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,860
So I didn't know if it was right...

1111
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,630
to prepare in advance
before we got any mission.

1112
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,599
I'm still worried...

1113
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,940
about whether it would be okay.

1114
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,340
But this...

1115
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,579
There's no gap.

1116
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,019
It's doomed.

1117
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,420
Dong Min went mad...

1118
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,090
about defense.

1119
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,449
He's setting up the defense like crazy.

1120
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,820
Pull it.

1121
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,289
Slowly.

1122
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,659
Slowly. Okay.

1123
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,699
You pulled too much on this side.

1124
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,170
Hold on. Pull them together.

1125
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,139
He was so serious about the construction.

1126
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,800
It would make you think that
you shouldn't come here.

1127
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,510
Even if they come to raid,
they can't come through.

1128
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,440
There is no door. It's blocked.

1129
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
It's game over.

1130
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,909
I was just there watching.

1131
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,050
Hold this, Jin Ho.

1132
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,519
Hold that? Wait.

1133
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,789
- From here?
- From the bottom to the top.

1134
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,789
Isn't it tight?

1135
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:40,920
- It's not tight.
- It's not tight.

1136
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,030
Look. It shouldn't be like that.

1137
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,590
- Jin Ho.
- Yes?

1138
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,599
- Lift it up now.
- Okay.

1139
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,500
Hold on.

1140
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,730
It's tiresome.

1141
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,869
(Letting go)

1142
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,570
Hold on.

1143
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:05,880
Did he let go of it again?

1144
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,449
Goodness.

1145
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,789
Where did he go?

1146
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:12,889
- Jin Ho.
- Wasn't he here?

1147
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,960
Jin Ho.

1148
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,599
It would be weird if I worked hard.
I was a spy.

1149
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:25,400
I thought I should quickly make...

1150
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,639
some action...

1151
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,010
to help the spy team.

1152
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:34,940
(The spy came down to the pantry
while everyone was busy.)

1153
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,349
What's that?

1154
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,019
(He's flustered.)

1155
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,289
Most of all, I'm very frustrated...

1156
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,260
about the SMS Box in the pantry.

1157
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,900
It was most important to find...

1158
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,969
something to send SMS.

1159
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,369
We had to know each other's situation.

1160
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,440
But...

1161
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:02,269
I couldn't find it.

1162
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,139
The safe box was right there.

1163
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,440
I thought that was it.

1164
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,210
So from the second day,
I made time to go there...

1165
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,880
to open the safe box with a key.

1166
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:14,280
It's not the one.

1167
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,250
It didn't open.

1168
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,519
Wasn't this the key?

1169
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,489
This could be the right one.

1170
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,260
Is it because I touched it wrong?

1171
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,659
So I kept going in there
to work on the safe box.

1172
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,530
(Startled)

1173
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,170
I got it wrong again. Gosh.

1174
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:38,309
What was annoying...

1175
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,409
was that the alarm went off
because I got it wrong a number of times.

1176
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,539
I had to run away
because it made me so nervous.

1177
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,079
What did I miss?

1178
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,719
So I kept searching the area
whenever I had time.

1179
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,389
It's doomed.

1180
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:57,829
I really couldn't find it.

1181
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,760
Maybe I was the one with the problem.

1182
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,599
I even tried...

1183
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,670
to open the other safe boxes with the key.

1184
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,400
I tried the passcode for the phone too.

1185
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,599
I tried 1004, 7942...

1186
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,269
or 1818.

1187
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,809
I tried everything.

1188
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,239
But it wouldn't open.

1189
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,179
I checked everywhere on the second floor.

1190
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,679
I looked for a keyhole...

1191
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,909
or something I can use for communication.
I searched everywhere,

1192
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:21,250
but I found nothing.

1193
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,019
This situation is really confusing.

1194
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,719
I can't find any means of communication.

1195
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,159
The door is open. It's very dangerous.

1196
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,530
So I'll fix it with nails.

1197
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:33,429
How will you do that?

1198
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,159
With a screwdriver.

1199
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,500
Is there a screwdriver here?

1200
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:38,829
I'll definitely find one.

1201
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,170
I'll find it no matter what.

1202
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:44,170
Didn't you bring something like that?

1203
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:46,510
- A multipurpose knife?
- I don't think so.

1204
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,710
I'll check just in case.

1205
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,909
I'll find it.

1206
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,449
A crosshead.

1207
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,380
There would be something for it.

1208
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,150
It's there.

1209
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,989
Is it done?

1210
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,119
- Goodness.
- He'll curse again.

1211
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,760
- I told you to look for a screwdriver.
- It's not there.

1212
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:05,190
I looked for it but it wasn't there.

1213
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,559
- Where did you search?
- My room.

1214
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,730
My room and Eon Kyu's room.
But it wasn't there.

1215
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,570
You're in the same room.

1216
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,269
Your room and Eun Kyu's room.

1217
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,400
Be quiet.

1218
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,969
Why would there be a screwdriver
in your room?

1219
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:19,739
I was telling you to look for it outside.

1220
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:22,179
We just need a screwdriver.

1221
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,579
If we don't have one,

1222
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,010
we can just use our hands.

1223
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,590
This is the quickest.

1224
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,260
We can turn it with our hands.

1225
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:36,760
(Using his strength)

1226
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,389
There was no screwdriver.

1227
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:42,000
So we fixed a nail by hand.

1228
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,530
So I have...

1229
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:47,400
blisters on my hands,
and the skin came off.

1230
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,570
We built our base during the day,

1231
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,380
and we built it in the evening too.

1232
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,010
First of all,

1233
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:59,050
Dong Min was sweating and working hard.

1234
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,650
It was hard not to do anything
next to him.

1235
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,119
- Well done.
- Let them come.

1236
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,820
Let them come.

1237
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:10,360
(They worked on shutting down
the lounge all night.)

1238
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,489
Nothing is perfect.

1239
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,829
I'm going to make it sturdier.

1240
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,630
I think this is the best way.

1241
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,170
Their strategy...

1242
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,769
is to block us from the first floor.

1243
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:21,969
We're going to do the opposite.

1244
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,670
While we pretend to scuffle with them
on the first floor,

1245
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,110
one of us will sneak around,

1246
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,769
start breaking things
from the third floor, and come down.

1247
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,579
There are three symbols in the end.

1248
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:30,480
Think about coming at them all at once.

1249
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,250
Jin Ho will keep Yurisa and Seong Beom...

1250
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,019
in his arms.

1251
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,289
Steve and Hyun Seo
can take care of MJ and Si Yoon.

1252
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:40,489
We should block them
and break all the symbols.

1253
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,320
For defense, they were dispersed...

1254
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,329
in several locations to stand guard.

1255
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:49,559
But they couldn't communicate
with one another.

1256
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,199
So I thought we would outnumber them...

1257
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:56,139
no matter where we go...

1258
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:57,809
when Jin Ho joins us.

1259
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,610
I have Plan B. The hydrant.

1260
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,809
What are you going to do with water?

1261
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,610
I'll confuse them or something.

1262
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:03,780
No.

1263
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,280
- We're allowed to use anything.
- Let's use everything...

1264
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,349
in the building.

1265
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,449
We should do everything we can.

1266
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:11,349
Listening to Eon Kyu's strategy,
I was like, "What's this?"

1267
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,090
If something doesn't work,

1268
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,219
we need a Plan B.

1269
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,429
But he was just like, "We can do it.
We can outnumber them."

1270
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,860
This is unfavorable to us
because they're all ready.

1271
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:23,530
No, it's not. It's not unfavorable at all.

1272
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:26,099
They scattered everywhere.

1273
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,170
But we're going to attack them
all together.

1274
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:30,769
- Right.
- We'll outnumber them.

1275
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:32,570
And they can't communicate
with one another...

1276
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,739
without a phone or anything.
How can they signal?

1277
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:35,909
- It's more difficult to defend.
- Yes.

1278
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,050
We should all move as one group.

1279
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,079
- All together?
- We should move together.

1280
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,179
- I oppose it.
- Why?

1281
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,619
At least one of us should move separately.

1282
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,489
- Why?
- No. That's not good at all.

1283
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:46,690
- Why?
- One of us...

1284
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:47,889
should move separately as a specialist.

1285
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:49,619
- Why?
- Your plan doesn't seem right.

1286
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,059
- Why?
- We can't do that.

1287
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,389
What if they block us?

1288
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,800
They can't if we all move together.

1289
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,260
- That's not how it'll go.
- We'll outnumber them.

1290
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,269
- You're assuming...
- We'll outnumber them.

1291
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:00,670
everything will work out.

1292
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:03,269
- And I'm assuming it might not.
- No.

1293
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,369
- We need to outnumber them.
- So your strategy...

1294
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,579
Your plan...

1295
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:08,809
is to start from the first floor...

1296
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:10,880
- and just attack them at once.
- No.

1297
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,880
He kept saying we could win
by using strength as we'd outnumber them.

1298
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,119
It's like...

1299
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,050
Someone asks you how they can make money,

1300
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:20,119
and you just say, "Just make it.
Why are you not making money?"

1301
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,260
"Just work."

1302
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:23,320
He kept saying the same thing.

1303
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:25,230
It didn't feel like a strategy.

1304
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:27,929
They invested so much in the third floor.

1305
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:30,630
So the sunk cost is too high...

1306
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,030
for them to defend in another place.

1307
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,070
How are we going to enter the third floor?

1308
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:37,710
Having a large number of people
is advantageous to us.

1309
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:40,510
Either we follow your strategy
and you become the sacrificial player,

1310
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:42,440
or we follow my strategy
and I become the sacrificial player.

1311
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,650
- My gosh.
- The choice is yours. What do you think?

1312
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,480
Eon Kyu, whether we're right or wrong...

1313
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,019
isn't important.

1314
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,619
- We need to make it.
- That's true.

1315
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:50,690
I'm not trying to argue
about whether you're right...

1316
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,349
- or I'm right.
- It doesn't matter to me.

1317
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,349
I don't want to argue based on emotions.

1318
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,389
- Okay.
- Look.

1319
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:56,719
- You...
- But I'm running a company.

1320
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,429
I work with 100 employees.

1321
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,659
When I make a strategy...

1322
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,599
I actually hate being patronized
like that.

1323
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,829
He suddenly started talking
about his company.

1324
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,739
He said he knew because he ran a company.

1325
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:09,300
I was like, "What is he talking about?"

1326
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,309
It was very annoying.

1327
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,510
- Let's keep emotions out of this.
- I don't have any.

1328
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,409
It's not about who is right
and who is wrong.

1329
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,210
- That's not my intention.
- No, I felt it.

1330
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,719
If you talk about your company,
I can talk about my subscribers too.

1331
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,750
That's not what this is about.

1332
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,360
I thought I should get rid of him quickly.

1333
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:32,260
We're not compatible.

1334
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,260
I shouldn't have come with him.

1335
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,500
We need to use our strength in the end.

1336
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,570
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it
at all. We should.

1337
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,869
- We should use our strength.
- But the strategy we have...

1338
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,639
is to use our strength and outnumber them.
That's all.

1339
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,639
So it depends on how we use our strength.

1340
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,480
The defenders would think
they can block the entrance as it's small.

1341
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,380
How much physical force
we can apply to it...

1342
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,019
depends on the structure.

1343
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:58,289
- So...
- Are you calculating that?

1344
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:00,250
I'm not saying I'll calculate the numbers.

1345
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,820
I'm saying we should consider it.

1346
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,460
But we have no plans
other than using our strength.

1347
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,030
We can develop strategies
if we know the structure.

1348
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,599
We need information to plan it.

1349
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,030
We also need to think strategically...

1350
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,429
about how we use our strength.

1351
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,139
Are we going to grapple with them?

1352
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:18,840
We need a protocol and signals
for how to solve the problem...

1353
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,369
when more than one person blocks us.

1354
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:22,639
Like we should make a signal...

1355
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,679
to indicate
when to grab their arms and legs.

1356
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,780
Do you think we can predict
how we are going to grapple with them now?

1357
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,250
We don't know how we're going to start...

1358
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,650
when we get to have
a physical fight with them.

1359
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,460
But if we decide what to do beforehand,
we can just do it.

1360
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,289
How? Give me an example.

1361
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:38,489
- We're going to decide now.
- We're going to decide now.

1362
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:39,489
For example,

1363
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,800
we could just grab their waist
to drag them out.

1364
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,570
So it's about martial arts now.

1365
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:45,900
It's not martial arts.

1366
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,500
It's about how we're going to use
our strength.

1367
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,000
- "Let's grab their legs."
- Yes.

1368
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:50,869
It's about how to use our strength.

1369
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:52,739
And we need to plan it beforehand.

1370
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,710
For example, if we say, "Get them,"

1371
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,039
it means we're going to grab their legs.

1372
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,309
It could be their arms, legs, or waist.

1373
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:00,010
- But nothing is decided yet.
- Right.

1374
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,949
Hyun Seo suddenly started talking...

1375
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,989
about a protocol and grabbing their legs.

1376
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,360
It's like the old comedy show.

1377
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,829
"Turn around, raise your arm,
and hit their neck. Done."

1378
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,360
They think it'll work, but it won't.
What's this? It's not a strategy.

1379
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,570
It's like poomsae in taekwondo.

1380
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,869
Planning a strategy is deciding
how many of us will enter which floor.

1381
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,110
I don't know.

1382
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,969
As the two of them argued like that,
I started to think if I was wrong.

1383
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,840
We were talking
about the structure of the map,

1384
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,309
and you're talking
about grabbing their legs.

1385
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,179
That's a sub-plan within a plan.

1386
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,679
I'm saying we should discuss the tactic...

1387
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:35,780
as we didn't.

1388
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,989
How can we not plan anything
before a battle?

1389
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:39,420
Because we were talking
about the structure first.

1390
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:40,920
- So...
- The order doesn't matter.

1391
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,690
We were talking
about the overall situation.

1392
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,389
And you talk about how to use a knife.
Of course, it's important.

1393
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:47,260
It's important. That's why I said it.

1394
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,199
Let's say
two people are standing over there.

1395
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:52,900
We need different plans
depending on whether the corridor...

1396
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,039
is straight or has turns.

1397
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,199
I said there was none.

1398
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,670
That's what I'm saying.
The overall strategy...

1399
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:58,670
will change depending on the details.

1400
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,239
Like the first place we will enter
and how it will go.

1401
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:04,250
I think Pani was temporarily insane
at that moment.

1402
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:05,750
He couldn't sleep much...

1403
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,949
and was very stressed out.

1404
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,579
So he was particularly aggressive.

1405
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,989
We could have conflicting opinions
and we could think differently.

1406
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,659
But we couldn't reach an agreement.

1407
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:19,260
Honestly, I don't really like...

1408
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:22,199
the combination of the Remaining players.

1409
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,369
Go to sleep for now.

1410
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:28,940
Let's sleep and talk again later.

1411
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,190
Darn, it's too bright.

1412
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,599
It's too bright!

1413
01:04:58,099 --> 01:04:59,230
Darn it.

1414
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:05,739
Let's eat quickly.

1415
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:07,409
There are many things to do today.

1416
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:09,280
According to Yurisa,

1417
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,710
there are two prisons down there.

1418
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,280
- Did she see the prisons?
- What?

1419
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,880
Yes, she did.

1420
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:19,250
I see two prisons.

1421
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,349
- Prisons?
- Yse.

1422
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,760
There are prisons?

1423
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,329
- There are two.
- There are two prisons?

1424
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:26,960
My gosh. There are prisons.

1425
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Don't we have to check them
if that's true?

1426
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:33,070
I talked about it too, but...

1427
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,199
The altar and the prisons.
She claims she saw them,

1428
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,940
- but she didn't show them.
- Right.

1429
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,039
I wonder if she habitually lies.

1430
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,010
How did she see them?

1431
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,909
I don't know. She said she had been there.

1432
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:46,480
She talked with the person in the prison.

1433
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,820
Let's go to the prison together
after we finish this.

1434
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,750
We don't have to go all together.

1435
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,230
(Glancing)

1436
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,699
Yesterday, I talked with the prisoner...

1437
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:02,860
who was locked in there
after losing in the Deathmatch.

1438
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,099
"Who was your opponent?"

1439
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,739
"It was a man."

1440
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,170
"Are you talking about Hong Jin Ho?"

1441
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:13,809
"I think that was his name."

1442
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:15,739
"What did he look like?"

1443
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,380
"He was kind of chubby
and looked like a nice person."

1444
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,320
Did you see their face?

1445
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,349
The prisoner looked so tired.

1446
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,989
Weren't you possessed by a ghost?

1447
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:32,030
That's horrible.

1448
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,260
I got goosebumps.

1449
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,860
So it's not Hye Seon who said so?

1450
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,230
I think the prisoner wasn't Korean then.

1451
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,000
If they weren't Korean,
I can understand...

1452
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,699
they didn't monitor "The Genius..."

1453
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:46,940
before participating in Bloody Game.

1454
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,940
If they were Korean,
they would've watched it beforehand.

1455
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:50,210
If they did,

1456
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,809
they must know Jin Ho.

1457
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:54,849
It is kind of strange.

1458
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,320
Yurisa says so many weird things.

1459
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,820
She said she had seen the altar,
but she didn't show it to us.

1460
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:00,989
She didn't tell us where it was.

1461
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,190
I want to go too.

1462
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:05,260
I want to take ice and go there,
but I can't go.

1463
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:06,989
Including Dong Min, everyone...

1464
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,329
didn't believe her.

1465
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,929
- The more I listen...
- Does she have mythomania?

1466
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,170
- Yes.
- My gosh.

1467
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,570
Most of us...

1468
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,300
think she is weird...

1469
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,809
and tells lies habitually.

1470
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,840
I think that's what we think.

1471
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:22,679
Oh, my gosh.

1472
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:24,809
The weather is crazy.

1473
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,510
It's the worst.

1474
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,679
Is there anyone outside?

1475
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,920
- Outside?
- Yes.

1476
01:07:31,389 --> 01:07:32,449
No.

1477
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:34,619
So you're not a person, you punk?

1478
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,159
Then there's me.

1479
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:39,130
Please wait. Just for a minute.

1480
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,489
Don't make me do anything.

1481
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:41,599
Are you going somewhere?

1482
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,659
What is it? I'll give you a minute.

1483
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,099
- A minute? Just go then.
- Yes.

1484
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,070
- Do you want me to call someone?
- Yes.

1485
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,670
Someone who can act like a person.

1486
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:51,869
All right. Give me a moment.

1487
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,070
Si Yoon.

1488
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,309
- Si Yoon.
- Yes?

1489
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,409
- Dong Min is looking for you.
- Okay.

1490
01:07:58,409 --> 01:07:59,780
- He's at the door.
- All right.

1491
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,480
Should I go inside?
Or should I fix it outside?

1492
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,289
Please stay there for a minute.

1493
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,420
Okay.

1494
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:10,260
Thank you for acting like a person.

1495
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:15,659
I know Jin Ho is individualistic.

1496
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,000
But what he did wasn't nice at all.

1497
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,770
He should've pulled the string at least.
He did nothing.

1498
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,840
- There's a wooden beam on the top.
- I see it.

1499
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,670
- We're going to pull it.
- Okay.

1500
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:28,239
You want me to attach it
to the door so it can be secured?

1501
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,409
Two, three.

1502
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:30,949
Yes. It's secured now.

1503
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:31,949
- Is it done?
- Yes.

1504
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:33,310
- It's stuck, right?
- Yes.

1505
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,319
Okay.

1506
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:37,590
Let me tell you how we blocked the door.

1507
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,619
We brought two metal boards.

1508
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:44,260
We secured them to the outside
of the door with screws,

1509
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,100
placed a wooden beam at the very top,

1510
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,260
and used strings...

1511
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,630
to tie everything together,

1512
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,439
attaching it to the bar inside.

1513
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:59,609
We also secured a metal board...

1514
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:01,039
to the inside of the door with screws.

1515
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,710
We wrapped the string
around the doorknob on the inside...

1516
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:07,350
and taped around it.

1517
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,149
We completely blocked the door
in the living room.

1518
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:13,750
Come here, guys.

1519
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,590
- Let me explain one last time.
- Okay.

1520
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,590
First of all, the opponents will enter...

1521
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:21,930
either here or here.

1522
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,329
If we defend here
while they enter the building...

1523
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:26,899
through the other side, it'll be useless.

1524
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,369
So I decided to give up on this.

1525
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,869
The door in the lounge
is completely blocked.

1526
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,340
There are exactly four doors...

1527
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,810
to the place.

1528
01:09:37,409 --> 01:09:39,409
As for the two of them,

1529
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:42,979
we made it impossible to push
the doorknob down from the outside.

1530
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,819
We're going to put it...

1531
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:47,319
here.

1532
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,819
Seong Beom, try it.

1533
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:50,789
(The doorknob is secured
and can't be pushed down outside.)

1534
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:52,159
Okay.

1535
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:53,560
- So this is holding the doorknob?
- Yes.

1536
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:55,760
There are two other doors.

1537
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,970
They're folding doors.

1538
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:02,199
I kept thinking about
what to do with the folding doors...

1539
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,470
to block them.

1540
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,439
I decided to put gravel...

1541
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:09,680
on the track under the doors.

1542
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:17,520
(They collected gravel to fill the track.)

1543
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:24,859
Let's make sure this doesn't stick out.

1544
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:27,359
(The gravel on the track
will secure the door.)

1545
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:33,000
The final line of defense...

1546
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,340
would be the door in the lounge anyway.

1547
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:39,869
We took measures to slow down
the enemies' infiltration...

1548
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:43,109
to the door in the lounge.

1549
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:45,810
So that they can't come
to the center here?

1550
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:48,949
Yes. When we block here,

1551
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,020
they will come as they won't be able
to open the other doors.

1552
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,649
They'll open the door over there.

1553
01:10:54,619 --> 01:10:57,560
Even if they do,
the only place they can enter...

1554
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,189
is the room with the mattresses.

1555
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,630
We're going to block the space.

1556
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,260
Then they won't be able to go
to the other room...

1557
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,699
or come out into this garden.

1558
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:08,270
- I got it.
- They'll be isolated.

1559
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:12,569
There are two symbols in this space.

1560
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,609
As the two doors are completely blocked,

1561
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:16,310
we don't have to engage
in a physical fight.

1562
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,880
We can block them with our strategy.

1563
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,220
We blocked all the spaces...

1564
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,350
connected to the third floor.

1565
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,550
Even nuclear missiles...

1566
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,119
won't work.

1567
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:28,420
It's completely blocked.

1568
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,930
All these efforts for defense?
My goodness.

1569
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:35,159
If I were a spy,
I would tell them not to come...

1570
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:36,659
after seeing this.

1571
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:39,970
I think I'd say that.

1572
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,539
We can't share any information right now.

1573
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:44,840
And this team...

1574
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:47,470
has already prepared for a raid...

1575
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,840
we haven't even planned in detail.

1576
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,550
Seeing that makes me...

1577
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,550
Let me in.

1578
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,890
- Dong Min.
- Yes?

1579
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,449
- Don't do that.
- It's a practice.

1580
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:01,520
We should practice.

1581
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,220
It's weird.

1582
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,630
We should check if it opens.

1583
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:07,960
"Guys, don't come. We're doomed."

1584
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:10,430
I want to deliver the message.
We're really doomed.

1585
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,600
But I can't tell them.

1586
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:13,970
What do I do? My goodness.

1587
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:15,970
I should share information...

1588
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,409
or do something here...

1589
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:21,239
to help Hyun Seo or Hye Seon...

1590
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,779
on Team Remaining.

1591
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,149
What was the most important...

1592
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,680
was to find a way...

1593
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,590
to send a text message. But...

1594
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:34,520
My gosh.

1595
01:12:43,229 --> 01:12:44,300
It's not here.

1596
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:46,130
I couldn't find it.

1597
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:48,039
I wondered
if there might be a problem with me.

1598
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,569
Should I not have come here...

1599
01:12:51,369 --> 01:12:52,470
as a spy?

1600
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:55,840
Was it a mistake?

1601
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:58,380
It was very frustrating.

1602
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,579
Oh, my gosh.

1603
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,489
I was like, "What do they want me to do?"

1604
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:08,159
Then I suddenly thought...

1605
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:11,020
I was obsessed
with finding the safe box...

1606
01:13:11,229 --> 01:13:13,829
and I might've been mistaken.

1607
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,800
The moment it came to my mind,

1608
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,470
I decided to search everything
one last time.

1609
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,600
I took all the boxes out...

1610
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:24,140
to touch and open everything.

1611
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,539
I kept trying like that.

1612
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:47,329
Darn it.

1613
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:51,600
By accident, I was touching the wall...

1614
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:55,000
next to a pile of snack boxes,

1615
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:56,939
and something was protruding.

1616
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:59,340
When I felt it,

1617
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,069
I knew that was it.

1618
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,979
"This is crazy."

1619
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,449
Darn it.

1620
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:13,720
Even if I look at it again,
it's extremely difficult to find.

1621
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,960
People might wonder
why it took such a long time to find it.

1622
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,529
But I can say this with confidence.

1623
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:21,430
You try it.
You won't be able to find it either.

1624
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:24,159
It was hidden...

1625
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,699
very carefully.

1626
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,600
If you think about it,

1627
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,300
If I hadn't found it
by the Day of the Raid,

1628
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,939
I wouldn't have been able to use the item.

1629
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:33,909
For days, I was filled with frustration,

1630
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,180
anxiously pacing back and forth alone
in the early morning,

1631
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,279
and then I bumped into Si Yoon
and pretended I pooped.

1632
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:38,810
(Early morning of the second day)

1633
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,119
(He bumped into Si Yoon
while he was secretly working as a spy.)

1634
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,279
(Glancing)

1635
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,319
Did you come down because you were hungry?

1636
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:49,390
No. I don't eat breakfast.
It's because I have a stomach ache.

1637
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,029
I did all sorts of things.

1638
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,100
Those memories flashed before me
like a panorama,

1639
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,760
and I recalled those difficult moments.

1640
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,770
"I finally found it. Darn it."

1641
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:03,199
If you see Jin Ho by any chance...

1642
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:05,270
- Jin Ho is roaming outside.
- Jin Ho.

1643
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,710
Where is he?

1644
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,609
I haven't seen him all day.

1645
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:11,449
Where did he go?

1646
01:15:17,619 --> 01:15:19,989
The location of the pantry
with the Contact Box,

1647
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,920
which I could use to send messages,

1648
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:24,159
was actually very dangerous.

1649
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,899
People could see it
while going down the stairs.

1650
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,319
I have a stomach ache.

1651
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,449
(Glancing)

1652
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,449
I took everything inside...

1653
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:25,390
to send messages quickly,

1654
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:27,489
which got me excited.

1655
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:30,989
Darn it.

1656
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,399
Seriously.

1657
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,239
This is so hard.

1658
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:48,180
It seemed they were in a hurry.

1659
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,680
They asked me questions.

1660
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:54,609
They explained the situation.
Pani Bottle, Eon Kyu,

1661
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:56,720
and Steve were there.

1662
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,220
"Third floor."

1663
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,289
They're going to break the glass
on the third floor?

1664
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,359
They must be crazy. Hold on.

1665
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,829
Why are they curious...

1666
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,060
about the ceiling on the third floor?

1667
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,260
Overall, they asked...

1668
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,399
about the best way to conduct the raid.

1669
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:15,899
That was the main question.

1670
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:19,270
I thought I should let them know
what was going on quickly.

1671
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:20,939
So I grabbed a pen in a hurry.

1672
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:24,579
"It seems a little dangerous
to break the glass."

1673
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:25,779
I wrote something like that.

1674
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:28,920
"They gave up on the second floor
and did everything..."

1675
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:30,449
"to defend the third floor."

1676
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:32,819
(The window next to the 3rd-floor door
looks breakable, but it looks dangerous.)

1677
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:34,920
(Jang Dong Min is taking the lead.
They're all defending the 3rd floor.)

1678
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:39,229
(Continuing to act like his stomach hurts)

1679
01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:03,119
I did my part.

1680
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,550
That's what I thought.

1681
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:12,689
Did you get some sleep?

1682
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:15,159
- Yes.
- Are you okay?

1683
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,760
- I'm not okay.
- Oh, no.

1684
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:20,000
Do you understand how we feel?

1685
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:22,140
We were here for two nights.

1686
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,340
It was so uncomfortable
because it was so humid.

1687
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,850
I really couldn't sleep.
Even though I was tired,

1688
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,810
it was hard to fall asleep there.

1689
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:35,720
I couldn't really sleep.

1690
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:38,289
I was sleeping,

1691
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,050
and someone kept tapping me.

1692
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,029
When I woke up, I saw
that water was dropping on my clothes.

1693
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,569
- Oh, no.
- So I took this off and dried it a bit.

1694
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:58,810
I dried it and put it on again.

1695
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,640
I at least want to change.

1696
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,640
That was my wish yesterday.

1697
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,479
That humidity and that smell.

1698
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:11,520
The clothes I had on since the day before.

1699
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:13,550
I kept sweating,

1700
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,420
and I had on the same clothes.

1701
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,590
I kept smelling like sweat.

1702
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,060
You really shouldn't go
to the Remaining Living Space.

1703
01:19:25,729 --> 01:19:27,029
- What is that?
- Is something here?

1704
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:34,010
- Why are there so many?
- What? A message?

1705
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,109
Did Jin Ho write it?

1706
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,510
- There's a message.
- One message.

1707
01:19:38,109 --> 01:19:39,250
A message?

1708
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:41,579
(Spy Hong Jin Ho's message arrives.)

1709
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:42,720
What is this?

1710
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,819
"No one found out I was a spy."

1711
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:46,590
"But Yurisa saw the Underground Prison..."

1712
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,090
There's an Underground Prison?

1713
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:49,659
There must be an Underground Prison
in Paradise.

1714
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:52,789
- How could there be a prison there?
- What is this?

1715
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,199
How did they find the Underground Prison?

1716
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,930
"What is this?"
That's what I was thinking the most.

1717
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:02,770
Was there a reason
to lie about everything like that?

1718
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,939
It wasn't just me. Nobody could find it.

1719
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,109
So I thought, "What is this?
Where is this place?"

1720
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:10,439
"The window next to the third-floor door
looks breakable, but it looks dangerous."

1721
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,909
"Jang Dong Min is taking the lead.
They're all defending the third floor."

1722
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,579
- "They're all defending the third floor."
- This one also says,

1723
01:20:15,579 --> 01:20:17,479
"They gave up on the 2nd floor and went
all-in on defending the 3rd floor."

1724
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,220
"They completely blocked the door
with the third floor symbol."

1725
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:22,659
Right. They're going all-in
on the third floor.

1726
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:25,029
- Eon Kyu. If this is really the case,
- Yes.

1727
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,029
we need to break the one
in the Main Hall first.

1728
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:29,199
So when we first start,
someone should break that.

1729
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,199
- Start with the one in the Main Hall.
- Then we can go to the third floor.

1730
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,329
- That sounds good.
- Seriously. Let's do that.

1731
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:33,869
- Then it's all over.
- Okay.

1732
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,069
- Right?
- I like it.

1733
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:36,399
Jin Ho sent the last five messages...

1734
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,970
all at once.

1735
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,409
They said,
"They went all-in on the third floor."

1736
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,109
What he told us was very helpful.

1737
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,449
We made our strategy
based on those messages.

1738
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:49,220
I brought that.

1739
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,149
- I drew a map.
- Really?

1740
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:52,850
- That's such a relief.
- Because...

1741
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:56,319
The Paradise we were in
has a unique structure.

1742
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:57,560
It's not like a normal building.

1743
01:20:57,789 --> 01:20:59,489
I thought we would need
some sort of a map...

1744
01:20:59,489 --> 01:21:01,029
to come up with a strategy.

1745
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:03,560
I drew a map...

1746
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,130
before the Deathmatch.

1747
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:11,039
(Pani Bottle drew a map
before the Deathmatch.)

1748
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,739
Let's see.

1749
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:16,710
(Checking where all symbols are)

1750
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:18,210
- Here is my room.
- Hold on.

1751
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,250
- We should go in through here?
- Right.

1752
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,149
This wall here is a fake wall.

1753
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,920
(The walls on either side are fake walls.)

1754
01:21:26,989 --> 01:21:28,789
- Should we break this from the back?
- We could do that.

1755
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:30,920
- We could get lucky...
- We could get lucky...

1756
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,659
- and break that along with the wall.
- Right.

1757
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:35,000
You know that wall, right?

1758
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,899
The glass wall on the map earlier.

1759
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,569
There's a fake wall behind the glass wall.

1760
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:42,739
It looks like brick, but when you hit it,

1761
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:43,939
- it's just a fake wall.
- A fake wall.

1762
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:45,770
We should break that and go in.

1763
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:48,310
- Let's break them all.
- Let's break them all.

1764
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,010
We just have to break everything in sight.

1765
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:51,279
Let's not think...

1766
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:53,279
about how we'll sleep once we get in here.

1767
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,779
We can sleep in the break room
because it has air conditioning.

1768
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:57,279
I'm not concerned
about how we'll sleep at all.

1769
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,949
- Same.
- Let's give up on all of that.

1770
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,449
- It can't be worse than here.
- Let's give up on all of that.

1771
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:03,689
I think
we need to make some tools to use...

1772
01:22:03,689 --> 01:22:05,789
when we make the raid.

1773
01:22:05,789 --> 01:22:06,859
(The Remaining players start looking
for tools for the raid.)

1774
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:08,159
How many floors does this place have?

1775
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,829
This place goes up to the second floor.

1776
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,399
What is this? There's something like this.

1777
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,470
(Pani Bottle found a sledgehammer.)

1778
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,939
(Testing it out right away)

1779
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,380
Let's take that too.

1780
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,649
That's nice. That could even break glass.

1781
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:37,060
He found a sledgehammer
and a hammer from somewhere.

1782
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,789
He also found a helmet.
He was good at finding things.

1783
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:45,170
We were expanding attacking prospects
with those tools.

1784
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,970
Pani Bottle and Eon Kyu
made such a good plan.

1785
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:51,810
I thought it was already game over
when we made the plan.

1786
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:55,310
We're even planning to break walls.
I think we'll succeed.

1787
01:22:55,939 --> 01:22:59,409
I'm sure over 90 percent of the symbols...

1788
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:01,880
will be the pyramids.

1789
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:05,449
But the knife is getting in the way.

1790
01:23:05,649 --> 01:23:07,649
Because it's in every location.

1791
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,520
It's here and at the Mansion too.

1792
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,020
- Right.
- I think that means something.

1793
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:17,159
(Another symbol in Bloody Game 3,
the knife)

1794
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,670
(In front of the pool on the 1st floor)

1795
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,630
(At the end of the hall on the 2nd floor)

1796
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,770
(At the Sky Garden on the 3rd floor)

1797
01:23:23,869 --> 01:23:25,770
Everyone thinks the symbol...

1798
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:29,810
is the pyramid with the eye.

1799
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,439
We knew there was the pyramid symbol.

1800
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,550
Strangely, there was a knife next to that.

1801
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:36,520
There was one each
on each of the three floors.

1802
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,590
I thought the knife could be the symbol.

1803
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,720
I think it could be the knife.

1804
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,920
Did you see the drawing in the Main Hall?

1805
01:23:44,489 --> 01:23:46,590
This drawing is also a knife,

1806
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:47,829
not an eye.

1807
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,560
There are many knives.

1808
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,069
- Right.
- There are decorative knives.

1809
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,869
Maybe we'll have to use the knives.

1810
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,140
- So the knives...
- It could be the knife.

1811
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,369
- So...
- If it is, that makes it even easier.

1812
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:02,909
Does the symbol change
when you open Pandora's Box?

1813
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,779
Does it change to the knife?

1814
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,710
That makes it much easier.

1815
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:11,479
In the rules for the Day of the Raid,
it says, "When Pandora's Box is opened,"

1816
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,050
"the Remaining players will be given
an advantage at the time of the raid."

1817
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,489
- So it's good to make them open it.
- Yes.

1818
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:18,890
That must be it.

1819
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:19,989
If it becomes the knife,
it gets much easier for us.

1820
01:24:19,989 --> 01:24:22,399
As soon as it becomes the knife,
the difficulty level drops a lot.

1821
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,869
- Wait. Something is here.
- Jin Ho?

1822
01:24:25,869 --> 01:24:28,000
- Let's go and look.
- Gather around, everyone.

1823
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,100
- What?
- What?

1824
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,010
- What?
- Today is the Day of the Raid.

1825
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:35,409
If you raid Bloody Paradise
and destroy the symbol,

1826
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:38,239
you can become the new owners of Paradise.

1827
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,850
The raid will begin after midnight.

1828
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:44,720
On the Day of the Raid,
any use of force is permitted.

1829
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:47,050
You will be given 90 minutes for the raid,

1830
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,659
and you will have three symbols
you must find and destroy.

1831
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,859
If you want to take over Paradise,

1832
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:54,390
do everything in your power...

1833
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,899
to destroy the symbol.

1834
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:59,029
However, you must vote
to choose one player before the raid...

1835
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:01,270
who will be the sacrificial player.

1836
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,069
If your raid succeeds,
you'll be given a chance...

1837
01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:06,670
to save the sacrificial player.

1838
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:09,279
If your raid fails,
the sacrificial player...

1839
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:12,250
will not be able to participate
in the team matches that start tomorrow,

1840
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:15,319
and they will have a Deathmatch
with the elimination candidate...

1841
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:16,850
from the team that loses the team match.

1842
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:24,289
The raid is very important.

1843
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:26,489
That's the reason this team exists.

1844
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:28,500
That's my goal.

1845
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:30,760
A powerful raid.

1846
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:32,529
I was planning to break everything.

1847
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,840
Also,
let's decide on the sacrificial player.

1848
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:37,369
I'll be the sacrificial player.

1849
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:41,140
No. We need you.

1850
01:25:42,979 --> 01:25:45,850
We need you to use the fire extinguisher,
yell, and cause chaos.

1851
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,119
I'm all about winning.

1852
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:55,689
I'm all about winning.

1853
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:56,960
We need to win.

1854
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,659
If we're thinking like that,

1855
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,260
we should make Hye Seon
the sacrificial player?

1856
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,770
This isn't personal at all.

1857
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,300
- I just want to win.
- Of course. Why would this be personal?

1858
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,670
I'm just thinking about how to win.

1859
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,170
Of course, this isn't personal.

1860
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,770
The conversation was basically leading...

1861
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:15,710
to me being the sacrificial player.

1862
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:17,680
Naturally, from the beginning,

1863
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,310
the sacrificial player
I was thinking of...

1864
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,310
was Hye Seon.

1865
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:24,119
I had Hye Seon in my mind
as the sacrificial player.

1866
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:27,149
For the raid, we need physical power.

1867
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:29,489
Since Hye Seon is a girl,

1868
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:31,720
she's not as physically strong as a guy.

1869
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:34,590
Honestly, I think we have to do this
in order to win.

1870
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:37,399
I can't really disagree with that...

1871
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:38,569
You know the area well.

1872
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:40,500
That too, and I could do...

1873
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,239
a bit more of the rough things.

1874
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:47,039
But besides you lacking some power,

1875
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:49,039
I don't think you're the best choice.

1876
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,479
If you think
we'll definitely lose without me,

1877
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:53,079
then I won't be the sacrificial player.

1878
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:54,510
But I don't think that'll be the case.

1879
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:57,720
- But...
- That's just what I think.

1880
01:26:57,949 --> 01:26:59,949
If we're thinking strategically,
you really have to come with us.

1881
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:02,920
To increase our chances of winning.

1882
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,060
We should do so
to increase our chances of winning.

1883
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,659
To increase our chances of winning.

1884
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:15,000
I want to hear...

1885
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:17,369
what Hye Seon has to say.

1886
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:20,369
I don't know why I felt that way,

1887
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:21,869
but I felt a bad sympathy toward her.

1888
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,409
Because Hye Seon was dragged
to the Remaining Living Space...

1889
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:24,909
as soon as she got here,

1890
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:27,310
and she barely got to participate
in the games.

1891
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,520
She was just staying in a place
with a leaking roof.

1892
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,050
And she was really looking forward
to the raid.

1893
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:34,890
She looked very excited,

1894
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:36,789
but people were basically saying,
"Get out."

1895
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:39,760
Hye Seon couldn't really argue
against them,

1896
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:43,130
but she was looking discouraged
and concerned.

1897
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:44,760
She must've felt wronged.

1898
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,329
We can't tell who'll be better
until we try.

1899
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:47,930
And actually, she is taller.

1900
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:51,569
Hye Seon. Do you want to go?

1901
01:27:51,569 --> 01:27:52,640
Yes, I'll go.

1902
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:55,810
Okay. Then I'll stay.

1903
01:27:59,109 --> 01:28:00,250
Really?

1904
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:02,579
But as an aside...

1905
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:03,680
But someone has to stay.

1906
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,920
Someone has to stay.

1907
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:08,550
Don't we need to vote on this anyway?

1908
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,720
Right. We do need to vote.

1909
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:13,659
This is how I feel.

1910
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:16,260
I feel so bad because you were sent here
as soon as you arrived.

1911
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:19,170
But the team wants you.

1912
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,430
To increase our chances of winning,
even by just a little bit.

1913
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,840
If I stay and Hye Seon goes,

1914
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,300
I'm just saying
we'd have a slightly higher chance...

1915
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,710
What if we lose?

1916
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:30,539
Then it'll partially be my fault
because I made that decision.

1917
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:34,180
I won't criticize anyone.

1918
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,520
I said I would go.

1919
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:38,319
- I said I wouldn't go, so how would I...
- No, we would criticize you.

1920
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:41,890
- Why did you make us lose by staying?
- If we lose.

1921
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:44,159
It might not be because I stayed.

1922
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,220
That's true, but still.

1923
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,760
In a game of probabilities,
every little decision is important.

1924
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,699
You should go with us.

1925
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,199
- I really don't know.
- Let's vote.

1926
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,770
If I'm going to be criticized
even if I go,

1927
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:57,800
what am I supposed to do?

1928
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:01,640
I just use tools and act crazy.

1929
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,880
I'm not strong.

1930
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:06,010
Personally,
I didn't think our chances of winning...

1931
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,510
would decrease...

1932
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:10,279
just because Hye Seon went.

1933
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,189
Personal feelings aside,

1934
01:29:12,189 --> 01:29:13,789
I believe Hye Seon needs to be...

1935
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:16,689
the sacrificial player
to increase our chances of winning.

1936
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,329
They don't let
the sacrificial player go...

1937
01:29:19,329 --> 01:29:22,399
as soon as your team's raid succeeds.

1938
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,430
It said your team would get...

1939
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:27,630
the chance to save the sacrificial player
if your team's raid succeeds.

1940
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:30,539
If so, the sacrificial player
isn't 100 percent safe...

1941
01:29:30,539 --> 01:29:32,310
from being sent home.

1942
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,909
If I'm sacrificed
as the sacrificial player...

1943
01:29:35,909 --> 01:29:38,979
and don't even get saved in the end,

1944
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:42,149
I imagine I would be so frustrated.

1945
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,619
Wait. Something is here.

1946
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,989
"All players. Please choose..."

1947
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,590
"the player who will be sent
as the sacrificial player."

1948
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,329
"When you vote
for the sacrificial player,"

1949
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:55,800
"you will be able to use
the Ghost Casino's menu."

1950
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,130
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1951
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,170
Darn it.

1952
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:11,210
The person with more strength must go.

1953
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:15,180
If I get sent home
without getting to play even once,

1954
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:17,380
I imagine I would be so frustrated.

1955
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,590
(Choi Hye Seon, 1 vote for Pani Bottle)

1956
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:22,159
I voted for Pani Bottle.

1957
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,689
This feels like deja vu.

1958
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:28,800
I hope it won't happen this time.

1959
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:32,000
(The voting is over.)

1960
01:30:33,069 --> 01:30:35,840
- What?
- No, it's not that.

1961
01:30:38,739 --> 01:30:41,609
The result of the voting of
the sacrificial player will be announced.

1962
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:47,850
The player who will be sacrificed
as the sacrificial player...

1963
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:49,550
for the raid on Bloody Paradise...

1964
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,020
is Pani Bottle.

1965
01:30:55,449 --> 01:30:56,720
I'm safe.

1966
01:30:58,689 --> 01:30:59,960
I decided to stay.

1967
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:03,460
If you want to let her go,
let's do a random draw.

1968
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:06,770
If I want to let her go,
can't I just decide to do that?

1969
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:08,970
Let's just do the draw.

1970
01:31:09,869 --> 01:31:12,869
If we do this, she'll be upset.

1971
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:14,939
If we do this, he'll be upset.

1972
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:15,979
We'll just accept whatever result, right?

1973
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:17,539
- We can do that.
- Yes.

1974
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:18,880
- What do you think?
- It sounds good to me.

1975
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,449
- I think that'd be better.
- Okay. Let's do that.

1976
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:21,550
The two of us.

1977
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,380
Because we're all responsible...

1978
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:26,720
for the result of the raid,

1979
01:31:26,789 --> 01:31:28,890
we couldn't just let one person...

1980
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:30,890
make the decision.
So we did a random draw.

1981
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:33,489
I think it was a reasonable proposal
for a good compromise.

1982
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:35,829
Pani Bottle,
the sacrificial player for the raid,

1983
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:39,399
please head to the Remaining Prison
on the first underground level.

1984
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:40,930
- The first underground level?
- There is a prison.

1985
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,770
It's upstairs.

1986
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,279
It was 50-50.

1987
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:02,220
Our plan wasn't bad,

1988
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:05,390
but Dong Min's team
already knew about the raid.

1989
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,260
They were very well-prepared.

1990
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:28,680
(Pani Bottle, the sacrificial player,
is now in the Remaining Prison.)

1991
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:31,380
How could they give me nothing?

1992
01:32:39,329 --> 01:32:42,159
Go and break three symbols.

1993
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,260
That's all.

1994
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:44,800
It feels like we're going to war.

1995
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:52,439
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1996
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:53,710
Hey, we have trouble.

1997
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,010
Hey. It's here.

1998
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:00,579
I thought of the Day of the Raid...

1999
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:02,079
as D-day.

2000
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:06,520
I felt a bit uncomfortable.

2001
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,289
It was a very ironic situation.

2002
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:12,060
My original identity is a spy.

2003
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:16,460
But I spent several days
with Team Paradise here.

2004
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,100
My affection for them grew.

2005
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,970
Even though I didn't always love them,
my affection for them grew.

2006
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,199
That made me weak.

2007
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:26,739
I definitely feel myself
kind of going back and forth. I do.

2008
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,340
Yesterday, one person was eliminated...

2009
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:32,880
from Bloody Game 3.

2010
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,279
- What?
- What? Yesterday?

2011
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:35,350
Yesterday?

2012
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,619
Today...

2013
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:43,359
- is the Day of the Kidnapping.
- Kidnapping?

2014
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:45,659
The winner
of last night's Money Challenge,

2015
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:47,130
Heo Seong Beom,

2016
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,829
- opened Pandora's Box.
- What?

2017
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:52,930
As such, you can kidnap
one new outside player.

2018
01:33:53,869 --> 01:33:55,699
What are they saying?

2019
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,770
- That's a good thing.
- In 30 minutes,

2020
01:33:58,869 --> 01:34:01,909
you will head to the place
to kidnap an outside player.

2021
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,279
Heo Seong Beom,
please head to the voting room...

2022
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:07,909
and receive the information
you need for the kidnapping.

2023
01:34:09,449 --> 01:34:11,420
We're not defending today.
We're going there.

2024
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,949
- We're going to kidnap someone.
- Exactly. We're going out.

2025
01:34:13,949 --> 01:34:15,550
I didn't expect this at all.

2026
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:16,760
- What is this?
- Right?

2027
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:18,819
If there's a kidnapping,

2028
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,090
that means there's also an invasion.

2029
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:24,000
If so, we need to decide
whether to take someone...

2030
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,229
- needed for the invasion...
- Someone strong.

2031
01:34:25,229 --> 01:34:26,699
- I brought it.
- What is it?

2032
01:34:26,699 --> 01:34:27,800
- This is so interesting.
- What is it?

2033
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,829
Can we look?

2034
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,199
- I'll open this first.
- Okay.

2035
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,069
- It's a map.
- Is it a map?

2036
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:35,909
What is this?

2037
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:37,640
This isn't this place, right?

2038
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,279
- I think it's theirs.
- Right. It's theirs.

2039
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:41,010
- It's a map of their place.
- This place is round.

2040
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:42,350
(Paradise)

2041
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:44,220
(Mansion)

2042
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,319
There's another building.

2043
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,590
This place isn't completely wild either,
it seems.

2044
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:51,760
When we go, this place will be empty.

2045
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,829
If Team Remaining comes then,
it would be very nice.

2046
01:34:53,829 --> 01:34:54,960
Couldn't they come then?

2047
01:34:55,229 --> 01:34:57,329
"The information on the player
you will kidnap..."

2048
01:34:57,329 --> 01:35:00,569
"is in the security camera room
that is the outside survival ground."

2049
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:05,640
(The Mansion's security camera room
behind a secret door)

2050
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:11,739
(A hidden space behind the voting room)

2051
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,479
"There are no limitations
to the kidnapping methods."

2052
01:35:13,479 --> 01:35:14,949
"Regardless of whether or not
the kidnapping succeeds or fails,"

2053
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:16,720
"you must return before midnight
for it to stand."

2054
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,020
We should convince them to come.

2055
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:19,819
We can make up a situation...

2056
01:35:19,819 --> 01:35:21,119
- and say we're scouting them.
- Right.

2057
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,319
Then the people whose faces are known
should do it.

2058
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,859
- The box...
- What was in Pandora's Box?

2059
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:28,590
There was an advantage and a disadvantage.
I think,

2060
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:31,760
since bringing one person
is a good thing for our team,

2061
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,029
this must be a benefit.

2062
01:35:33,029 --> 01:35:34,800
- In Pandora's Box...
- Is this happening...

2063
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,970
because you opened Pandora's Box?

2064
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,239
- Yes.
- It seems like it.

2065
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:43,880
It sounded quite scary.

2066
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:46,279
(Rules of Pandora's Box)

2067
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:52,050

2068
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,149

will stay in effect..."

01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,289
"until the next Money Challenge."

2072
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:03,699
I can survive until tomorrow, I see.

2073
01:36:04,829 --> 01:36:05,930
Good.

2074
01:36:06,069 --> 01:36:08,529

and question mark?"

01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:10,239

(Sighing)

2078
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,239
Bad.

2079
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:16,810
What could be the bad thing?

2080
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:18,380
Why won't they tell us
what the disadvantage is?

2081
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:21,710
I was really surprised when I saw that.

2082
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:23,520
The good one said
"Elimination Exemption Card..."

2083
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,319
and a question mark.

2084
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:28,720
When I flipped it over,
the bad one had a question mark too.

2085
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,560
And it said,
"To be revealed at the next game."

2086
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:33,859
What is this?

2087
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,430
What's going to happen?

2088
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,260
We don't have time,
so we need to gather our supplies.

2089
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,659
Don't we each have windbreakers?

2090
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:41,329
Pack some hats and windbreakers.

2091
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:43,670
This is a funny situation.
This is interesting.

2092
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,239
We prepared so much for defense,
but we're the ones attacking.

2093
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:49,909
I don't think it'd be a bad idea...

2094
01:36:49,909 --> 01:36:51,479
for some of us to stay here.

2095
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:52,880
No, that's meaningless.

2096
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,449
It won't be that intense.

2097
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,819
That's not it. I'm sure someone will come.

2098
01:36:58,819 --> 01:37:00,390
There's an intention behind making us
empty this mansion.

2099
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:02,720
Right. Why would they want us
to empty this place?

2100
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,989
We weren't told that all of us
had to leave.

2101
01:37:04,989 --> 01:37:07,590
Right. That's the hole in the rule.

2102
01:37:07,789 --> 01:37:08,930
We should stop them.

2103
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:11,000
We should stop them
from seeing what this place looks like.

2104
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,529
So before they raid the place,

2105
01:37:13,529 --> 01:37:14,829
they'll be given time
to explore this place.

2106
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:17,399
Right. I feel like
they will be given that time...

2107
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:18,800
to look around this place.

2108
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,010
That might be true.

2109
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:21,869
But it's meaningless to raid this place...

2110
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:24,180
if they aren't taking away this mansion.

2111
01:37:29,779 --> 01:37:31,350
Can't someone stay here?

2112
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:33,789
You should stay.

2113
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:36,960
- I think it'll be good to have you stay.
- Me too.

2114
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,819
I think it's meaningless.

2115
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,489
I didn't know that MJ was that meticulous.

2116
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,159
MJ suddenly said,
"What if they break in..."

2117
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,460
"when the mansion is empty?"

2118
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,770
Things got complicated.

2119
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,229
It's true that they can really break in
when the mansion is empty.

2120
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:53,210
Will you be staying here?

2121
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:56,479
Dong Min. Do you think it's right to stay?

2122
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,909
(Looking)

2123
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,479
- One person.
- How many?

2124
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:02,510
Also,
if you read the rules of Pandora's Box,

2125
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:03,779
it says that a big advantage
and disadvantage will come...

2126
01:38:03,779 --> 01:38:05,020
to the one who opens the box.

2127
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:08,149
If this is an advantage,

2128
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:10,859
there should definitely be a disadvantage.

2129
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:12,989
I think there's something behind
emptying this place.

2130
01:38:12,989 --> 01:38:16,159
If we all leave,
another team could come...

2131
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,729
and be given the time
to look around the place.

2132
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:19,829
It could be something like that.

2133
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,600
I don't think that's a bad idea.

2134
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,100
- They could look around the mansion.
- Right.

2135
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:26,310
While looking around the mansion,

2136
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:27,369
they can destroy what we've made.

2137
01:38:27,739 --> 01:38:29,409
- The things we've made?
- Right.

2138
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:33,409
- We'll be leaving in 2 minutes?
- We have 2 minutes left.

2139
01:38:33,409 --> 01:38:35,510
So is it better for someone
to stay or not?

2140
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:37,750
The thing that could be a loss for us...

2141
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:39,520
is just that. They can...

2142
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,819
- They can look around this place.
- Right.

2143
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,890
So it'll be better for someone to stay.

2144
01:38:45,159 --> 01:38:46,859
I'll stay by the stairs then.

2145
01:38:46,989 --> 01:38:48,229
You should just stay here comfortably.

2146
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:49,659
The place is...

2147
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,560
not the staircase
but the area in the middle.

2148
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,069
- In between the two automatic doors?
- Right.

2149
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,829
The cafeteria inside the automatic doors.

2150
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:57,069
The place where the food is set up.

2151
01:38:57,069 --> 01:38:58,600
You can see everything from that place.

2152
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,369
You can see the garden...

2153
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:01,739
and the other entrance from there.

2154
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:03,909
- Okay.
- We'll leave it to you.

2155
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:05,680
- Good luck.
- I'm going to beat them up...

2156
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,949
- Okay.
- with my fists.

2157
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:08,579
Gosh, she's so scary.

2158
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,279
I'm serious.

2159
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:12,649
It was a chance for our team...

2160
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,649
to easily get inside.

2161
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,689
MJ was able to catch onto that well,

2162
01:39:17,689 --> 01:39:20,130
so one person was left to stay
in the mansion.

2163
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:21,590
I left while feeling disappointed.

2164
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,760
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

2165
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,800
I feel nervous.

2166
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:33,739
This is a real kidnap.

2167
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:39,380
I wish there's someone valuable.

2168
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:44,380
Good luck.

2169
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:46,920
- I'll protect the mansion.
- We'll be back. Protect the mansion.

2170
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,050
Be careful.

2171
01:39:48,689 --> 01:39:50,420
Choose a good player.

2172
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:09,479
Let's make a mess.

2173
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,289
(Bloody Mansion)

2174
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:28,430
I feel excited.

2175
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:31,130
- What do we do?
- I really feel excited.

2176
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:35,430
- I'll show them.
- So this is why we had no game.

2177
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:37,939
- This must be the game.
- Right.

2178
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:39,170
Let's leave.

2179
01:40:39,609 --> 01:40:41,439
They will probably come from there, right?
There's a lot more space there.

2180
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,479
There's a possibility
they will come from there.

2181
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:46,649
This side, right?

2182
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:48,880
- It's 100 percent, right?
- Right.

2183
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,279
They will come from here for sure.

2184
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:54,420
(The predicted area
the intruders will come from)

2185
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,520
I expected intruders from the Mansion.

2186
01:40:57,789 --> 01:41:00,890
When we were sleeping in the morning,

2187
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:02,090
a siren went off.

2188
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:04,460
(This morning)

2189
01:41:05,729 --> 01:41:07,270
An intruder has broken into the house.

2190
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:10,369
- An intruder has broken into the house.
- What?

2191
01:41:10,369 --> 01:41:12,470
- An intruder has broken into the house.
- What's going on?

2192
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:20,449
(The intruder siren went off
in the Mansion.)

2193
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:24,619
As I thought there were going to be
threatening attacks,

2194
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:26,050
I moved around the area.

2195
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,359
Let's lock this up.

2196
01:41:34,359 --> 01:41:35,859
- We should close the gate.
- Right.

2197
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:39,670
We should try to stall them
as much as possible.

2198
01:41:43,869 --> 01:41:45,470
Here. I love it here.

2199
01:41:50,109 --> 01:41:52,710
We're not sure if they're looking for
the pyramid or the knife.

2200
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,380
- We're totally unsure.
- Right.

2201
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:02,720
Should we place
at least one person outside...

2202
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,890
to be on guard?

2203
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:06,659
Should that person shout
when there's a threat?

2204
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:09,260
The chance that
there will be a raid right now is...

2205
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,000
What is this?

2206
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,630
Where are they coming from? Who is coming?

2207
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:15,000
How many of them are coming?

2208
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,199
Dong Min.

2209
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:19,640
Let's go.

2210
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:33,920
Is it this way?

2211
01:42:42,029 --> 01:42:43,800
Stay quiet. Stay to the side.

2212
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,699
Hey! We have to go together.

2213
01:42:45,699 --> 01:42:47,229
- We have to go together!
- Yurisa!

2214
01:42:47,229 --> 01:42:49,199
We have to go together.

2215
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,069
We should move together.

2216
01:42:55,409 --> 01:42:57,840
We can get spotted if we move as a group.

2217
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:00,550
I'll move first and give signals.

2218
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:03,779
No. That's not it.

2219
01:43:04,649 --> 01:43:06,949
That's not it!

2220
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:09,050
Gosh.

2221
01:43:13,159 --> 01:43:14,329
Okay.

2222
01:43:19,029 --> 01:43:20,569
Whatever. Darn it.

2223
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,619
Where are we?

2224
01:43:42,119 --> 01:43:43,359
Why does it feel ominous?

2225
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:45,060
Very ominous.

2226
01:43:48,659 --> 01:43:50,430
- What?
- You heard something, right?

2227
01:43:53,699 --> 01:43:55,399
Look at this.

2228
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:58,270
Where are we?

2229
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:00,640
I think this is the basement.

2230
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:02,909
(Current location)

2231
01:44:02,909 --> 01:44:04,409
We're here.

2232
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:08,180
This is the laundry room.

2233
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,949
We have to find the Door of Secrets.

2234
01:44:17,689 --> 01:44:19,930
We're here right now.

2235
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:22,090
We have to move from the basement.

2236
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:25,960
- This is the first...
- Quiet! They're close.

2237
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,500
The place we are at...

2238
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:30,600
- There's no door here.
- We have to find it.

01:44:56,399 --> 01:44:57,560
It can't be.

2243
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:36,369
Is this a door?

2244
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:42,810
Is this a door?

2245
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:47,010
What? Who are you?
