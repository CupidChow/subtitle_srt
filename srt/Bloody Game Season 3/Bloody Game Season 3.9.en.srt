1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,139
Should we talk about the old Team Mansion
before it's too late?

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,679
Yes, let's talk about it now.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,119
Team Mansion still exists, you know.

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,119
Where's Min A?

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,419
I think she's in her room.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,050
You can come in.

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,489
- Get up.
- Yes.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,859
Why are you sleeping for so long?

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,230
No, I was just resting my eyes.

10
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,730
Do you want to finish what we were talking
about last night, Gina?

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,230
Sure.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,200
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm not going to.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,810
- I already ate.
- Good.

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
I asked you to be here...

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,210
because we sent you away
when you were a teammate, after all.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,020
So, your opinion matters more
from this point on.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,450
We'd be too shameless...

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,759
- to say, "Welcome back,"
- Right.

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,759
- "let's keep working as a team."
- That's true.

20
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,429
We don't have the right to say that.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,659
It's entirely up to you now.

22
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,000
So, I wanted to ask you about that first.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
The way things are going right now...

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,340
is Team Mansion is awkwardly
in between the competition...

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,680
of Team Paradise and Team Remaining.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,120
Dong Min wanted to use us...

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,480
as chess pieces.

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,260
It's so annoying.
We're like a punching bag.

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,120
You mean the scapegoat?

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,459
A scapegoat or a spy.

31
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,859
Whichever it is?

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,299
He wanted to take advantage of us?

33
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,060
He wants us to complete missions for him.

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,599
Actually, as soon as I got here,

35
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,939
you guys said,
"Yurisa was a spy," out of nowhere.

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,769
So, I was puzzled.

37
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,109
- But she wasn't a good liar, though.
- It shows.

38
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,340
She couldn't fool us.

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,140
At first, she was like, "No."

40
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,640
But her eyes were trembling.

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,250
- Did you watch the game?
- Yes, Spy.

42
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,150
I didn't do anything.

43
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,519
I understand how it happened, though.
We've been talking about it.

44
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,890
(Anxious)

45
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,790
Her eyes are huge,
and they were trembling.

46
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,689
She's such a bad liar.

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,260
Judging from all the information,

48
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,030
we can either declare neutrality or...

49
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,599
So, when we have 3 left,
and they're 6 against 6,

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,469
we can become Switzerland.

51
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,409
We'll tell them every game...

52
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,240
that we'll neither place first
nor place last.

53
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,610
Like, "We'll be locked up
in a small room..."

54
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,310
- "play clapping games every game."
- And pray.

55
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,719
- And pray.
- That will be our motto.

56
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,319
"We won't communicate with any teams,"

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,020
"won't be a spy for any teams,
and won't cooperate."

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,990
"We'll just stay silent." Then,

59
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,490
we won't be eliminated, at least.

60
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,990
It's not such a bad idea...

61
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,889
because they're fighting
against each other.

62
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,500
We realized your talent
through last night's game,

63
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,300
so both teams would want you.

64
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,669
I see.

65
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,069
It happened so out of the blue,
and I was puzzled.

66
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,039
I don't even know what to feel
at the moment.

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,750
To be perfectly honest,
I feel the most betrayed by these two.

68
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,219
Because Xitsuh and Yurisa joined
our team...

69
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,620
at the last minute.

70
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,830
But these two...

71
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,330
have been with me for a long time.

72
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,900
I was so upset...

73
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,840
because I felt betrayed by them.

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,379
I once considered them as teammates.

75
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,349
Especially Chungju-Man and Min A...

76
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,879
have been in Team Mansion
for a longer period.

77
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,819
It felt like no one was helping me.

78
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,590
Even with Yurisa. We clearly know...

79
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,419
how smart she is.

80
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,560
When you knew
that she didn't do anything...

81
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,500
I realized how little you thought of me.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,569
Whatever happened, the members
of Team Mansion felt both love and hate,

83
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,009
and I felt bad about sending her...

84
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,610
to the Deathmatch.

85
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,979
I think Xitsuh and Chungju-Man tried
to console her.

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,919
But I think she went
because she did poorly...

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,319
and came back because she did well.

88
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,520
I don't have a clear opinion about her.

89
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,289
I think too many people have
their own plans in their heads.

90
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,759
You said earlier...

91
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,960
that I'd be the scapegoat...

92
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,829
if I moved to another team
as they already had a bond.

93
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,399
But I...

94
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,769
feel like I'm the scapegoat
even in this team.

95
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,170
But that's not...

96
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,410
No, Min A. Stop.

97
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,110
So, I'm not exactly sure at the moment.

98
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,420
I'd feel alone wherever I was.

99
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,230
I realized that there was no team...

100
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,160
that I could consider my own.

101
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,029
I should probably think
about how to survive,

102
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,730
but I'm not sure what's a better decision.

103
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,399
I know I have to make up my mind,

104
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,170
but it's tough for me.

105
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,310
Please gather at the Main Hall.

106
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,779
Today's Money Challenge is
an individual match.

107
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,980
The winner of the Money Challenge...

108
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,889
becomes the ultimate power holder.

109
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,120
- Goodness.
- I'm scared.

110
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,620
The ultimate power holder gets
20,000 dollars of private funds...

111
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,290
- and two Immunity Passes.
- Two?

112
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,660
And he or she may transfer one
to another player.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Also, the ultimate power holder gets
the right...

114
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,439
to form the teams
for the team match tomorrow.

115
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,910
A team can have up to seven members,

116
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,110
and the losing team
in tomorrow's team match...

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,839
must live in the Remaining Living Space.

118
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,350
I never wanted
to go back to the Remaining,

119
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,620
so I wasn't so happy to hear that.

120
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,550
The experience in the previous season
was too traumatic.

121
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,990
It was the worst. I didn't want to go.

122
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,259
No person should ever live there.

123
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,930
I sincerely want to avoid going there.

124
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,600
Two players will be eliminated
in the individual match.

125
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,029
The bottom two players
of the individual match...

126
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,029
automatically become
elimination candidates.

127
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,029
The bottom two players.

128
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,569
And you will take a vote
between two players chosen...

129
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,040
by the bottom two players.

130
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,310
The most-voted player
and the bottom two players,

131
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,839
hence, a total of three players will go
to the Deathmatch.

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,149
Two players, excluding the winner,
will be eliminated...

133
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,350
and be forced to leave.

134
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,490
We will now announce the game
for the individual match.

135
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,720
- Okay.
- Good.

136
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,120
Today's Money Challenge is...

137
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,329
Seven Note.

138
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,730
(Seven Note)

139
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,259
Seven Note is
a 15-player individual match...

140
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,029
where players score points
when the notes assigned to them...

141
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,199
are played on a piano keyboard
as a specific song is played.

142
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,240
Each player is randomly assigned...

143
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,310
two out of twelve musical notes
ranging from do to ti.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,009
The note assignments are reset
every two rounds.

145
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,920
At the start of each round,

146
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,949
the note names of the song to be played
are revealed.

147
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,160
Players can use 20 coins,
which are distributed to them first,

148
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,620
to bet on changing the key of the song.

149
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,360
There are 12 possible keys,

150
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,230
and to move the key up by one,

151
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,230
players must bet
either 1 coin or 13 coins.

152
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,970
Once the betting phase is over,
the final key is revealed.

153
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,769
The key is adjusted upwards
by the number of coins...

154
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,040
bet by the players
who wagered the most coins.

155
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,779
When the notes
of the determined key are played,

156
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,250
players assigned
to the corresponding notes earn points.

157
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,250
If a player is assigned
to a white key note,

158
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,850
they receive 1 point per note hit
from Rounds 1 to 6...

159
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,350
and 2 points per note hit
in Rounds 7 and 8.

160
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,689
If a player is assigned
to a black key note,

161
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,129
they receive 2 points per note hit
from Rounds 1 to 6...

162
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,029
and 3 points per note hit
in Rounds 7 and 8.

163
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,430
Players can also use their coins
to purchase the item "Mute Token."

164
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,240
This item allows a player
to mute one specific note for one round,

165
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,970
preventing any player
assigned to that note...

166
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,879
from earning points for that round.

167
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,610
If two or more players attempt
to use the Mute Token,

168
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,379
only the note with the most coins
wagered will be muted.

169
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,290
Players who fail to mute a note
due to insufficient wagers...

170
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,660
will still lose their Mute Token.

171
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,990
The game consists
of a total of eight rounds.

172
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,660
After all rounds are completed,

173
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,959
the player with the highest total score is
declared the winner,

174
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,269
and the two players with the lowest scores
are designated as elimination candidates.

175
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,399
If the total scores are tied,
the tiebreakers are,

176
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,240
first, the player with the most coins
remaining will be ranked higher,

177
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,639
and second, the player with
the largest private funds...

178
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,339
before the game will be ranked higher.

179
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,350
The winning player can convert...

180
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,120
their remaining coins into cash
after the game.

181
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,850
Each coin is converted
into 10,000 dollars.

182
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,590
First off,
today's game is played individually.

183
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,629
But it's a team match
under the pretense of an individual match.

184
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,100
It's going to be a political game.

185
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,529
I expect the interests to get entangled.

186
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,730
There are separate teams,

187
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,700
and no one exchanges information
with other teams.

188
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,710
They try not to as they'll be suspected.

189
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,639
So,

190
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,009
even small misunderstandings are
hard to resolve.

191
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,980
It was especially different...

192
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,850
from the previous days.

193
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,279
Everyone was in a bad mood.

194
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,049
Not just our team. All the other teams.

195
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,419
They were all in a bad mood.

196
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,320
We could find a way to prevent betrayals.

197
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,460
Yes. I had an idea.

198
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,659
One of us gets all the notes,

199
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,000
and everyone else is in the dark.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,570
For instance, only you and I can know
because we know what's a better choice.

201
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:25,899
Only we know what's going on,
while Hye Seon doesn't.

202
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,009
We'll tell her to entrust us
with the decisions.

203
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,879
I never stopped suspecting...

204
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,179
Hye Seon to be a spy.

205
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,049
I left that possibility open.

206
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,720
We're trying to keep
our information within us.

207
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,149
This is a matter of trust.

208
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
- Say I'm the commander.
- Okay.

209
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,730
- Then, I know everyone's notes.
- Okay.

210
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,029
I organize what we have
and tell you what to bet on.

211
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,259
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

212
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,169
All you know is your own note.

213
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,840
- But I'm the only one who knows all.
- Just one person?

214
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,169
- Yes, one person only.
- We give it to one person.

215
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:01,370
If we have only one person
coordinating things,

216
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,610
there won't be any leaks.

217
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,840
I was slightly bothered,

218
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,879
but I couldn't speak up...

219
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,250
because they told me that it was...

220
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,250
their way of preventing further trouble,

221
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,389
while giving me trust.

222
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,320
- That sounds neat.
- The teammates...

223
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,629
- Otherwise, our information will leak.
- Yes, we can prevent that.

224
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,259
Since we're all talking to each other...

225
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,769
Then, either Jin Ho or Steve...

226
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,870
should collect all the information.

227
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,970
- We'll let Steve keep doing it.
- I'll follow your lead.

228
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,870
Or it could be Hyun Seo.

229
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,470
I think...

230
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,409
you and Hyun Seo could
both run point on it.

231
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,080
- We were thinking about that too.
- Since we trust these two.

232
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,250
- Sounds good.
- You could be mistaken...

233
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,950
- if you do it all by yourself.
- Yes.

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
We're playing it safer
by having two on the job.

235
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,889
- That sounds better to me.
- Sure.

236
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,320
But we still need to decide
on the order...

237
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,159
since the ones who have the information
should make the decision.

238
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,159
One, we can have someone place first.

239
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,129
A strategy that's fit
for making someone place first.

240
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,929
I think our best option is...

241
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,769
supporting the top player.

242
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,740
Of course, we'll do our best
to prevent anyone from placing last.

243
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,509
I think we should first decide...

244
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:11,909
when we can boost the top player.

245
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,049
We're using the coins...

246
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,049
- for both muting and key changes.
- Yes.

247
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,480
We'll have to evenly distribute them.

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,080
We need to mute other notes...

249
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,289
and change keys as well.

250
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,289
It's actually better
to have seven players.

251
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,620
It's a total of eight rounds,

252
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,029
so eight players are the best...

253
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,460
It's the best option, but eight of us?

254
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
We can't form such a team.

255
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,759
We can't guarantee everyone's success.

256
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,769
I think we should win over Xitsuh,
but I'm not sure.

257
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,370
Xitsuh?

258
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,440
If we're going to, let's hurry.

259
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,500
- Now?
- Yes.

260
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,440
- We'd better get moving.
- Xitsuh still...

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,769
feels loyal about starting...

262
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,840
in the same place.

263
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,649
But I'm a little concerned.

264
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,879
Dong Min is good...

265
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,720
at winning someone over with his words...

266
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,250
when there aren't that many benefits
he can give.

267
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,419
- Yes, he can talk.
- That's why I'm worried.

268
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,389
If they absorb Team Mansion,

269
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,830
we may be in danger.

270
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,559
Smoke? Pantry?

271
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,399
(Dong Min has already contacted
Team Mansion.)

272
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,730
First... No, don't come here.
Stand over there.

273
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,799
- If someone comes in,
- Yes,

274
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,039
tell them to keep out...

275
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,110
as you're having a meeting.

276
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,809
I'm always open to suggestions.

277
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,740
The winning strategy in this game is...

278
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,710
having eight or more players.

279
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,850
- Way better if it's nine.
- Right.

280
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,690
Then, we have the power...

281
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,850
to control the whole game.

282
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,320
It's certainly helpful to some extent...

283
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,490
when we outnumber the opponents.

284
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,059
You're at an advantage...

285
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,899
in an individual match
if you have more info.

286
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,870
I thought that individuals would have
the upper hand...

287
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,299
if they formed groups.

288
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,330
For instance,

289
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,870
nine people decided to play together.

290
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,139
Of those nine people,

291
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,980
we can make wagers on the notes...

292
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,840
chosen by the most people.

293
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:55,549
Do you get it?

294
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,679
But just 3 to 4 of you...

295
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,620
can't do that.

296
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,820
You'll barely win one point in a round.

297
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,320
So, it's not...

298
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,259
such a bad plan
to cooperate with each other...

299
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,799
- as a strategy.
- Right.

300
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,529
- You get it, right?
- I agree.

301
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,330
Have a meeting first,

302
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,139
and Xitsuh, come and talk to me.

303
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,470
Jin Ho's team is too strong at the moment.

304
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,240
Just counting the number of players,

305
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,039
it was 5 to 4 to 6.

306
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,179
We're 5, and Team Paradise is 6,

307
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,649
so we're short of coins.

308
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,549
We needed players and coins,

309
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,720
so we knew we had to win
over the neutral team.

310
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,990
(Jin Ho's team approaches Team Mansion
to recruit a member.)

311
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,590
- You can come in.
- We have one spot left in Team Paradise.

312
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,830
Think this through, everyone.

313
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,929
Is it on a first-come-first-served basis?

314
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,659
Just so you know, we're not so sure
if we'll lose.

315
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,000
Just keep that in mind.

316
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,169
You're not so sure?

317
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,370
Not so sure if we'll lose.

318
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,269
Think it through.

319
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,269
- We'll think it through.
- Think it through.

320
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,870
They all want us on their teams.

321
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,409
Casting vote.

322
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,450
Team Mansion turned into the odd one out,

323
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,450
so we're in a tough spot.

324
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,379
There are two strong groups,

325
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,990
and we need to focus on surviving...

326
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,860
between their power struggles.

327
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,460
We needed to talk about it...

328
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,990
and make a decision as soon as possible.

329
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,259
This is tough.

330
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,100
We're in such a funny position.

331
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,100
They both desperately want us
in this game, at least.

332
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,009
- Right.
- Wild cards like us are crucial.

333
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,940
And there are more strategies
than we think...

334
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,279
This is a purely political game.

335
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,149
We might have to move back and forth.

336
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,090
- To survive?
- To survive.

337
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
But from a bigger picture,
we're taking the Switzerland stance.

338
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
- Yes.
- From a bigger picture.

339
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,860
But I believe that stance...

340
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,860
will be effective in this game as well.

341
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
I agree.

342
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,929
Number one, we do nothing.

343
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,330
I honestly think doing nothing...

344
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,269
is a good idea.

345
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,139
At least we can save the coins.

346
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,299
At least...

347
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,639
- There won't be any high scorers.
- Right.

348
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,309
If we do nothing,

349
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,440
our value goes up in the later rounds.

350
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
That's true.

351
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,779
"You have 20 coins, right?"

352
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,549
"We'll bring you the points,
so do this for us."

353
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:11,919
They could offer such a deal.

354
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,350
And the elimination candidates
get to pick the others,

355
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,289
so we'll also have to try...

356
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,690
not to be picked during the game.

357
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,490
We might have to do our best
to win their favor...

358
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,490
so that they don't pick us.

359
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,629
Which strategy sounds...

360
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,759
the best to you?

361
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,299
What do you think we should do
to avoid placing last?

362
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,700
- In this situation.
- At the moment...

363
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,299
If we come at them, we'll be in trouble.

364
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,570
I think we should avoid
attacking them at all costs.

365
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,710
Why are they talking for so long?

366
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,340
(Dong Min revisited Team Mansion.)

367
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,679
- Hello, Dong Min.
- Hey.

368
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,710
Sorry for the delay.

369
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,710
Don't be.

370
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,049
I thought that
I should talk to you first...

371
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,879
- before I heard from you.
- Okay.

372
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,919
Your number-one concern must be this.

373
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,590
When you join one team...

374
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,730
"You guys said that you were neutral."

375
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,190
"And you joined forces with them?"

376
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,830
And then...

377
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,659
For the audacity...

378
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,799
I have close to 500,000 dollars.

379
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,200
(Dong Min persuades them by lying.)

380
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
So,

381
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,870
they're no match for us, anyway.

382
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:11,480
I never make promises that I can't keep.

383
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,950
I will guarantee your survival.

384
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,149
In the end,

385
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,350
only seven people can stay
in the Paradise.

386
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,649
When we decide on that,

387
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,350
no one gets to say, "I'm staying!"

388
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,720
Everything will be fair.

389
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,019
He was extremely persuasive.

390
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,159
He presents the facts
in a detailed and reasonable fashion.

391
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,529
"Our plan goes like this."

392
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,029
But Team Paradise was...

393
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,100
like...

394
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,299
We're not so sure if we'll lose.

395
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,700
Keep that in mind.

396
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,370
Just do what you want.

397
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,000
Make your own decisions.

398
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,110
"Well, if you come to us, good."

399
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,879
That was all.

400
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,179
They don't have the specifics.

401
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,909
He sounded reasonable.

402
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,779
He didn't want us...

403
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,419
to take advantage of us and abandon us.

404
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,549
He showed that he really needed us.

405
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,090
He told us,

406
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,019
"I will guarantee your survival,"
and it was the best promise...

407
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,860
you could hear from a guy
who always kept...

408
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,429
his promises in survival games.

409
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,630
- Do you get it?
- Yes, we do.

410
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,069
- Wait. I have one final question.
- Okay.

411
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,069
If we announce...

412
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,700
that we won't join any of the teams...

413
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,099
and won't try to win first place...

414
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,910
- without creating any variables...
- Yes.

415
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,309
We won't even use our coins.

416
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,740
Say we'll stay out of it...

417
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
without making any changes.

418
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,380
What would you think about that?

419
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,579
I don't mind that.

420
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,619
But won't you look...

421
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,019
too stupid?

422
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,619
What choice do we have, though?

423
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,549
- But...
- Team Mansion has been...

424
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,619
No, listen.

425
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,390
Here's what you're missing.

426
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,529
You think, "They won't attack us
if we act like we're neutral."

427
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,359
Hey.

428
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,670
If we join forces with them,
you guys are done.

429
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,799
Do you get it? If you act so foolishly,

430
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,809
why would any of us...

431
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,109
leave you alone?

432
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,380
"They're neutral.
Let's keep them out of it."

433
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Who would ever say that?

434
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,809
Dong Min suddenly changed...

435
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,779
and showed his true colors.

436
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,650
It felt like he was blackmailing us.

437
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,920
But at that moment...

438
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,390
But...

439
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,720
I was slightly offended.

440
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,690
It's a stupid strategy?

441
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,400
He's only trying to use us
as his tools, after all.

442
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,460
It's the same conclusion.

443
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,200
He only wants us
as his pieces to move around.

444
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,500
And he calls it stupid?

445
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
When there are 15 players?

446
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,210
He's already splitting sides?

447
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,440
Here's what I think.

448
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,809
I decided to play stupidly...

449
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,339
because he called it stupid.

450
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,579
He can attack us all he wants.

451
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,349
"Is that right?
Then, I'll show you how I survive."

452
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,450
I wanted to prove to him...

453
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,019
that there were other ways.

454
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,150
But not all four of us need
to do the same...

455
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,289
just because I chose to do so.

456
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,589
Moreover, it's not ideal for us...

457
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:40,519
in general.

458
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,230
We don't have to make the same decision.

459
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,559
Leaving Chungju-Man...

460
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,470
in the gray zone all by himself...

461
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,930
How should I put this?

462
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,470
Setting the rationality aside,

463
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,339
I just didn't want to leave him there.

464
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,269
I'm likely to play in the gray zone too.

465
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,880
I think that's better for me.

466
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,339
So, I announced it.

467
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,109
We don't even have a strategy.

468
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,279
When we're in the gray zone...

469
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,289
I don't think they'll care about us
as we're just a team of two.

470
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,720
It sounded like a good number,

471
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,059
so I decided to stay there.

472
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,319
I should be with him until the end.

473
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:15,859
What about you, Gina?

474
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,359
Seriously.

475
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,529
I wasn't sure about it.

476
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,569
And his dictatorial disposition...

477
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,309
wasn't that compatible with me.

478
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,740
So, I kept feeling bothered.

479
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,309
I wasn't too inclined to do it.

480
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,809
So, I talked to Hyun Seo...

481
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,680
to ask for advice.

482
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,750
I'm in a situation
where I need to choose one,

483
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,349
but I don't know what to do.

484
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,220
- But you're the most trustworthy, so...
- Well,

485
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,759
what's your goal?

486
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,859
Survival, of course.

487
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,200
I want to survive
and stay out of the Remaining.

488
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,829
You're finished
once you go to the Remaining.

489
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,329
I can't go there.

490
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,099
I don't want to.

491
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,970
- If I were you...
- What would you have done?

492
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,970
"The winning team is my team."

493
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,369
You'll need to make a deal
to save yourself.

494
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,779
Then, keep your coins
and approach the winning team.

495
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,279
Tell them, "I'll give these to you,"

496
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,180
"so secure the win with my help."

497
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,819
But what Team Remaining is offering...

498
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,990
is that we'll be loyal to each other
for the rest of the game...

499
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,960
if we join them now.

500
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,460
But if we don't,

501
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,190
we'll be in a situation...

502
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,900
where we become the first target.

503
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,630
But you won't be a target...

504
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,630
by not joining them...

505
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,970
at least in this game.

506
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,299
They could pick me...

507
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,599
to go to the Deathmatch with them.

508
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,539
But if you cooperate in the later rounds,

509
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,210
would they go,
"Why did you cooperate so late?"

510
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,210
"You're going to the Deathmatch?"

511
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,039
Then, they already wanted to send you.

512
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,779
So, it doesn't matter either way.

513
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,049
Also, it's simply impossible
to save a teammate...

514
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,750
just because they want to.

515
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,349
He's just boosting morale.

516
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,859
I'd rather you follow your reason.

517
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,819
Come to us.

518
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
Come to us when it's time.

519
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,329
I was slightly tempted by that.

520
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:02,269
"Yes, I'll maintain
my neutral position, and then, change."

521
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:03,869
I came to think that, but...

522
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,369
Fine. Let's keep it simple.
What's your decision?

523
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,940
I...

524
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
(Min A asked for Dong Min separately.)

525
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,609
My head has been in a jumble,

526
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,509
but I kept it simple.

527
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,579
"Where am I more likely to survive?"

528
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,710
- Yes.
- And my decision is your team.

529
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,049
I joined them as it seemed
like a better chance at surviving.

530
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,480
That's the only reason.

531
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,319
(Dong Min's team, Jin Ho's team)

532
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,890
(Gray Zone)

533
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,519
Before the beginning of Round One,

534
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,420
each player will enter...

535
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,529
the voting room one by one...

536
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,230
and pick two notes.

537
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,630
We talked about playing by ourselves
as we had four players, after all, but...

538
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,799
Did you tell them
that I was playing with them?

539
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,809
What? No, I heard from someone.

540
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,440
(Jin Ho sneakily heads
to the voting room.)

541
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:51,980
Hello.

542
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,349
(Jin Ho enters the voting room.)

543
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,720
Jin Ho, please pick two cards.

544
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:58,859
Okay.

545
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,400
(La)

546
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
(Sol)

547
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,630
Jin Ho, you've been assigned
to sol and la.

548
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,170
(Jin Ho picks sol and la.)

549
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,640
Okay.

550
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,569
Here I go.

551
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,309
(Acau enters the voting room.)

552
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,450
Where's Acau?

553
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,750
Acau!

554
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,250
Acau?

555
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,319
Acau!

556
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,619
Acau!

557
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,859
Oh, he's picking his notes.

558
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,420
- He's picking them?
- Yes.

559
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,799
(La)

560
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,259
Acau!

561
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,299
Acau, you've been assigned to sol and la.

562
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,599
(Jin Ho and Acau picked the same notes.)

563
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,799
(Sol and la)

564
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,710
I had to see if they were marked.

565
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,980
I looked from underneath and above.

566
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,119
I wondered if the production crew
planted some tricks,

567
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,079
so I looked through the light as well,
but there was nothing.

568
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,190
I thought, "There's nothing."

569
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,660
I wondered if I could mark them,

570
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,230
so I picked my cards...

571
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,700
while I had grease on my fingers
from eating chips.

572
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,460
I put it on the cards,
but she didn't stop me.

573
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,170
I realized that it would work.

574
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,799
I didn't consult with the team
before going into the voting room.

575
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,140
But when I saw Jin Ho going in,

576
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,640
I felt...

577
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,180
that he would try something funny.

578
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,509
Although I didn't have Dong Min's consent,

579
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,109
I followed him
and picked the cards second.

580
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,480
There was one with a fingerprint on it...

581
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,250
and another one with a nail mark.

582
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,819
I decided to make use of that.

583
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,160
- Pani.
- Yes?

584
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,559
- Did you pick your cards?
- Yes.

585
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,059
- I was going to.
- Yes, you can go now. Wait.

586
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,299
(Jin Ho calls for the members
after picking his notes.)

587
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,369
Just...

588
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,799
- It's nothing special.
- Come this way.

589
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,869
Oh, wait.

590
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:56,109
I have to tell everyone what my notes are.

591
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,539
- Right. Just tell me.
- Okay.

592
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,980
- Who picked the notes?
- Me.

593
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,079
(He only shares the information
with Steve, the commander.)

594
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,309
Give us a minute.

595
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,650
I got la and sol cards.

596
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,950
They might have erased it,

597
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,119
but there's grease...

598
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,759
on the back of la and sol cards...

599
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,259
because I had chips beforehand.

600
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,930
- And?
- Just keep that in mind.

601
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,329
La and sol are bad,
so we need to avoid them.

602
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,599
- Right.
- Yes.

603
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,400
Tell them not to pick them
if they see grease.

604
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,000
We decided to make use of this
from Round Three.

605
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,170
We could mark the cards
in the way only we can notice...

606
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,410
and pick the notes that we want.

607
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,609
Pani Bottle, you've been assigned
to la and re sharp.

608
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,650
Eon Kyu, you've been assigned
to mi and la sharp.

609
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,250
Do and mi.

610
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:41,920
Steve, you've been assigned
to sol and sol sharp.

611
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,089
Why did you already pick them?

612
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,589
I'll tell you why.

613
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,329
I went in to see if he marked the cards.

614
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,960
There was a fingerprint on this one.

615
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,130
They picked the cards first, right?

616
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,000
They must be trying
to mark the cards by themselves.

617
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,839
- Jin Ho went in first.
- Right.

618
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,339
I realized that
Jin Ho was pulling a strategy...

619
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:03,710
from Round One.

620
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:05,240
That was good news to me.

621
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,109
We decided to counterattack.

622
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,880
So, I told them that I'd pick
one of the marked ones...

623
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,589
and wait until I found...

624
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,220
and markings
that no other team could find.

625
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,990
That's when I went in.

626
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,000
(Sol)

627
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,799
I picked the one with the fingerprint.

628
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:36,509
Idiots.

629
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:39,809
You call this a strategy?

630
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,549
I was thinking about what to pick.

631
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,980
Then, I found a scratch...

632
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,490
that wasn't visible to the naked eye...

633
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,930
but was only visible
when the light was at the right angle.

634
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,759
A scratch at the center.

635
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,599
I'll pick...

636
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,099
this one.

637
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,970
I picked that one, and it was re sharp.

638
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,940
Dong Min, you've been assigned
to sol and re sharp.

639
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,609
And it was a sharp note.

640
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,180
The whole universe is helping me out.

641
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,180
The fingerprint is noticeable.

642
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,289
- That one is sol. I picked that one.
- Okay.

643
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,289
Next, I got re sharp. I'll explain.

644
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,819
- There's a light, right?
- Yes.

645
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,289
When you look at it from this angle,

646
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:33,200
there's a card...

647
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,869
with a horizontal line here.

648
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,299
- Okay.
- All right?

649
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,269
There are other cards with the scratch,

650
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,240
but they all have
this sun symbol at the center.

651
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,980
This scratch goes way past that.

652
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,349
That's re sharp. Pick those two.

653
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,710
I'll go.

654
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,990
(Team Remaining's plan is
to pick sol and re sharp.)

655
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,089
I looked at the cards under the light,

656
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,630
and there were differences
that occurred...

657
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,630
when they were printed,

658
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,930
such as lines.

659
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,500
Okay.

660
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:16,069
Seong Beom, you've been assigned
to sol and re sharp.

661
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:20,109
MJ, you've been assigned to sol and fa.

662
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,880
Yurisa, you've been assigned
to mi and sol.

663
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
(Yurisa picks mi and sol.)

664
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,420
Of all the members,

665
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,220
only Seong Beom...

666
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:31,119
got re sharp and sol.

667
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,430
The other ones picked sol, at least.

668
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,829
The fingerprint was...

669
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,559
obviously...

670
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,369
It was there as if someone had signed
a housing contract.

671
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:46,000
Anyone would have guessed
it was a fingerprint.

672
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:50,109
Then, you guys could have worked
a little bit harder.

673
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,839
Just a little bit harder,
and you could see the scratch!

674
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:58,420
They couldn't find that.

675
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,750
They all got different cards.

676
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,720
I'm so frustrated.

677
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:05,220
But they came back and said...

678
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,759
There were two cards with the same line.

679
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,430
- No, the longest one.
- So, I picked one of them.

680
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,759
- I got sol and mi.
- Mi?

681
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,329
But there are many cards...

682
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,099
- Yes.
- with a line.

683
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,230
But...

684
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,539
Then, how do you think
Seong Beom found the right one?

685
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,910
How did he find the right one?

686
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,180
Did you pick your cards?

687
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,940
- I did.
- You did?

688
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,210
- I can't?
- You should have...

689
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,579
- Why did you?
- consulted us first.

690
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,250
But they keep changing.

691
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,250
No, they don't!

692
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,019
And Min A had already gone
and picked the cards without telling me.

693
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,359
Min A, you've been assigned
to re sharp and fa sharp.

694
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,789
Why did you pick them?

695
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,630
Why would you just go and pick them
when you knew nothing?

696
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,769
Gosh, so frustrating.

697
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,470
Xitsuh, you've been assigned
to do and la sharp.

698
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,069
Gina, you've been assigned
to sol and sol sharp.

699
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,410
Chungju-Man, you've been assigned
to la and ti.

700
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,309
Why do they take so long?

701
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,650
There's no reason to take a long time.

702
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,690
I see.

703
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,930
(Round 1 Card Status)

704
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,200
(Dong Min: re sharp and sol,
Seong Beom: re sharp and sol,)

705
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
(MJ: fa and sol, Yurisa: mi and sol,
Acau: sol and la,)

706
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,599
(Min A: re sharp and fa sharp,
Jin Ho: sol and la...)

707
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,170
All players have chosen their notes
for Round One.

708
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,769
The song for Round One will be revealed,
so please gather at the Main Hall.

709
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,140
- What's your plan?
- Did you get your cards?

710
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,769
- I did.
- What?

711
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,079
- My head hurts so much.
- This isn't the time for that.

712
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,750
You don't have time for that.

713
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,019
I'll decide after listening to this.

714
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,950
The song for Round One will be revealed.

715
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:52,059
(Round 1: "Airplane")

716
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:59,900
(Round 1: "Airplane")

717
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,470
The song for Round One is "Airplane."

718
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,710
The notes are do, re, and mi in C major.

719
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:11,279
Round One will now begin.

720
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,079
Should we go to the security camera room
or the cafeteria? Cafeteria.

721
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:16,049
Okay. Now?

722
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,089
Let's move.

723
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,660
- Are we moving?
- Come out, guys.

724
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,089
You can't just sit there...

725
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,829
when I said that we should move!

726
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,430
- You can go by yourself.
- Are we playing individually?

727
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,930
Are we actually playing individually?

728
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,529
What are you guys doing?

729
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,299
- Were we playing together?
- What is this?

730
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:33,799
- Were we playing together?
- Yes, we were.

731
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,240
You should have told us.

732
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:36,670
- Let's go.
- I didn't know we were playing together.

733
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,069
- Chungju-Man.
- They were all sitting still,

734
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,539
so I just did the same.

735
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,150
Tell us if you want to play with us.

736
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,849
I said, "Let's move,"

737
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,980
and no one else moved.

738
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,289
- I just sat there like everyone else.
- That was hilarious.

739
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,259
You need to choose a side now.

740
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:55,059
- You can't betray us after this.
- He went with them.

741
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,859
- We don't want that to happen.
- I'm not betraying you.

742
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,630
Are you joining us?

743
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,730
But I'll be dead if I go, right?

744
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,400
Yes, that's for sure.

745
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,869
I don't care where you go right now.

746
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,440
But if you join them in the middle,

747
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,170
- we won't let it slide.
- That's a sure death.

748
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,779
They kept urging me
to join them on the spot.

749
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,279
Half of it was conciliation,
and the other half was blackmailing.

750
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,819
It's just that we need to have
a meeting right now.

751
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,279
We don't have much time.

752
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,890
- Are you a spy? Is that it?
- No.

753
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,789
Then, have a meeting
by yourselves for five minutes.

754
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,359
No, that's not happening.

755
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,690
- No?
- No.

756
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,789
Five minutes?

757
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,759
You've been thinking for three hours.

758
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,829
- Three hours?
- Yes.

759
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:33,099
You're going to end up like last night.

760
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,730
- Is that what you want?
- No. Fine.

761
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,029
Why do you keep trying
to stay in the middle?

762
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,569
If you maintain that stance,

763
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,269
you won't have a spot among us.

764
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,109
But you don't have a spot there, anyway.

765
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,309
- Why do you want to join them?
- Is that it?

766
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:46,680
Because I've known Hyun Seo.

767
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,039
- Go, then!
- I can trust him more.

768
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,480
What happened when you trusted Kyung Ran?

769
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Oh, right.

770
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,849
Let me clarify this one last time.

771
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,490
If anyone betrays us,
we'll make sure to eliminate them.

772
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,319
It's not that I want to join that team.

773
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,589
I was already pretty much forced
to join the team.

774
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,329
They said,
"You already heard about our plan,"

775
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,730
"so you're a traitor if you don't join us
now, and you'll be executed."

776
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,569
You could say that I was...

777
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:11,130
intimidated.

778
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,240
Gosh.

779
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,440
- I picked the cards last, right?
- Yes.

780
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,279
I found two cards that were marked.

781
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,339
- Seriously?
- Yes.

782
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,980
But we're not allowed to mark them.

783
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,579
They were already marked.
Someone left a nail mark.

784
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,119
- It's not stated in the rules.
- It's not prohibited, though.

785
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,720
All the cards were the same,

786
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,420
but just those two cards had
nail marks on them.

787
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,089
I picked those two on purpose.

788
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:33,789
- Good.
- But...

789
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,430
(Seong Beom picked sol and re sharp.)

790
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,000
(And he left a nail mark
on other cards as a decoy.)

791
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,670
Come over here.

792
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,599
We need to pick them, right?

793
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,240
I left a nail mark
with my thumb on purpose.

794
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,009
But I told you not to do that!

795
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,049
Right?

796
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,509
It looks like they're...

797
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,019
telling each other their marks...

798
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,019
like we did.

799
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,519
Remember?

800
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,819
(Hye Seon is last.)

801
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,829
(She finds the nail mark
left by Seong Beom.)

802
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,339
(Hye Seon chooses la and la sharp.)

803
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,240
All the other cards were clean,

804
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,670
but one of them had a nail mark.

805
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,309
And the other one had two nail marks.

806
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,109
So, I picked those two.

807
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,339
La and la sharp.

808
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,880
Come to think of it,

809
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,180
maybe it was a trick.

810
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,920
- I doubt that.
- But they don't know...

811
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,819
what the other cards are,
so I don't see the point of that.

812
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:40,859
Maybe I chose the same cards
as they did or...

813
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,759
I bet you did.

814
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,690
Because there was no way
they could have taken so long.

815
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,759
Stop talking.

816
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,430
We could mark them.

817
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,829
Unless they say it's prohibited,

818
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,269
you can do everything.

819
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:52,839
Gosh.

820
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,970
I'm dumbfounded.
I didn't know they'd go this far.

821
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,339
To be fair, we used a sledgehammer.

822
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:59,109
That's...

823
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,710
They allow us to mark the cards?

824
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,180
If the dealer stopped you...

825
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,380
when you were marking it,
then it's not allowed.

826
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Otherwise, it's allowed.

827
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,449
But that has happened many times
until now.

828
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,750
The same thing happened
in the previous season.

829
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,090
Then, we could also...

830
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,889
warm a card for a minute...

831
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,059
and pick it.

832
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:17,929
- The next person could go right away...
- That's not bad.

833
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,199
and pick the warm card.

834
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,199
Then, the other players will never know.

835
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,130
That's true.

836
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,139
But it's not always good
to have the same cards.

837
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,199
- There's a risk.
- Yes.

838
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,909
Under the assumption...

839
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,539
that I picked the same cards as them,

840
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,969
we can figure out...

841
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,809
- what their strategy is.
- Yes.

842
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,309
Then, we'll be able to figure that out...

843
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:37,650
- Yes.
- from their points in this round.

844
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,849
I'm just praying.

845
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm praying just like Chungju-Man,

846
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,550
hoping that they have my cards.

847
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,690
That way, my points will go up
without having to do anything.

848
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,329
<i>Up, up</i>

849
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,159
<i>Goes the airplane</i>

850
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,199
<i>Fly high</i>

851
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,670
I'm glad that they both went to Dong Min.

852
00:34:58,469 --> 00:34:59,599
You're right. They both went?

853
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,699
That's good.

854
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,940
Theoretically speaking,

855
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,139
- it's better to split up.
- I'm sure Dong Min will look after them.

856
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,909
Dong Min will have seven members now.

857
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,380
There are only two in the Gray Zone,

858
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,610
so we won't stand out either.

859
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:09,809
Good.

860
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,260
Chungju-Man is actually going to sleep.

861
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,429
Let's get some sleep.

862
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,599
They left fingerprints...

863
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,730
to mark the cards.

864
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,969
So, they picked sol and la.

865
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,239
(They saw
through Jin Ho's fingerprint plan,)

866
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,440
(and Acau figured out
that Jin Ho picked sol and la.)

867
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:45,150
(Dong Min's team's strategy was
to pick re sharp and sol.)

868
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,550
So, here's what we'll do.

869
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,320
- I don't think we should bet on sol.
- No.

870
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,750
No. Fortunately,

871
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,090
re sharp and sol are in one group.

872
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,190
But that means...

873
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,130
we have to spend 15 coins.

874
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,960
- That's true. Fifteen coins.
- Right.

875
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,929
We need 15, but they need even more.

876
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,599
They have sol and la,

877
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,000
so they need to go to F major or G major.

878
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:08,469
For them to get there,

879
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,039
they should either spend five coins...

880
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,840
or 6 to 7 coins.

881
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,610
To confirm their victory,

882
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,949
it's over if they spend 19 coins.

883
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:20,280
But they only have six guys,

884
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,590
so they don't have enough
to spend that much from the start.

885
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,050
And second.

886
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:25,619
It's only one point.

887
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,760
They won't spend 19 coins...

888
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,789
only to get one point.

889
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,460
It's seven coins at best.

890
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,530
Or they'll stop at five coins.

891
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,230
That's why I'm saying
we need to spend 15 coins.

892
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,139
I think we should bet on D sharp major...

893
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,300
and use the other five...

894
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,670
to mute la.

895
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,139
- Because they...
- There's no need to mute la.

896
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,039
- Because...
- Just in case.

897
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,380
If we fail to switch keys...

898
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,010
Well, we need to stop them...

899
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,449
from getting points with sol and la
by changing it to F or G.

900
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:56,420
We've got a lot of sols,
so we don't have to care.

901
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,050
- We need to mute la.
- Right.

902
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,219
- We can mute la.
- Right?

903
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,159
I'll use all my coins in Round One.

904
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,159
Then...

905
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Well...

906
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,329
For us to build trust,

907
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,769
do you think you can bet your coins first?

908
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,110
From that point on,

909
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,110
I thought, "I chose the wrong team."

910
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,050
Their system was...

911
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,320
I get where he was coming from,

912
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,590
but isn't it...

913
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:34,989
such a communist system?

914
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,230
It sounded very dangerous.

915
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:40,800
- I'll do it.
- What?

916
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,829
I'll do it.

917
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,300
No.

918
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:46,269
I think Gina should have the first say...

919
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,269
in going first.

920
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,800
Because she was indecisive.

921
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,340
If you spend all your coins,

922
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,079
you can't betray us.

923
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,780
That will make us feel at ease.

924
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,510
But who knows I won't place last?

925
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,250
- Gosh.
- But if we all...

926
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,889
If you're going to suspect us like that,
just get out now.

927
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:05,289
I don't tell such lies.

928
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:08,820
There's a reputation I've been building.

929
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,630
Would I lie to you in this round...

930
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,829
only to trick you...

931
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,659
and damage my reputation?

932
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,269
- All right, then.
- I would never.

933
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:18,429
And you're not sacrificing your coins.

934
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,469
We're all going to spend them.

935
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,039
- We are.
- Of course, we are.

936
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,170
We're all going to spend them.

937
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,170
I was turning into an actual traitor...

938
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,210
if I had pulled out then.

939
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,309
So, I had no other choice.

940
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,210
I didn't like the concept itself,

941
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,820
but I had to spend it, anyway,

942
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,489
so I just decided...

943
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:37,489
to go and do it.

944
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,789
Gina, will you place a bet?

945
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:41,820
Yes.

946
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,659
I will bet 15 coins.

947
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,329
(Betting 15 coins to move the key
from C to D sharp)

948
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,469
I'll bet five coins on muting la.

949
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,070
(Betting 5 coins to mute la)

950
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,170
What did you do?

951
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,070
- As you told me to.
- Did you?

952
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:58,010
Min A, will you place a bet?

953
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,010
I will not place a bet.

954
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,409
I will not place a bet.

955
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,050
I will not place a bet.

956
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,710
I will not place a bet.

957
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,780
- Yurisa, will you place a bet?
- No.

958
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,519
Dong Min, will you place a bet?

959
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,619
Yes, all of these.

960
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:13,059
Please keep them safe.

961
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,289
Will you not place a bet?

962
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
No.

963
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:17,460
(Steve and Hyun Seo have a meeting
away from the teammates.)

964
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,130
We have two options here...

965
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,159
as there's been a variable.

966
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,130
Our team's strategy was...

967
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,739
not knowing each other's choices.

968
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,840
I worked as the control tower...

969
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,510
to make the best decisions.

970
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,309
And Hyun Seo was there to communicate...

971
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:35,210
and stop me
from making arbitrary decisions.

972
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,079
We completely stopped...

973
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,320
any information from leaking.

974
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,980
Our system was to enable us to make...

975
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,150
the most efficient decision.

976
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:45,250
I'm thinking of mute la sharp.

977
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,429
But there's no guarantee
that they have the marked notes.

978
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,559
About the marked ones, Seong Beom...

979
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,199
told MJ and Yurisa that...

980
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,570
(Seong Beom left a fake nail mark.)

981
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,369
(Jin Ho's team was tricked.)

982
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,409
So, I picked those two on purpose.

983
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,670
La and la sharp.

984
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,110
I think they marked them.

985
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,010
And they're likely to be these two.

986
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,820
You're assuming that they all picked...

987
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,480
the marked cards, right?

988
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,320
Yes. After they've been marked,

989
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,420
they must have chosen them.

990
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:22,320
If they're in the right mind,
they'll bet all their coins...

991
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,489
to earn points with la sharp.

992
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,960
F sharp, G sharp, and A sharp.

993
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,030
Where is it? This one.

994
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,329
They'll vote for one of these three keys.

995
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,269
Then,
the ideal choice is to mute la sharp...

996
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,639
and move up the key to G sharp.

997
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,070
So, we'll...

998
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,280
bet eight coins to change keys.

999
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,280
Then, we spend 12 coins to mute this note.

1000
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,320
That's the one.

1001
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,019
That looks like the optimal plan.

1002
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,119
Take a look, guys.

1003
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,360
We can't rule out the possibility
that it was fake.

1004
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Which one?

1005
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,590
- The marking.
- The nail mark.

1006
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,829
If you're not sure,
don't mind that at all...

1007
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,099
No, we have to mute it.

1008
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,829
We should simply think...

1009
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:04,829
(Steve insists on muting la sharp.)

1010
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,469
that they all went with the same notes.

1011
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,070
Even if we're wrong,

1012
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,639
it's not such a huge loss for us.

1013
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,539
- But when we mute them,
- Because...

1014
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:15,139
we can't do it from Round One.

1015
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,179
Say they all picked the same cards.

1016
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:19,219
Then, we'll see their total scores
after Round One.

1017
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,019
If all their scores evenly increased,

1018
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,190
we can decide
that they went with the same cards.

1019
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,590
But the cards
that we picked aren't consistent.

1020
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:27,019
I'll tell you that.

1021
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,889
They're all different.

1022
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,730
So...

1023
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,989
- We're doomed.
- Yes.

1024
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,960
How did you manage to pick these?

1025
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,500
- Gosh.
- We're finished.

1026
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,829
- Anyway...
- We picked the wrong ones.

1027
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,699
Our priority should be stopping them
under that assumption.

1028
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,769
Even if they randomly pick one,

1029
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,570
we'll get someone, at least.

1030
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,179
There's that, so...

1031
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,039
I think...

1032
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,280
Since our worst-case scenario is
all of them earning points...

1033
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,719
- from the same cards...
- Yes.

1034
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,250
Our priority should be stopping that
from happening.

1035
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,250
And we'll use the coins, anyway.

1036
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,420
That's the best possible option,

1037
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,820
so even if it's a trick,
it's only one round.

1038
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,019
Hye Seon is going to place the bet.

1039
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,590
- Okay.
- You're going to do it.

1040
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,659
Mute la sharp with 12 coins...

1041
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,599
- and move up the key by eight.
- Okay.

1042
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,170
I'll bet 12 coins to mute la sharp.

1043
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,099
And I'll move up the key...

1044
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,070
by spending eight coins.

1045
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,769
Steve, will you place a bet?

1046
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,409
I'll do nothing.

1047
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,710
Goodbye.

1048
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:25,079
(No one but Hye Seon
from Jin Ho's team placed a bet.)

1049
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:26,820
Goodbye.

1050
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,820
- Thank you.
- This is...

1051
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
- Are you done?
- zero.

1052
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,190
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1053
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,619
They must be thinking...

1054
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,489
of moving up the key by another lap...

1055
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:35,760
at a critical moment, right?

1056
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:36,929
- Another lap?
- Yes.

1057
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:37,960
What do you mean?

1058
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,860
It goes all the way up with 12 coins.

1059
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,300
- Yes.
- They could spend twice...

1060
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,360
- Of course, they will.
- Then, the coins...

1061
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,869
Dong Min is closer to a leader who leads.

1062
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,739
And there isn't much I can do
in that situation.

1063
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,010
No.

1064
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,510
And he can be pretty opinionated,

1065
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,679
so I was frustrated
with not being able to do anything.

1066
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,420
If they...

1067
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,219
didn't spend any, we can just...

1068
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:09,690
(Yurisa sneaks out.)

1069
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,389
Chungju-Man turned into a politician.

1070
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,000
He's already in politics.

1071
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,800
But he's not the type to be political.

1072
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,030
Am I being tricked again?

1073
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,539
You want me to tell you
when I get ti sharp?

1074
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,139
- Ti sharp?
- Mi sharp and ti sharp.

1075
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:24,309
Okay.

1076
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:25,980
Please get ti sharp.

1077
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:27,980
We still have one spot open.

1078
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,480
- We have 1 more spot left.
- We have 1 spot open.

1079
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,050
- Where? What do you mean?
- Right here.

1080
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,820
- We can recruit one more player.
- Really? Count me in.

1081
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,219
We have a spot open.

1082
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,380
- Count me in.
- Think wisely.

1083
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,389
When should I come back?

1084
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,820
You can't make it obvious right now.

1085
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,559
- You have to bring intel.
- Really? Okay.

1086
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,230
I thought it would be more fun
to join a team...

1087
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,159
where the atmosphere was more easygoing.

1088
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,730
We won't be eliminated
for not entering at all. Will we?

1089
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,070
If we don't enter,
we can't get any points.

1090
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,300
- We still have to enter.
- My gosh.

1091
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Let's go then.

1092
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,280
That hurts. My gosh.

1093
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,079
Chungju-Man. Will you place a bet?

1094
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,750
No. I will not.

1095
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,550
I will not bet...

1096
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:08,349
my 20 coins.

1097
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,619
Round One is over.

1098
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,019
I will play the song for Round One.

1099
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,760
I'm doomed.

1100
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,400
I have no idea.

1101
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,239
I think I hear a sol sharp.

1102
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:29,440
No. I think the starting note was sol.

1103
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:30,539
Isn't that in the key of E?

1104
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:31,909
The song, "Airplane,"

1105
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:34,909
was transposed to the key of D sharp.

1106
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,809
(Players with a re sharp, fa sharp,
and sol cards will earn a point.)

1107
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,349
La sharp was muted.

1108
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:40,349
What?

1109
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,989
(Seong Beom left fake marks
on la and la sharp.)

1110
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,320
(Hong Jin Ho's alliance wasted coins
on incorrect intelligence.)

1111
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,429
Players
with a re sharp, fa, and sol cards...

1112
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:52,800
will earn a point.

1113
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,500
Jang Dong Min and Heo Seong Beom
are in first place.

1114
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,099
Joo Eon Kyu, Lim Hyun Seo,
Choi Hye Seon, Xitsuh,

1115
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:03,969
and Chungju-Man are in last place.

1116
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,039
Round Two will now begin.

1117
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,380
The song for Round Two will be revealed.

1118
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:19,420
(Round 2: "Butterfly")

1119
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:27,360
(Round 2: "Butterfly")

1120
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,400
The song for Round Two is "Butterfly."

1121
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,230
It is in the key of C.

1122
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,070
Do, re, mi, fa, sol are the default notes.

1123
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,710
- There are 5 notes.
- There are 5 notes.

1124
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,079
Round Two will now begin.

1125
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:49,219
(Chungju-Man received
0 points for Round 1.)

1126
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,130
- Who got three points?
- Anyway...

1127
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,329
Dong Min and Seong Beom got three points.

1128
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,099
- All of them won points.
- Yes.

1129
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,699
The players with zero points are
Hyun Seo, you, me...

1130
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:09,139
- But...
- Hold on.

1131
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,969
Everyone on Dong Min's team
got at least a point.

1132
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,110
(Everyone on Jang Dong Min's alliance
got a point or more.)

1133
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,280
(I see.)

1134
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,139
I guess their notes overlapped.

1135
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,510
Who knows? They could have marked it
with their nails.

1136
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,650
I see.

1137
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,920
I'll go out for a smoke.

1138
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,750
You know what? Obviously,

1139
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,960
- Did they fake it?
- four of them drew a re sharp.

1140
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:31,730
They must have bet a lot of coins.

1141
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,599
Did we mute la sharp?

1142
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,599
Yes.

1143
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,570
So by that logic,
they bet more than three coins?

1144
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,000
They made a full circle?
They used 15 coins?

1145
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:44,539
I can't tell. I don't know how many coins
we used. So I can't make a guess.

1146
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:46,739
But here's what we know for sure.

1147
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,750
Dong Min, Seong Beom, MJ, and Min A...

1148
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,780
all had a re sharp.

1149
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,690
For the two points,
they could have had a fa or a sol.

1150
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,820
It's iffy to think that
MJ and Min A had a fa or a sol.

1151
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,889
- Well, that's possible.
- Yes.

1152
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,659
Round One was over.

1153
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,300
Ironically,
Dong Min's team got a lot of points.

1154
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,659
Their points ranged from 1 to 3.

1155
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,170
I realized that they marked the cards too.

1156
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,070
Is it possible to mark
the cards with fingernails?

1157
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,739
Isn't that a violation of rules?

1158
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,199
Does it not matter here?

1159
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
It doesn't.

1160
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:19,780
This could be the danger
of being in the gray area...

1161
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,110
if picking the same cards was possible.

1162
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,179
How could they pick the same cards?

1163
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,519
Well, there are many ways.

1164
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:28,719
Actually, that's why I looked at the cards
closely for fingernail marks.

1165
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,889
- Yes.
- I can mark them with our fingernails.

1166
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:34,019
- I see.
- Or we can mark the corners.

1167
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,519
- Anyway, we can mark the cards.
- Yes.

1168
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,559
- We can bend it just slightly.
- Yes.

1169
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,659
Our strategy to be neutral...

1170
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:43,329
only works
if the cards are chosen randomly.

1171
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:45,900
If we can choose the same cards...

1172
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,000
by marking the cards
or somehow leaving a trace...

1173
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,369
on the cards,

1174
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,769
then taking the neutral stance...

1175
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,409
will put us on the bottom.
So it's a disadvantage.

1176
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,750
This game won't go in our favor
if we don't do anything.

1177
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,880
That's the tough truth.

1178
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,989
This is awful.

1179
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:06,460
You know what? Here's what I think.

1180
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,289
Only by judging by our current situation,

1181
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,000
even if we're working together
or you don't choose to join a team,

1182
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,460
I'll keep my distance from you.

1183
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,159
So we'll show them
we're playing separately.

1184
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,530
If you were to come across an opportunity,

1185
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,639
go with it.

1186
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,440
If we both end up on the bottom,
that'd be the worst.

1187
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,869
- Do you understand?
- Both of us might end up on the bottom?

1188
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:25,440
Right. That'd be the worst.

1189
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,480
I'll have to see after Round Two.

1190
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,679
Right. That's our best strategy.

1191
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,679
Let's go with that for now.

1192
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,949
With the strategy to escape the bottom.

1193
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,150
But I'm curious
as to how they chose the same cards.

1194
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,489
- The marks...
- There's only one way.

1195
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,019
- They probably went in one at a time.
- How?

1196
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,860
They would keep going
until one of them drew a black key.

1197
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,360
- Whoever drew the black key...
- Yes.

1198
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,929
must have marked it
before leaving the room.

1199
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,829
Then the rest of them went in...

1200
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:51,199
- and chose the same card from the mark...
- That's not it.

1201
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,570
shared by the person who drew it.

1202
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,440
Then did I spot a fake mark?

1203
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,699
Right.

1204
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,969
I didn't see any other marks
on the rest of the cards.

1205
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,480
- It's likely that it was a fake mark.
- Yes.

1206
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,510
It didn't matter.

1207
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,750
How did they mark the cards?
I only spotted the fingernail mark.

1208
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,719
They could've wiped it.

1209
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,219
- I'm asking because I'm really curious.
- Yes?

1210
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:16,389
Is it allowed to leave a mark
on the cards?

1211
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:17,960
- Yes.
- I said this several times now.

1212
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,289
Seeing how the other team is playing,
it's probably allowed, right?

1213
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,329
As long as you're not stopped,

1214
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:21,360
- it's okay.
- Right.

1215
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,130
- I'm certain that's what they did.
- They drew the same cards.

1216
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,900
I completely excluded that possibility.

1217
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,469
- I see. It's not fair.
- Naturally, I thought...

1218
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:29,710
That's the thing here.
You can't be quick to dismiss anything.

1219
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,010
- Then...
- Otherwise, it's not possible for them...

1220
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,940
being in the gray area became risky.

1221
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,809
No area can be demilitarized forever.

1222
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,019
It's really difficult...

1223
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,119
- to draw sharp notes.
- right.

1224
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,190
I don't think they know
the secret behind the cards.

1225
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,489
This is what's going down
in the next round.

1226
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,730
The five of us will line up.

1227
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:53,800
- All of us must draw a re sharp.
- Yes.

1228
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
You get it, right?

1229
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,070
But this strategy will only work
until the next round.

1230
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,170
After the next round, they'll figure out
that something was up with the cards.

1231
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,699
- About the re sharp?
- Yes.

1232
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,010
So they will draw it too.

1233
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,380
That's why we must gather as many points
as possible until the next round.

1234
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:10,409
All right. Let's decide what to go with.

1235
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,750
Here's the thing.
Since we got three points,

1236
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,920
they already know
you and I had a re sharp.

1237
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,489
Then they might consider muting
a re sharp.

1238
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:22,960
They will probably mute a re sharp.

1239
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,590
They will probably assume
we'll go all-in here.

1240
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,530
Then they will use a lot of coins.

1241
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,199
They will probably want
to spend 20 coins to mute it.

1242
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,800
We should let them waste their coins.

1243
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,170
For this round,

1244
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,809
we must go with the key
that yields the most points for us.

1245
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,940
Let's look for the key
where our notes overlap the most.

1246
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,949
- The key of D sharp.
- D sharp?

1247
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,719
We can just bet three coins
to transpose the song to D sharp.

1248
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,349
We just have to bet three coins.
We don't need to mute any notes.

1249
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,559
If this defense strategy
with three coins works out,

1250
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:56,789
it would be the best-case scenario.

1251
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,130
Then there will come a moment
when we can bet 17 coins at once.

1252
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,929
We can still bet 17 coins...

1253
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,539
even after betting three coins
before that.

1254
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:10,239
- Then we won't need Xitsuh anymore.
- Right.

1255
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,440
- I'll use my coins.
- You got two points, right?

1256
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,980
- Three?
- Yes. I'll go and place the bet.

1257
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,340
- Go on.
- I'll go and do it.

1258
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,710
(Their strategy meeting finishes quickly.)

1259
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,719
I'll bet three coins.

1260
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,179
(D sharp:
re sharp, fa, sol, sol sharp, la)

1261
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,320
(3 coins to transpose
the key of C to D sharp)

1262
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:28,989
This is giving me a headache.
Dong Min's team is moving really fast.

1263
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,360
Is it because they discussed a lot?

1264
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,769
Anyway, they're checking everyone's cards,
so they can use the information.

1265
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,900
We wanted to do that,
so one of us could make decisions quickly.

1266
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,469
We figured out the secret,
but we didn't think to make use of that.

1267
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,679
The basis of our strategy is
having a control tower.

1268
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:01,320
You have 10 minutes left
until the end of Round 2.

1269
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,059
Are you guys ready?
If you are, let's talk about this.

1270
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,059
If they try to score with re sharp,

1271
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:08,400
we can choose one of these
that goes well with our cards.

1272
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,670
But they probably know
we'll try to mute re sharp.

1273
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,679
If you've made up your mind,
share it with us.

1274
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,619
Should I just go and do it?

1275
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,219
I'll place the bet.

1276
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:32,889
Could you share it with us too?

1277
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:34,960
- Tell us how you will bet.
- Tell us after you make a bet.

1278
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,730
- What?
- Tell us how you will bet.

1279
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:38,730
- What? Why? That's...
- Let's do that.

1280
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,760
- Tell us after the round is over.
- I'll tell you everything...

1281
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,199
- for Rounds 1 and 2 once it's over.
- Okay.

1282
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,900
No. Tell us now. The moment you go in,

1283
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,969
it doesn't matter if we know or not.

1284
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,469
No, the other team could find out.

1285
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,570
- There is still that possibility.
- Gosh, we'll be together. Come on.

1286
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:52,170
We have ten minutes left.

1287
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,480
After you go down,
we'll talk and then go down right away.

1288
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,510
Why would you keep it from us?

1289
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,579
You can go. We'll hear it from him.

1290
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,559
They drew the same cards.

1291
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,070
I couldn't tell the difference.
The colors and the patterns...

1292
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,570
They were all just paper cards.

1293
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,570
They probably made marks on the cards.

1294
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:23,039
Drawing cards...

1295
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,340
They used a trick to draw the same cards.

1296
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,179
If that becomes possible, the rules...

1297
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,019
So they marked the cards.

1298
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,519
They were smart about it.

1299
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,090
There's nothing we can say about that.

1300
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,420
They were just smart about it.

1301
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,559
It's not like we didn't know about it.

1302
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:45,329
But still.
We should draw the cards randomly.

1303
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,900
We had the same amount of time,
but couldn't do it.

1304
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,099
So they played it better.

1305
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,769
This is a fraud.

1306
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:59,539
That's just flat-out card fraud. Darn it.

1307
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:01,980
We have to cut off their wrists
with the sledgehammer.

1308
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,809
We ought to cut off their wrists.

1309
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:17,530
(Humming)

1310
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
I'll do it after that.

1311
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
(6 minutes before Round 2 ends)

1312
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,110
If our strategy for this round works,
we have it in the bag.

1313
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,010
They cannot beat us
no matter what they try.

1314
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:34,110
You cannot mess it up.

1315
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,110
When you go inside,

1316
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,480
some of the cards are crumpled like this.

1317
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,949
So there's a symbol in the middle.

1318
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:44,050
There's a small symbol in the middle.

1319
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,050
On top of that,

1320
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:51,059
- there's a line like this.
- Yes.

1321
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:53,360
But you can't see it right away.

1322
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,300
But if you look at it in different angles,
the light will reflect it.

1323
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,400
- See?
- Yes.

1324
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,429
- I can see it.
- There's a card with a line here.

1325
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,900
If we fail to draw this card,

1326
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,239
our strategy will fail.

1327
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,639
What about the other card?

1328
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,440
I have to pick the second one randomly.

1329
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:09,039
But will you mark that too?

1330
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,210
Yes. I will.

1331
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,449
I'll put crumbs on my fingers
before I go in.

1332
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:14,550
I'll put the oil right in the middle.

1333
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,320
- Can't you do that for both cards?
- What?

1334
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,590
Can't you do that for both cards?

1335
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,190
- All right. Then once I go inside,
- At the end...

1336
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,829
I'll mark both of them if it's hard...

1337
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,530
to pick them out.

1338
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,960
And I'll go in last.
I'll mark all the cards the same way.

1339
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,300
Then on two cards...

1340
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,599
Here's the thing.
We shouldn't try to mark the other cards.

1341
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,769
- Get rid of the marks?
- We must get rid of the marks.

1342
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:35,539
If you do that,
they will figure it out too.

1343
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:36,869
Wet some tissue...

1344
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,769
and put it in your pocket.

1345
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,809
We have to line up
as soon as the time is up.

1346
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,179
Where are they?

1347
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,650
Get them here now.

1348
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,349
Hurry up.

1349
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,550
Hurry. Where is everyone? Darn it.
We don't have much time left.

1350
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,789
Hey, bring a bag of chips.

1351
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:54,619
They formed a team.

1352
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,789
Hurry up. Where are the others?

1353
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,489
Once Round Two ends,
they will announce the scores.

1354
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,929
Then we have to go
and draw the cards right away.

1355
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,829
Once they see us line up,

1356
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:05,800
they will realize that
there's a secret behind the cards.

1357
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,369
So we can't let that happen.

1358
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,739
- "We should have a strategy meeting."
- "Let's draw the cards now..."

1359
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:10,809
"and strategize."

1360
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:11,869
Once I head out, I'll say,

1361
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,710
"Draw the cards quickly
and gather around."

1362
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,309
That's when you line up.

1363
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:18,780
I'll go inside and use my fingerprints
to put oil on the cards.

1364
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,179
- Then draw those two cards.
- Okay.

1365
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,150
- I'll wipe everything else.
- Yes.

1366
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,489
So just draw those two cards.

1367
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:25,489
- You'll go in last.
- Me.

1368
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,590
- Wipe down the cards.
- Okay.

1369
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:30,760
- Wet the corner of your shirt here.
- Okay.

1370
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,530
Wipe it with the wet corner
and then with the dry corner.

1371
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:34,199
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

1372
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,769
For Round Three, we can draw...

1373
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,699
the cards anew.

1374
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,840
I was very excited.

1375
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,909
It was a chance...

1376
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:46,670
for all of us to draw two sharp cards.

1377
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,579
I'll put my oily thumbprint on a re sharp.

1378
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:52,550
Then I'll draw a random card.

1379
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,679
If I draw another sharp card,
the universe must be on my side.

1380
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,289
If we get a white key,

1381
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,989
we can at least earn three points.

1382
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
That would still be good.

1383
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,760
Round Two is over.

1384
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,789
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1385
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:09,429
I will play the song for Round Two.

1386
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:28,449
The song, "Butterfly,"

1387
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,320
was transposed to the key of F.

1388
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,760
Re sharp was muted.

1389
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,929
Let's look for the key
where our notes overlap the most.

1390
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,099
(Jang Dong Min's alliance
tried to transpose it to D sharp.)

1391
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,500
They will probably mute a re sharp.

1392
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,000
They will probably want
to spend 20 coins to mute it.

1393
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,139
(They expected Hong Jin Ho's alliance
to go all-in on muting a re sharp.)

1394
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:53,170
(They bet only 3 coins
on transposing the song.)

1395
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:56,510
They can probably guess that
we'll mute a re sharp.

1396
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,510
My gut tells me...

1397
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:58,980
"They will use a lot of coins..."

1398
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,750
"even if we don't spend our coins."
I bet that's what they're thinking.

1399
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,750
They won't use a lot of coins this round.

1400
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,750
- Right? I don't think they will.
- Yes.

1401
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,820
I will 17 coins to transpose the song.

1402
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,530
I'll mute a re sharp.

1403
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,260
(3 coins to mute a re sharp)

1404
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,429
Players with fa, sol, la, la sharp,

1405
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:18,030
and do cards...

1406
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,199
will earn a point.

1407
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,840
(Round 2, "Butterfly" in F,
fa, sol, la, la sharp, do)

1408
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:26,110
Jang Dong Min, MJ Kim,
and Heo Seong Beom have four points.

1409
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:31,510
Hong Jin Ho, Pani Bottle,
and Choi Hye Seon have three points.

1410
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:35,519
Before we begin Round Three,
players are asked...

1411
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:37,250
to enter the voting room one at a time...

1412
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,690
and choose two notes.

1413
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,730
They figured it out.

1414
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,599
Where did it go? Can I get some snacks?

1415
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:50,570
- I see.
- Gosh, whatever. I'm hungry.

1416
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,030
Hey, let's get this over with
and have a meeting.

1417
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,699
Goodness, I'm drained.

1418
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:58,969
What did they do?

1419
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,579
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1420
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:07,320
Hey, come on out. Let's hurry.

1421
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,650
Okay.

1422
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:14,789
(Running)

1423
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,630
- I'm sorry. You can't cut the line.
- No cutting.

1424
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:22,929
- No cutting.
- What do you mean?

1425
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:24,800
- You can't skip the line.
- I came here first.

1426
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,300
- We lined up.
- Let me go in first then.

1427
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,369
- You go first then.
- Go ahead.

1428
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:28,940
- Go on.
- You go in first then.

1429
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,610
- I just hate him.
- Right.

1430
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,050
- He's trying to be sly.
- I hate his guts.

1431
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,119
Chungju-Man, choose two cards.

1432
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:52,989
Chungju-Man.
You drew a la sharp and sol sharp.

1433
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,030
- Please wait.
- Okay.

1434
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,940
- They choose the cards they want.
- Right.

1435
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:36,639
Did you draw cards?

1436
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,739
I did. I was the first one.

1437
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:39,769
You were the first one?

1438
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:40,940
- When I lined up in the middle,
- Yes.

1439
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,579
they told me to get lost.
So I said I would go first.

1440
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:44,679
- I crumpled everything.
- You crumpled what?

1441
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:45,750
I crumpled all the cards.

1442
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,820
Go inside.

1443
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,599
Darn it. That jerk.

1444
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,530
Come on.

1445
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,039
That jerk.

1446
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:11,670
He's a lunatic.

1447
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,909
He has no idea what I'm capable of.

1448
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,480
You crumpled them hard on purpose, right?

1449
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,889
- They became a dot.
- What?

1450
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,889
They became a dot.

1451
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,559
Gosh, there's no middle ground with you.
Yes, sir.

1452
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,230
My gosh. That guy is a complete lunatic.

1453
01:01:43,269 --> 01:01:44,969
Darn it. Come on.

1454
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,679
Darn it.
I cannot stand crazy jerks like him.

1455
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:49,510
Gosh, I have no choice.
I need to get rid of him.

1456
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,820
We have to eliminate these people...

1457
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,650
with a nasty temper.

1458
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:00,489
How is this staying neutral?

1459
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,289
Gosh, that crazy jerk. Darn it.

1460
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,929
You're done for.

1461
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,230
How dare he...

1462
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:07,900
How dare he ruin my plan?

1463
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:11,699
(Dong Min was supposed
to pick a re sharp card.)

1464
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:15,940
You're done for. Darn it.

1465
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,050
You're done for. Darn it.

1466
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:33,619
There it is.

1467
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,559
I found it. Gosh.

1468
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,000
I found it. Darn it.

1469
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,300
I found it. You jerk.

1470
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,670
You can try all you want to ruin my plan.
But I'll find my card, you jerk.

1471
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,539
That fool. You messed with the wrong guy.

1472
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,150
You could have just kept it low-key.

1473
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,380
I would have shown mercy, you jerk.

1474
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,420
That fool. Darn it. Anyway...

1475
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:11,530
I have no choice.

1476
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,360
I don't want to make it look obvious.

1477
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,369
(Fidgeting)

1478
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:22,239
I have no choice. I must go with this.

1479
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,210
I chose this. Okay.

1480
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,010
(Jang Dong Min drew
sol sharp and re sharp cards.)

1481
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,980
You're done for. You jerk.

1482
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,980
You picked the wrong guy to mess with.

1483
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:36,619
All done?

1484
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:37,789
Don't change the deck.

1485
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,489
Okay.

1486
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:44,760
Darn it.

1487
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,500
My gosh, darn him.

1488
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,769
He doesn't know who I am. Okay.

1489
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:01,079
Chungju-Man crumpled up all the cards.

1490
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,210
But I found a re sharp card.

1491
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,179
And I found a sol sharp card.

1492
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:10,920
Here's what I did. Listen up.

1493
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,420
For the re sharp card,
this corner is torn.

1494
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,289
The tear is visible.

1495
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,989
For the sol sharp card, I ripped it here.

1496
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,730
It's horizontal.

1497
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,130
Look for a card
with a long horizontal tear...

1498
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,500
and a card where a corner is torn
in a circular shape.

1499
01:04:24,769 --> 01:04:25,929
- Okay.
- Pick those two cards.

1500
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,670
Then who's the last one to go in?

1501
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:30,039
- Me.
- Rip all the cards like this.

1502
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,539
Rip all 12 cards the same way.

1503
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:32,539
Okay.

1504
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,980
Kim Min A. Draw two cards.

1505
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,630
He said it was torn a lot,
but it's a minor tear.

1506
01:04:57,429 --> 01:05:00,130
He went in first
and crumpled all the cards.

1507
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,639
I turned them into a dot.

1508
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:04,440
- You crumpled the cards?
- I didn't like the rules.

1509
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,840
- He crumpled all the cards.
- Are you serious?

1510
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,579
- Really?
- I turned them into a dot.

1511
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:09,579
She didn't stop you?

1512
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,750
If they change the deck,

1513
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,750
it would be against the rules then.

1514
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,050
- All the cards?
- Yes.

1515
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:15,820
Are you being serious?

1516
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,719
- I'm being serious.
- He was the first one to go in.

1517
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:18,920
- I crumpled all of them.
- Here's what we have to check now.

1518
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,349
Whether they switch the cards or not.

1519
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,219
- But that is...
- If it gets damaged...

1520
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:24,960
I'm sure they'll put it back
if the game can't go on.

1521
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:27,599
No, they should just flatten it
and put it as is.

1522
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,829
- But I don't know about that.
- So...

1523
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:30,929
- they should...
- From my perspective,

1524
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:32,070
you guys are being totally unreasonable.

1525
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,940
Depending on how damaged it is,
they could just flatten it...

1526
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,239
- or switch it out for a new one.
- Right, we're curious.

1527
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,969
- It was with the intention of checking.
- And if they switch it for a new one,

1528
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,309
it's not that unreasonable.

1529
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:43,440
Sure.

1530
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,050
For example, if the level of damage is...

1531
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,780
If folding it once is considered okay,
and they won't change it, then...

1532
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,989
- It's weird.
- Two people could choose...

1533
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,050
- the ones folded horizontally,
- That's why this makes no sense.

1534
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,050
- the ones folded vertically,
- There's no standard.

1535
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,719
- and the ones folded diagonally.
- It's distinguishable.

1536
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,519
- So, from the beginning...
- They won't be switched out.

1537
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:04,929
From the beginning, that stuff is...
Back when I was on "The Genius,"

1538
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:06,769
I spotted the open and pass from the back.

1539
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,900
The moment others complain that
it's cheating, it would seem ridiculous.

1540
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:12,440
- So...
- But back then, it was the design itself.

1541
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,440
But in the end, whatever it is...

1542
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,340
You can nitpick about anything
if you want.

1543
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,510
This isn't a sport.

1544
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:20,449
This game is unreasonable
and unfair from the beginning.

1545
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:28,360
You can't compete with normal methods,

1546
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,190
so you're just using whatever excuse.
Darn it.

1547
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,760
This is infuriating.

1548
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,500
Darn it. This makes no sense.

1549
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:41,840
We were totally prepared with a plan...

1550
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,809
and thinking about how to keep
our information safe from spies.

1551
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,469
I can't believe this.

1552
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,179
What is this, origami?

1553
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,719
(Sighing)

1554
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,559
A survival game is...

1555
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,260
a game that someone wins
by being sensible...

1556
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,460
while others win by finding loopholes
in the rules.

1557
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,559
I think that's what the overall genre
of a survival game is supposed to be,

1558
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,469
where those things are allowed.

1559
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,829
So, I was really angry about that.

1560
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,400
"Because of you, because of the situation,
because of this and that..."

1561
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,369
So, they say they can't do this.

1562
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,409
Actually, I really...

1563
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:23,610
don't think highly of that behavior.

1564
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,309
Gosh, darn it.

1565
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:31,090
Sure. This is fun.

1566
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,289
What did you do, punk?

1567
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:37,119
What kind of nonsense did you pull?

1568
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:38,289
- This is...
- It was you, wasn't it?

1569
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,989
- Go complain to Chungju-Man.
- What?

1570
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,260
Go complain to Chungju-Man.

1571
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:44,130
- No, I'm going to kill him anyway.
- Did you decide on your own?

1572
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,570
Or was it a team decision?

1573
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,230
- No.
- Chungju-Man is in Gray Zone.

1574
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,599
I don't even care.
I'm just going to kill him.

1575
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,010
I don't care about anything.
I'll just kill him.

1576
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,510
He picked a fight with the wrong guy.

1577
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,909
But damaging the cards is
actually a very crucial thing for me.

1578
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:00,380
My strategy doesn't make sense, then.

1579
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:01,949
What strategy?

1580
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:04,150
From a random,
neutral state's perspective...

1581
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:05,449
Actually, this is a very good strategy...

1582
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:06,690
if you think about probability.

1583
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,119
If you damage the cards
and start choosing the same ones,

1584
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,760
- It wouldn't be random.
- it won't make sense.

1585
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,460
- Then, I should be a troll.
- Right.

1586
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,260
You're right.

1587
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:21,270
(Jang Dong Min chose re sharp
and sol sharp earlier.)

1588
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,439
I will choose.

1589
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,770
(Sol sharp, re sharp)

1590
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,510
(Kim Min A chose re sharp and sol sharp.)

1591
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,180
(Heo Seong Beom chose re sharp
and sol sharp.)

1592
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,550
(Lee Gina chose re sharp and sol sharp.)

1593
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:38,949
(Yurisa chose re sharp and sol sharp.)

1594
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:42,619
(MJ Kim chose re sharp and sol sharp.)

1595
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,630
(Ripping)

1596
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,640
(Mission complete)

1597
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,739
(Acau chose re sharp and sol sharp.)

1598
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,739
(Round 3 Jang Dong Min Alliance
Card Distribution)

1599
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,880
(Re sharp, sol sharp)

1600
01:09:05,949 --> 01:09:08,649
Look, this round is a critical one.

1601
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,989
The other team has no choice...

1602
01:09:10,989 --> 01:09:14,560
but to choose the same ones now.

1603
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,489
But thankfully, we chose two sharps.

1604
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:21,359
In Round 3, we will take 4 points each,
no matter what.

1605
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:25,699
But in Round 4, 1 will get thrown out.

1606
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,199
Still, we have six points.

1607
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,069
Do you get what I mean?

1608
01:09:30,369 --> 01:09:34,010
Now, they can't overcome
the score difference with us.

1609
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,909
Chungju-Man is likely to be in last place.

1610
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,680
And so is Hyun Seo.

1611
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,550
Depending on which side Xitsuh takes,

1612
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,390
he could survive.

1613
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:51,430
Because now, Chungju-Man and Hyun Seo
have a point each.

1614
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:56,300
(The lowest ranks as of now,
Hyun Seo and Chungju-Man)

1615
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,029
Anyway, that's the result.

1616
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:02,369
Steve, what should we...

1617
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:06,739
Other than two of us,
we don't know the distribution.

1618
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,510
- You have to decide that soon.
- How many to divide it into?

1619
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:15,350
The person who goes in right after
that team draws their cards...

1620
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,319
should be one
with good observational skills.

1621
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,119
That person should go in
and write down what they can.

1622
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,989
Then, draw a card, leave a mark,
and the rest go in after. Isn't that okay?

1623
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,729
For example, someone like Hyun Seo
goes in and takes a look.

1624
01:10:26,829 --> 01:10:29,329
Just be totally obvious.
Draw two and wrinkle them up.

1625
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,899
The ones you chose.

1626
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:34,569
And if those are two sharps,
we can all go in as well.

1627
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,470
If they're not two sharps,

1628
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,640
we'll exclude those two,
and the next person will do the same.

1629
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,810
My goodness.

1630
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,250
- My gosh. These cards...
- Lim Hyun Seo, choose two cards.

1631
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,060
(La)

1632
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,600
(Lim Hyun Seo chose mi and la.)

1633
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,569
I chose a rotten pair.

1634
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:14,909
The one with the cross is la.

1635
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:18,710
The one with the corners folded is mi.

1636
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,380
(Joo Eon Kyu chose re sharp and fa sharp.)

1637
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:26,420
The one with three folds this way
is re sharp.

1638
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:29,420
The one with three folds diagonally
is fa sharp.

1639
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:33,060
Then, I'll go and choose one of these
and something else.

1640
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,859
We have to distribute the cards.

1641
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:41,399
(Steve Yea chose re and re sharp.)

1642
01:11:43,369 --> 01:11:44,739
(Hong Jin Ho chose re sharp and fa sharp.)

1643
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,739
(Choi Hye Seon chose do and do sharp.)

1644
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,739
(Pani Bottle chose do sharp and fa sharp.)

1645
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:53,409
Good. We can discuss it together now.

1646
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,319
Everyone can talk about it.

1647
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:58,449
But other than those in our group,

1648
01:11:58,449 --> 01:11:59,819
we're forbidden to talk to anyone else.

1649
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,260
Okay.

1650
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,789
Let's just shut that off.

1651
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:15,369
(Xitsuh chose re sharp and fa sharp.)

1652
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:18,569
(Round 3, Hong Jin Ho Alliance
Card Distribution)

1653
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:20,239
(Round 3, Gray Zone Card Distribution)

1654
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:22,180
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1655
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,880
The song for Round Three will be revealed.

1656
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:32,119
(Round 3, "Why Did You Come to My House")

1657
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:36,720
(Round 3, "Why Did You Come to My House")

1658
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,560
The song for Round Three is
"Why Did You Come to My House."

1659
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:46,500
It's in the key of G
with sol, la, ti, and re.

1660
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:48,340
Our strategy is simple.

1661
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,569
There's no other way,

1662
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:52,869
since we can only bet up to 20 coins.

1663
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,779
Yes, we can go with B.

1664
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,750
But we need to consider the transition.

1665
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,310
Then, let's see.

1666
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,479
But if we go with B,
Hyun Seo doesn't get anything.

1667
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:02,680
But we have no choice but to go with B.

1668
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,850
- B is the most advantageous for us.
- Right.

1669
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:05,949
We have do, re, and fa sharps.

1670
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,819
Then, we have to go with B. So, 16?

1671
01:13:07,819 --> 01:13:09,060
(Key of B)

1672
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,390
Right, but...

1673
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:14,060
if we consider the ones they'll take
among 17, 18, 19, and 20,

1674
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,800
they'll probably be the ones with sharps.

1675
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,670
It will be between 18 and 20.

1676
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:20,569
So, we'll play defense on one of those.

1677
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:22,470
That's our basic strategy for now.

1678
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,239
We either have to take out
sol sharp and la sharp.

1679
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:27,880
I think la sharp might be better,

1680
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,579
since we have do and re sharps
if we go to C sharp.

1681
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,409
- We have a lot of do and re sharps.
- Yes.

1682
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,579
Do sharp and re sharp.

1683
01:13:34,579 --> 01:13:36,920
- So, we can win too.
- Yes, okay.

1684
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,689
That's better.

1685
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:41,359
That's more dominant.

1686
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:43,420
- We'll place a bet with 16 coins.
- So, 16 coins.

1687
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,430
- And bet 4 coins to mute.
- And 4...

1688
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,090
Hello.

1689
01:13:47,829 --> 01:13:49,060
How are you?

1690
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:54,430
(16 coins to transpose
from key of G to key of B)

1691
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,039
La sharp.

1692
01:13:57,399 --> 01:14:00,739
(4 coins to mute a la sharp)

1693
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:02,810
But look. We have a problem.

1694
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,850
In the next round,

1695
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:07,279
- we might have to bet small.
- A small amount.

1696
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:09,020
Betting the maximum every time...

1697
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,890
With eight people,
we can pretty much bet the maximum.

1698
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:15,760
But there are only six of us.

1699
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,789
We have to convince two to join us later.

1700
01:14:19,029 --> 01:14:20,229
No matter what.

1701
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,029
I think that has become
a necessity now, right?

1702
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:24,430
- Yes, no matter what.
- Right.

1703
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:28,100
The crucial thing for us is...

1704
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:29,939
to bring Xitsuh over.

1705
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:33,210
Hey, are you okay?

1706
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,510
- What?
- Are you okay?

1707
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,680
Well, I'm mad right now,
since the random method won't work.

1708
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,380
Everyone is playing origami in the end.

1709
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,750
Honestly, I was wondering what to do.

1710
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,989
If the cards were...

1711
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,260
just flat, they wouldn't have folded them.

1712
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:50,789
But Chungju-Man crumpled them up.

1713
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,560
Because of that,
everyone could start marking them.

1714
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,899
- Didn't they mark and choose similarly?
- Right, I know.

1715
01:14:57,329 --> 01:14:58,899
So, I can't go with a random method
anymore either.

1716
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:00,630
So, I have to join a team.

1717
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:03,140
In that case, Paradise is better
to make the number 7 to 7.

1718
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,810
Still, our team would be better.

1719
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,640
We're on our way to winning now.

1720
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,810
You have to come out on top.

1721
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,680
Here's the thing.
I don't want to go where Acau is.

1722
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,909
Oh, that's why.

1723
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,949
That's it. I'll be honest. I know...

1724
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,250
that Acau plays politics
and defends himself with words a lot.

1725
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:21,189
I know it's part of his playing style.
Do you get what I mean?

1726
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:22,720
- I do.
- You do, right?

1727
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,630
I can't handle that.
It's too mentally straining.

1728
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,829
You know what I mean. I can't stand that.

1729
01:15:26,829 --> 01:15:28,000
I know, but...

1730
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,329
It would be best...

1731
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,439
if you didn't tell
the others about this, but...

1732
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:39,039
I mean, it's up to you.

1733
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:42,340
But the mood in our team is really good.

1734
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,680
I have to consider that too.

1735
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,979
If Acau doesn't go to
Deathmatch right away,

1736
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:47,380
and I have to consider being with him
for a day or two,

1737
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:49,119
it's too hard on me mentally.

1738
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,550
I know myself. I'll explode.

1739
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:53,649
- Yes, I respect that.
- So, I...

1740
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,460
If you have Dong Min's trust,

1741
01:15:56,659 --> 01:15:58,789
tell him clearly. I'm not there yet.

1742
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,329
I... Well...

1743
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:07,899
Why doesn't he understand this?

1744
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:10,699
People can just go,
"Oh, sure," and move on.

1745
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,770
Darn it. We're here for a survival game,

1746
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,909
and we're not supposed to play politics
or whatever?

1747
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:16,909
Saying something is wrong and all that.

1748
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,649
Then just enter a contest instead.

1749
01:16:20,949 --> 01:16:22,279
We should just do well from now on.

1750
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:23,319
What does it all mean, anyway?

1751
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:25,319
Anyway, I think we're at a disadvantage...

1752
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,689
- because of Chungju-Man's actions.
- Just avoid going to Remaining today.

1753
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,920
(Pani Bottle came to Gray Zone.)

1754
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:32,390
Are you still eating?

1755
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,300
- Are you still playing randomly?
- What?

1756
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,029
- Are you still playing randomly?
- Yes, of course.

1757
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,970
After Round Four,
I think I'll go to Paradise.

1758
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:43,140
- Later...
- But some might think it's too late.

1759
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,340
In Paradise...

1760
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:47,909
Seong Beom came down and talked to me.

1761
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,739
He was going,
"Why aren't you coming to Remaining?"

1762
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,279
So, do you know what I said?

1763
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:52,350
"Acau is there."

1764
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,720
If I were to choose a side,

1765
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,050
I intended to go with Paradise.

1766
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,250
And if I go to Dong Min's team,
I will definitely explode.

1767
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:00,890
- I will probably...
- You can't hold back.

1768
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,619
either rebel against Dong Min,

1769
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,729
or I'll get into a fight
with someone there.

1770
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:07,760
So, if Team Paradise says...

1771
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,529
that they need help,

1772
01:17:09,529 --> 01:17:10,529
I'm willing to go...

1773
01:17:10,529 --> 01:17:11,670
- at any time.
- We don't need help.

1774
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,569
We have to bring you to our side,
no matter what.

1775
01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:14,569
That's how things are now.

1776
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:15,770
Guarantee him something.

1777
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:17,039
That he won't be chosen
to go to Deathmatch?

1778
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:20,239
Rather than not choosing me
for Deathmatch,

1779
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,439
it would just be treating me equally.

1780
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:23,579
But what I want is...

1781
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,909
to be really accepted as a team member.

1782
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:27,710
That's all I need to join you.

1783
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:29,949
We'll go to a team
that's more sincere to us...

1784
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:33,149
and acknowledges our presence more.

1785
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,289
To a team where our value is acknowledged.

1786
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:40,060
All right. Who should go this time?

1787
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:44,659
The person who has a chance of winning...

1788
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:45,930
should use their coins later.

1789
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:48,300
Then, who spent their coins already?

1790
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,569
- I spent 3.
- I only have 2 points.

1791
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,609
So, I should go first.

1792
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:54,670
Okay, then.

1793
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:56,579
You should go this time...

1794
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:00,479
and bet 18 coins.

1795
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,350
- And bet two to mute do sharp.
- Okay.

1796
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,619
Mute on do sharp.

1797
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:06,619
So, 18 and 2.

1798
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:10,890
- What if...
- What if they bet 19 or 20?

1799
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,729
No, that doesn't matter at all.

1800
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:15,100
Even if that's the case, we have no choice
but to go with this.

1801
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,800
We bet on this.

1802
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,399
Right, we have to accept it...

1803
01:18:19,399 --> 01:18:20,899
if they go with those two.

1804
01:18:23,069 --> 01:18:24,739
We can't bet based on the chance...

1805
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:25,939
that we might get these two.

1806
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,140
We're betting 18 coins on this.

1807
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,010
We have to think of it
like there's a higher chance of this.

1808
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:34,050
We will bet 18 coins on key changes.

1809
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,920
(18 coins to transpose
from key of G to key of C sharp)

1810
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,220
(2 coins to mute a do sharp)

1811
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,189
I'll bet two coins to mute a do sharp.

1812
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,720
Do sharp.

1813
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:06,949
The people with coins left are me...

1814
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,550
And Yurisa.

1815
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,850
Yurisa hasn't spent her coins yet.

1816
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,119
But Acau has a lot of money.

1817
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,520
Acau has 17.

1818
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,659
Then we don't have to bring in
any new members.

1819
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,460
But later on,

1820
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,859
it will become a competition
to bring in members.

1821
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,800
Because in Round Eight,

1822
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,500
they'll say,
"Hey, they bet on this in Round Seven."

1823
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,800
And they'll go all-in on muting.

1824
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:50,590
Well...

1825
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:54,359
We could choose one with the sharps
or go with something like...

1826
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:55,359
Sounds good.

1827
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:57,260
Jin Ho.

1828
01:19:57,899 --> 01:19:58,899
- Let's talk.
- What?

1829
01:19:58,899 --> 01:19:59,970
Let's talk.

1830
01:20:10,409 --> 01:20:11,979
I'm just going to go home today.

1831
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:13,409
- What?
- I'm just going home today.

1832
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:15,850
Why? Are you sick of it?

1833
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,590
It's not like I do anything here.

1834
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:22,420
Playing the game with Dong Min is...

1835
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,060
It's so stressful for me.

1836
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,060
It's not like I'm here to play a game.

1837
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,760
I'm just...

1838
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:33,699
listening to someone else's orders
for a whole week.

1839
01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:37,100
I don't get to voice my opinion
or anything.

1840
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,039
If I voice my opinion...

1841
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:41,140
For example, look here.

1842
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:44,109
Back then, I said,

1843
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,710
"What if these are knives?"

1844
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,810
And "What if that's not the only mission?"

1845
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,680
I kept saying stuff,
but he never listened.

1846
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,550
He never listened
and just sent me to prison.

1847
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:54,020
Even now,
that's how he's still playing the game.

1848
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,020
Even if I voice my opinion...

1849
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:58,430
Then, why am I even here?
Why should I stay?

1850
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,130
He just needs people who listen well.

1851
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,390
For a whole week,

1852
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:03,760
I'm just working my butt off.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1853
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,439
There are those who lead the game
and those who don't.

1854
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,800
Anyway, Dong Min is the person
who's leading the game.

1855
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,840
And you're still a part of his team.

1856
01:21:13,109 --> 01:21:14,840
That must be why you feel like
you don't fit...

1857
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,079
and why you keep feeling annoyed.

1858
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,850
Actually, when you play a game together,

1859
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:23,119
having different ideas
and butting heads can happen...

1860
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:24,220
more than you think.

1861
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,850
Anyway, you came here at first
and ended up in this situation.

1862
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:29,689
And afterwards,
you ended up on the same team...

1863
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,319
as Dong Min.

1864
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,630
And in the midst of that,

1865
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,460
the way that Dong Min leads the game
isn't how you want it to go.

1866
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,399
And you think you have nothing to do,

1867
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:38,670
and no one seems to listen to you.

1868
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:40,930
I think that's what's going on.

1869
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,199
You know, the situation of the game
can't stay the same,

1870
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,640
and you can't stay
with the same team the whole time.

1871
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,979
Eventually, someone gets eliminated
and teams change.

1872
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,640
And you could keep following along,

1873
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,680
or you could take the lead at times.

1874
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:55,619
Anyway, today... You know this too.

1875
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,079
We're going to switch teams now.

1876
01:21:57,619 --> 01:21:59,649
Dong Min might be there or not.

1877
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,220
If you really think you don't like this,

1878
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,159
and if you don't like being on
the same team as Dong Min,

1879
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,130
you shouldn't just say this to me.

1880
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,460
You should express how you feel.

1881
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:11,430
Say, "I don't think
I'm a good fit on Dong Min's team,"

1882
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:12,600
"so I'll go somewhere else."

1883
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,770
"And I want to play an active part."

1884
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,770
You can definitely do that
in your current situation.

1885
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,810
If you try to take the lead...

1886
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,369
But...

1887
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:25,250
even if I tell that team
that I don't want to play with them,

1888
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:27,310
this team will just...

1889
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:29,079
I'm always accused of being a spy.

1890
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:33,489
People always think I'm a spy...

1891
01:22:35,619 --> 01:22:37,289
whether I do something or not.

1892
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,359
I can't say that I want to join
someone's team.

1893
01:22:45,329 --> 01:22:46,329
That's...

1894
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,340
I don't know. You...

1895
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,810
You might feel that way,

1896
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,939
but from my team's, or my own perspective,

1897
01:22:54,939 --> 01:22:57,180
you didn't show us...

1898
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,310
that you wanted to come over
to our team that enthusiastically.

1899
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,380
Anyway, you always say...

1900
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,319
that you have this or that,

1901
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:06,449
but you don't tell us anything
to prove that.

1902
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:07,689
That's the image you have.

1903
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:08,689
You know that too.

1904
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:12,329
If you just take a more active stance,

1905
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:13,989
we would welcome you too, for sure.

1906
01:23:22,569 --> 01:23:23,640
You should calm down first.

1907
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,210
Calm down.

1908
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:30,279
Even if you don't go that far,

1909
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:33,310
if you just do well
and tell people how you feel,

1910
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,810
you could easily come over to our team.

1911
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,750
But I've been stabbed in the back
so many times.

1912
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,090
You're just not used to these things.

1913
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,819
Your weakness is in...

1914
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,619
getting along in this world.

1915
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:45,489
As you can't even show what you can do...

1916
01:23:46,329 --> 01:23:48,329
and are just swayed by others,

1917
01:23:48,329 --> 01:23:50,359
you're frustrated with yourself.

1918
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,529
You don't have to feel that way.

1919
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:59,310
There is such a thing as luck
when it comes to picking teams,

1920
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:00,710
but you haven't been lucky in that way.

1921
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,149
So, for now,

1922
01:24:05,409 --> 01:24:07,310
don't say that you'll just leave.

1923
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:09,819
Really, it's just about hanging in there.

1924
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:12,449
If you just hang in there,
people live just fine.

1925
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:15,789
You never know
if he will go to Paradise...

1926
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:17,460
or go back to Remaining like right now.

1927
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,689
If you just say
that you'll go the other way,

1928
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:22,630
everyone will welcome you there.

1929
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:27,399
You just haven't shown...

1930
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,539
a strong enough stance
that you would do that.

1931
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:32,739
Okay, I'll think about it.

1932
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:36,840
Calm down. Are you okay?

1933
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:07,310
I thought, "That team is..."

1934
01:25:08,109 --> 01:25:09,979
"also not as bonded,
unlike what they seem."

1935
01:25:10,109 --> 01:25:12,449
From my experience, Dong Min...

1936
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,479
I don't know what he does to coax people,

1937
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:15,520
but he just drags people in.

1938
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:16,819
He puts a team together.

1939
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:19,149
That's what he does best, actually.

1940
01:25:20,189 --> 01:25:21,420
I thought,
"That team seems to have a strong bond."

1941
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,489
"They're all on Dong Min's side.
What should I do?"

1942
01:25:23,489 --> 01:25:25,060
But then, when I talked to her,

1943
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,229
they were actually starting to fall apart.

1944
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:28,760
Xitsuh said he'd join us.

1945
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,500
But should we...

1946
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:32,930
hide this strategically?

1947
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,100
- Or should we just reveal it?
- Xitsuh?

1948
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,170
- Yes.
- I think Xitsuh will know anyway,

1949
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,840
but until the other team finds out,

1950
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,970
we don't have to tell them.

1951
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,909
Because the other team will think...

1952
01:25:41,909 --> 01:25:43,640
- they outnumber us.
- Right.

1953
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,640
So, let's do that for now.

1954
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:47,949
Hey, talk to Jin Ho.

1955
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:49,149
Me?

1956
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:54,020
But we have to discuss this once more.

1957
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,289
Xitsuh, you're on our side now.

1958
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,630
But we should show you
playing on our side...

1959
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,130
as late as possible.

1960
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:04,029
What I want to say now is...

1961
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:05,770
Yurisa...

1962
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,270
She's not doing really well now.

1963
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:11,069
She came to me crying her eyes out.

1964
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,069
Why?

1965
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:15,010
She's totally losing her nerve.

1966
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,380
She wants to go home.

1967
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:18,550
Why?

1968
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:20,409
She just thinks
she can't do anything here.

1969
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,149
She's upset.

1970
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,520
Then she should've stuck around
at the Mansion.

1971
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,250
I calmed her down a bit,

1972
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,090
but she was crying so much.

1973
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:31,859
Anyway, when she first came to Paradise,

1974
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:34,189
she didn't get to do anything
and was just tagging along.

1975
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:36,659
She tried to voice her opinion,

1976
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,770
but Dong Min didn't listen to her at all.

1977
01:26:39,729 --> 01:26:41,199
But it turned out she was right.

1978
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:43,199
And amid all that,
she ended up going to prison.

1979
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:45,539
She was thrown out
after being accused as a spy.

1980
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:47,810
She feels like she has no role,
and her self-esteem...

1981
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,979
is at rock bottom.

1982
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:50,810
We could just bring Yurisa over now.

1983
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,350
Anyway, we're playing a game now.

1984
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,479
It might be weird to ask you this,

1985
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:57,979
- but it's okay, right?
- What is?

1986
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:00,319
How many coins does she have?

1987
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,590
- This is important too.
- Oh, Yurisa?

1988
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,529
- We should ask her that.
- That is important.

1989
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,760
We should ask her that later...

1990
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,399
And there's no chance
that she's a double spy?

1991
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,659
There's a zero possibility
that she's a spy.

1992
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,569
You become weak when women cry.

1993
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:15,600
They weren't fake tears
in the first place.

1994
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:18,670
She cried her eyes out.

1995
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:20,239
Fake tears?

1996
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:23,810
I feel bad to say this,

1997
01:27:23,979 --> 01:27:27,180
but what's good about bringing
Yurisa over in this situation?

1998
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:28,779
It helps to have coins.

1999
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,949
That's obvious.

2000
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:32,890
Let's have her over first
and tell her about our situation.

2001
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:35,250
We'll let her know
that we can't save her...

2002
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,390
and that we'll stick to our way.

2003
01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:40,460
- Then...
- What?

2004
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:45,670
We can't tell each other what to do.

2005
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:49,239
We just...

2006
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:51,800
follow our convictions.

2007
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,970
If you don't feel comfortable
about a certain way,

2008
01:27:55,409 --> 01:27:57,680
you're not cut out for it.

2009
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:00,779
And if you...

2010
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:05,149
feel comfortable about it,

2011
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:08,090
you can do what you want with ease.

2012
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,689
If it hadn't suited you, you could've just
chosen not to come in the first place.

2013
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:16,960
We all agreed to work together
in the beginning.

2014
01:28:17,829 --> 01:28:19,399
I'm not sure anymore.

2015
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:25,340
There are various kinds of groups.

2016
01:28:26,109 --> 01:28:29,039
If it were in the past...

2017
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:31,180
when I was in my 30s,

2018
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:32,979
I'd call them over to have
a private conversation.

2019
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:36,649
Now that I'm in my 40s,
I just let things slide.

2020
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:38,850
Where's Jin Ho?

2021
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,619
He's having a sweet time with her.

2022
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:44,060
(Dong Min came to meet Jin Ho.)

2023
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,930
You're still part of that group.

2024
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:48,930
That may be why you keep
feeling like you don't belong there...

2025
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:51,260
and having unpleasant situations.

2026
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,270
"Well, that's understandable."

2027
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,340
I used to try my best
to somehow lead those...

2028
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,810
who weren't really to my liking.

2029
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:11,020
But now, I know it's impossible.

2030
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,590
So I don't go the extra mile.

2031
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,989
However,

2032
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,329
they will be faced with a huge burden.

2033
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,359
Everyone, please gather at the Main Hall.

2034
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:41,680
The song for Round Three will be played.

2035
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,390
"Why Did You Come to My House" was...

2036
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,829
changed to C sharp.

2037
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:00,600
La sharp was muted.

2038
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:06,869
The players who went for do sharp,
re sharp, fa, and sol sharp...

2039
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:08,270
are to obtain points.

2040
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:13,050
In the first place, there are
Jang Dong Min, MJ Kim, and Heo Seong Beom.

2041
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:15,779
Round Four will now begin.

2042
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,420
The song for Round Four will be revealed.

2043
01:30:19,149 --> 01:30:24,659
(Round 4: "A Cottage on an Isle")

2044
01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:30,729
(Round 4: "A Cottage on an Isle")

2045
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:34,170
The song for Round Four is
"A Cottage on an Isle."

2046
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:38,539
Its original key is D, re, mi, fa sharp,

2047
01:30:38,739 --> 01:30:41,939
sol, la, and ti.

2048
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,279
That's so many.

2049
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,510
Why are there so many?
It's half the notes.

2050
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,609
Round Four will now begin.

2051
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,220
If anyone wishes to change keys,

2052
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,189
please enter the voting room
and bet your coin.

2053
01:30:59,029 --> 01:31:00,760
(Well...)

2054
01:31:05,529 --> 01:31:06,529
Let's go.

2055
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:10,069
Let's go, Jin Ho.

2056
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:11,770
Okay.

2057
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,739
Let's go.

2058
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,819
(Yurisa follows Jin Ho out.)

2059
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:32,189
Chungju-Man, will you bet your coin?

2060
01:31:32,489 --> 01:31:33,590
I won't.

2061
01:31:35,029 --> 01:31:36,199
That was so fast.

2062
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:38,199
Why don't we have a talk?

2063
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:39,899
I'm going to sleep for real.

2064
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:41,670
- No, let's talk for a bit.
- Why?

2065
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:43,640
It means they have...

2066
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:47,010
sol sharp and one more.

2067
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:50,109
- Yurisa knows what they have, right?
- The other team?

2068
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:52,880
She knows what they currently have.

2069
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,279
She's coming.

2070
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:56,479
She should've joined us before the game.

2071
01:31:56,819 --> 01:31:58,119
It would've been nice then.

2072
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,720
Hi, Yurisa.

2073
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,890
- Hello.
- Hi.

2074
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:03,020
Are you feeling better now?

2075
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,590
Yes, I want in.

2076
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:05,890
Come here.

2077
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:07,529
Our team got bigger.

2078
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,159
- You seem upset.
- Come to the inner side.

2079
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,199
(Yurisa has joined Jin Ho's team.)

2080
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:14,100
But just so you know, we're in a mess.

2081
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,470
Why?

2082
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:17,069
- We're at a big disadvantage.
- Really?

2083
01:32:17,069 --> 01:32:18,539
They...

2084
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,439
- Is it okay to tell you?
- It doesn't matter.

2085
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:22,039
They have re sharp and sol sharp.

2086
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:23,609
Re and sol... I knew it.

2087
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,750
Have you bet your coin?

2088
01:32:25,949 --> 01:32:27,149
- No.
- Never?

2089
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:28,850
That's good news for us.
You saved your coins?

2090
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:30,949
We should share what we have with her.

2091
01:32:30,949 --> 01:32:32,489
No objections, right?

2092
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,489
- No.
- This is what we have.

2093
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:36,289
What do you have, Yurisa?

2094
01:32:36,289 --> 01:32:38,189
- Re sharp and sol sharp.
- Re sharp...

2095
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:39,229
Re and sol?

2096
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:40,829
Then, you won't get
to take points this time.

2097
01:32:40,829 --> 01:32:41,829
That's okay.

2098
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:43,159
I think we should go with do and fa.

2099
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,300
In that case, who will take points?

2100
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,500
Pani.

2101
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:47,630
Pani?

2102
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:50,000
Do sharp and fa sharp.
Then, they will take points.

2103
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,239
We should go with A for sure.

2104
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:54,470
- Then 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
- We don't know...

2105
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,310
Let's only consider these cases.

2106
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:58,279
We're going to use 19 to go with this.

2107
01:32:58,279 --> 01:33:01,149
Is there a chance they will use 20?

2108
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:02,380
They don't even know what we have.

2109
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:04,180
I doubt they will bet 20
on what they don't know.

2110
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,050
They won't bet 20 that way.

2111
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:07,520
They need to save coins anyway.

2112
01:33:07,989 --> 01:33:11,119
So we've decided to bet 19,
and they're not likely to bet 20.

2113
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,659
If they hear what we have,
they will bet 19.

2114
01:33:13,659 --> 01:33:15,390
- Right.
- They will.

2115
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:18,100
Then, all of us will take no points.

2116
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:20,529
In this case, we have to bet 20.

2117
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:22,899
Just in case, let's stop re sharp.

2118
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:24,100
Let's go with five.

2119
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,710
It's quite a blow to cut off their plan.

2120
01:33:26,909 --> 01:33:29,079
I think it's better to bet five safely.

2121
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:31,510
They might mute do.

2122
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,250
When we bet one, it didn't work.

2123
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,510
Not even when we bet five.

2124
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,920
(They bet 5 which turned to failure.)

2125
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,149
(They bet 2 which turned to failure.)

2126
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,720
It's six at the least.

2127
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,590
Why don't we go with seven
just to be sure?

2128
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:43,619
Okay.

2129
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,260
He has seven.

2130
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,760
- I'll go.
- What?

2131
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:47,829
I need to go now.

2132
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,369
I'll bet 20.

2133
01:33:52,369 --> 01:33:53,529
(Betting 20 coins to change the key
from D to A sharp.)

2134
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,970
I'll bet seven on do.

2135
01:33:57,539 --> 01:34:01,640
(Dong Min's team precisely predicted
Jin Ho's team's strategy.)

2136
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:03,909
It'd be perfect to have Chungju-Man
at a time like this.

2137
01:34:03,909 --> 01:34:05,680
If we had him, we'd easily win the game.

2138
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:06,750
Where is he?

2139
01:34:07,649 --> 01:34:08,779
He's in Switzerland.

2140
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:15,149
(The Swiss man shows up.)

2141
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:19,260
<i>The sea's lullaby</i>

2142
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:21,689
- He's here.
<i>- The baby</i>

2143
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:23,159
<i>- Slowly</i>
- Help us out.

2144
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,430
- Help us.
- What do you mean?

2145
01:34:25,529 --> 01:34:27,100
We're outnumbered.

2146
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,170
Help us.

2147
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,939
It'd be nice if you could bet just five.

2148
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:35,140
Use just five coins for mute.

2149
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,739
He and I are bottom-place rivals.

2150
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:39,409
No, actually... I'm set to place last.

2151
01:34:39,409 --> 01:34:41,250
Are they giving you support?

2152
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,949
No, I'm their human shield.

2153
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,890
You are? But they will
treat you better later on.

2154
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,920
I doubt it, considering our strategy.

2155
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,989
Anyway, I'll talk to you later.

2156
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,829
My coins increase in value
the more time passes.

2157
01:34:58,699 --> 01:35:01,329
They will show their worth
in Round 7 or 8.

2158
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:02,770
So I've waited for that moment.

2159
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,539
Yurisa, come with me.

2160
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,069
I'll use 19 and you should use 5.

2161
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:09,779
- Re sharp.
- Yes, mute re sharp.

2162
01:35:10,979 --> 01:35:13,380
After this,
go wash your face or something...

2163
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,310
during the break.

2164
01:35:15,449 --> 01:35:18,020
I see tearstains on your face.

2165
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,590
You can see them?

2166
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:20,789
I can.

2167
01:35:22,859 --> 01:35:24,420
Go on first. I'll wait here.

2168
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,130
Let me wipe off the tearstains. Hold on.

2169
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,930
Five on re sharp.

2170
01:35:32,699 --> 01:35:34,170
I'll use my coins to mute.

2171
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:37,569
I'll use 19 coins.

2172
01:35:37,569 --> 01:35:39,909
(Betting 19 coins to change the key
from D to A.)

2173
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,939
Dong Min...

2174
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,609
leads his team so obstinately.

2175
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:47,050
I always call him self-willed, you know.

2176
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:49,920
(Self-willed)

2177
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:53,090
I hardly work with him
because we don't get along much.

2178
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:54,689
I try to stay as his rival.

2179
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:58,090
But he sure is good at games.

2180
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,829
He's good.

2181
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:03,359
Gosh, he gets the best of me all the time.

2182
01:36:04,829 --> 01:36:06,500
The betting is over.

2183
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:09,270
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2184
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,369
(The Swiss guy wakes up.)

2185
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:15,140
The song for Round Four will be played.

2186
01:36:27,789 --> 01:36:30,220
The song was transposed...

2187
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:32,420
to the key of A sharp.

2188
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,560
Do was muted.

2189
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:40,670
The players with ra sharp, re,
re sharp, fa, or sol...

2190
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,640
are to obtain points.

2191
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,270
(Round 4: "A Cottage on an Isle," A sharp)

2192
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:46,739
What...

2193
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:51,239
Let me reveal the current ranks
with accumulated points so far.

2194
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:55,350
The first-place players are
Jang Dong Min, Heo Seong Beom, and MJ Kim.

2195
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,619
The bottom-place player is Lim Hyun Seo.

2196
01:36:59,289 --> 01:37:01,119
Isn't it your first time ever
to place last?

2197
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:02,520
- I place last from time to time.
- You do?

2198
01:37:03,489 --> 01:37:05,989
But the difference is just huge.

2199
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:09,399
Before Round Five begins, each player...

2200
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:13,229
should enter the voting room
and choose two notes.

2201
01:37:14,729 --> 01:37:17,640
(Dong Min's team heads straight
to the voting room.)

2202
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:25,510
Dong Min, please choose two cards.

2203
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,979
(He previously drew
re sharp and sol sharp.)

2204
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:35,119
What the...

2205
01:37:36,819 --> 01:37:39,060
What on earth? Why is it gone?

2206
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:45,529
Are these the original cards?

2207
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:49,800
Gosh. This is...

2208
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,539
This is supposed to be sol sharp.

2209
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,310
Let me check if it is.

2210
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,949
Gosh. That startled me.
Oh, this is re sharp.

2211
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:02,779
As expected.

2212
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:05,119
Oh, this is re sharp.

2213
01:38:05,649 --> 01:38:07,449
Re sharp.

2214
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,819
(Leaving a mark)

2215
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,460
This...

2216
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:15,890
(He manages to find sol sharp too.)

2217
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,329
They should've torn it similarly,

2218
01:38:17,329 --> 01:38:18,729
not completely different.

2219
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:19,829
Darn.

2220
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:21,029
I...

2221
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,000
folded the corner here.

2222
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Re sharp and sol sharp?

2223
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,399
Yes, just choose those two.

2224
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:30,279
(They're planning to draw
the same cards again this time.)

2225
01:38:30,439 --> 01:38:31,979
(Kim Min A has drawn
re sharp and sol sharp.)

2226
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:33,310
(MJ Kim has drawn re sharp and sol sharp.)

2227
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:34,909
(Acau has drawn re sharp and sol sharp.)

2228
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:38,180
(Lee Gina has drawn re and re sharp.)

2229
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:44,060
I chose those with a folded left corner.

2230
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,590
- You couldn't find them?
- No, that's not it.

2231
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,989
The cards were re sharp and re.

2232
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,130
This is not good.

2233
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,729
We were faced with trouble
because of this.

2234
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,380
(Heo Seong Beom has drawn
re sharp and sol sharp.)

2235
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,149
(Team Jang Dong Min's cards for Round 5.)

2236
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:07,649
(Dong Min, Seong Beom, MJ Kim,
Acau, and Min A: Re sharp and sol sharp)

2237
01:39:07,649 --> 01:39:09,079
(Gina: Re and re sharp)

2238
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,949
They bet 20.

2239
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:13,789
- I didn't think they would.
- I know.

2240
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:17,220
Their points are...

2241
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:18,560
balanced so well.

2242
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,960
It's practically impossible
for us not to have...

2243
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,460
a bottom-place player from our team.

2244
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,699
Hyun Seo, I know it's late,

2245
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:26,130
but try to get as many points as possible.

2246
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,500
Then it's almost higher than 90 percent...

2247
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,829
that I'll move up to second from last.

2248
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:30,199
If our team is to support anyone,

2249
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,239
it should be Jin Ho.

2250
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:33,010
Me, Yurisa, and Steve. One of us three.

2251
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,039
All three of us should draw
different cards.

2252
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,340
Mostly black keys.

2253
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:39,010
Then, we should support...

2254
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,850
whoever has cards near 19 or 20.

2255
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,720
Why don't we go...

2256
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:45,319
with different keys with sharp?

2257
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:47,520
Sol sharp and do sharp for one set.

2258
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,090
Mi sharp and sol sharp for another.

2259
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,390
Fa sharp and la sharp for next. Like this.

2260
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:53,560
This way, we can get points in any case.

2261
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,689
(Jin Ho's team is planning
to draw different keys.)

2262
01:39:54,829 --> 01:39:57,800
Is there any key I need to find?

2263
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,829
Sol sharp.

2264
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:00,930
But they already know
the card for sol sharp.

2265
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:03,100
They may have drawn other keys.

2266
01:40:03,569 --> 01:40:07,039
We can't be sure
if they know of additional keys...

2267
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:09,170
because all of them had
sol sharp and re sharp.

2268
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:12,210
Unless we make a mistake,

2269
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,479
we can continuously...

2270
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:15,609
draw re sharp and sol sharp.

2271
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,880
But what makes me anxious is...

2272
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:20,390
that we can only draw
re sharp and sol sharp.

2273
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,149
Why are they taking such a risk, though?

2274
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,159
What if we completely mute those two?

2275
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,890
They may think we aren't aware.

2276
01:40:27,489 --> 01:40:29,060
If their strategy was...

2277
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:32,359
to draw different cards in general...

2278
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,500
It may get more advantageous for them
during Rounds 7 and 8.

2279
01:40:34,899 --> 01:40:35,899
But it's a good strategy.

2280
01:40:35,899 --> 01:40:38,340
The score difference is only three.

2281
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:40,270
We don't have to risk ourselves
on just one.

2282
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,310
Then, I'll do some searching.

2283
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,439
- We'd better find la sharp first.
- Okay.

2284
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:48,149
It's best to find
both la sharp and sol sharp.

2285
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,420
I'll look for them...

2286
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:51,250
among all the cards
except for those we know.

2287
01:40:53,619 --> 01:40:57,289
(Eon Kyu is up to find other sharp cards.)

2288
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,069
(Leaving out the cards he already knows)

2289
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:24,250
(He's got to find la sharp and sol sharp.)

2290
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:37,800
(Joo Eon Kyu has drawn la sharp and fa.)

2291
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,600
How should I fold this?

2292
01:41:49,779 --> 01:41:51,010
You told me to find two, right?

2293
01:41:51,409 --> 01:41:52,909
La sharp and sol sharp.

2294
01:41:52,909 --> 01:41:54,079
I found la sharp.

2295
01:41:55,449 --> 01:41:58,350
I folded the la sharp card
into a funeral house.

2296
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,890
- Okay.
- And as for the fa card, I folded it...

2297
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:03,560
big like this.

2298
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:05,560
So far, we've identified nine cards.

2299
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,789
(They've figured out 9 out of 12 cards.)

2300
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:08,560
Who else will do the searching?

2301
01:42:09,189 --> 01:42:10,229
I'll go.

2302
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,899
(If one more goes,
they can identify all the cards.)

2303
01:42:20,739 --> 01:42:21,810
Re.

2304
01:42:22,039 --> 01:42:23,180
Re sharp.

2305
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:24,810
Do.

2306
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:25,909
(Referring to the picture examples)

2307
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:33,520
This is...

2308
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,659
Did I do it right?

2309
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,670
(Pani Bottle has drawn sol and ti.)

2310
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:50,300
I wrote the F word on the mark here.

2311
01:42:50,369 --> 01:42:52,170
That's ti. "F you" is sol.

2312
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:54,909
- You wrote that?
- I just wrote on them.

2313
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:59,039
And this torn one is sol sharp.

2314
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:00,479
- Do I draw do and re?
- Do and re.

2315
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:04,319
(Jin Ho's team has identified
all the cards now.)

2316
01:43:13,529 --> 01:43:15,890
(Hong Jin Ho has drawn
do sharp and re sharp.)

2317
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,829
(Steve Yea has drawn
do sharp and re sharp.)

2318
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:25,039
This is how you should leave marks.

2319
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:28,039
(Yurisa has drawn fa sharp and sol sharp.)

2320
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:31,310
(Xitsuh has drawn fa sharp and sol sharp.)

2321
01:43:32,109 --> 01:43:34,350
(Lim Hyun Seo has drawn
fa sharp and sol sharp.)

2322
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,649
(Choi Hye Seon has drawn
fa sharp and la sharp.)

2323
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,149
(Chungju-Man has drawn
re sharp and fa sharp.)

2324
01:43:40,289 --> 01:43:42,289
(Team Hong Jin Ho's cards for Round 5)

2325
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:44,819
(Gray Zone's cards)

2326
01:43:47,689 --> 01:43:50,000
All players are done drawing cards
for Round Five.

2327
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:53,170
Round Five will now begin.

2328
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,800
The song for Round Five will be revealed.

2329
01:43:57,439 --> 01:44:04,510
(Round 5: "Full Moon")

2330
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:08,050
The song for Round Five is "Full Moon."

2331
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:09,510
The original key is F,

2332
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:14,020
fa, sol la, la sharp, and do.

2333
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:15,319
(Round 5: "Full Moon")

2334
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:17,390
Round Five will now begin.

2335
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:19,359
Shall we?

2336
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:22,789
After you.

2337
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:24,460
- You're the hero.
- I have a different path.

2338
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:37,140
I choose not to bet.

2339
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:43,819
<i>What kind of moon is it?</i>

2340
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:45,779
<i>It's round like a tray</i>

2341
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:53,760
Good news is...

2342
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,930
that it has all four that we've drawn.

2343
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,399
(They have all the black keys
for C sharp.)

2344
01:44:56,399 --> 01:44:58,060
- It has all four that we have.
- Here.

2345
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,770
Do, re, sol, and la.

2346
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:02,829
If not muted, it will give four points...

2347
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:04,369
to our leading players each.

2348
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,409
I just hope that their cards...

2349
01:45:06,409 --> 01:45:07,569
don't include any of these.

2350
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,779
We're not going to mute it anyway.

2351
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:12,909
In any case, we can change keys...

2352
01:45:12,909 --> 01:45:14,479
to the 20th high at the maximum.

2353
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:16,920
So it's always nice if our cards...

2354
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,750
are close to the 20th.

2355
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,720
We'll likely catch up with them this time.

2356
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:22,989
Did Xitsuh decide to join them?

2357
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:25,560
Yes, he was assigned
to draw certain cards.

2358
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,630
Did he join them too?

2359
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:28,260
Chungju-Man? Not yet.

2360
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,829
During Rounds 6, 7, and 8,

2361
01:45:30,829 --> 01:45:32,529
we have to bet all 20 anyway.

2362
01:45:32,529 --> 01:45:34,170
All in for sure.

2363
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:36,640
This fight is about coins after all.

2364
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,970
That team has eight players.

2365
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,140
Later in the game,

2366
01:45:41,369 --> 01:45:42,439
it can get unpredictable.

2367
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:44,210
(Dong Min's team is short on coins.)

2368
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:45,340
We have to bet 20 for sure.

2369
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:50,619
For now, it's best to use ten coins...

2370
01:45:50,949 --> 01:45:54,890
on D sharp.

2371
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:57,119
We'll use only ten coins,
but coincidentally,

2372
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:58,319
it has both of what we have.

2373
01:45:58,689 --> 01:46:01,189
During the 1st 3 rounds,

2374
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:02,930
they played the game randomly.

2375
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:04,300
So...

2376
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,729
they may not have anyone...

2377
01:46:07,829 --> 01:46:09,170
- with all 20 coins.
- They may not.

2378
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:11,000
- You have all coins, right?
- Yes.

2379
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:12,270
Should I use mine now?

2380
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:13,710
Yes, use them now.

2381
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:14,739
- Bet all 20.
- Okay.

2382
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:18,409
I'll bet 20.

2383
01:46:18,409 --> 01:46:19,539
(Betting 20 coins to change the key
from F to C sharp)

2384
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:22,250
The betting is over.

2385
01:46:22,779 --> 01:46:24,720
Everyone, please gather at the Main Hall.

2386
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:30,020
The song for Round Five will be played.

2387
01:46:38,659 --> 01:46:41,300
The song for Round Five, "Full Moon,"

2388
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,470
has been changed to C sharp.

2389
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:49,010
(Dong Min's team only bet 10 coins.)

2390
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:52,409
(Pani Bottle bet all 20.)

2391
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:57,050
The players with do sharp, re sharp,
fa, sol sharp, and la sharp...

2392
01:46:57,579 --> 01:47:00,119
are to obtain points.

2393
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:01,789
(A lot of players have obtained 4 points.)

2394
01:47:01,949 --> 01:47:06,829
The first-place players are Jang Dong Min,
Heo Seong Beom, and MJ Kim...

2395
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:09,960
with 14 points and the bottom-place player
is Lim Hyun Seo with 3 points.

2396
01:47:10,359 --> 01:47:12,899
Round Six will now begin.

2397
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,630
The song for Round Six will be revealed.

2398
01:47:18,539 --> 01:47:25,479
(Round 6: "Red Fox")

2399
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:30,319
The song for Round Six is "Red Fox."

2400
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:33,250
Its original key is C sharp,

2401
01:47:33,619 --> 01:47:38,289
do sharp, fa, sol sharp, and la sharp.

2402
01:47:38,289 --> 01:47:40,090
(Round 6: "Red Fox")

2403
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:41,930
Are you dead or alive?

2404
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:43,960
Are you dead or alive?

2405
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,829
Gosh, see?

2406
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,800
Chungju-Man isn't placed last.

2407
01:47:49,069 --> 01:47:50,140
Isn't he sharing last place?

2408
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:52,270
No. What are you talking about?

2409
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:54,270
- Guys, play random like me.
- You really...

2410
01:47:54,439 --> 01:47:55,510
You took a nap and still managed to win.

2411
01:47:56,609 --> 01:47:58,279
Do I just do it? What do we do now?

2412
01:47:58,279 --> 01:47:59,279
You slept and still won.

2413
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,149
Oh, betting. We have to make a bet, right?

2414
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,020
Chungju-Man, will you make a bet?

2415
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:07,149
I won't.

2416
01:48:09,619 --> 01:48:12,289
They will show their worth
in Round 7 or 8.

2417
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:14,090
Gosh, we aren't...

2418
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:16,489
getting a single satisfying moment.

2419
01:48:18,229 --> 01:48:20,500
We bet 20 coins,
so the key was changed to what we chose.

2420
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,270
Without knowing what the original key is,

2421
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:25,170
how do they manage
to keep getting four points?

2422
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:27,369
The previous key...

2423
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:30,579
had a lot of sharps. It had four sharps.

2424
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:34,649
Considering that, I can force myself
to understand the situation.

2425
01:48:34,649 --> 01:48:36,250
- But originally...
- The same...

2426
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:37,579
- What if they drew the same?
- They...

2427
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,989
I wonder if they drew different cards
and still obtained points...

2428
01:48:40,989 --> 01:48:42,420
or if they...

2429
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,159
drew the same cards again...

2430
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,359
like sol sharp and re sharp from earlier.

2431
01:48:46,359 --> 01:48:47,689
Did they agree to go with sol sharp
and re sharp all together?

2432
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:48,960
That could be the case.

2433
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,659
But it's a high risk...

2434
01:48:51,829 --> 01:48:53,430
to draw sol sharp and re sharp
for all rounds.

2435
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,829
Isn't it only natural
to draw different cards?

2436
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,369
The problem is that we're
at a disadvantage this time.

2437
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,810
If they use 19 coins,
they can change the key to G sharp...

2438
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,340
with re sharp and sol sharp.

2439
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,680
(G sharp with do, re sharp,
fa, and sol sharp)

2440
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:07,909
But let's say we don't use any coins...

2441
01:49:07,909 --> 01:49:09,779
and expect them to use 19 coins.

2442
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:14,149
If we mute sol sharp,
Jin Ho and I will get re sharp.

2443
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:16,760
That's one strategy.

2444
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,060
(Strategy 1: Expect the other team
to bet 19 coins and mute sol sharp.)

2445
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:21,529
Otherwise, we could bet 20 coins.

2446
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:22,960
(Strategy 2:
Bet 20 coins and win 2 points.)

2447
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:26,329
They'll definitely think
that we have re sharp and sol sharp.

2448
01:49:26,529 --> 01:49:29,229
They might expect us to use 19 coins...

2449
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:32,340
and say,
"Let's bet 20 coins and get 1 note."

2450
01:49:32,939 --> 01:49:35,340
If they mute re sharp or sol sharp,

2451
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,609
we'll waste our coins.

2452
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:39,279
If they mute one of the notes,

2453
01:49:39,579 --> 01:49:42,750
we'll only get 2 points
after using 19 coins.

2454
01:49:42,779 --> 01:49:44,880
Let's say they mute re sharp or sol sharp.

2455
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:47,420
Then they won't use 20 coins.

2456
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:49,520
- Right.
- You know what I mean, right?

2457
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:51,659
Let's think about it.

2458
01:49:51,989 --> 01:49:54,789
Let's think about
the psychological aspect.

2459
01:49:55,229 --> 01:49:58,300
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2460
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,100
Seven. Seven coins.

2461
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,800
If we bet seven coins and mute...
Thirteen coins.

2462
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,270
Dong Min, I think...

2463
01:50:07,369 --> 01:50:09,739
it might be best not to mute any notes.

2464
01:50:09,739 --> 01:50:11,810
- It's only two points.
- That's right.

2465
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,050
I'll bet 7 coins
and leave 13 coins behind.

2466
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:16,409
- Okay.
- Wouldn't it be better to use 13 coins...

2467
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:18,079
to mute an important note
in Rounds 7 and 8?

2468
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,579
- That's a good idea.
- Something like three points.

2469
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,550
Okay. Let's do that.

2470
01:50:34,069 --> 01:50:36,970
(7 coins for G sharp)

2471
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:39,739
I'll bet seven coins.

2472
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:41,939
(Betting 7 coins to change the key
from C to G sharp)

2473
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,170
Will you place a bet?

2474
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:47,350
Heo Seong Beom, you bet seven coins.

2475
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:53,079
(Xitsuh enters the voting room
to place a bet.)

2476
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:56,189
Xitsuh, will you place a bet?

2477
01:50:56,189 --> 01:50:57,659
Finally, I'll place a bet.

2478
01:51:00,789 --> 01:51:02,430
The betting is closed.

2479
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:05,100
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2480
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:09,170
The song for Round Six will be played.

2481
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:20,909
The song for Round Five, "Red Fox,"

2482
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,779
was transposed to the key of F sharp.

2483
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:29,220
Sol sharp was muted.

2484
01:51:35,229 --> 01:51:38,899
(Hong Jin Ho Alliance was torn
between the two strategies.)

2485
01:51:39,329 --> 01:51:41,670
We should mute sol sharp.

2486
01:51:42,869 --> 01:51:45,340
If we change the key to F sharp,
will we get many points?

2487
01:51:47,109 --> 01:51:49,109
We don't have sol sharp.

2488
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:52,010
It'll be good for us. Why do you ask?

2489
01:51:52,409 --> 01:51:54,449
Instead of wasting coins on sol sharp,

2490
01:51:54,449 --> 01:51:56,210
why don't we take this key with 17 coins?

2491
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:59,350
If we use 17 coins,
we'll lose when they use 19 coins.

2492
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:00,590
(17 coins for F sharp,
19 coins for G sharp)

2493
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,420
They've already taken some coins.

2494
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:04,220
They wouldn't use 19 coins in this round.

2495
01:52:04,489 --> 01:52:05,890
Rounds 7 and 8 remain.

2496
01:52:06,289 --> 01:52:07,489
She has a point.

2497
01:52:08,189 --> 01:52:09,930
If we change the key with 17 coins
and mute a note with 3 coins,

2498
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:11,500
we'll have 20 coins and 15 coins.

2499
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,159
We can do something with them.

2500
01:52:13,899 --> 01:52:15,569
- I think it's a good idea.
- Yes.

2501
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:17,399
Let's bet 17 coins and 3 coins
respectively.

2502
01:52:18,199 --> 01:52:20,510
I'll bet 17 coins.

2503
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:21,869
(Betting 17 coins to change the key
from C to F sharp)

2504
01:52:21,869 --> 01:52:25,380
And I'll bet three coins
to mute sol sharp.

2505
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:27,750
(3 coins to mute a sol sharp)

2506
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:31,220
The older members wanted to pick
the strategy of muting the note.

2507
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:33,350
We had more coins,

2508
01:52:33,489 --> 01:52:36,420
so I persuaded them to more money
to change the key...

2509
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:39,119
in order to gain points
and avoid the muted note.

2510
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:40,930
I racked my brain.

2511
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:46,199
The players with do sharp, re sharp,
fa sharp, and la sharp...

2512
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:47,670
are to obtain points.

2513
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:49,630
(Round 6: "Red Fox," F sharp)

2514
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:53,199
The first-place players are Jang Dong Min,
Heo Seong Beom, and MJ Kim...

2515
01:52:53,239 --> 01:52:57,210
with 16 points.
Hong Jin Ho and Steve Yea have 15 points.

2516
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:58,310
Run!

2517
01:52:58,579 --> 01:53:00,850
That punk.

2518
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:04,149
- My goodness.
- I can react right away.

2519
01:53:04,149 --> 01:53:06,720
Before Round Seven begins,

2520
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:08,949
please enter the Voting Room
one at a time...

2521
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:11,159
and choose two notes.

2522
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:12,920
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2523
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:16,829
- So scary.
- Don't scare us.

2524
01:53:19,229 --> 01:53:21,500
Hold on. You know what I mean, right?

2525
01:53:21,699 --> 01:53:23,270
I'll go last.

2526
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:24,600
I gave everyone a mission.

2527
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:29,010
(After having a meeting
on placing a bet in Round 6)

2528
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:30,680
Now, we need to talk about...

2529
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,550
which notes to pick in the next round.

2530
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:37,119
To play it safe,
we need to pick two notes each.

2531
01:53:37,779 --> 01:53:41,550
They'll think
that re and sol are dangerous.

2532
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:43,689
They'll mute those notes the most.

2533
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:46,119
You know what I mean, right?

2534
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,630
But it can't be helped.

2535
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:49,029
- We need to take one.
- I agree.

2536
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:51,159
We don't know what we'll get
if 20 coins are bet.

2537
01:53:51,899 --> 01:53:53,829
We worried the most about
not getting any points.

2538
01:53:53,829 --> 01:53:56,300
We thought it'd be best
to pick a variety of notes.

2539
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:00,069
When we enter the voting room this time,

2540
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:03,310
we need to check.

2541
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,710
- You have a job when you enter first.
- Okay.

2542
01:54:06,979 --> 01:54:08,350
Find do sharp.

2543
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:11,680
If you find do sharp,

2544
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:14,850
tear the bottom to the middle, okay?

2545
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:19,020
The two of you need to do your best
to find la sharp.

2546
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:20,989
If you find la sharp,

2547
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:23,359
- tear all four corners.
- Okay.

2548
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:25,729
- Tear all four corners.
- Okay.

2549
01:54:25,829 --> 01:54:29,699
If we win 6 points in Round 7,

2550
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,840
it's game over.

2551
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:36,810
(Acau chose do sharp and fa sharp.)

2552
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:48,789
(Kim Min A chose do sharp and la sharp.)

2553
01:54:57,899 --> 01:54:58,930
We find all of them.

2554
01:54:59,529 --> 01:55:02,800
MJ, you'll choose re sharp and sol sharp.

2555
01:55:03,369 --> 01:55:05,340
- Okay.
- The notes have been identified.

2556
01:55:05,369 --> 01:55:06,369
Seong Beom, what will you choose?

2557
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:08,609
I'll choose do sharp and fa sharp.

2558
01:55:09,239 --> 01:55:10,979
I'll choose do sharp and la sharp.

2559
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:12,439
Do sharp and la sharp.

2560
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:16,279
(Lee Gina chose do sharp and sol sharp.)

2561
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:19,850
(MJ Kim chose re sharp and sol sharp.)

2562
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:24,159
(Heo Seong Beom chose do sharp
and la sharp.)

2563
01:55:24,819 --> 01:55:26,119
I'll pick two cards.

2564
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:29,930
(Jang Dong Min chose
do sharp and fa sharp.)

2565
01:55:30,029 --> 01:55:32,630
(Jang Dong Min: Do sharp, fa sharp
Heo Seong Beom: Do sharp, la sharp)

2566
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:34,199
(MJ Kim: Re sharp, sol sharp
Acau: Do sharp, fa sharp)

2567
01:55:34,199 --> 01:55:35,770
(Kim Min A: Do sharp, la sharp
Lee Gina: Do sharp, sol sharp)

2568
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:40,609
Here's what we found out
through this round.

2569
01:55:41,739 --> 01:55:43,510
It's only a guess,

2570
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:45,010
but they probably don't have many coins.

2571
01:55:45,579 --> 01:55:49,250
Jin Ho and I are 1 point behind
compared to the 1st-place group.

2572
01:55:51,649 --> 01:55:52,819
This is so hard.

2573
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,090
They'll divide up the notes now.

2574
01:55:56,989 --> 01:56:00,329
I think we can turn the tables
by using your strategy...

2575
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,789
by ditching one sharp...

2576
01:56:02,729 --> 01:56:04,699
and choosing 1 sharp and 1 white key note.

2577
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,470
Then we can mute one sharp...

2578
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:10,170
and bet 20, 18, or 19 coins.

2579
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:13,369
That'll give us the highest chance.

2580
01:56:14,409 --> 01:56:16,909
In the end, you and I will do it.

2581
01:56:17,779 --> 01:56:19,340
While the team members are trustworthy,

2582
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:21,779
you and I should keep
our final strategy...

2583
01:56:21,779 --> 01:56:23,409
- a secret.
- Okay.

2584
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:24,449
You should do that.

2585
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,250
The thing is,

2586
01:56:28,189 --> 01:56:30,050
Yurisa has a chance.

2587
01:56:30,619 --> 01:56:32,460
Xitsuh also has a chance.

2588
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:35,229
First place?

2589
01:56:36,229 --> 01:56:39,500
They could get lucky and win six points.

2590
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:41,770
There's that possibility.

2591
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,840
So we should include Yurisa and Xitsuh.

2592
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,170
- Right. Yurisa and Xitsuh.
- We'll take the initiative, but...

2593
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:49,510
If we go with two white key notes,

2594
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:52,409
- they can go with two black key notes.
- That's an idea.

2595
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:54,850
This is so hard.

2596
01:56:56,779 --> 01:56:58,579
- Jin Ho, can I have a moment?
- Me?

2597
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:02,149
- You didn't sit out today, did you?
- Today?

2598
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:04,260
I did something toward the end.

2599
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:06,520
- Let's go together.
- What?

2600
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,130
- Let's go together.
- Where?

2601
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:10,960
It depends on what your strategy is.

2602
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,770
Pani Bottle said,

2603
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:18,600
"The bottom two members will come
from our team anyway."

2604
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:22,439
Hyun Seo and I will definitely go
to the Deathmatch.

2605
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:24,210
Then I don't need the Immunity Pass.

2606
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:25,680
I won't vote anyway.

2607
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:27,909
Getting first place is possible.

2608
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:29,380
- It's possible if we mute the notes well.
- Yes.

2609
01:57:29,649 --> 01:57:32,350
Saving the bottom player is
out of the picture, right?

2610
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:34,390
- Tell us honestly.
- Statistically speaking, yes.

2611
01:57:35,189 --> 01:57:37,390
- I...
- Getting first place is important.

2612
01:57:37,819 --> 01:57:40,220
He said that getting first place was
more important.

2613
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,460
Yes. That's the team motto.

2614
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:44,529
Yes. That's how it is.

2615
01:57:44,729 --> 01:57:47,199
If two bottom players come from your team,

2616
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:48,829
I won't need the Immunity Pass.

2617
01:57:48,829 --> 01:57:50,539
- I won't need it.
- That's right.

2618
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,869
So can I choose the same cards as you?

2619
01:57:53,569 --> 01:57:54,609
- You and I?
- Yes.

2620
01:57:55,609 --> 01:57:57,710
- You want to raise your points.
- Yes.

2621
01:57:57,810 --> 01:57:58,840
- You can do that.
- I won't have the Immunity Pass.

2622
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:01,050
After all, anything can happen.

2623
01:58:01,149 --> 01:58:03,310
- I might end up placing last.
- Right.

2624
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:05,250
- You're nervous since you have 11 points.
- Yes.

2625
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:07,149
I can talk to the team about it.

2626
01:58:07,149 --> 01:58:08,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

2627
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:09,819
Let's go inside.

2628
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:12,189
I had to avoid placing last.

2629
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:15,489
I thought, "How can I play effectively..."

2630
01:58:15,489 --> 01:58:17,090
"to avoid placing last?"

2631
01:58:17,329 --> 01:58:18,729
So...

2632
01:58:18,859 --> 01:58:21,729
it was Team Paradise's goal
to make a first-place winner.

2633
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,000
Thus, they needed my coins.

2634
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:26,739
They promised not to vote for me...

2635
01:58:26,739 --> 01:58:28,270
if I joined the alliance.

2636
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:29,770
That was how the deal came to be.

2637
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:32,310
He'll join the alliance
and give us 20 coins...

2638
01:58:32,539 --> 01:58:34,750
so that he can win more points.

2639
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:38,119
I thought it was totally acceptable.

2640
01:58:38,119 --> 01:58:40,489
I agreed to the deal, okay?

2641
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:42,189
The four key members.

2642
01:58:44,819 --> 01:58:48,560
(The 1st-place candidates sit separately.)

2643
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:51,600
Xitsuh and Yurisa, come over here.

2644
01:58:56,970 --> 01:58:58,239
These ones come out the most often.

2645
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:01,409
- Do, ti, and la?
- No, not those.

2646
01:59:02,539 --> 01:59:04,380
Do sharp comes out very often.

2647
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:06,180
We should gamble.

2648
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,250
Let's go with do sharp and mi.

2649
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:12,220
Won't they go with re sharp and sol sharp?

2650
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:14,319
They might do that.

2651
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:17,659
But we can't guarantee that.

2652
01:59:18,989 --> 01:59:22,989
They have four people who have
a higher score...

2653
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:24,630
than us.

2654
01:59:24,729 --> 01:59:28,300
They might split
all the sharps between them.

2655
01:59:29,329 --> 01:59:31,239
That's why I want to avoid the sharp.

2656
01:59:32,069 --> 01:59:33,840
But the notes will overlap.
We can't prevent everything.

2657
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,279
You think it's a good idea
to include a sharp, right?

2658
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:38,340
Yes.

2659
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:42,510
We're trying to leave out
re sharp and sol sharp.

2660
01:59:42,949 --> 01:59:46,149
We can include them.
We just need to leave one out.

2661
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:51,989
Shall we go with statistics?

2662
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:55,689
You and Yurisa should go
with the same ones.

2663
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:57,829
Yurisa, Chungju-Man, and I...

2664
01:59:57,829 --> 01:59:59,100
will go with the same ones.

2665
02:00:01,699 --> 02:00:02,899
I'm sorry for coming late.

2666
02:00:04,369 --> 02:00:05,369
I see.

2667
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:08,770
Pani Bottle, please choose two cards.

2668
02:00:09,739 --> 02:00:12,539
(Jang Dong Min chooses the notes last.)

2669
02:00:12,739 --> 02:00:13,739
Good?

2670
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:21,550
(He begins to fold the cards.)

2671
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:24,960
I can ruin all the cards, right?

2672
02:00:29,689 --> 02:00:30,859
This is the last round.

2673
02:00:30,859 --> 02:00:31,859
(He gets rid of the marks.)

2674
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:33,460
You guys started it.

2675
02:00:36,899 --> 02:00:38,539
I thought they were fools,

2676
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:40,810
but they marked the cards somewhat.

2677
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,539
I thought they were stupid.

2678
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:48,949
All right.

2679
02:00:49,479 --> 02:00:50,579
I've done enough.

2680
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,020
I'll get going now.

2681
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:57,920
I apologize for taking your time.

2682
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:04,960
One, two, three, four.

2683
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,930
This is fa. Okay.

2684
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:10,430
We marked the cards...

2685
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:12,699
after figuring out which was which.

2686
02:01:12,869 --> 02:01:15,409
But the oldies' team went in there
and ripped up the cards.

2687
02:01:15,539 --> 02:01:17,680
When I went in there,
I could recognize some cards.

2688
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:19,479
I had the drawing skills...

2689
02:01:19,479 --> 02:01:20,479
since I majored in art.

2690
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:21,810
So I drew them as closely as possible.

2691
02:01:22,279 --> 02:01:23,279
In your next life,

2692
02:01:24,279 --> 02:01:26,350
don't enter a survival show like this.

2693
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:29,090
Go to a rich family...

2694
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:31,619
(To the cards)

2695
02:01:31,619 --> 02:01:32,689
and have a good life.

2696
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,029
(Torn with a white side)

2697
02:01:39,930 --> 02:01:41,630
This one is do. Then...

2698
02:01:41,970 --> 02:01:43,029
I need fa and la.

2699
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,609
My goodness.

2700
02:01:47,609 --> 02:01:48,609
(Pani Bottle chose fa sharp and la.)

2701
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,710
I miscalculated it.

2702
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:53,039
It's too bad. I was so close.

2703
02:01:53,539 --> 02:01:54,550
What do you mean?

2704
02:01:55,409 --> 02:01:57,079
They turned the cards into rags.

2705
02:01:57,979 --> 02:01:59,250
I drew them as closely as possible.

2706
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:01,819
I did my best.

2707
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:03,989
I'll tell you the ones we know for sure.

2708
02:02:03,989 --> 02:02:05,619
You can tell them apart.

2709
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,460
The card is ripped in this shape.
Fa sharp.

2710
02:02:08,689 --> 02:02:11,199
Hold on. Which one is the ripped part?

2711
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:13,329
This part is white.

2712
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:14,699
- Is it the ripped part?
- Yes.

2713
02:02:14,699 --> 02:02:16,569
Hold on. Are you saying
that only this shape remains?

2714
02:02:16,569 --> 02:02:18,899
- Yes.
- For goodness' sake.

2715
02:02:19,369 --> 02:02:20,369
They're doing all sorts of things.

2716
02:02:20,369 --> 02:02:22,039
You can choose the cards
by looking at this part.

2717
02:02:22,039 --> 02:02:24,779
This is the white part. This is fa sharp.
Thus, this is la.

2718
02:02:24,779 --> 02:02:27,579
This is a mark I use when I sign things.

2719
02:02:27,579 --> 02:02:28,750
- I put it there.
- This one?

2720
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,449
No, the smiley face.

2721
02:02:30,449 --> 02:02:31,449
(Pani Bottle marked the cards.)

2722
02:02:31,449 --> 02:02:32,779
We can choose by looking at this.

2723
02:02:32,779 --> 02:02:34,720
- Let's take this.
- Let's go as a group with this notebook.

2724
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:37,720
I'll go first since I have the notebook.

2725
02:02:43,329 --> 02:02:44,329
My goodness.

2726
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:48,369
Hong Jin Ho, please pick two cards.

2727
02:02:48,369 --> 02:02:49,369
Okay.

2728
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:51,739
The cards were in tatters.

2729
02:02:51,739 --> 02:02:53,770
The back of the cards...

2730
02:02:54,069 --> 02:02:56,270
looked like a map...

2731
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:58,180
since 30 percent, not even 50 percent,
was remaining.

2732
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:01,250
We were fortunate to have Pani Bottle.

2733
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:02,649
Although the cards were ripped,

2734
02:03:02,649 --> 02:03:04,579
he drew them with incredible details.

2735
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:07,789
(Hong Jin Ho chose fa sharp and la.)

2736
02:03:07,789 --> 02:03:09,050
So we identified all the cards in the end.

2737
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:13,090
(Chungju-Man chose fa sharp and la.)

2738
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,229
(Xitsuh chose do sharp and mi.)

2739
02:03:20,899 --> 02:03:23,529
(Steve Yea chose do sharp and mi.)

2740
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:28,069
(Choi Hye Seon chose fa sharp and la.)

2741
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:32,239
(Lim Hyun Seo chose
fa sharp and la sharp.)

2742
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:36,750
(Joo Eon Kyu chose sol and la sharp.)

2743
02:03:36,949 --> 02:03:38,119
How's the atmosphere there?

2744
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,220
Everyone is a chess piece.

2745
02:03:41,619 --> 02:03:43,319
Dong Min chooses everything.

2746
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,890
Are you ready for the Deathmatch?

2747
02:03:45,819 --> 02:03:47,529
I'll send you there with my own hands.

2748
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,489
Spare me.

2749
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:55,729
The notes have been chosen
for Round Seven.

2750
02:03:56,199 --> 02:03:58,039
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2751
02:04:00,810 --> 02:04:03,039
The song for Round Seven will be revealed.

2752
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:06,840
(Round 7: "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star")

2753
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,010
I didn't think of this song.

2754
02:04:11,949 --> 02:04:14,819
The song for Round Seven is
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

2755
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:16,390
(Round 7: "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star")

2756
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:17,449
The original key is C,

2757
02:04:17,890 --> 02:04:23,130
do, re, mi, fa, sol, and la.

2758
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:26,060
Come on. Those are all the notes.

2759
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:27,829
Are all of us supposed to win points?

2760
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:29,829
Move.

2761
02:04:35,310 --> 02:04:37,170
For goodness' sake.

2762
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:39,010
There are too many notes.

2763
02:04:41,909 --> 02:04:42,909
Here's the thing.

2764
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:47,789
We're behind by one point again.

2765
02:04:48,289 --> 02:04:50,090
This isn't really good, is it?

2766
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:54,529
Here's the bright side.

2767
02:04:55,529 --> 02:04:57,699
In any case, they don't have many coins.

2768
02:04:58,229 --> 02:04:59,260
They can't use more than this.

2769
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:00,260
(Jin Ho thinks Jang Dong Min Alliance
used up the coins.)

2770
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:02,329
They can't use more than this.
Then the key will be D.

2771
02:05:02,729 --> 02:05:04,939
If the key is D, only fa has a sharp.

2772
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,239
If they took after the sharp notes,

2773
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:08,810
they'd be in bigger trouble.

2774
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:11,840
- That's right.
- We can look forward to that.

2775
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:13,739
(Hong Jin Ho and Steve Yea are
only 1 point behind.)

2776
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:16,979
The most dangerous ones are
Jin Ho and Steve.

2777
02:05:16,979 --> 02:05:17,979
That's right.

2778
02:05:17,979 --> 02:05:19,920
If we use 20 coins,

2779
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:21,819
we'll end up here.

2780
02:05:21,819 --> 02:05:22,850
That's right.

2781
02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:26,760
Then we have this one, this one, this one,

2782
02:05:26,890 --> 02:05:27,960
and this one.

2783
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:31,130
Let's say they mute sol sharp.

2784
02:05:31,729 --> 02:05:32,930
Then these notes will remain.

2785
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:35,529
If they mute la sharp,
these notes will remain.

2786
02:05:35,529 --> 02:05:36,970
- Yes.
- If they mute do sharp,

2787
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:38,000
these notes remain.

2788
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
(If do sharp gets muted,
MJ Kim will win 4 points.)

2789
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,670
- It's perfect.
- Seriously.

2790
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:41,670
It's beautiful.

2791
02:05:42,609 --> 02:05:44,239
- It's beautiful.
- We planned perfectly.

2792
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:45,439
We can't lose.

2793
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:48,350
They can't stop 20 coins either.

2794
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:50,409
That's right. We're bound to win.

2795
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:52,819
For goodness' sake.

2796
02:05:58,289 --> 02:05:59,289
Coins.

2797
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:01,590
Here are 20 coins.

2798
02:06:03,029 --> 02:06:06,699
(Betting 20 coins to change the key
from C to G sharp)

2799
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:11,340
(Sighing)

2800
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,340
I'm exhausted.

2801
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:16,310
- Jin Ho wants to go with D.
- D?

2802
02:06:16,569 --> 02:06:18,609
If they don't have enough coins...

2803
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:19,810
They're going with sharp.

2804
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:21,479
I'm certain they chose
a combination of sharp notes...

2805
02:06:21,479 --> 02:06:23,149
for two members each...

2806
02:06:23,579 --> 02:06:25,479
since we're bound to have a sharp note.

2807
02:06:25,979 --> 02:06:27,819
Then the ones with that sharp note...

2808
02:06:27,819 --> 02:06:30,289
- They'll win points.
- Yes. I think that's the strategy.

2809
02:06:30,819 --> 02:06:32,659
Then the best we can do...

2810
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:34,529
is betting 14 coins.

2811
02:06:34,529 --> 02:06:35,930
I agree. They must've bet...

2812
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:37,329
on the sharp notes.

2813
02:06:37,699 --> 02:06:39,229
Dong Min will try to make
a winning move...

2814
02:06:39,229 --> 02:06:40,399
in Round Seven.

2815
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:44,739
(Dong Min passes by.)

2816
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:46,539
Hide.

2817
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:51,210
Did he leave?

2818
02:06:51,579 --> 02:06:52,680
- Yes.
- Did he leave?

2819
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:53,680
Yes.

2820
02:06:57,279 --> 02:06:59,119
Seeing as how they're coming up,
they must be done.

2821
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:00,180
Shall we hurry up and do it?

2822
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,819
Time is passing.

2823
02:07:02,189 --> 02:07:03,220
Let's go.

2824
02:07:04,819 --> 02:07:07,060
We have to win this round. Please.

2825
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,529
The betting is closed.

2826
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:13,029
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2827
02:07:14,699 --> 02:07:17,069
The song for Round Seven will be played.

2828
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:28,979
The song for Round Seven,
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"

2829
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:31,579
was transposed to the key of G sharp.

2830
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:36,449
Sol sharp, la sharp, and re sharp...

2831
02:07:36,449 --> 02:07:38,020
were muted.

2832
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:47,630
- Can multiple notes be muted?
- Mute Token...

2833
02:07:48,329 --> 02:07:50,670
- What?
- I thought only one note could be muted.

2834
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:54,539
Can multiple notes be muted?

2835
02:07:54,539 --> 02:07:55,840
- Yes.
- You can mute multiple notes...

2836
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:56,840
by using the same number of coins.

2837
02:07:58,010 --> 02:07:59,109
- Really?
- Yes.

2838
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:01,949
You must've failed to study the rules.

2839
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:09,420
To be honest,

2840
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:13,289
when you're on a survival show
like this one,

2841
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,390
you can get hung up on one thing.

2842
02:08:15,989 --> 02:08:17,489
Then you fail to do other things...

2843
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:18,600
because your vision is clouded.

2844
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:21,130
Each member had one chance
to mute a note...

2845
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,930
and we were using many coins...

2846
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,939
to mute a note.

2847
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,970
So we let our guards down
and mistakenly thought...

2848
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:29,239
that such an event wouldn't happen.

2849
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,510
(Hong Jin Ho Alliance
thought about betting 14 coins.)

2850
02:08:36,750 --> 02:08:38,350
This method works
if they have less than 20 coins.

2851
02:08:38,779 --> 02:08:40,119
Is there a chance of them having
less than 20 coins?

2852
02:08:40,619 --> 02:08:42,689
Judging by Dong Min's personality,
there's a chance he stashed the coins...

2853
02:08:42,689 --> 02:08:45,260
for the last rounds.
Rounds 7 and 8 remain.

2854
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:47,829
Let's think that they'll use 20 coins...

2855
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:52,359
and mute three sharp notes.

2856
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:55,670
Let's mute sol sharp, la sharp,
and re sharp...

2857
02:08:55,829 --> 02:08:56,930
so that only do sharp will remain.

2858
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:59,470
Muting multiple notes is...

2859
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:01,970
a strategy they haven't thought about...

2860
02:09:01,970 --> 02:09:03,909
- or worried about until now.
- Right.

2861
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:07,380
- We haven't used it once.
- No.

2862
02:09:07,539 --> 02:09:08,609
Thus...

2863
02:09:08,779 --> 02:09:11,079
We purposefully didn't use
that strategy...

2864
02:09:11,319 --> 02:09:12,579
until Round 7 or Round 8.

2865
02:09:12,579 --> 02:09:14,220
Had we used the strategy,

2866
02:09:14,949 --> 02:09:16,189
the other team could've copied us.

2867
02:09:16,189 --> 02:09:18,119
We saved up on it
in order to prevent that.

2868
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:20,659
If you bet the same number of coins,

2869
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:22,430
we can mute multiple notes.

2870
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:24,529
The latter rounds yield more points.

2871
02:09:24,659 --> 02:09:26,760
We can use the Mute Tokens toward the end.

2872
02:09:27,029 --> 02:09:29,199
We can use multiple Mute Tokens...

2873
02:09:29,369 --> 02:09:30,729
as long as we use
the same number of coins.

2874
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,569
Three, four...

2875
02:09:32,569 --> 02:09:34,100
Then we can mute all the notes
except for mine.

2876
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:37,210
We muted the important sharp notes.

2877
02:09:38,609 --> 02:09:42,710
(Using 1 coin each, they muted...)

2878
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:45,520
(sol sharp, la sharp,)

2879
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,449
(and re sharp.)

2880
02:09:47,449 --> 02:09:51,159
It was our strategy
to win points in other ways.

2881
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:54,960
We used that strategy in Round Seven.

2882
02:09:54,989 --> 02:09:58,600
The players with do, do sharp, and fa...

2883
02:09:58,600 --> 02:09:59,930
are to obtain points.

2884
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:01,970
(Round 7:
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," G sharp)

2885
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:05,899
The first-place players are Jang Dong Min,
Heo Seong Beom with 19 points.

2886
02:10:05,899 --> 02:10:08,239
Steve Yea has 18 points.

2887
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:11,979
Now, Round Eight will begin.

2888
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:13,279
(Round 8 of Seven Note begins.)

2889
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:16,479
The song for Round Eight will be revealed.

2890
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:24,619
(Round 8: "Baby Shark")

2891
02:10:29,159 --> 02:10:33,130
The song for Round Eight is "Baby Shark."

2892
02:10:34,229 --> 02:10:35,300
The original key is B,

2893
02:10:35,699 --> 02:10:39,439
si, do sharp, re sharp, and mi.

2894
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:41,439
(Round 8: "Baby Shark")

2895
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:45,109
Xitsuh also has do sharp.

2896
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:47,539
- Yes.
- Xitsuh.

2897
02:10:50,579 --> 02:10:51,579
This is fun.

2898
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:56,020
Players who want to change the key,

2899
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:59,159
Please enter the voting room
and bet coins.

2900
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:06,500
(Candidate 1 in the lowest rank
enters the room as soon as it begins.)

2901
02:11:07,699 --> 02:11:09,729
I don't have any coins anyway.

2902
02:11:10,069 --> 02:11:11,239
So I'll just leave.

2903
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:12,500
I'll get going.

2904
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:14,170
(He leaves immediately.)

2905
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:17,140
(Candidate 2 in the lowest rank
enters the room as soon as it begins.)

2906
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:19,739
Will you place a bet?

2907
02:11:19,739 --> 02:11:21,210
(He also leaves immediately.)

2908
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:24,250
We have absolutely no luck
when it comes to arrangements, right?

2909
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:26,850
Why do you not have any of these?

2910
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:32,859
(They should earn points while keeping
Dong Min and Seong Beom in check.)

2911
02:11:33,289 --> 02:11:36,229
MJ is the only one
who didn't get do sharp.

2912
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:40,300
MJ isn't the problem.

2913
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:41,970
We don't know...

2914
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:44,770
what other sharp notes the other three
have other than do sharp.

2915
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:47,170
Both teams have do sharp.

2916
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:49,109
- Don't we have to go for mi then?
- Yes.

2917
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:51,380
Then actually,

2918
02:11:51,810 --> 02:11:54,510
it'd be either 17 or 15.

2919
02:11:54,539 --> 02:11:56,510
But 17 has two sharp tones.

2920
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:58,020
(Fa sharp and sol sharp)

2921
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,050
(If the sharp note Dong Min Alliance has
is played, they can't turn the tables.)

2922
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:01,750
But they... Oh, you're right.

2923
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,350
We can't choose the one
with two sharp notes.

2924
02:12:05,489 --> 02:12:06,989
We should choose the one
with one sharp note.

2925
02:12:06,989 --> 02:12:08,430
We can't mute the note, can we?

2926
02:12:08,529 --> 02:12:10,659
Can any of us mute the note?

2927
02:12:10,859 --> 02:12:11,859
Among us?

2928
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,960
- Did you mute any notes earlier?
- Well...

2929
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,800
None of us can mute the note now.

2930
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,430
- Not at all?
- We already did it earlier.

2931
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:18,800
We can only attack now.

2932
02:12:19,699 --> 02:12:22,770
Then 13 is the only one we can choose.

2933
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:24,010
(It's best to choose the one
without any sharp notes.)

2934
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:26,079
The only thing we can choose is 13.

2935
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:28,680
- Because we can't have sharp notes?
- The one without any sharp notes.

2936
02:12:28,750 --> 02:12:32,420
And we should hope
they have less than 13 coins.

2937
02:12:33,449 --> 02:12:35,250
Come to think of it,
they can defend by muting the note.

2938
02:12:35,289 --> 02:12:36,720
They didn't know
they could defend that way.

2939
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,890
But it doesn't matter...

2940
02:12:39,489 --> 02:12:42,329
- because they don't know what we have.
- Because they don't know what we have?

2941
02:12:43,789 --> 02:12:46,529
They used 20 coins this time, right?

2942
02:12:46,829 --> 02:12:47,859
Yes.

2943
02:12:48,199 --> 02:12:49,270
Come here.

2944
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:51,340
This is an emergency.

2945
02:12:53,399 --> 02:12:55,609
We don't have money.

2946
02:12:55,609 --> 02:12:57,939
And they muted the notes three times
this time.

2947
02:12:58,210 --> 02:12:59,210
But I don't know...

2948
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:00,439
- how many coins they used.
- Right.

2949
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:03,909
If they spend more coins...

2950
02:13:03,909 --> 02:13:04,920
- Right.
- Yes.

2951
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:07,220
- They might spend more coins.
- How many coins do they have?

2952
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:09,090
- That's what I'm saying.
- They'll go all-in anyway.

2953
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,090
What we can hope...

2954
02:13:11,789 --> 02:13:13,619
is they have less than 13 coins.

2955
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:14,659
Right.

2956
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:16,590
Yes.

2957
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:19,829
While Jang Dong Min and Heo Seong Beom
who have two sharp notes...

2958
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:21,770
should transpose the song to the key
with a sharp note...

2959
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:24,800
to take first place safely,

2960
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:28,640
Steve Yea has both do sharp and mi,

2961
02:13:28,739 --> 02:13:31,710
so he can turn the tables
by transposing the song to the C key...

2962
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,640
that doesn't have any sharp notes.

2963
02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:38,319
(The final betting that will decide
the result has begun.)

2964
02:13:38,579 --> 02:13:39,949
I won't place a bet.

2965
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:42,250
- I won't place a bet.
- I won't place a bet.

2966
02:13:42,250 --> 02:13:45,789
(Those who already went all-in
enter the room in turn.)

2967
02:13:46,689 --> 02:13:48,289
I won't do anything.

2968
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:49,460
I don't have any coins.

2969
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:51,130
I want to place a bet,
but I don't have anything.

2970
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,600
Yes.

2971
02:13:55,229 --> 02:13:56,270
I don't have anything.

2972
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:57,829
There's nothing I can do.

2973
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:02,609
(The players who can't do anything
are upset.)

2974
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:05,779
Chungju-Man, will you place a bet?

2975
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:15,989
I'll go all-in.

2976
02:14:15,989 --> 02:14:17,189
Will you place a bet?

2977
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:18,760
No, I won't.

2978
02:14:18,989 --> 02:14:21,289
(Picking up)

2979
02:14:21,319 --> 02:14:23,329
(Picking up)

2980
02:14:28,229 --> 02:14:30,399
Heo Seong Beom, will you place a bet?

2981
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:32,069
Yes. Give me a moment, please.

2982
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:36,640
There are no other possibilities.
This is the only possibility.

2983
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:49,619
Joo Eon Kyu, will you place a bet?

2984
02:14:49,619 --> 02:14:50,649
Yes.

2985
02:14:57,659 --> 02:14:59,359
The betting is closed.

2986
02:15:00,029 --> 02:15:02,229
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2987
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:06,770
What will happen to us?

2988
02:15:08,739 --> 02:15:10,939
The winner
of today's Money Challenge is...

2989
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:14,779
Are they announcing the winner right away?

2990
02:15:15,649 --> 02:15:17,850
I kept praying.

2991
02:15:18,079 --> 02:15:19,279
We put our heads together...

2992
02:15:19,479 --> 02:15:21,350
and thought of as many possibilities
as we could,

2993
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:22,550
considering the coins we currently have,

2994
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:24,750
the actions we can take,

2995
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,319
and our plans.

2996
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:28,489
We thought it was the best thing
we could do for now.

2997
02:15:33,159 --> 02:15:34,430
Why are they dragging it so much?

2998
02:15:36,529 --> 02:15:38,439
Everyone played their best.

2999
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:42,640
I tried to think about every possibility.

3000
02:15:42,810 --> 02:15:47,579
I think we have come this far...

3001
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:50,649
as everything we prepared
has stacked up well 1 by 1.

3002
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:53,649
Why are they dragging it so much?

3003
02:15:55,390 --> 02:15:57,489
The winner
of today's Money Challenge is...

3004
02:15:58,149 --> 02:16:00,159
Heo Seong Beom.

3005
02:16:11,369 --> 02:16:14,140
It was an extremely disappointing moment.

3006
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:16,310
I wasn't even watching, I just listened.

3007
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:18,109
I was waiting to hear "S,"

3008
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:21,279
but he said, "Heo Seong Beom" in the end.

3009
02:16:23,109 --> 02:16:25,979
(Sighing)

3010
02:16:26,119 --> 02:16:27,220
We're doomed.

3011
02:16:27,649 --> 02:16:28,789
I should go.

3012
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:31,289
(Round 8, "Baby Shark," C major,
Mi: Steve Yea, Xitsuh, Fa: Yurisa)

3013
02:16:31,390 --> 02:16:32,459
Here's the final ranking.

3014
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:35,159
Heo Seong Beom took 1st place
by earning 19 points.

3015
02:16:35,559 --> 02:16:39,299
Lim Hyun Seo and Pani Bottle
took last place by earning five points.

3016
02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:43,729
I almost fainted
when you muted three notes.

3017
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:45,440
- Seriously.
- You should've fainted.

3018
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:47,670
- "You should've fainted."
- "You should've fainted."

3019
02:16:48,569 --> 02:16:50,139
- You should've.
- This is crazy.

3020
02:16:51,409 --> 02:16:52,579
This is crazy.

3021
02:16:52,909 --> 02:16:55,280
The lowest-ranked player
in today's Money Challenge is...

3022
02:16:55,479 --> 02:16:57,209
This is so embarrassing.

3023
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:59,920
Pani Bottle...

3024
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,590
and Lim Hyun Seo.

3025
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:03,450
(14th place, Lim Hyun Seo)

3026
02:17:03,719 --> 02:17:05,059
Where is your arm sleeve?

3027
02:17:06,059 --> 02:17:07,290
I lost confidence.

3028
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:10,260
- You should intimidate others.
- I lost confidence.

3029
02:17:13,059 --> 02:17:14,299
I don't know.

3030
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,729
Heo Seong Beom,
the winner of the Money Challenge,

3031
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:21,170
please come to the voting room and receive
your personal funds of 20,000 dollars.

3032
02:17:21,639 --> 02:17:25,409
And choose one person
to be exempt from elimination with you.

3033
02:17:28,110 --> 02:17:31,579
After a long mind game,
our alliance has won.

3034
02:17:32,079 --> 02:17:34,180
Luckily, I took first place.

3035
02:17:36,489 --> 02:17:38,020
Today's key player.

3036
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,889
- Would you like to submit it?
- Yes.

3037
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:46,260
Heo Seong Beom,
the winner of the Money Challenge...

3038
02:17:46,559 --> 02:17:48,100
chose Yurisa...

3039
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:52,639
to be exempt from elimination.

3040
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:02,110
What? I was perplexed.

3041
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:13,090
I think he wrote it wrong.

3042
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:19,959
Well...

3043
02:18:21,329 --> 02:18:23,129
It must be a typo.

3044
02:18:30,239 --> 02:18:33,379
He chose Yurisa to be exempt
from elimination.

3045
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:39,319
Who made the biggest contribution
to winning this game?

3046
02:18:39,319 --> 02:18:40,379
It's Yurisa.

3047
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:43,020
It's right to choose her
to be exempt from elimination.

3048
02:18:59,870 --> 02:19:01,399
My goodness.

3049
02:19:01,569 --> 02:19:04,010
It was unbelievable. It was a masterpiece.

3050
02:19:04,209 --> 02:19:06,879
If it weren't for Yurisa,

3051
02:19:07,479 --> 02:19:09,079
we might've lost.

3052
02:19:09,409 --> 02:19:10,780
But...

3053
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:12,780
Yurisa...

3054
02:19:12,950 --> 02:19:14,879
carried the team...

3055
02:19:15,149 --> 02:19:17,520
perfectly today.

3056
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:23,629
(Last night)

3057
02:19:23,829 --> 02:19:27,799
You should interact with Team Paradise
on personal matters.

3058
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:29,530
On personal matters.

3059
02:19:29,670 --> 02:19:32,969
Then you should act as a spy for us.

3060
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:36,510
"It's nice to be on Team Remaining,"

3061
02:19:37,170 --> 02:19:39,579
"but I'm not sure
if it's the right thing."

3062
02:19:39,579 --> 02:19:41,809
"I can't even express my opinion..."

3063
02:19:42,209 --> 02:19:44,450
"because of Dong Min."

3064
02:19:44,709 --> 02:19:46,920
If you just say something like that,
Jin Ho will agree.

3065
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:48,319
You should use that.

3066
02:19:48,850 --> 02:19:51,190
"I don't think
I can work with them anymore."

3067
02:19:51,290 --> 02:19:52,620
Go and say something like that.

3068
02:19:53,719 --> 02:19:56,489
I've never played as a spy.
I was just suspected.

3069
02:19:56,590 --> 02:19:59,500
"What should I do to play as a spy?"

3070
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,360
I thought about it.

3071
02:20:01,559 --> 02:20:04,799
Right before talking to Jin Ho,

3072
02:20:04,969 --> 02:20:07,139
I was thinking hard...

3073
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:09,510
in the backyard by myself.

3074
02:20:10,409 --> 02:20:11,409
Let's say I cry.

3075
02:20:11,909 --> 02:20:14,340
(Thinking)

3076
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:15,709
How should I cry?

3077
02:20:18,049 --> 02:20:19,719
I couldn't organize my thoughts.

3078
02:20:19,879 --> 02:20:22,319
I was like, "Whatever."
And I went to Jin Ho.

3079
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:24,850
If you just take a more active stance,

3080
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:26,690
we would welcome you too, for sure.

3081
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:29,829
You should calm down first.

3082
02:20:30,889 --> 02:20:32,459
Calm down.

3083
02:20:32,629 --> 02:20:35,870
People always think I'm a spy...

3084
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,639
whether I do something or not.

3085
02:20:39,569 --> 02:20:41,500
As you can't even show what you can do
and are just swayed by others,

3086
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:43,709
you're frustrated with yourself.

3087
02:20:44,010 --> 02:20:46,840
It's a little irresponsible to say
you were just unlucky, but...

3088
02:20:49,809 --> 02:20:51,110
I could cry easily.

3089
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:52,780
"What's this?"

3090
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:54,950
"This is easier than I thought."

3091
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:56,790
The biggest reason I trusted her...

3092
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:58,559
was when she was crying her eyes out,

3093
02:20:58,559 --> 02:21:01,719
her nose was completely stuffed up.

3094
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:03,389
That's why I believed her.

3095
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:07,059
I believed what she said was true
because of her nose.

3096
02:21:07,329 --> 02:21:09,569
Is she crying? She's crying.

3097
02:21:11,569 --> 02:21:13,969
- Why?
- What's going on?

3098
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,239
Why is she crying?

3099
02:21:16,670 --> 02:21:18,309
She's crying so much.

3100
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:19,840
I don't think she's acting.

3101
02:21:22,409 --> 02:21:23,450
What is Jin Ho doing?

3102
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:26,549
- He's with Yurisa.
- Okay.

3103
02:21:29,549 --> 02:21:32,190
Gosh, I feel proud.

3104
02:21:33,219 --> 02:21:34,290
I'm proud of her.

3105
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:36,459
Yurisa.

3106
02:21:37,389 --> 02:21:38,489
I'm proud of you.

3107
02:21:41,059 --> 02:21:42,670
Come here.

3108
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:43,729
Excuse me for a moment. I'm sorry.

3109
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:48,770
It seemed...

3110
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:51,510
the atmosphere here wasn't good.

3111
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:53,780
So I came to tell you something.

3112
02:21:54,110 --> 02:21:55,549
Looking at her, it seems
things aren't going well for you either.

3113
02:21:55,610 --> 02:21:57,409
What? Why is it not going well?

3114
02:21:57,549 --> 02:21:59,879
- Yurisa.
- Why would it be bad?

3115
02:21:59,879 --> 02:22:01,620
It seems there's a problem. But anyway...

3116
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:04,649
Gosh, stop talking.

3117
02:22:04,989 --> 02:22:06,219
I got into the emotion.

3118
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,190
Come right now. My goodness.

3119
02:22:12,629 --> 02:22:13,799
Nice. Now,

3120
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:16,629
Yurisa started talking with Jin Ho
as we had planned.

3121
02:22:16,969 --> 02:22:18,969
If she successfully gets the information,

3122
02:22:19,399 --> 02:22:21,639
we'll know what they have.

3123
02:22:21,739 --> 02:22:24,069
We can spend a lot of coins...

3124
02:22:24,069 --> 02:22:25,069
in Round 7 and Round 8.

3125
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,940
I'll think about it.

3126
02:22:29,479 --> 02:22:30,780
- Calm down.
- Yes.

3127
02:22:41,459 --> 02:22:43,159
We're done talking. I'm joining them.

3128
02:22:44,389 --> 02:22:45,459
You cried.

3129
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:46,530
Why did you cry?

3130
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:47,760
- What?
- You acted, right?

3131
02:22:48,629 --> 02:22:49,729
This is crazy.

3132
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:53,770
When the strategy involves a spy,

3133
02:22:53,969 --> 02:22:55,670
you shouldn't try to succeed in one go.

3134
02:22:55,770 --> 02:22:56,969
You need to preheat it.

3135
02:22:57,809 --> 02:22:59,479
Start the engine and preheat it.

3136
02:23:01,809 --> 02:23:02,909
Let's go.

3137
02:23:05,149 --> 02:23:06,750
- Let's go to the meeting.
- Yes.

3138
02:23:08,989 --> 02:23:12,489
You should do what you believe is right.

3139
02:23:12,489 --> 02:23:13,489
I...

3140
02:23:13,659 --> 02:23:14,790
Me? All of a sudden?

3141
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:16,790
(No)

3142
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:18,360
(They're listening outside.)

3143
02:23:24,329 --> 02:23:25,969
You should go and play comfortably.

3144
02:23:29,239 --> 02:23:30,239
When you go,

3145
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,239
you can tell them...

3146
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:36,180
- we got these notes.
- Okay.

3147
02:23:36,409 --> 02:23:38,379
Because they have either of these.

3148
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:40,350
(Steve Yea suspected Yurisa.)

3149
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:41,520
There's a zero possibility
that she's a spy.

3150
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:43,590
You become weak when women cry.

3151
02:23:43,590 --> 02:23:45,090
I can't trust...

3152
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:46,489
Yurisa 100 percent.

3153
02:23:46,489 --> 02:23:48,590
I had to suspect her.

3154
02:23:48,729 --> 02:23:51,530
I couldn't help but suspect her
under those circumstances.

3155
02:23:51,530 --> 02:23:53,000
I thought we should think...

3156
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,200
she might be a spy.

3157
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:56,399
(After the result of Round 7
was announced)

3158
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:57,469
I should go in advance.

3159
02:23:57,569 --> 02:23:58,969
- Hey.
- Because there's nothing to use anyway?

3160
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,540
- You know what?
- What?

3161
02:24:04,309 --> 02:24:06,280
- Why?
- Yurisa picked something else.

3162
02:24:08,610 --> 02:24:09,680
The score was announced.

3163
02:24:09,979 --> 02:24:12,479
So we knew who placed a bet on what.

3164
02:24:12,479 --> 02:24:14,049
We knew which card we chose.

3165
02:24:15,049 --> 02:24:16,620
But Yurisa's score was different
from ours.

3166
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:18,049
It means she chose a different card.

3167
02:24:18,049 --> 02:24:19,459
Yurisa wrote something else.

3168
02:24:19,790 --> 02:24:20,959
She wrote something else? I had no idea.

3169
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:24,190
(Steve Yea strongly suspected Yurisa.)

3170
02:24:24,190 --> 02:24:25,600
I told Jin Ho.

3171
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:27,159
Why is he not saying anything?

3172
02:24:27,399 --> 02:24:29,569
He said the overall result
wouldn't be affected.

3173
02:24:29,569 --> 02:24:31,229
But it doesn't make sense. What's this?

3174
02:24:33,139 --> 02:24:34,200
Does it matter?

3175
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,540
It doesn't bother me at all.

3176
02:24:35,909 --> 02:24:38,510
It's weird she wrote something else.

3177
02:24:40,979 --> 02:24:44,510
Darn it. My gosh.

3178
02:24:45,209 --> 02:24:47,780
There are circumstances
that raise suspicion.

3179
02:24:47,979 --> 02:24:49,350
You can't explain every single thing.

3180
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:50,889
I should just trust her.

3181
02:24:50,889 --> 02:24:52,489
Jin Ho usually...

3182
02:24:52,489 --> 02:24:54,290
trust people.

3183
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:56,829
When someone appeals to emotions,

3184
02:24:57,729 --> 02:25:00,100
he trusts them even more. The key is...

3185
02:25:00,299 --> 02:25:01,729
we don't know...

3186
02:25:01,729 --> 02:25:04,069
how Xitsuh or Chungju-Man will react.

3187
02:25:04,729 --> 02:25:07,069
What were you supposed to choose?

3188
02:25:07,069 --> 02:25:09,469
I was supposed to pick do sharp,

3189
02:25:09,469 --> 02:25:10,540
but I chose do.

3190
02:25:11,969 --> 02:25:14,079
You should've told me. Why didn't you say
you pick the wrong one?

3191
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:16,309
- When I chose it...
- Yes.

3192
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:18,409
and flipped it, I saw "do."

3193
02:25:18,409 --> 02:25:20,520
So I thought I picked do sharp...

3194
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,020
and went with it.

3195
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:23,950
I told Xitsuh...

3196
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:25,090
the same thing I told Jin Ho.

3197
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:26,860
I told him the same lie.

3198
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:29,229
Whenever I did something,

3199
02:25:29,629 --> 02:25:31,290
people always suspected me.

3200
02:25:31,959 --> 02:25:33,159
Jin Ho said I could join you...

3201
02:25:33,159 --> 02:25:34,700
if I couldn't work with them anymore.

3202
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:37,100
But this happened as soon as I came.

3203
02:25:38,899 --> 02:25:40,340
It was your choice.

3204
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:41,540
We're not suspecting that you're a spy...

3205
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:42,709
or Dong Min sent you.

3206
02:25:42,969 --> 02:25:43,969
You made a decision.

3207
02:25:44,069 --> 02:25:45,209
Don't cry.

3208
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:48,739
- Hey.
- I shouldn't have asked.

3209
02:25:48,739 --> 02:25:50,350
Honestly,
I just followed Jin Ho's opinion...

3210
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:51,579
because he said it was okay.

3211
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:53,280
I can have doubts.

3212
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,690
Because he made his own judgment...

3213
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:56,850
even though I haven't talked to you
in person.

3214
02:25:57,549 --> 02:25:59,659
I won't play anymore in this round then.

3215
02:26:01,690 --> 02:26:03,260
You're suspecting me, so...

3216
02:26:04,159 --> 02:26:05,500
No. Just stick to me.

3217
02:26:05,959 --> 02:26:07,100
It doesn't matter.

3218
02:26:14,069 --> 02:26:15,239
Let me pop into the bathroom.

3219
02:26:24,579 --> 02:26:26,950
You need to find out
what cards they chose in Round Seven...

3220
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:28,079
no matter what it takes.

3221
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:30,389
The most important ones
are what Jin Ho and Steve chose.

3222
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:35,020
If you go just because you're told to
like a pushover...

3223
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,229
(She's getting ready to tell Gina
about the cards they chose in Round 7.)

3224
02:26:37,229 --> 02:26:38,690
- Let's keep an eye on it.
- I couldn't tear it...

3225
02:26:38,690 --> 02:26:40,129
and give the note to her in front of them.

3226
02:26:40,459 --> 02:26:42,829
So I wrote it
in the corner of the notebook...

3227
02:26:43,129 --> 02:26:44,430
and folded it into a small piece.

3228
02:26:44,430 --> 02:26:46,600
I was going to rip the small piece
to give it to her.

3229
02:26:51,870 --> 02:26:53,579
But I heard the sound of it tearing.

3230
02:26:53,579 --> 02:26:54,780
I could hear it.

3231
02:26:58,510 --> 02:27:00,780
I opened the water bottle
in front of me...

3232
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:02,350
and poured water into the cap.

3233
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:04,620
I was pouring it right in front of them,
but no one saw it.

3234
02:27:04,889 --> 02:27:06,860
I dipped my finger
into the water in the cap.

3235
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:09,659
Because you can tear paper quietly
when it's wet.

3236
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:12,129
So I tore a small piece of paper...

3237
02:27:12,129 --> 02:27:13,129
and rolled it.

3238
02:27:13,829 --> 02:27:15,159
I looked at Gina.

3239
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,600
- Is that lip balm?
- No, it's a lipstick.

3240
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,700
Can I borrow it?

3241
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:20,540
Keep talking. I'm sorry.

3242
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:22,909
I used the lipstick...

3243
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:25,979
and put it back into her pocket...

3244
02:27:25,979 --> 02:27:27,409
with the note.

3245
02:27:27,879 --> 02:27:30,049
They didn't notice it
when I did it right in front of them.

3246
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:37,190
(They check the cards Jin Ho and Steve
picked in Round 7 and Round 8.)

3247
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,120
The only case we'll lose...

3248
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,319
is when Steve earns points in both rounds.

3249
02:27:41,719 --> 02:27:43,430
But I don't have mi.

3250
02:27:43,430 --> 02:27:44,489
I only have do sharp.

3251
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:46,860
If I win with do sharp,
I'll earn 22 points in total.

3252
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:48,930
It means I should just stop Steve
from earning points.

3253
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:50,329
We should mute the note successfully.

3254
02:27:50,329 --> 02:27:51,329
If we can't mute mi...

3255
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:53,000
while Steve earns points with mi,
the game is over.

3256
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:55,340
No matter how many times
they transpose to another key,

3257
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:57,110
we'll win if we mute mi.

3258
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:00,040
The moment I saw the cards they chose,

3259
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:01,110
I calculated everything.

3260
02:28:01,409 --> 02:28:04,180
I thought we'd win no matter what...

3261
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:05,450
if we mute mi successfully.

3262
02:28:06,579 --> 02:28:09,219
We must mute mi.

3263
02:28:09,219 --> 02:28:10,549
But we don't have money.

3264
02:28:11,149 --> 02:28:12,889
Seong Beom has 13 coins.

3265
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:14,590
If we can't do it, we'll lose.

3266
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:16,459
- If we can't do it, we'll lose anyway.
- It's hopeless.

3267
02:28:17,059 --> 02:28:18,860
In the last round,

3268
02:28:19,030 --> 02:28:22,270
they had airtight security like the FBI.

3269
02:28:22,270 --> 02:28:23,700
We couldn't break in.

3270
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:28,040
Yurisa.

3271
02:28:28,639 --> 02:28:30,209
Can I borrow your pad?

3272
02:28:31,909 --> 02:28:32,909
Do you have one?

3273
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:44,819
They're suspecting me strongly.

3274
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:46,790
Just hold the pad like this.

3275
02:28:47,290 --> 02:28:48,920
- So that they can see it.
- Just throw away the note.

3276
02:28:49,229 --> 02:28:50,959
Mute mi.

3277
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:52,329
Okay.

3278
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,459
- Min A.
- Yes?

3279
02:28:55,229 --> 02:28:56,229
You startled me.

3280
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:59,469
I borrowed her pad for real.

3281
02:29:00,069 --> 02:29:02,100
I would've stopped you if not.

3282
02:29:02,239 --> 02:29:03,309
I told her to mute mi.

3283
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:06,110
Did you ask her how many coins were left?

3284
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:07,379
Xitsuh came in.

3285
02:29:08,479 --> 02:29:10,479
So it was the only thing I could tell her.

3286
02:29:10,479 --> 02:29:11,549
Okay. We did our best.

3287
02:29:11,549 --> 02:29:12,549
(They don't know
how many coins Yurisa has.)

3288
02:29:12,850 --> 02:29:14,579
Use 11 coins.

3289
02:29:16,090 --> 02:29:17,389
Please, Yurisa.

3290
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:28,969
I'll bet all the coins I have to mute mi.

3291
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:32,840
- I spent five coins to mute re sharp.
- Okay.

3292
02:29:33,739 --> 02:29:35,069
I'll mute it.

3293
02:29:35,709 --> 02:29:37,540
Yurisa, will you place a bet?

3294
02:29:41,309 --> 02:29:44,549
(Yurisa had all the coins.)

3295
02:29:47,350 --> 02:29:49,149
Actually, I was curious...

3296
02:29:49,989 --> 02:29:50,989
about the moment. I wanted to see...

3297
02:29:50,989 --> 02:29:52,559
how they will react.

3298
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,559
When it was announced, they were quiet.

3299
02:29:55,790 --> 02:29:57,690
Jin Ho figured it out at that moment...

3300
02:29:57,690 --> 02:29:59,299
and his eyes changed.

3301
02:29:59,629 --> 02:30:01,229
They were scary.

3302
02:30:01,229 --> 02:30:03,170
They suddenly became serious.

3303
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:09,709
I...

3304
02:30:10,270 --> 02:30:11,709
was ashamed of myself.

3305
02:30:14,079 --> 02:30:16,110
Honestly, I can applaud her.

3306
02:30:16,510 --> 02:30:17,649
It was an amazing play.

3307
02:30:17,649 --> 02:30:20,280
She cried so much.
If she could act like that,

3308
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:22,120
we should just let her deceive us.

3309
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:23,719
Because if it turns out
she isn't a spy later,

3310
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:25,549
then it'll make us...

3311
02:30:25,959 --> 02:30:27,819
the worst guys in the world.

3312
02:30:27,819 --> 02:30:29,889
She was already stressed out,
so it'll discourage her even more.

3313
02:30:31,989 --> 02:30:34,229
We could've blocked it completely,

3314
02:30:34,559 --> 02:30:35,729
but...

3315
02:30:36,569 --> 02:30:38,729
it's mostly my fault
that we couldn't do it.

3316
02:30:38,729 --> 02:30:42,670
It feels like we were caught off guard.

3317
02:30:42,770 --> 02:30:44,209
I...

3318
02:30:44,209 --> 02:30:45,440
wasn't sorry, to be honest.

3319
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:46,879
You're old enough...

3320
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:49,709
to tell when someone sheds fake tears.

3321
02:30:52,579 --> 02:30:53,579
I acknowledge her.

3322
02:30:53,950 --> 02:30:55,549
- If...
- It was amazing.

3323
02:30:56,719 --> 02:30:58,719
she could shed fake tears
and even let her nose run,

3324
02:30:58,719 --> 02:30:59,719
I acknowledge her for that.

3325
02:31:00,559 --> 02:31:01,989
I should acknowledge her effort.

3326
02:31:08,430 --> 02:31:12,100
"Did she really have to do it?"

3327
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:13,500
"Was there a reason she should do that?"

3328
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:15,170
There were moments I thought like that.

3329
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,340
(Dong Min was passing by
while they were discussing.)

3330
02:31:17,770 --> 02:31:18,770
Hide.

3331
02:31:19,879 --> 02:31:20,879
Is he gone?

3332
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:23,409
Those moments...

3333
02:31:23,409 --> 02:31:25,280
are like still images to us.

3334
02:31:25,549 --> 02:31:28,079
If she was really acting,

3335
02:31:28,579 --> 02:31:29,649
I should acknowledge her for that.

3336
02:31:43,229 --> 02:31:45,399
Pani Bottle and Lim Hyun Seo...

3337
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:49,139
who took last place
in the Money Challenge...

3338
02:31:49,969 --> 02:31:51,440
will become the elimination candidates
automatically...

3339
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:52,940
and go through a Deathmatch.

3340
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:57,110
Except Heo Seong Beom and Yurisa,

3341
02:31:58,209 --> 02:32:00,350
each of you should choose one person
to go up against in the Deathmatch...

3342
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:01,719
as an elimination candidate.

3343
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:04,250
Please enter the voting room...

3344
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:05,649
one at a time immediately.

3345
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:10,030
They're running to the room.

3346
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:21,739
Who do you think they picked?

3347
02:32:23,209 --> 02:32:24,239
I'm not sure.

3348
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:29,250
I will announce the result.

3349
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:32,649
Pani Bottle chose...

3350
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:40,120
Kim Min A.

3351
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,659
I knew that punk would choose me.

3352
02:32:42,090 --> 02:32:43,590
Pani took last place,

3353
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:45,360
so I thought my predictions were right.

3354
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:47,959
And he really picked me.

3355
02:32:48,329 --> 02:32:50,530
The player chosen by Lim Hyun Seo is...

3356
02:32:50,530 --> 02:32:52,569
- It's you.
- No way.

3357
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:54,840
Please don't do this to me.

3358
02:32:57,370 --> 02:32:59,639
Jang Dong Min.

3359
02:32:59,879 --> 02:33:02,209
- All right.
- They're so brave.

3360
02:33:03,379 --> 02:33:04,809
It's Dong Min without a doubt.

3361
02:33:06,549 --> 02:33:08,649
What should we do
to make Dong Min spend his money,

3362
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:10,590
so they'll spend their own money
to make the vote.

3363
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:15,459
If we select MJ,

3364
02:33:15,790 --> 02:33:17,459
Dong Min will probably volunteer to go.

3365
02:33:18,159 --> 02:33:20,860
If we select Min A or Gina,

3366
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:22,930
he'll be in a dilemma.

3367
02:33:23,129 --> 02:33:25,430
- Let's eliminate Kim Min A.
- Is it going to be Min A and Dong Min?

3368
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:27,399
I'll pick Min A, so you choose Dong Min.

3369
02:33:27,399 --> 02:33:28,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

3370
02:33:29,409 --> 02:33:30,639
Pani Bottle,

3371
02:33:30,909 --> 02:33:34,209
please select one player
you wish to go to the Deathmatch with.

3372
02:33:36,049 --> 02:33:37,110
This woman.

3373
02:33:38,049 --> 02:33:39,750
- Is that your final decision?
- Yes.

3374
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:40,780
(Lim Hyun Seo picked Jang Dong Min.)

3375
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:43,590
You have selected Jang Dong Min.

3376
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:46,120
When you're unsure, remember VJE.

3377
02:33:46,590 --> 02:33:48,489
When you're unsure,
vote for Jang Dong Min to be eliminated.

3378
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:51,129
I picked Jang Dong Min,
who is evaluated...

3379
02:33:51,430 --> 02:33:52,729
as the most powerful player.

3380
02:33:52,829 --> 02:33:54,530
It would be great if I won,

3381
02:33:54,559 --> 02:33:56,200
but even if I don't,
I got nothing to lose.

3382
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:59,399
I've wanted to go
against Dong MIn here in Bloody Game.

3383
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:01,399
I was planning to do that sooner,

3384
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:03,110
but I didn't get the chance to.

3385
02:34:03,469 --> 02:34:04,809
I think today's the day.

3386
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:05,870
I'll have to stand my ground.

3387
02:34:06,079 --> 02:34:08,540
I know there's a high chance
it won't work.

3388
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:10,879
If I go against him,

3389
02:34:10,979 --> 02:34:13,219
I could get hit by his arrow
and lose my life.

3390
02:34:13,379 --> 02:34:15,479
I'm actually more scared
of Kim Min A coming to us.

3391
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:17,920
If we vote for Kim Min A,
thinking she's a weak player...

3392
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:19,120
and end up losing,

3393
02:34:19,290 --> 02:34:20,389
I can't imagine doing that.

3394
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:21,819
We need to win to break even.

3395
02:34:21,819 --> 02:34:24,360
If we lose,
it's going to be so embarrassing.

3396
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:26,959
I'm hoping it's Dong Min.

3397
02:34:27,559 --> 02:34:29,670
I'm going to lose my mind
if it's Kim Min A.

3398
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:30,729
Oh, my gosh.

3399
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:31,870
All right.

3400
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:35,440
From now on, among the two candidates,

3401
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:37,540
Kim Min A and Jang Dong Min,

3402
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:40,409
select one player
to go straight to the Deathmatch...

3403
02:34:40,409 --> 02:34:41,879
and make your vote.

3404
02:34:43,049 --> 02:34:45,579
The voting ends an hour from now.

3405
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:54,120
(Voting starts now.)

3406
02:34:54,459 --> 02:34:56,889
- Let's hurry and get this over with.
- Gosh.

3407
02:34:56,889 --> 02:34:58,229
No, we need to talk.

3408
02:34:58,229 --> 02:34:59,500
You want to have a talk?

3409
02:35:03,930 --> 02:35:05,399
- Good job.
- What's there to talk about?

3410
02:35:06,739 --> 02:35:08,040
Darn it!

3411
02:35:08,639 --> 02:35:09,770
Gosh.

3412
02:35:09,770 --> 02:35:12,370
Hey, stop bringing the past up.
That annoys me.

3413
02:35:13,379 --> 02:35:15,040
It's not the past. I've mentioned this.

3414
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:16,780
You should've insisted back then,

3415
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:18,450
- you fool.
- No, I trusted you.

3416
02:35:18,450 --> 02:35:20,180
Then don't bring it up.

3417
02:35:25,319 --> 02:35:26,520
I'm annoyed, so don't talk to me.

3418
02:35:27,260 --> 02:35:30,159
If we made a decision together,
stop talking about it.

3419
02:35:32,159 --> 02:35:33,629
I wasn't in a good mood.

3420
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:35,600
It was Yurisa who caused it to happen,

3421
02:35:36,829 --> 02:35:38,469
so I was quite angry about it.

3422
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:41,700
I couldn't accept what happened...

3423
02:35:41,870 --> 02:35:45,510
because he didn't listen
to other people's opinions.

3424
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:48,309
Jin Ho just accepted it.

3425
02:35:48,510 --> 02:35:51,610
We lost because Yurisa was a spy.

3426
02:35:51,649 --> 02:35:54,020
It was irresponsible of him to say that.

3427
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:55,950
It was unacceptable to me.

3428
02:35:56,090 --> 02:35:58,950
We're voting for him nonetheless, right?

3429
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:00,659
We need to break his neck.

3430
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:03,090
Yes, the chieftain.

3431
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:05,489
But they have so much money.
What are we going to do now?

3432
02:36:06,459 --> 02:36:08,000
We can just let Min A leave.

3433
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,930
He might even volunteer
for the Deathmatch.

3434
02:36:10,530 --> 02:36:11,569
Who?

3435
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:12,940
Dong Min.

3436
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:14,770
- No, he won't.
- You mean Dong Min?

3437
02:36:14,870 --> 02:36:17,010
- He'd never do that.
- That's nonsense.

3438
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:19,680
He was the one
who planned out this whole thing to win.

3439
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:21,180
(Dong Min's team heads
to the pantry to talk.)

3440
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:22,540
I'm so tired.

3441
02:36:24,649 --> 02:36:26,780
- Great job, guys.
- Come on in.

3442
02:36:27,579 --> 02:36:29,049
Yurisa.

3443
02:36:29,049 --> 02:36:30,649
My gosh.

3444
02:36:31,250 --> 02:36:32,489
- Come on.
- Good job.

3445
02:36:32,489 --> 02:36:34,260
That was amazing. You did a great job.

3446
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:35,559
It was impressive.

3447
02:36:37,030 --> 02:36:38,559
Min A...

3448
02:36:39,329 --> 02:36:41,399
and Gina both did a great job today.

3449
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:42,770
As I've always said,

3450
02:36:43,469 --> 02:36:46,770
I'm not here
to just have a good experience.

3451
02:36:47,399 --> 02:36:48,899
We're all here because we have a goal.

3452
02:36:48,899 --> 02:36:50,309
This is just a process.

3453
02:36:50,670 --> 02:36:52,469
We didn't come up with any plans there.

3454
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:55,040
Something just didn't feel right.

3455
02:36:55,639 --> 02:36:58,149
I felt like the others wouldn't want...

3456
02:36:58,250 --> 02:37:00,780
to send Dong Min away.

3457
02:37:01,020 --> 02:37:03,750
So I thought I'd be chosen for this round.

3458
02:37:06,659 --> 02:37:08,190
I even thought...

3459
02:37:09,790 --> 02:37:12,559
of asking Chungju-Man and Xitsuh
to buy an extra ballot.

3460
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:14,159
That's what was on my mind.

3461
02:37:15,129 --> 02:37:17,500
It's about time we showed them...

3462
02:37:18,899 --> 02:37:21,340
that they can't mess with us.

3463
02:37:25,969 --> 02:37:28,940
Jin Ho was chosen in the beginning too.

3464
02:37:29,239 --> 02:37:31,879
But if we don't show them who's boss,
things will get annoying for us.

3465
02:37:32,379 --> 02:37:34,479
If I get eliminated today...

3466
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:37,049
because I'm not qualified,

3467
02:37:37,219 --> 02:37:38,950
That just means this is the end for me.

3468
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:41,159
Our team lost yesterday too.

3469
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:43,729
But even if we won today,

3470
02:37:43,989 --> 02:37:46,600
two of our members got selected.

3471
02:37:46,659 --> 02:37:49,600
If you don't stand your ground now,

3472
02:37:49,870 --> 02:37:52,370
then I won't have any motivation...

3473
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:54,399
to lead the team either.

3474
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:57,510
So in comparison to my own life,

3475
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:59,309
I need to show them...

3476
02:38:00,280 --> 02:38:04,010
that messing with me will...

3477
02:38:04,409 --> 02:38:05,549
send them home.

3478
02:38:07,250 --> 02:38:10,790
So I think I should go.

3479
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,319
You know,

3480
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:15,790
don't worry about me.

3481
02:38:15,790 --> 02:38:18,790
I made my promise, so I have your back.

3482
02:38:19,459 --> 02:38:20,600
Thank you...

3483
02:38:21,459 --> 02:38:22,600
for having my back.

3484
02:38:23,469 --> 02:38:26,069
I always keep my word.

3485
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:29,670
I don't think they're crazy enough...

3486
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:31,569
to pick you instead.

3487
02:38:31,670 --> 02:38:34,110
They're probably hoping for me
to get eliminated.

3488
02:38:34,579 --> 02:38:36,010
You have nothing to worry about.

3489
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:40,879
Dong Min...

3490
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:43,989
actually united our team...

3491
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:46,020
and told me not to be anxious.

3492
02:38:46,559 --> 02:38:48,090
I was happy I teamed up with Dong Min.

3493
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:50,489
He's a man of his word.

3494
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:55,260
Today was quite shocking for me.

3495
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:58,729
How is Yurisa doing all this
when she's not even an actress?

3496
02:39:02,670 --> 02:39:04,670
This is why I get fooled
a lot in real life.

3497
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:06,209
Jin Ho.

3498
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:10,250
I think it's better for me
to go to the Deathmatch.

3499
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:12,049
- You? Why?
- Yes.

3500
02:39:12,209 --> 02:39:13,280
Why not?

3501
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:15,780
These good-for-nothings are crawling
against me, so I need to show them.

3502
02:39:19,149 --> 02:39:20,690
I actually want to go.

3503
02:39:20,690 --> 02:39:21,889
So don't think...

3504
02:39:23,090 --> 02:39:24,430
of picking Min A.

3505
02:39:24,459 --> 02:39:26,299
But it's Min A I want to kill.

3506
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:29,969
It was because of Min A
that I was sent off to the Remaining.

3507
02:39:29,969 --> 02:39:31,469
- I see.
- Yes.

3508
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:36,340
I think there's a high chance
that I'll be sent off.

3509
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:37,739
No way.

3510
02:39:38,370 --> 02:39:40,909
If that's the case, then they wouldn't
have voted for me in the first place.

3511
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:44,450
They want me to disappear.

3512
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:47,979
But for me,

3513
02:39:47,979 --> 02:39:49,549
I could choose not to go
if I didn't want to.

3514
02:39:49,649 --> 02:39:51,850
I could've spent all my money.

3515
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:57,290
If I don't show them who's boss now,

3516
02:39:57,930 --> 02:39:59,059
then they'll keep messing
with the other teammates.

3517
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:04,569
Oh, little lamb.

3518
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:06,700
Do not fear.

3519
02:40:06,899 --> 02:40:08,940
You're right. It's not easy...

3520
02:40:10,069 --> 02:40:11,340
to shake off my fear.

3521
02:40:17,209 --> 02:40:18,879
Here's my vote for the Deathmatch.

3522
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:21,180
I'll kill them and return.

3523
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:22,620
(I'll kill them and return.)

3524
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:24,790
How dare these nobodies go against me?

3525
02:40:26,860 --> 02:40:29,590
(Jang Dong Min votes
for himself with 1 vote.)

3526
02:40:30,959 --> 02:40:32,629
Thank you, Dong Min.

3527
02:40:34,430 --> 02:40:35,959
I hope he comes back.

3528
02:40:35,959 --> 02:40:37,799
(Please come back.)

3529
02:40:38,799 --> 02:40:41,569
(Kim Min A votes
for Jang Dong Min with 1 vote.)

3530
02:40:42,239 --> 02:40:44,510
I was thankful and impressed...

3531
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:48,239
that he tried to keep his word.

3532
02:40:49,010 --> 02:40:50,979
(Chungju-Man votes
for Jang Dong Min with 1 vote.)

3533
02:40:50,979 --> 02:40:52,049
It's admirable.

3534
02:40:55,979 --> 02:40:58,020
What a long day.

3535
02:41:00,659 --> 02:41:02,620
I really didn't want...

3536
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:07,200
to make any votes today.

3537
02:41:08,299 --> 02:41:10,069
I don't think this will eliminate him.

3538
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,770
But even if he does,
I'm hoping he comes back.

3539
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:15,940
This is for my teammates.

3540
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:18,170
(Hong Jin Ho votes
for Jang Dong Min with 1 vote.)

3541
02:41:19,709 --> 02:41:22,340
I'd like to buy two extra votes, please.

3542
02:41:22,739 --> 02:41:26,379
(Choi Hye Seon votes
for Jang Dong Min with 3 votes.)

3543
02:41:29,079 --> 02:41:30,350
Give me two extra votes.

3544
02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:31,450
(Xitsuh purchases two extra votes.)

3545
02:41:31,450 --> 02:41:35,360
(Xitsuh votes for Jang Dong Min
with 3 votes.)

3546
02:41:38,129 --> 02:41:40,360
Can I check how much money I have left?

3547
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:43,299
Joo Eon Kyu's personal balance
is 89,000 dollars.

3548
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:44,770
That's a lot.

3549
02:41:44,969 --> 02:41:46,899
I'll buy all the extra votes.

3550
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:52,739
(Joo Eon Kyu purchases 4 extra votes.)

3551
02:41:53,510 --> 02:41:56,309
(Joo Eon Kyu votes
for Jang Dong Min with 5 votes.)

3552
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:57,709
I support his decision.

3553
02:42:01,450 --> 02:42:05,389
(Dong Min's team is hesitating
because they don't want to send him away.)

3554
02:42:05,389 --> 02:42:08,690
It's all up to us now.

3555
02:42:08,860 --> 02:42:10,360
We have to stop him
even if he volunteers to leave.

3556
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:13,260
Who's going to sit and watch
while their mom is going away to die?

3557
02:42:13,829 --> 02:42:15,799
Dong Min is actually willing to go.

3558
02:42:15,799 --> 02:42:18,829
But just because he's acting that way,

3559
02:42:18,829 --> 02:42:20,969
it's not wrong for us
to react this way either.

3560
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:24,840
Will you be okay
even after Dong Min finds out about this?

3561
02:42:26,139 --> 02:42:27,309
I don't know.

3562
02:42:28,079 --> 02:42:31,010
You don't suppose the other team bought
extra votes to protect Dong Min, do you?

3563
02:42:31,010 --> 02:42:32,809
No, it would be the other way around.

3564
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:34,850
They might have bought votes
to eliminate Dong Min.

3565
02:42:34,850 --> 02:42:37,219
- To eliminate him?
- Some people might have done that.

3566
02:42:37,250 --> 02:42:38,920
That's what Jin Ho told me.

3567
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:40,190
Jin Ho told me that.

3568
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:43,590
Then they might buy more votes
if they think...

3569
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:45,290
that we're trying to protect Dong Min.

3570
02:42:45,430 --> 02:42:47,629
No, so will you buy extra votes?

3571
02:42:47,629 --> 02:42:49,760
Are you buying 3 or 4 more votes?

3572
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:51,370
- I'll buy 4.
- Okay, 4.

3573
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:53,469
- What about you?
- Okay.

3574
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:01,379
(Kim Min A)

3575

(Lee Gina votes

3577
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:16,930
I'd like to buy one extra vote.

(MJ Kim votes for Kim Min A with 2 votes.)

3580
02:43:23,569 --> 02:43:25,770
We get your point,
but we can't let you go, Dong Min.

3581
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:27,969
You said so yourself...

3582
02:43:27,969 --> 02:43:31,469
that we should use Money Challenge
prize money for the good of the team.

3583
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:32,909
Now's the time to do that.

3584
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:36,409
(Heo Seong Beom votes
for Kim Min A with 3 votes.)

3585
02:43:36,579 --> 02:43:39,610
(Current Voting Statistics
Jang Dong Min: 15, Kim Min A: 7)

3586
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:50,159
I have money,
so I can use that to stop him.

3587
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:53,059
But I don't think
Dong Min will be eliminated...

3588
02:43:53,059 --> 02:43:54,329
just because he's going to the Deathmatch.

3589
02:43:54,559 --> 02:43:57,129
I know what Dong Min has in mind,

3590
02:43:57,129 --> 02:44:00,469
but it won't be too late
to do that tomorrow or the day after.

3591
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:03,709
He went and told all his enemies...

3592
02:44:03,709 --> 02:44:06,270
to vote for him,
but if he doesn't get voted,

3593
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:11,350
then we're humiliating Dong Min.

3594
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:14,819
There were a lot of things
I didn't quite understand.

3595
02:44:15,450 --> 02:44:17,819
Dong Min had strongly insisted...

3596
02:44:17,819 --> 02:44:19,549
that he was volunteering for Deathmatch.

3597
02:44:19,549 --> 02:44:22,219
I thought it would be weird...

3598
02:44:22,219 --> 02:44:25,260
if Dong Min ends up staying
in this situation.

3599
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:27,659
But Seong Beom said...

3600
02:44:27,899 --> 02:44:29,299
he wanted to save Dong Min.

3601
02:44:29,459 --> 02:44:32,000
I told him he shouldn't do that.

3602
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:35,569
I'd like to buy three extra votes.

3603
02:44:37,139 --> 02:44:39,139
I ended up buying extra votes.

3604
02:44:39,139 --> 02:44:41,909
You have purchased three extra votes.

3605
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:52,420
We're voting for the person
to be on Deathmatch, right?

3606
02:44:52,750 --> 02:44:53,760
Yes, that is correct.

3607
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:55,389
How much do I have left?

3608
02:44:56,190 --> 02:45:00,559
You have
173,000 dollars left in your balance.

3609
02:45:01,729 --> 02:45:02,959
I'd like to buy eight votes.

3610
02:45:04,629 --> 02:45:06,299
- Are you buying eight votes?
- Yes.

3611
02:45:12,739 --> 02:45:14,409
The voting has ended.

3612
02:45:16,479 --> 02:45:19,579
Between Kim Min A and Jang Dong MIn...

3613
02:45:19,579 --> 02:45:22,549
who were selected by Pani Bottle
and Lim Hyun Seo,

3614
02:45:23,950 --> 02:45:26,450
the candidate for elimination
to go to the Deathmatch is...

3615
02:45:30,459 --> 02:45:32,159
Jang Dong Min.

3616
02:45:40,799 --> 02:45:43,739
(Acau purchased 3 extra votes.)

3617
02:45:44,969 --> 02:45:48,879
(Acau votes for Kim Min A with 4 votes.)

3618
02:45:50,309 --> 02:45:53,979
I felt like I had to show them
that I belonged here...

3619
02:45:53,979 --> 02:45:56,750
to gain their trust.

3620
02:45:57,290 --> 02:45:59,819
When I think of Dong Min,

3621
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:03,829
I think he's a good leader,

3622
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:06,159
so I felt like I could trust...

3623
02:46:06,159 --> 02:46:07,729
this team entirely.

3624
02:46:08,530 --> 02:46:09,969
I'd like to buy eight extra votes.

3625
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:16,540
Dong Min is the leader
of our opposing team,

3626
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:18,709
so I thought we should eliminate him...

3627
02:46:18,870 --> 02:46:21,180
whenever we get the chance.

3628
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:22,540
That's why I voted for him.

3629
02:46:23,549 --> 02:46:30,389
(Steve Yea votes for Jang Dong Min
with 9 votes.)

3630
02:46:33,250 --> 02:46:34,319
I'll get going.

3631
02:46:49,139 --> 02:46:50,309
Hello.

3632
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:54,280
This is such a long day.

3633
02:47:04,719 --> 02:47:06,250
- We shouldn't be meeting like this.
- I know.

3634
02:47:06,959 --> 02:47:09,489
It's embarrassing
when we're on the same team.

3635
02:47:09,489 --> 02:47:10,930
I know. Goodness.

3636
02:47:11,459 --> 02:47:13,659
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

3637
02:47:13,930 --> 02:47:15,059
How are you?

3638
02:47:18,370 --> 02:47:19,469
This is what I wanted.

3639
02:47:19,930 --> 02:47:23,569
- We've been waiting for this moment.
- A lethal combat against the final boss.

3640
02:47:24,209 --> 02:47:26,340
The fight among ants looks so pitiful.

3641
02:47:26,409 --> 02:47:27,879
We can challenge the final boss...

3642
02:47:28,379 --> 02:47:29,610
and leave if we have to.

3643
02:47:29,809 --> 02:47:30,909
Sidekicks should get out.

3644
02:47:31,049 --> 02:47:32,079
However,

3645
02:47:33,379 --> 02:47:35,120
you picked the wrong enemy.

3646
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:39,149
I'd like to test myself.

3647
02:47:39,620 --> 02:47:41,489
Am I still as quick-witted
as I was before?

3648
02:47:41,489 --> 02:47:44,329
Am I still considered smart?

3649
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:47,129
I'm trying, because it's you.

3650
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:49,159
Now that I go to Deathmatch anyway,

3651
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:51,629
I will achieve my intended purpose here,

3652
02:47:51,629 --> 02:47:54,340
challenging Dong Min in Bloody Game.

3653
02:47:54,440 --> 02:47:55,899
There can be a game I play well,

3654
02:47:55,899 --> 02:47:57,440
and a game Dong Min plays well.

3655
02:47:58,370 --> 02:48:00,680
If it's a game
that I can play well enough,

3656
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:03,549
it's worth trying and I can win.

3657
02:48:07,850 --> 02:48:08,920
Pani Bottle,

3658
02:48:10,219 --> 02:48:11,290
Lim Hyun Seo,

3659
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:13,489
Jang Dong Min.

3660
02:48:14,659 --> 02:48:15,790
Three players need to have...

3661
02:48:15,959 --> 02:48:19,959
a 1-on-1-on-1 Deathmatch.

3662
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:23,159
Today's Deathmatch will be revealed.

3663
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:25,500
Deathmatch today...

3664
02:48:26,469 --> 02:48:27,870
is Hidden Code.

3665
02:48:27,870 --> 02:48:29,270
(Hidden Code)

3666
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:33,209
In Hidden Code, find the rule
hidden in the star,

3667
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:36,079
apply the rule to the star
of the question,

3668
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:40,010
and get the answer
before the other player.

3669
02:48:40,719 --> 02:48:43,989
It's an individual match by 3 people,
and it consists of 5 rounds.

3670
02:48:44,690 --> 02:48:48,290
You will use 5 dices
with numbers 1 to 6 written.

3671
02:48:48,559 --> 02:48:51,690
A butler has two dice,

3672
02:48:51,790 --> 02:48:53,430
and each player has one die.

3673
02:48:53,729 --> 02:48:56,969
For each round, when the star
of the question is revealed,

3674
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:00,239
the butler will roll two dice randomly.

3675
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:04,139
The two numbers from it
will be revealed to players.

3676
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:08,010
Players will pick one number...

3677
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,709
from each dice they have,
and submit at the same time.

3678
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:14,379
You can enter
the combination of numbers...

3679
02:49:14,579 --> 02:49:17,090
with the 5 numbers gotten from 5 dice
to the empty star,

3680
02:49:17,319 --> 02:49:19,350
and check the result.

3681
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:22,989
But when no one gets the answer,

3682
02:49:23,090 --> 02:49:25,590
the process of getting new numbers
will be repeated.

3683
02:49:25,989 --> 02:49:28,760
The player who finds the answer
will shout, "I got it,"

3684
02:49:28,930 --> 02:49:31,899
and say the result gotten from
applying the rule...

3685
02:49:31,899 --> 02:49:33,430
to the star of the question.

3686
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,569
If it's the correct answer,
you get one winning point.

3687
02:49:36,940 --> 02:49:39,469
If it's incorrect,
the chance of answering...

3688
02:49:39,469 --> 02:49:42,280
is on for the other players
for 30 seconds.

3689
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:44,110
After five rounds are over,

3690
02:49:44,110 --> 02:49:47,250
the player with higher winning points
wins.

3691
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:49,219
Goodness. I thought...

3692
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:52,549
this would be tough,
but it's harder than I imagined.

3693
02:49:53,049 --> 02:49:55,620
Honestly, when I heard the tutorial,
I thought I had a chance.

3694
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:58,590
I'm not that slow-witted in that area.

3695
02:49:58,629 --> 02:50:00,129
I thought that game was worth trying.

3696
02:50:00,860 --> 02:50:01,899
Bring it on.

3697
02:50:02,729 --> 02:50:05,700
Well, I'm confident.

3698
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:08,239
I will show you what I got.

3699
02:50:09,299 --> 02:50:12,110
The first star will be revealed.

3700
02:50:17,409 --> 02:50:18,850
I will roll the dice.

3701
02:50:21,079 --> 02:50:22,719
The numbers achieved are six...

3702
02:50:22,719 --> 02:50:25,250
and four.

3703
02:50:26,090 --> 02:50:29,219
Players, pick a number on your die.

3704
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:34,030
Lim Hyun Seo chose the number three.

3705
02:50:34,030 --> 02:50:36,629
Pani Bottle chose the number one.

3706
02:50:36,659 --> 02:50:39,229
Jang Dong Min chose the number five.

3707
02:50:39,299 --> 02:50:40,799
The numbers you can apply...

3708
02:50:40,799 --> 02:50:44,940
are 6, 4, 3, 1, and 5.

3709
02:50:45,010 --> 02:50:47,139
Now, you can enter the numbers.

3710
02:50:47,139 --> 02:50:48,680
If you want to enter the numbers,

3711
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:51,379
please tell me the combination
of numbers you desire.

3712
02:50:54,250 --> 02:50:55,750
Enter 64 for A,

3713
02:50:55,850 --> 02:50:57,120
three for D,

3714
02:50:57,750 --> 02:50:58,920
and 15 for C.

3715
02:50:59,250 --> 02:51:01,860
The result is 64.

3716
02:51:04,430 --> 02:51:05,629
I got it. The answer is 79.

3717
02:51:05,629 --> 02:51:07,700
(The answer is 79.)

3718
02:51:07,829 --> 02:51:09,930
Pani Bottle, you are incorrect.

3719
02:51:09,959 --> 02:51:12,370
You can't answer for 30 seconds.

3720
02:51:12,569 --> 02:51:15,299
They said I had unlimited chances
to give the answer,

3721
02:51:15,299 --> 02:51:16,299
so I made a guess.

3722
02:51:16,299 --> 02:51:17,940
Despite having a lower hand,

3723
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:19,940
I made an effort and I think
it's better than doing nothing.

3724
02:51:23,479 --> 02:51:25,709
- I will enter the numbers.
- Please tell me the combination.

3725
02:51:25,879 --> 02:51:32,450
Enter 1 for A, 3 for B, 4 for C, 5 for D,

3726
02:51:32,649 --> 02:51:33,959
and 6 for E.

3727
02:51:34,190 --> 02:51:37,360
The result is ten.

3728
02:51:37,360 --> 02:51:39,959
(The result is 10.)

3729
02:51:48,770 --> 02:51:50,239
I will enter the numbers.

3730
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:52,709
Enter 6 for A, 5 for B,

3731
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:54,440
four for C,

3732
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:57,079
three for D, and one for E.

3733
02:51:57,850 --> 02:51:59,950
The result is ten.

3734
02:51:59,950 --> 02:52:02,049
(The result is 10.)

3735
02:52:06,690 --> 02:52:07,760
This is so difficult.

3736
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:09,590
I will enter the numbers.

3737
02:52:09,719 --> 02:52:12,290
Enter 5 for A, 3 for B,

3738
02:52:12,590 --> 02:52:13,629
one for C,

3739
02:52:13,629 --> 02:52:16,459
four for D, and six for E.

3740
02:52:17,899 --> 02:52:19,899
The result is ten.

3741
02:52:30,110 --> 02:52:31,610
I will enter the numbers.

3742
02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:33,010
Yes, please tell me the combination.

3743
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:34,920
Forty-three for E,

3744
02:52:35,049 --> 02:52:36,780
sixty-five for D,

3745
02:52:37,049 --> 02:52:38,750
and one for C.

3746
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:41,219
The result is zero.

3747
02:52:42,459 --> 02:52:43,459
What?

3748
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:47,129
Darn it. I'm having a headache.

3749
02:52:50,430 --> 02:52:51,469
I got it.

3750
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:54,969
The answer is 406.

3751
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:56,270
Jang Dong Min.

3752
02:52:56,270 --> 02:52:58,969
(The answer is 406.)

3753
02:52:58,969 --> 02:53:01,340
It's correct. You've earned one point.

3754
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:03,850
- It's amazing.
- It's incredible.

3755
02:53:04,450 --> 02:53:05,680
Goodness.

3756
02:53:06,579 --> 02:53:07,620
How does he do that?

3757
02:53:08,180 --> 02:53:10,280
Actually, for these questions,

3758
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:13,090
analyzing the pattern is very important,

3759
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:14,420
and the results were the same.

3760
02:53:14,420 --> 02:53:16,290
Six plus four is ten.

3761
02:53:16,489 --> 02:53:19,860
Then are 1, 3, and 5 not necessary?

3762
02:53:19,860 --> 02:53:22,959
What's the difference between
1, 3, and 5, and 6 and 4?

3763
02:53:22,959 --> 02:53:24,370
Is it a sum of even numbers?

3764
02:53:24,370 --> 02:53:27,799
So I entered all odd numbers,
and the result was zero.

3765
02:53:28,370 --> 02:53:30,670
I gave it a try as a test.

3766
02:53:31,010 --> 02:53:33,069
It matched my prediction,
and I got the answer.

3767
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:34,479
He showed he was competent.

3768
02:53:34,809 --> 02:53:37,250
But I wasn't intimidated at all.

3769
02:53:39,010 --> 02:53:40,479
I didn't care about the others...

3770
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:41,680
and did it according to my pace.

3771
02:53:43,250 --> 02:53:45,690
The second star shape will be revealed.

3772
02:53:52,329 --> 02:53:53,559
The numbers earned from the dice
are four...

3773
02:53:53,959 --> 02:53:56,659
and four.

3774
02:53:57,030 --> 02:53:59,629
Lim Hyun Seo picked the number one.

3775
02:54:00,229 --> 02:54:02,739
Pani Bottle picked the number five.

3776
02:54:02,899 --> 02:54:05,639
Jang Dong Min picked the number one.

3777
02:54:06,209 --> 02:54:11,479
The numbers you can apply
are 4, 4, 1, 5, and 1.

3778
02:54:12,450 --> 02:54:14,319
I'll call the numbers in order,
starting from A.

3779
02:54:15,350 --> 02:54:17,319
Four for A, four for B,

3780
02:54:17,319 --> 02:54:20,790
one for C, five for D, and one for E.

3781
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:24,059
The result is 65.

3782
02:54:31,299 --> 02:54:33,569
- I will enter the numbers.
- Please tell me the combination.

3783
02:54:33,569 --> 02:54:36,799
Please enter 5 for A, 11 for B,

3784
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:38,940
four for C, and four for D.

3785
02:54:39,409 --> 02:54:42,610
The result is 856.

3786
02:54:47,110 --> 02:54:48,120
It's 856?

3787
02:54:49,979 --> 02:54:51,319
I will enter the numbers.

3788
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:53,889
Please enter 44 for A, 1 for B,

3789
02:54:53,889 --> 02:54:55,360
one for D, and five for E.

3790
02:54:56,420 --> 02:54:59,159
The result is 169.

3791
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:02,459
I have no idea.

3792
02:55:03,969 --> 02:55:05,030
How can I get the answer to this?

3793
02:55:10,670 --> 02:55:12,409
I will enter the numbers.

3794
02:55:12,409 --> 02:55:13,709
Please tell me the combination.

3795
02:55:13,709 --> 02:55:16,139
Please enter 14 for A, 4 for B,

3796
02:55:16,139 --> 02:55:17,979
one for D, and 5 for E.

3797
02:55:18,979 --> 02:55:21,219
The result is 256.

3798
02:55:22,780 --> 02:55:25,450
What's this? Seriously.

3799
02:55:26,219 --> 02:55:27,690
How can this happen?

3800
02:55:27,690 --> 02:55:31,059
They didn't have a clue at all anyway.

3801
02:55:31,059 --> 02:55:33,329
So I decided to catch the hints given...

3802
02:55:33,329 --> 02:55:34,899
right away without missing.

3803
02:55:53,250 --> 02:55:54,280
I got it.

3804
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:57,590
The answer is 35828.

3805
02:55:57,590 --> 02:55:58,719
Jang Dong Min,

3806
02:55:59,420 --> 02:56:02,290
you are correct. You've earned one point.

3807
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:03,959
How did he get the answer?

3808
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:06,389
He's doing acrobatics with his brain.

3809
02:56:08,129 --> 02:56:10,500
Compared to the numbers entered,

3810
02:56:10,500 --> 02:56:12,370
the result was a huge number.

3811
02:56:12,370 --> 02:56:14,239
So I thought the rule definitely
required multiplications.

3812
02:56:14,239 --> 02:56:16,100
So I tried multiplying,

3813
02:56:16,100 --> 02:56:17,739
but the answers
were bigger than the result.

3814
02:56:17,739 --> 02:56:20,809
So I thought I needed to subtract
something from the multiplication.

3815
02:56:20,809 --> 02:56:24,209
When I subtracted the sum of all numbers,
I got the answer.

3816
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:36,520
I can't believe it.

3817
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:41,129
Two of them challenged me to send me home,

3818
02:56:41,329 --> 02:56:43,229
but they will regret it after I slay them.

3819
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:47,340
The third star shape will be revealed.

3820
02:56:53,239 --> 02:56:54,309
I have no clue.

3821
02:56:54,510 --> 02:57:00,280
The numbers are 6, 6, 2, 1, and 1.

3822
02:57:00,579 --> 02:57:02,079
I will enter the numbers.

3823
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:04,250
Enter 1 for A, 1 for B,

3824
02:57:04,250 --> 02:57:07,590
six for C, six for D, and two for E.

3825
02:57:07,590 --> 02:57:09,590
The result is five.

3826
02:57:10,559 --> 02:57:11,590
What?

3827
02:57:12,459 --> 02:57:13,659
I will enter the numbers.

3828
02:57:13,659 --> 02:57:16,899
Enter 662 for A and 11 for B.

3829
02:57:18,170 --> 02:57:21,840
It's 662 for A and 11 for B.

3830
02:57:23,469 --> 02:57:25,569
The result is five.

3831
02:57:27,479 --> 02:57:28,540
It's all five.

3832
02:57:29,209 --> 02:57:30,379
Is the answer five, then?

3833
02:57:31,649 --> 02:57:32,850
I got it. The answer is five.

3834
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:35,680
I should have said that.

3835
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:38,420
You're incorrect.

3836
02:57:38,420 --> 02:57:39,489
I got it.

3837
02:57:39,750 --> 02:57:41,760
Pani Bottle, please tell me your answer.

3838
02:57:42,059 --> 02:57:43,120
Is it eight?

3839
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:44,860
(He says eight.)

3840
02:57:44,860 --> 02:57:47,760
- Is that right?
- Pani Bottle, you are incorrect.

3841
02:57:48,459 --> 02:57:50,360
I don't know. I honestly have no idea.

3842
02:57:51,399 --> 02:57:52,629
What's this?

3843
02:57:53,670 --> 02:57:55,940
I seriously have no clue at all.

3844
02:57:56,469 --> 02:57:57,469
This is...

3845
02:57:58,739 --> 02:58:00,909
- I will enter the numbers.
- All right.

3846
02:58:01,209 --> 02:58:04,409
Please enter 12 for A,
16 for B, and 6 for C.

3847
02:58:05,409 --> 02:58:09,549
It's 12 for A, 16 for B, and 6 for C.

3848
02:58:09,549 --> 02:58:11,649
The result is five.

3849
02:58:15,889 --> 02:58:18,590
I will enter the numbers.

3850
02:58:19,129 --> 02:58:20,799
Please enter 62 for A,

3851
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:23,629
sixteen for B, and one for C.

3852
02:58:23,629 --> 02:58:28,299
It's 62 for A, 16 for B, and 1 for C.

3853
02:58:28,299 --> 02:58:30,639
The result is five.

3854
02:58:33,110 --> 02:58:35,739
I will take this as an opportunity
to show them...

3855
02:58:35,739 --> 02:58:37,209
that I'm on a different level from them.

3856
02:58:38,479 --> 02:58:39,479
I got it.

3857
02:58:43,950 --> 02:58:45,090
I will say six.

3858
02:58:47,250 --> 02:58:48,319
Jang Dong Min,

3859
02:58:50,319 --> 02:58:51,329
you are correct.

3860
02:58:52,059 --> 02:58:53,159
This is fascinating.

3861
02:58:53,159 --> 02:58:54,399
(Jang Dong Min got the answer.)

3862
02:58:54,659 --> 02:58:58,030
Jang Dong Min got 3 answers
out of the 5 questions.

3863
02:58:58,030 --> 02:58:59,799
He's the final winner of the Deathmatch.

3864
02:58:59,799 --> 02:59:01,840
(Jang Dong Min
is the final winner of the Deathmatch.)

3865
02:59:02,139 --> 02:59:04,340
- Please tell us how you got the last one.
- You have an exquisite skill.

3866
02:59:04,340 --> 02:59:06,209
It's the way the butler said it.

3867
02:59:06,209 --> 02:59:08,309
She read the number 86 before,

3868
02:59:08,309 --> 02:59:10,479
- She read it as 1 and 6 this time.
- She said 1 and 6,

3869
02:59:10,479 --> 02:59:13,510
so I thought it wasn't about the numbers.

3870
02:59:13,510 --> 02:59:15,819
I think it's the number of circles
when written in Korean.

3871
02:59:16,450 --> 02:59:19,950
(Eight, six, two, nine,
one, zero, one, three)

3872
02:59:19,950 --> 02:59:26,690
(Eight, six, two, nine,
one, zero, one, three)

3873
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:28,760
- Gosh, you worked hard.
- You worked hard.

3874
02:59:30,030 --> 02:59:31,170
Dong Min,
thank you for showing us your skill.

3875
02:59:32,129 --> 02:59:33,700
- You worked hard.
- Thank you for your work.

3876
02:59:33,700 --> 02:59:34,770
Thank you for your work.

3877
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:36,270
Since you've come this far,
you should win.

3878
02:59:37,969 --> 02:59:39,610
Gosh, I should have acted up more.

3879
02:59:40,069 --> 02:59:43,110
"Please.
I wish Jang Dong Min gets eliminated."

3880
02:59:43,739 --> 02:59:45,280
What a stupid thought.

3881
02:59:46,250 --> 02:59:48,049
I will go back alive.

3882
02:59:48,219 --> 02:59:49,549
Just from meeting my eyes,

3883
02:59:49,549 --> 02:59:51,950
they will wet themselves.

3884
02:59:52,350 --> 02:59:54,790
When the cat's away, the mice will play.

3885
02:59:55,159 --> 02:59:56,489
I need to show them my competence.

3886
03:00:02,200 --> 03:00:04,030
Please gather at the Main Hall.

3887
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:08,670
The Deathmatch result will be announced.

3888
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:11,010
The eliminated players from Bloody Game...

3889
03:00:12,239 --> 03:00:13,309
are Pani Bottle...

3890
03:00:14,979 --> 03:00:16,180
and Lim Hyun Seo.

3891
03:00:17,950 --> 03:00:20,680
Pani Bottle and Lim Hyun Seo,

3892
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:22,879
please leave Bloody Game immediately.

3893
03:00:24,290 --> 03:00:26,549
- Without saying goodbye? It's heartless.
- Eliminated players...

3894
03:00:26,549 --> 03:00:28,159
cannot return to Bloody Game again.

3895
03:00:28,489 --> 03:00:30,290
- See you later somewhere.
- Yes.

3896
03:00:30,790 --> 03:00:33,090
Jang Dong Min is a monster!

3897
03:00:33,090 --> 03:00:34,530
- That monster!
- Monster!

3898
03:00:34,530 --> 03:00:36,100
- He's a monster both in skills and looks!
- Monster!

3899
03:00:36,459 --> 03:00:38,569
You shouldn't have messed with me,
you jerks.

3900
03:00:42,270 --> 03:00:44,270
- Seriously.
- I should leave.

3901
03:00:44,270 --> 03:00:45,370
Gosh, this is...

3902
03:00:46,270 --> 03:00:47,440
This is so amazing.

3903
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:49,610
I feel bummed out to some extent.

3904
03:00:49,610 --> 03:00:50,680
I regret many things.

3905
03:00:51,909 --> 03:00:53,049
It requires a lot of effort.

3906
03:00:53,049 --> 03:00:54,479
It requires thorough previews and reviews.

3907
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:57,690
I want to do this one more time again.
I mean it.

3908
03:00:58,489 --> 03:01:00,850
When I watched survival shows before,

3909
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:02,290
since the dynamics keep changing,

3910
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:05,790
I thought you couldn't compare
the contenders' skills,

3911
03:01:05,790 --> 03:01:08,260
saying one is better than the other.

3912
03:01:08,760 --> 03:01:10,969
But this show changed my perspective.

3913
03:01:11,129 --> 03:01:12,799
A strong player definitely exists.

3914
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:14,370
There's a good one.

3915
03:01:14,940 --> 03:01:16,770
If I have another opportunity like this,

3916
03:01:16,940 --> 03:01:18,040
I will train myself very much.

3917
03:01:18,270 --> 03:01:21,139
The moment of breaking the window
was most memorable to me.

3918
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:23,409
Arresting Chungju-Man...

3919
03:01:23,409 --> 03:01:25,780
and catching chicken from the remains
and putting it into the barrel,

3920
03:01:27,719 --> 03:01:29,120
all those moments remain in my memory.

3921
03:01:30,049 --> 03:01:32,020
Bloody Game fit me in many ways...

3922
03:01:32,489 --> 03:01:34,260
because you didn't have to use
only your brain...

3923
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:36,690
to move forward.

3924
03:01:36,790 --> 03:01:39,729
I could try many things as I wanted,

3925
03:01:39,729 --> 03:01:41,829
and there were many choices
given in the games.

3926
03:01:41,829 --> 03:01:44,770
I could show myself
without hiding who I was.

3927
03:01:45,569 --> 03:01:49,000
I cursed and broke things,
following my temper.

3928
03:01:49,170 --> 03:01:50,170
Darn it!

3929
03:01:52,870 --> 03:01:54,139
It was a game...

3930
03:01:54,909 --> 03:01:55,979
where I expressed my nature.

3931
03:01:56,079 --> 03:01:58,079
What I regret...

3932
03:01:58,079 --> 03:02:00,149
is not talking and arguing...

3933
03:02:00,579 --> 03:02:01,579
some more with the people there.

3934
03:02:01,979 --> 03:02:03,049
It's fun being with them in there.

3935
03:02:03,049 --> 03:02:04,389
I rarely get such a chance.

3936
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:07,590
I regret not being able to do it more.

3937
03:02:07,860 --> 03:02:09,590
But I've come this far with my brain.

3938
03:02:09,719 --> 03:02:11,489
I accept the outcome.

3939
03:02:11,729 --> 03:02:13,690
I want to play some more.
I should have stayed one more day.

3940
03:02:14,129 --> 03:02:15,430
But it's not up to me.

3941
03:02:16,159 --> 03:02:17,969
I had fun playing.

3942
03:02:18,670 --> 03:02:21,100
Aren't you going to have another season?
Can you cast me again?

3943
03:02:21,340 --> 03:02:23,270
I learned life here!

3944
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:24,940
I'm learning life!

3945
03:02:29,497 --> 03:02:31,297
