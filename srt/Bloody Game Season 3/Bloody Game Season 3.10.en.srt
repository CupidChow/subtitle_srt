1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,409
Okay.

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's listen to the story.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,740
We told both of them to go against you.

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,849
That was our order.

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,279
What was the game?

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,679
What did you play?

7
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,880
- I'll tell you what we played.
- Yes.

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,919
- They couldn't team up?
- I'm so relieved.

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,149
Why would you have them team up?

10
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,589
We told them to team up.

11
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,160
They wouldn't have stood
a chance otherwise.

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,390
We thought it was our opportunity.

13
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,429
You never die, old man.

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,399
What a bunch of bullcrap.

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,439
I lost the will to fight.

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,479
No one can be trusted.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,810
Why are we losing the game?

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,280
We couldn't beat that one grandpa.

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,149
To me, I was frustrated...

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,090
and felt bad that day.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,729
The two players that I wanted to bring...

22
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,259
to the final round were Hyun Seo and Pani.

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,000
And those two were eliminated.

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,829
The six of us had such a strong bond.

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,299
And we lost two guys at once. Darn it.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,299
I'm so angry.

27
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,840
It felt awkward, bloody,

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,379
and uncomfortable,
and that feeling didn't go away.

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,480
Why have I gotten so soft?

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,379
I'm usually sensitive...

31
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,920
about betrayals,

32
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,519
so I used to smell those things
right away.

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,230
You need to eat.

34
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,829
They got into a festive mood instantly.

35
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,129
It's scary.

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,969
I was scared today.

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,209
We said goodbye to them,
and as soon as we left,

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,069
they were cheering and eating.

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,980
Well, they had the right to welcome him
as he made it back.

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,609
It felt like a revival service.

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,620
I was waiting to heat this up,

42
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,319
and there was a revival service going on.

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,650
They were all going, "You're amazing!"

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,359
I knew you'd come back.

45
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,959
You're good. Now, that's more like it.

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,030
They're kissing up so hard. Darn it.

47
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,900
Isn't Jin Ho laughing with them too?

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,930
- He is.
- Let's eliminate him now.

49
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,030
I'm telling you. Jin Ho is a spy.

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,199
Dong Min and Jin Ho might be
coordinating everything...

51
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,710
in the game.

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,009
Yes, I agree.

53
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,310
I secretly wished
the announcement would go,

54
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,909
"Pani Bottle has won."

55
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,020
"Unlike everyone's expectations..."

56
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,949
I did wish that Pani Bottle would win.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,150
My heart wanted Pani to survive,
my head wanted Hyun Seo to survive,

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,990
- but in reality, it was Dong Min.
- In reality, it was Dong Min.

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,110
Tough day, right?

60
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,710
It wasn't tough.

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,110
And Steve was...

62
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,819
Right. What made him so sulky?

63
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,979
Beats me. That's what concerns me.

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,620
He's gotten sulky,

65
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,689
and he's complaining,
"How should I vent this anger?"

66
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,030
It's hard enough to control him,
and he's doing that.

67
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,759
I got irritated too.

68
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,870
He's basically a harsh speaker.

69
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,930
Right? He talks bluntly.

70
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,240
I try to explain all the steps,
but he talks so bluntly,

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,009
nor does he back down.
He's got a huge ego.

72
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,979
In the end, we can't communicate,
and it hurts my feelings as well.

73
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,509
We had such arguments
a few times outside of this.

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,750
That's why I try not to go against him.

75
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,819
I've just given up.

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,520
You can't play to the full...

77
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,120
as long as he's here.

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,289
I can't. So, I'm letting him
make all the decisions.

79
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,629
Right. Now, what does that make you?

80
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,199
I don't know what the game will be today,

81
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,870
but you can suggest
that you two play separately.

82
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,639
I actually want to step up...

83
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,039
when the time is right.

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,909
I'll have to see how things go, though.

85
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,939
But I'll still avoid him
if there's going to be a conflict.

86
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,979
Why are you exposing yourself
to such stress all the way out here?

87
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,090
Right. I just want to play the game
on a show that I like.

88
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,300
Are you actually going to use
the ladder game?

89
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,459
- What nonsense are you talking about?
- I'll come for you, then.

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,829
The ladder game? Are you serious?

91
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,269
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

92
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,199
Yurisa, you, Dong Min, and I are fixed.

93
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,500
We are.

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,110
But we have three remaining spots.

95
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,879
I want to send
Steve and Xitsuh to the Remaining.

96
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,379
And I want to send
the three players from the Mansion,

97
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,680
who haven't been to the Remaining.

98
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,180
Chungju-Man, Min A, and Gina.

99
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,389
Yes. Good idea.

100
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,889
Then, here's what we're left with.

101
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,160
Me, Dong Min, MJ, Yurisa,

102
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,500
Acau,

103
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,129
Jin Ho, and Eon Kyu.

104
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,870
All the members of the Mansion are going
except for Acau.

105
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,569
We're switching Acau and Hye Seon.

106
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,439
I can't send Acau to the Remaining.

107
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,209
It's better to keep him.

108
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,579
It is. It'll be troublesome
if we send him away.

109
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,209
No, it's not about that. When they pick
one of us for the Deathmatch,

110
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,519
- he's their enemy.
- Oh, he's a scapegoat.

111
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,720
I thought really hard about it.

112
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,389
I wondered why everyone criticized Acau
every time he spoke.

113
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,790
When we play politics,
Dong Min is the type to conciliate us,

114
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,560
but Acau uses lies
that are easily detected and slander.

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,129
He wasn't playing politics.

116
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,000
- He was just playing both sides, in fact.
- Right.

117
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,839
So, you and I make a duo?

118
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,240
(He suggested Kyung Ran
that they team up.)

119
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,870
You might be left all alone.

120
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,079
Kyung Ran asked to team up with me.

121
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,779
Kyung Ran...

122
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,910
- kept asking me to team up.
- Seriously?

123
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,779
I think Acau is...

124
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,649
- He's sounding us out.
- sounding people out.

125
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,019
He sounded Min A out too.

126
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,889
That's funny to me too.

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,759
"I did this."

128
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,490
"I went there and did this."

129
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,230
"That's why I went
and told them to do this and that."

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,899
I talked to them.

131
00:05:58,899 --> 00:05:59,930
And I...

132
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,269
I got mad and told them.

133
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,870
I saved everyone.

134
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,300
I was...

135
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,110
the most influential one among them.

136
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,470
He claims that he manipulated everyone.

137
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,240
But no one was manipulated by him.

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
No one.

139
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,379
Also, I'm not so sure
about his playing abilities.

140
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,920
I don't think he's that good.

141
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,720
Ask Dong Min for his opinion too.

142
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,959
I should.
I wonder what he thinks about this.

143
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,329
Anyway, we need to win today.

144
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,240
- What's up?
- I'm just...

145
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,379
having random thoughts.

146
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,709
Random thoughts?

147
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,019
So many things happened
while you were gone.

148
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,319
Why? What happened?

149
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,790
I spent about 60,000 dollars.

150
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,800
Why?

151
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,230
I was going to respect your decision...

152
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,170
as you decided to go.

153
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,600
But the teammates thought differently.

154
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,110
MJ and Seong Beom...

155
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,980
badly wanted to save you,

156
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
so I bought three extra votes.

157
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,750
- You bought three and voted for Min A?
- Yes.

158
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,779
We all did.

159
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,750
Seong Beom, MJ, and Yurisa bought them.

160
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,790
Judging from the atmosphere,

161
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,730
I thought I'd be in an awkward position
if I kept claiming...

162
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,290
that we should respect your decision.

163
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,699
- You'd look greedy.
- Yes.

164
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,970
I didn't want that, so...

165
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,470
Have you guys lost your mind?

166
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,740
That's why I told them not to do it.

167
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,939
Are you guys insane? Hey.

168
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,879
If you were to do that,

169
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,250
I would have spent my money...

170
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,279
to make decisions.

171
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,279
- Right. So...
- And?

172
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,920
Of course, I told you guys,
"There's a risk,"

173
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,790
"but I have to do this to reach higher."

174
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
And I overcame it.

175
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,290
- You did.
- I overcame it,

176
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,199
so what can support us after that...

177
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,899
- is our funds.
- That's true.

178
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,240
But spending so much money
unnecessarily...

179
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,639
is the same as harming our strength.

180
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,879
- Yes.
- Okay?

181
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,810
(Dong Min sighing)

182
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,779
I lost the will to fight.

183
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,779
Do you know why?

184
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,220
Because you keep getting angry.

185
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,960
But they make me angry!

186
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,960
This is the last day you get angry.

187
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,830
Once you start using your energy...

188
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,360
solely on playing and winning...

189
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,570
Listen.

190
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,899
We were only a point behind
when there was a spy on our team.

191
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,600
We won the Expression Link,

192
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,169
even when we were unsure of Hye Seon.

193
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,379
Taking those into account,
there was no reason for us to lose.

194
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,710
But we lost
because we were vulnerable to poking.

195
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,580
We're so vulnerable to their poking.

196
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,149
Because you guys go out to smoke,

197
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,350
and some of us go over there.

198
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,549
And some of us stay together like this.

199
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,590
But that team has Dong Min saying,

200
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,759
"Bring him here," and they all gather.

201
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,960
"You're all dead if you don't wake up
early in the morning."

202
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,899
Then, they all wake up and gather.
That's their atmosphere.

203
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,769
They even have a set schedule for pooping.

204
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,929
Are you serious?

205
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm serious.
They can only poop at a designated time.

206
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,370
He says, "Poop now,"
and they have to poop.

207
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,309
You need to poop.

208
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,539
Shouldn't we call the police for that?

209
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,379
So, I'm saying that we should also...

210
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,580
Well, not as strict as them.

211
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,980
But I'd like us to do something...

212
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,049
to increase our trust.

213
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,350
As you said,

214
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,720
what we lack is...

215
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,860
trust and team unity.

216
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,259
And mental strength.

217
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,659
When one person gets angry,
the other gets angry.

218
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,129
It's contagious.
So, I suggest we stop doing that.

219
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:57,500
Don't get angry. When we do have energy,

220
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,840
let's channel all of it into winning.

221
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,240
I actually trusted Jin Ho
when I came here.

222
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,639
You need to show us your keen instincts.

223
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,809
- No, he's...
- You're doing great, but better.

224
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,519
I didn't step forward before,

225
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,919
as I told a few people,

226
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,190
because Steve and Hyun Seo...

227
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,789
joined our team.

228
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,120
If I step up,
there are going to be conflicts.

229
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:23,190
I could see those unstable factors,
so I didn't step up...

230
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,159
because I thought it'd be better
to have one person controlling it.

231
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,070
If we have a single leader,
we're no different from that team.

232
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,370
They also have one leader.

233
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,970
If you count Seong Beom,

234
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,870
they have a leader and a calculator.

235
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,210
(Dong Min stopped
as he heard some voices.)

236
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:53,460
(Jin Ho's team is having a meeting
right next to his room.)

237
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,399
(He starts eavesdropping
through the wall.)

238
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,539
A calculator.

239
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,370
That's true.

240
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,779
We have individuals with great skills.

241
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,179
- Good.
- I want everyone...

242
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,620
to participate when we play.

243
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:21,850
For instance, we can make Hye Seon...

244
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,919
the Minister of National Defense.

245
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,860
Look how she's moving around
to look for eavesdroppers.

246
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:31,029
Now, we can say, "Hye Seon isn't a spy."

247
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,700
"That team totally hates her."

248
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,570
We could do that...

249
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,169
and trust each other.

250
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,299
And Chungju-Man...

251
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,000
(He looks at where Dong Min is.)

252
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,169
Minister of Public Administration.

253
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,870
(Then, he turns around
and returns to his seat.)

254
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,679
- So...
- He can be trusted.

255
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,210
- Not really.
- I'm joking, of course.

256
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,279
Let's distribute our roles.

257
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,679
- You're on good terms with Min A, right?
- I am.

258
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,250
You can be the guy who contacts them.

259
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,590
Min A and Gina must think the same.

260
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:01,929
They could be eliminated at any moment.

261
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,629
What should we do if they mix us up?

262
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,200
Then, we'll have to exclude them.

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,570
If we're split into 2 teams of 3,

264
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,570
we don't have a choice
but to play with them.

265
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,769
But if only one of us goes
to a different team,

266
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,769
I must say that that person is excluded.

267
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,669
But above all, I think it depends...

268
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,279
on how the eliminated player is decided
in the new Money Challenge.

269
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,980
Whether it'll be 2 players
or 1 player from the team.

270
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,580
It won't be one player from each team...

271
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,679
because there will be a winning team
and a losing team.

272
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,620
Right. I don't think it'll be
one player from each team.

273
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,190
The widely-accepted theory is
that 2 players of our team will pick 1.

274
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,090
If that happens,
the players who are on our team...

275
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,230
will have to work hard.
If that's the system, I mean.

276
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,759
Otherwise, it's obvious
that we'll send them to the Deathmatch.

277
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,299
Even if it turns
into an individual game...

278
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Someone's here.

279
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,870
Someone's here.

280
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,509
- You have great hearing.
- He's not looking, though.

281
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,309
Maybe he was just going downstairs.

282
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,210
(Eon Kyu and Chungju-Man go
to the room next door.)

283
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,279
- But I heard something.
- No one's here.

284
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,279
Was it this door?

285
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,590
I think we can go back.

286
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,320
- I'll run to the bathroom.
- Go ahead.

287
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,490
- Get back in.
- Who was it?

288
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,529
No one. That door opened.

289
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,850
(He checks that everyone is gone
and runs away.)

290
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,000
Please gather at the Main Hall.

291
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,769
We have fewer chairs now.

292
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,269
- Right. It feels...
- They took the chairs out.

293
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,809
(The Main Hall seems empty.)

294
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,350
Oh, boy.

295
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,120
The next Money Challenge will be held
in two teams.

296
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,090
The power holder, Heo Seong Beom,

297
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,289
will enter the voting room
and form the teams.

298
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,820
A maximum of seven players can be
assigned to each team.

299
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,200
(Seong Beom has the right
to split the teams.)

300
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,200
Seong Beom, please split the teams
and place the player cards.

301
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,070
(Seong Beom sighing)

302
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,710
I've decided.

303
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,279
(He assigned the player to each team.)

304
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,320
The power holder, Heo Seong Beom,
has finished forming the teams.

305
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,120
The players will enter the voting room
one by one...

306
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,360
and check which team you're on.

307
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,570
You took impeccable notes.

308
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,039
Hello.

309
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,379
Hye Seon, check your team.

310
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,779
What the...

311
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,409
What?

312
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,580
(Stopping)

313
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,960
Jin Ho, check your team.

314
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,129
What?

315
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,000
What?

316
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,539
What's their plan?

317
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,809
What are you up to now?

318
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,080
What is this? This doesn't look simple.

319
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:45,149
What happened?

320
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,320
You should check it yourself.

321
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,590
It'll be revealed in 60 seconds.

322
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,090
- Chungju-Man, check your team.
- Oh, my head.

323
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,389
(Flipping)

324
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,759
Can I crumble the cards?

325
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,899
You may not damage the cards.

326
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:04,769
Funny.

327
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,610
What is going on?

328
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,509
(Humming)

329
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,649
Eon Kyu, check your team.

330
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,379
What is it?

331
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,820
(Among the members of Dong Min's team,)

332
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,129
(there's Eon Kyu.)

333
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,500
I was the only one
who was assigned to the other team.

334
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,070
I was like, "What is this?"

335
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,629
It was after I talked to all of them...

336
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,000
about uniting as a team.

337
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,070
So...

338
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,179
I was slightly frustrated.

339
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
- Why did it end up like this?
- Eon Kyu!

340
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,009
Did you talk to Seong Beom in private?

341
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,450
- Did you talk to him?
- No.

342
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,590
Gina, check your team.

343
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,029
(Gina is on Jin Ho's team.)

344
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,670
Won't it be weird
if I'm the only one on their team?

345
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,240
- It has nothing to do with looking weird.
- Is that right?

346
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,710
"If you sacrifice yourself today,
we'll reward you with money."

347
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,450
Maybe that was the deal.

348
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,549
It's like a religion there, after all.

349
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,019
I think it's something that our team...

350
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,960
and many other people want.

351
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,859
It's a strategy to eliminate Steve.

352
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,799
Listen.

353
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,829
(Before forming the teams)

354
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,369
This is on the condition
that everyone survives.

355
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,940
Gina will go to the other team.

356
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,569
By myself?

357
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,480
But it'll be so obvious that I'm the spy.

358
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,309
You don't need to do anything particular.

359
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,650
You can't make them lose either.

360
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,579
We're going to find a way to win.

361
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,450
What will happen when you lose?

362
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,920
I'll be voted as a Deathmatch candidate.

363
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,259
Right?

364
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,359
And they will all vote for you.

365
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,460
You'll get five votes.

366
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,900
We'll use a total of 11 votes.

367
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,299
No, 12 votes, including yours.

368
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,440
So, you're going to pick Steve...

369
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,069
and another one that we pick for you.

370
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,710
And those two will go to the Deathmatch.

371
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,339
The question is, "Why Gina?"

372
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,809
Steve hates Gina.

373
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,650
So, let's use that.

374
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,180
If Jin Ho's team loses,

375
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,349
they'll clearly vote for Gina.

376
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,119
I perfectly planned everything...

377
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,890
and sent Gina.

378
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,589
To be honest, I wasn't willing to go.

379
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,700
We don't know
how many extra votes they'll buy.

380
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,930
I'm aware that my survival
isn't guaranteed in this situation.

381
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,140
I couldn't help but feel
that I've been abandoned.

382
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,349
Oh, gosh.

383
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,950
- Man.
- You know,

384
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,759
Eon Kyu finds it...

385
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,759
extremely difficult
to adapt to a new environment.

386
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,460
That's because he's introverted.

387
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,960
He's gotten anxious by himself.

388
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,269
Like, "What's going on?
Why did they put me on their team?"

389
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,230
I'm so flustered.

390
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:27,500
I will now announce the teams...

391
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,970
assigned by Seong Beom, the power holder.

392
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,980
Jang Dong Min, Heo Seong Beom,

393
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,609
MJ Kim, Yurisa, Acau,

394
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,720
Kim Min A, and Joo Eon Kyu are
in the seven-member team.

395
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,319
Hong Jin Ho, Xitsuh,

396
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,960
Steve Yea, Choi Hye Seon,

397
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,859
Chungju-Man, and Lee Gina are
in the six-member team.

398
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,029
You may move freely
until the next announcement.

399
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,569
- Hey, tie her up.
- I'm serious.

400
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,269
- What?
- Tie her and lock her up.

401
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,470
That's so funny.

402
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,069
Gina, how were you assigned?

403
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,309
I was honestly notified.

404
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,910
- What?
- I was notified.

405
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,440
We were in the pantry,

406
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,109
he said, "I'll mix them up,"

407
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,920
so we said, "Okay," and waited.

408
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,420
The two of them left the room,
and I was notified.

409
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,119
- That has to be a total lie.
- She's lying.

410
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,720
- I know Dong Min.
- Yes.

411
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,960
He never notifies someone.

412
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,730
He always tells you...

413
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,000
the reason for his decision.

414
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,369
He would even tell her his measures.

415
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:31,339
- So, we...
- He did say, "We'll save you."

416
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:34,369
"You trust me, right? I saved Min A
yesterday. I'll save you."

417
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,069
She added that only because I said that.

418
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,380
Maybe it was a spontaneous answer or...

419
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,079
But you were tricked yesterday,
so I totally get it.

420
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,980
That's why I told him, "They're
definitely going to eliminate me."

421
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,819
Let me warn you in advance.

422
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,150
I'm eliminating you
as soon as you cry in front of me.

423
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,289
- The moment you cry, you're dead.
- What...

424
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,690
Once you show your snot...

425
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,460
I said, "This makes no sense!
I'll be eliminated for sure."

426
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,660
He said, "You know I saved Min A."

427
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,759
- How would he save you, though?
- I'm not sure.

428
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,829
It makes no sense.

429
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:03,670
This is only possible
because you're still on his team.

430
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,069
I actually have no idea.

431
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:07,099
- Should we talk to them?
- Let's move around now.

432
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,609
Gosh.

433
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,410
Wait. We don't know what the game is yet.

434
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,839
- We don't.
- No.

435
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:15,910
(Eon Kyu exclaiming)

436
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,150
- Poor Eon Kyu.
- We're just resting.

437
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,079
- I think he's having a panic attack.
- Yes.

438
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,890
- Who were you expecting?
- What?

439
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,589
I thought it'd be the same two teams.

440
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,759
- Seriously?
- Yes.

441
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,990
I think...

442
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,589
(Eon Kyu wailing)

443
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,059
- they're...
- Welcome to our team.

444
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,960
Among them, you're...

445
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,730
the most sane person.

446
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,099
That's true.

447
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,099
We mean it.

448
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,740
Ever since we had Si Yoon,

449
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,769
Yes.

450
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,980
I've wanted to play with you.

451
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,140
Thank you.

452
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,410
Aren't I better?

453
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,279
Aren't I a better fit?

454
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,519
You were last on the list.

455
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,990
I see that you've made yourself at home.

456
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,730
- Wait.
- He's adapting well.

457
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,569
- We already dropped the honorifics.
- Yes.

458
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,730
(Approaching)

459
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,839
They have a chat as they smoke,
so you need to go with them.

460
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,109
(Thinking)

461
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,180
But we don't even...

462
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,450
know his name yet,
so let me introduce ourselves.

463
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,750
- Sure.
- Okay.

464
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,049
Have a chat first.

465
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,720
What was your name?

466
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,089
They're definitely up to something.

467
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,259
Just now,

468
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,160
Min A was looking straight ahead
but pretended like she wasn't listening.

469
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,400
Seong Beom turned around and whispered.

470
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,759
If they talked behind our backs
while we were talking,

471
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,829
they must have a secret between them.

472
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:46,900
I'm just saying that they're conspiring.

473
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,039
I can see them talking in secret.

474
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,869
- I...
- Should we head inside?

475
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,079
- I'll just...
- Do you want to smoke?

476
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,140
You can stay here.

477
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,680
No, Gina should be inside.

478
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,910
- You can head inside.
- Sure.

479
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,309
- Wait inside.
- Okay.

480
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,480
This is...

481
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,990
(Sighing)

482
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,660
The Dong Min you know won't say,
"You trust me to save you,"

483
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,559
when he's sending someone away
because he doesn't like them, right?

484
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,789
- No.
- Never.

485
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,430
He'd never say that.

486
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,130
Dong Min likes guaranteeing things...

487
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,430
however he does it.

488
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,170
That's why he volunteered
to go to the Deathmatch.

489
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,900
Or he could have said,

490
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
"If you join their team now,"

491
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,839
"I'll guarantee your survival
until the end."

492
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,480
He could have made that deal.

493
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,910
But it's such a vague reward.

494
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,250
- Right?
- She's at risk today.

495
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,619
I don't know what the rules are, though.

496
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,349
Let's not let this get into our heads.

497
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,519
Nothing complicated about this.

498
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,160
It's been decided,

499
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,759
so we'll wait and play the game.

500
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,900
I've never done...

501
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,400
anything with you before,

502
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,769
so here's our stance.

503
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,599
We make sure to protect the teammates...

504
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,240
and make sure to make them
our enemies otherwise.

505
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:58,579
I see.

506
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,980
That's why I told her
that I'd guarantee her survival...

507
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,480
when she first joined us yesterday.

508
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,750
- So, I trusted you.
- And I went to the Deathmatch.

509
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,049
We'll consider you as part of our family.

510
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,559
If you decide to tell them
our information,

511
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,759
we'll think,

512
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:22,470
"He's our family
but decided to betray us."

513
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,440
For now, you're not a traitor...

514
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:27,640
or a stranger.

515
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,809
Of course, I hope you won't betray us.

516
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,710
(Exclaiming)

517
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,819
- It must weigh heavily on you.
- Right.

518
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,250
It does. It's a lot of pressure.

519
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,990
But once you play with us,

520
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,759
you'll realize
why we play so well on Dong Min's team,

521
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,529
trust, and rely on each other.

522
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,400
I bet you'll be able to see that.

523
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,259
And he proved himself...

524
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,369
by taking responsibility.

525
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,769
I'd like you to give us your trust.

526
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,339
I should still say goodbye to them...

527
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,740
- because none of us knew.
- You're right.

528
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,039
- Wait. Eon Kyu is coming.
- He said that he'd shuffle the cards.

529
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,279
How did this happen?

530
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,319
Have they asked you for anything yet?

531
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,849
- What?
- Did they offer any deals?

532
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:15,950
- To me?
- Yes.

533
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,990
(Reading the room)

534
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,059
Are they trying to win you over?

535
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,089
Gina, go over there for a minute.

536
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,359
Okay.

537
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:25,700
Poor her.

538
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
- Sorry.
- Poor me.

539
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,369
- She's an outcast.
- We don't have a choice.

540
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,500
I'm an outcast.

541
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,970
I've always been an outcast.

542
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,809
So...

543
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,740
(Eon Kyu sighing)

544
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:41,809
What is it?

545
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,680
- Are they up to something?
- Tell us if they told you anything.

546
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,450
Or you can tell us your opinion. Anything.

547
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,349
I haven't heard anything from them.

548
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:50,990
What they said was,

549
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,490
"Now that you've joined our team,"

550
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,160
"you can betray us if you want..."

551
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,730
"or stick with us if not."

552
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,059
So, I'm not sure...

553
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,630
what to do.

554
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,940
I should probably set my mind
in one direction today.

555
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,970
Okay.

556
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,109
Why don't we listen to your opinion first
if you have one?

557
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,779
We can wait
if you haven't organized your thoughts.

558
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,440
I'll tell you what it is.

559
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,579
I don't think they'll give me
any important information...

560
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,079
or any important roles.

561
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,150
- That's true.
- I can't help that.

562
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,750
- Right.
- That's a given.

563
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,089
It's a given.

564
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,390
- And I might stir up confusion...
- By giving fake info?

565
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,529
by giving you fake information.

566
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,259
I don't want to make all seven of them...

567
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,099
my enemies...

568
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,069
in the individual match
by being a clumsy spy.

569
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:39,970
Six enemies, I mean.

570
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,710
It's been a while since I last saw you...

571
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:44,440
in such a difficult situation.

572
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,109
You should decide on what to do.

573
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,579
I think they took you,
knowing that you wouldn't be a spy.

574
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:50,950
They figured out your inclination.

575
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,880
They must have.

576
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,819
All right, then. We see what you mean.

577
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,319
We don't know what the game is,

578
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,660
so don't jump to conclusions just yet.

579
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,319
Good luck with choosing your path.

580
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,190
- Yes.
- That'll be more helpful to us.

581
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,200
We'll both be confused
if I don't decide on what to do.

582
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,029
I want you to go back and forth,
even if it doesn't mean anything...

583
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:09,470
so that they'll be confused.

584
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,799
Just come around and chit-chat with us.

585
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,869
- Okay, then.
- You don't need to give us info.

586
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,609
- Have fun getting to know them.
- Okay.

587
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,740
We'll come to visit you.

588
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,210
Bye.

589
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:19,640
Good luck.

590
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,779
Cheer up.

591
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,180
They took the least dangerous player...

592
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:27,420
and sent the player
who was obviously our target.

593
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,849
Should we bring Gina here and talk to her?

594
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,990
There's no need to lock her up.

595
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,619
I feel bad to leave her alone like that.

596
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,430
Gina.

597
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,430
Why did you take on the mission?

598
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,099
I don't have a mission.

599
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,559
You can be honest with Team Mansion.

600
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,700
- Did you agree to it?
- I don't...

601
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,539
No. I told you he notified me.

602
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,440
There weren't any deals?

603
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,210
I'm serious. I don't have a mission.

604
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,369
- I know it's hard to believe.
- Yes.

605
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,609
Of course, it's hard to believe.

606
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,710
- I wouldn't believe it either.
- That's not it.

607
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,109
Anyway, he just told me to be here.

608
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,619
But I actually...

609
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,450
feel unsafe at the moment.

610
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,789
I'm going to do my best
so that this team wins.

611
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,490
- We also want you to do your best.
- Right.

612
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,990
But here's the problem.

613
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,829
Yes. You must be worried
that I'll leak your information.

614
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,430
Did he guarantee your survival?

615
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,829
- He said he would. But I'm not sure.
- But if we...

616
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,640
make you place last, he can't save you.

617
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
That's what I'm saying.

618
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:21,970
But he still told you to go?

619
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,970
I'm not so sure right now.

620
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,079
So, I don't want this team to lose...

621
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,880
because I also feel unsafe.

622
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,450
So, what Gina is saying is...

623
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,819
that she ended up here
without any heads-up.

624
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,549
You don't know their intention,

625
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,049
but you want to win
since you're here, after all.

626
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,289
Is that right?

627
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,359
You should try your best.

628
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,859
All players,
please gather at the Main Hall.

629
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,400
Today's Money Challenge is a team match.

630
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,269
I know.

631
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:55,309
All members of the winning team will be
given 20,000 dollars of private funds...

632
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,069
and Immunity Passes.

633
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,240
The losing team must take a vote...

634
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,009
to choose its elimination candidates.

635
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,079
The two elimination candidates...

636
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,619
will have a 1-on-1 Deathmatch.

637
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,380
The loser will be eliminated.

638
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,619
Two players on one team are going
to the Deathmatch.

639
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,819
According to the result of the team match,
the losing team must...

640
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,920
move to the Remaining and survive.

641
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,829
Oh, we're going to the Remaining.

642
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,559
I'll do my very best.

643
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,740
I'll give my everything!

644
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,170
That doesn't sound right.

645
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,410
I'll give my everything.
I don't want to go to the Remaining.

646
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,509
Don't make me do anything.

647
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,950
I'll never be a spy.

648
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,519
I can't go to the Remaining.

649
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,019
Today's Money Challenge is
Criminal Memory.

650
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,160
Criminal Memory is a team match.

651
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,430
Players must piece together clues
related to a fictional case.

652
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,490
The goal is to work together as a team
to analyze the clues...

653
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,599
and combine the information to uncover
the full story behind the case...

654
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,230
before the opposing team does.

655
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,500
At the start of the game,
an overview of the case is revealed.

656
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,569
The 1st set of 7 clues is distributed,

657
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,109
with 1 clue placed
in each of the 7 clue rooms.

658
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:08,180
Each player is assigned
to a specific clue room...

659
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,710
and has ten minutes
to check the clues in that room.

660
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,220
No communication is allowed
while the players are in the clue rooms.

661
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,660
After the ten-minute period,
all members gather in the headquarters...

662
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,259
to share information
and combine the clues...

663
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,259
to analyze the story behind the case.

664
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,670
If a player wishes to recheck a clue,
they can return to the clue room...

665
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,599
to review the clue for ten minutes.

666
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:35,769
Forty minutes
after the first clue set is revealed,

667
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,869
the first set of clues disappears,

668
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,539
and the second set of seven clues
is placed in the clue rooms.

669
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,980
The players follow the same process
as with the first clue set,

670
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,650
where they each check one clue...

671
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,089
before returning to the headquarters
and continue their deduction.

672
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:52,089
The teams can use the Sharing Item...

673
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,829
on either a first-set clue
or a second-set clue,

674
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:58,259
but they can only use it once
during the entire game.

675
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,000
The chosen clue is revealed
to all team members.

676
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,869
Once a team finishes its deduction,
the players can enter the Main Hall...

677
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,569
to answer the five case questions.

678
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,440
The questions are revealed in an order
from 1 to 5,

679
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:13,579
and each following question is revealed...

680
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,349
only after the previous question
is answered correctly.

681
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:19,579
If a team gives the wrong answer,
the currently revealed case questions...

682
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:21,549
are displayed to all the players,

683
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,859
and the right to answer is transferred
to the opposing team for ten minutes.

684
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,529
But the final question is only revealed
in the Main Hall.

685
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:33,099
The team that
submits an answer is isolated,

686
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,500
regardless of whether their answer
is correct or not,

687
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,200
and must wait until the opposing team
also submits their answer.

688
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,539
Once both teams have submitted
their answers,

689
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,240
the result is announced.

690
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,039
If both teams answered correctly,

691
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,680
the team that submitted
their answer first wins.

692
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,180
If both teams answered incorrectly,
both teams resume their investigation...

693
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,119
until one team gets
the correct answer first.

694
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,049
I was pretty confident in memorization.

695
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,950
I knew I had better memory than my peers,

696
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,759
but the game was called Criminal Memory.

697
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,920
I couldn't tell what the clues would be.

698
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,589
Also, even if I memorize them all,

699
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,700
we need to check different clues...

700
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,769
in our respective clue rooms
and combine the information.

701
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,339
It sounded like a 7-legged
or 6-legged race to me.

702
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,509
You do have the upper hand
if you have more members,

703
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,069
but it sounded like it required
some imagination.

704
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,980
And you need to have a good memory.

705
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:22,980
It sounds like a fusion of two games.

706
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,049
So, I thought our team had
evenly distributed talents.

707
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,990
You will check your private funds
before the team match.

708
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,789
Please take turns
to enter the voting room.

709
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,490
Hye Seon, your private funds...

710
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,289
are 43,000 dollars.

711
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:39,930
Yurisa, your private funds...

712
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,599
are 47,000 dollars.

713
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,730
Jin Ho, your private funds...

714
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,569
are 66,000 dollars.

715
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,839
Dong Min, your private funds...

716
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,609
are 307,000 dollars.

717
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,369
(Steve has 13,000 dollars.)

718
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,579
(Xitsuh has 10,000 dollars.)

719
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,279
(Seong Beom has 55,000 dollars.)

720
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,950
(MJ has 57,000 dollars.)

721
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,609
(Acau has 130,000 dollars.)

722
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,950
(Min A has 80,000 dollars.)

723
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,279
(Eon Kyu has 9,000 dollars.)

724
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,450
(Chungju-Man has 10,000 dollars.)

725
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,890
Gina, your private funds...

726
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,220
are 50,000 dollars.

727
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,490
- Okay.
- There's an additional announcement.

728
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,660
You have been selected
by another player...

729
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,400
as an elimination candidate.

730
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,130
(Someone made her
an elimination candidate.)

731
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,369
What?

732
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,099
(Someone made her
an elimination candidate.)

733
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:39,990
You will only be excluded...

734
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,460
from being an elimination candidate
if you obtain an Immunity Pass...

735
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,460
in today's team match.

736
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,029
Please go back to the Main Hall and wait.

737
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,369
Am I allowed to ask questions?

738
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,839
Yes.

739
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,069
Do I get an Immunity Pass
only by placing first?

740
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,609
You will be excluded
from being an elimination candidate...

741
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,710
only by winning in today's team match...

742
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,380
and obtaining an Immunity Pass.

743
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,389
- Okay.
- Please wait at the Main Hall.

744
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,449
One more question.

745
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,559
Am I the only one who's been chosen
as an elimination candidate?

746
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,760
Or are there multiple people?

747
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,960
I cannot tell you that.

748
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,590
This is driving me insane.

749
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,760
Okay, then.

750
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,699
What is happening?

751
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:26,469
Gosh.

752
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,369
What on earth is going on?

753
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,440
I was selected by another player...

754
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,679
as an elimination candidate.

755
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,280
I was so puzzled...

756
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,880
and didn't even know what it meant.

757
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,579
Why would anyone choose me?

758
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,489
It felt like
the whole universe was against me.

759
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,389
You added that so that we'd play hard.

760
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,960
About the two players
who have been traded...

761
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,690
To make it fair...

762
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,460
for everyone here,

763
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,329
let's cut their tongues off
in front of everyone.

764
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:01,400
We'll cut out
their tongues, ears, and eyes.

765
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,769
So that they can't see or do anything.

766
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,769
That's what that knife is for.

767
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,420
I bet Pani Bottle would be good at this.

768
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,190
But this...

769
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,789
Well, it's just that I'm not sure.

770
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,599
We'd be a fool to betray our team
based on these rules.

771
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:29,099
As I was listening earlier...

772
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,130
You seemed devastated.

773
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,340
Could you tell?

774
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,039
I'm having a mental breakdown.

775
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,269
- I couldn't hear the rules.
- You have to win now.

776
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,670
- I didn't get the rules.
- Right.

777
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,179
And Eon Kyu can't lose either.

778
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,840
We all have to win.

779
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,309
We can survive...

780
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,480
only if we work as a team.

781
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,150
Then, what was their plan...

782
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,449
Did they just abandon me?

783
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,150
- I just don't get it.
- Right.

784
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,690
That's how it turned out.

785
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,289
This game...

786
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,489
is totally based on trust,

787
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,559
so we need to start
by trusting each other.

788
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,329
It's true that we're doomed
if we betray each other.

789
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,329
But just like all the previous games,

790
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,230
it seems unnecessary to talk...

791
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,929
- about who the traitor is.
- Right.

792
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,769
It'll only lower our morale.

793
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
- Okay.
- Let's trust each other.

794
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,639
- I wish Eon Kyu would betray them.
- Let's just play the game.

795
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,170
Let's go. Let's play hard.

796
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,280
Let's try and win this one.
No betrayal, okay?

797
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,679
Once, we can ask...

798
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,380
to review one room,

799
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,550
whether it's in Round 1 or Round 2,

800
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,920
and enter the room as a whole team.

801
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:25,960
So, there's one Sharing Item
for each team.

802
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,789
- I think so.
- What's a Sharing Item?

803
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,889
We can use the Sharing Item...

804
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,889
- to share the room with everyone.
- Everyone will know the clue.

805
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,829
But we can only use it once
in the entire game.

806
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,769
What does it mean
that everyone will know the clue?

807
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,829
Everyone will be able to see
the clue in that room.

808
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,400
- We'll re-enter the room.
- One room.

809
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,969
We can all enter a room as a group.

810
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,210
Oh, the whole team.

811
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,409
We can check out one room
by using the Sharing Item.

812
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,110
There are 14 rooms
since there are 2 rounds.

813
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,809
- Is it two rounds?
- Yes.

814
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,320
What have you been doing?

815
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,420
Just so you know,
there are two rounds of clues.

816
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,019
- Yes.
- Not two cases.

817
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,690
- So, we use a total of 14 clues...
- The clue rooms.

818
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,260
- to answer five questions.
- Exactly.

819
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,429
But the problem is...

820
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,300
that I want to go to the bathroom.

821
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,829
- Go ahead.
- You can go.

822
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,329
The strategy that I came up with is...

823
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,940
(Glaring)

824
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,099
When we're in the headquarters...

825
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,079
I understand why I'm so nervous,

826
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,809
but why was Steve so nervous
to listen to the rules?

827
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,980
Him? I think he just dozed off.

828
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,519
Steve has been...

829
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,989
bullying me and yelling at me
for joining this team...

830
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,619
and called me a traitor.

831
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,030
He should be yelling at me
as if it was a joke.

832
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,559
But he didn't do anything like that.

833
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,500
And he seemed pretty tense.

834
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,869
So, I kept asking,

835
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,670
"Why does Steve look so nervous?"

836
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,170
I thought, "Did he pick me
as an elimination candidate?"

837
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,269
"But why?"

838
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,409
I had all kinds of thoughts.

839
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,050
- Should we go to our room, then?
- Yes.

840
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,650
We'll enter the room one by one.

841
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,889
I've been on many detective shows, right?

842
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,090
Let me explain.

843
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,230
When you're trying to collect information,

844
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:12,260
if you start with things
that repeat or stand out,

845
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:15,199
it only gets tougher.

846
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:19,369
A ten-minute limit may sound long,
but it's very short.

847
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,070
For instance,

848
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,510
if it's a place,
you should never touch it.

849
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,369
You can only stare at it.

850
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,210
And they said we'd get a chance
to review a room for ten minutes.

851
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,610
When we re-enter the room,

852
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,949
you can damage the scene.

853
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,320
Once you think, "Where was this placed,"

854
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,289
you're finished.

855
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,460
That's how you collect information
from a place.

856
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,760
But we're supposed to find the culprit.

857
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,860
We're investigating a case, right?

858
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,000
So, we need to make sure
what belongs to whom.

859
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,969
You get the content right
but don't know who it belongs to...

860
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:53,940
If you go, "Not me..."

861
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,579
Don't just wonder,
"Why did they put it like this?"

862
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:01,510
They're all clues.

863
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,349
You need precise and detailed information.

864
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,019
(Jin Ho)

865
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:10,289
(Tiptoeing)

866
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:13,320
Now, I'll tell you
how we're going to have a meeting.

867
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,719
This is the photo of the scene.

868
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,730
There's blood and everything.

869
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,300
You can't try to solve the case with this.

870
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:22,429
Your job is to capture it
as if it was a photo...

871
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,969
and brief us on that photo in detail.

872
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,500
You can't say, "My guess is this."

873
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,769
Once your assumption is involved,

874
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:32,940
you'll think, "Look at his face.
I think he killed her."

875
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,710
Then, you won't be able
to see his face objectively.

876
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,809
We only share the facts...

877
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,420
and never make assumptions...

878
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,019
until we hear from everyone.

879
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:44,650
If you go, "This must be it,"

880
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,260
the story changes from the next person.

881
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,130
You're saying
that there will be a confirmation bias.

882
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,590
That was a good tip.

883
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,030
- I love it.
- This should be fun.

884
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,429
How much do I owe you?

885
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,800
This class was pretty tough,

886
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,199
so you can pay me 30,000 dollars each.

887
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,840
If you invite me
to another competition show,

888
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I'll be sure to help you out.

889
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:04,440
He was a guide.

890
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,480
You're a guide.

891
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,610
It sounds like
they already came up with a strategy.

892
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:12,949
What's there to strategize about?

893
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:13,949
How did they come up with a strategy?

894
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:14,949
When I walked over to their room,

895
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,119
I eavesdropped
on the last part of their meeting.

896
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,219
As expected, Dong Min
was giving them a lecture or something.

897
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,159
I overheard the last part,
and this is what he said.

898
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:24,860
"Don't make assumptions
and tell us what you think it means."

899
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,829
- So...
- Don't make any subjective judgment?

900
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,059
Right. It's something like that.

901
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,670
I only caught the last part of it.

902
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,730
It's not a grand plan or anything.
You know?

903
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,699
But everyone there said,
"This is amazing. It's a great plan."

904
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,110
Why is that amazing?

905
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,139
He must have said something else
before that.

906
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,940
- What's amazing?
- I wanted to eavesdrop on them more,

907
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
but I was too scared to stay there.

908
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,780
You finally spied on them.

909
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,349
But I didn't get
any important information.

910
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,679
What could they be planning?

911
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,420
Players, please come to the outdoor arena.

912
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:55,289
Let's go.

913
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,630
Nice. Let's go and catch the culprit.

914
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,900
This is the perfect day to be a detective.

915
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,530
(The 7-player team)

916
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,340
(The 6-player team)

917
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,940
This is a great day
for one of them to die.

918
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,750
Submit the list of players
who will enter...

919
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,190
each clue room.

920
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,190
I think Xitsuh will enter Rooms 6 and 7.

921
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
He will check two rooms at once.

922
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,260
To prepare for that scenario,

923
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,289
for the rooms we get to check alone,

924
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,530
Eon Kyu should check
either Room 6 or Room 7.

925
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,199
- You should.
- Right.

926
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,030
- Seven?
- Okay. Lucky seven.

927
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,940
Dong Min, you take the center room.

928
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,570
Submit the list of players,
assigned to the clue rooms.

929
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,340
(Room 1: Yurisa, Room 2: Acau,
Room 3: MJ Kim, Room 4: Jang Dong Min,)

930
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,250
(Room 5: Heo Seong Beom,
Room 6: Kim Min A, Room 7: Joo Eon Kyu)

931
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,119
The order doesn't matter a lot
except for Rooms 6 and 7.

932
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,650
Right? So Xitsuh will take Rooms 6 and 7.

933
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,719
Since the rest doesn't matter much,
I'll put our names down arbitrarily.

934
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,719
(Xitsuh will check two rooms.)

935
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,289
I would not say that...

936
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:03,190
I have a great memory.

937
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,960
But this requires a sense of imagination
and reasoning ability,

938
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,130
so I will be checking two clue rooms.

939
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,130
I decided to focus on memorizing...

940
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,840
as many clues as possible from the rooms.

941
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,599
- Will you go into Room Two?
- Yes.

942
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,369
I always go with number two.

943
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,380
- That's my signature.
- I'll take Room Three.

944
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,309
- Okay. Room 3.
- Room 3.

945
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,949
Steve, take Room Four.

946
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,449
Four means death. Why me?

947
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,780
Gina should take it.
She'll die anyway today.

948
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,780
- Just in case.
- You're too mean.

949
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:33,019
Submit the list of players,
assigned to the clue rooms.

950
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,059
(Room 1: Choi Hye Seon,
Room 2: Hong Jin Ho,)

951
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:38,090
(Room 3: Chungju-Man, Room 4: Lee Gina,
Room 5: Steve Yea, Room 8: Xitsuh)

952
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:42,000
Criminal Memory will begin shortly.

953
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,369
Before the first set of clues is revealed,

954
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,199
please go over the case overview.

955
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:52,110
(A murder case in an abandoned building)

956
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:54,239
On July 15, 2024,

957
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,349
a famous YouTuber, Danielle Rodriguez,

958
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:00,449
was found dead in an abandoned building.

959
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,719
Here are the findings
of the police's initial investigation.

960
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,019
To film a horror video,
the YouTuber visited...

961
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,590
the abandoned building.

962
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:12,190
A total of six people visited
the abandoned building.

963
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:15,800
A famous YouTuber, Danielle Rodriguez.

964
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:19,440
The YouTuber films all kinds of videos...

965
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,800
with a variety of themes
ranging from vlogs, the wild, and camping.

966
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,510
To film a horror video,

967
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,139
the YouTuber gathered people
and visited the abandoned building.

968
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,539
But the YouTuber was found dead.

969
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,179
A rookie YouTuber who is on the rise...

970
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,119
and received a lot of help from Danielle.

971
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,449
Two influencers who are a couple...

972
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,449
and famous on social media.

973
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,920
A popular idol star who is known
as Danielle's best friend.

974
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,730
Danielle's longtime fan and subscriber.

975
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:49,469
There was an argument among the people...

976
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:50,969
who visited the abandoned building.

977
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:52,869
And the filming was stopped for a while.

978
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:56,840
After people scattered,
there was a scream.

979
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,380
Then the YouTuber was found dead.

980
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,010
Investigate the case.

981
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,949
And get to the bottom of the murder case
in the abandoned building.

982
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,320
(Characters)

983
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,449
(Danielle Rodriguez: A famous YouTuber)

984
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,590
(Rookie YouTuber:
Received a lot of help from Danielle)

985
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,750
(Popular idol: Danielle's best friend)

986
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,889
(Influencer couple:
Famous on social media)

987
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,019
(Subscriber: Danielle's fan)

988
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,920
- Danielle Rodriguez.
- Yes.

989
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:18,360
- Since this is a foreign name,
- Yes.

990
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,400
- getting the name right will be tough.
- I can't see.

991
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:23,269
- The rookie YouTuber's name isn't here.
- Right.

992
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,369
That could be a question too.

993
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,730
- None of their names are revealed.
- Right.

994
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,500
- There will be five questions, right?
- Yes.

995
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,340
They might be about these people.

996
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,309
Take a look at this.

997
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,010
It says, "Here are the findings..."

998
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,750
"of the police's initial investigation."

999
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,750
- Yes.
- Right.

1000
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,050
- There might be statements.
- Right.

1001
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,989
The content of the statements
will be really long.

1002
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:49,119
It said there were six of them.

1003
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,630
They must have formed relationships.

1004
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,699
I bet their relationships are entangled.

1005
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,630
Here's an example.

1006
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,170
This person is
Danielle's longtime fan and subscriber.

1007
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,039
- But this fan could turn out...
- Okay.

1008
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,940
- to be Danielle's ex-lover.
- Yes.

1009
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,440
- There must be a history with everyone.
- Right.

1010
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,579
Their relationships could be messy.

1011
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,210
Then we must memorize this first.

1012
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,550
Let's carefully read
the case overview again.

1013
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,090
Here's the thing
about planned games like this.

1014
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,960
"Someone from the Himalayas
was the murderer."

1015
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,019
"It was a random killing."

1016
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,019
That wouldn't make sense.

1017
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,800
Someone had complicated the case
for this game.

1018
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,929
If so, everyone's interests
must be entangled.

1019
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:31,800
My guess would be that
they must have a messy history.

1020
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,869
Take a look.
They went there to film a horror video.

1021
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,039
There's an idol star who is known
to be Danielle's friend.

1022
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,869
It says this idol star is popular.

1023
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,440
There must be a reason
the idol star joined the filming.

1024
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,409
- Probably.
- And since their names aren't revealed,

1025
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:44,579
if we see drawings of the characters,

1026
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,849
pay attention to their appearances
to identify each one.

1027
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:47,949
- We can use that to identify them.
- Right.

1028
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,590
And take a look at this one.

1029
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,250
The influencer couple.

1030
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,289
They're all famous.

1031
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,530
This one is a rookie YouTuber on the rise
who's getting help from Danielle.

1032
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:58,090
Here's what we can assume then.

1033
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,260
This YouTuber went
to be in Danielle's good graces.

1034
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:02,300
Just like it says in the case outline,

1035
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:07,070
there was an argument among the people
in the abandoned building.

1036
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,570
It just says it was among the people.

1037
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,809
- We don't know who argued.
- Right.

1038
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,840
That's important too.

1039
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,940
I'm sure
everyone has a motive to kill Danielle.

1040
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,610
The same goes for these characters.

1041
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,610
So look.

1042
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,280
One, two, three, four,

1043
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,750
- and five. So one of them is the culprit.
- Yes.

1044
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,619
Then someone must hold a grudge.

1045
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,420
But here's what we need
to pay attention to overall.

1046
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
It's the timeline.

1047
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:32,190
It happened on July 15, 2024.

1048
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,130
If there's an estimated time of death,

1049
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,500
there must be a series of actions
other characters took.

1050
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:40,739
The timeline is very important.

1051
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,440
And after they scattered,

1052
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
they heard the scream.

1053
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,710
Like the surveillance footage,

1054
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,710
a few of them might be arranged
chronologically.

1055
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,110
We must pay a lot of attention
to the timeline.

1056
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,579
They could've dropped
their belongings too.

1057
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,920
I worry that
there might be some fake clues.

1058
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,059
So anything relevant to dates and time
is important.

1059
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,090
- July 15.
- Yes.

1060
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,360
I bet the story is complicated.

1061
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,889
- Right. I bet it's complicated.
- "The clues..."

1062
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,530
I bet this goes back to the history
between the characters...

1063
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,699
and so on.

1064
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:12,530
Anyway, when we gather later,

1065
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,500
- let's share only facts.
- Yes.

1066
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,469
- Or this will get confusing.
- Okay.

1067
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,010
So no guesses?

1068
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,210
- No. Just tell us the facts.
- Gather objective information first.

1069
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,210
- Just information.
- Yes.

1070
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:24,150
If there are things you can guess
with your subjective opinions,

1071
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,610
let's talk about them separately.

1072
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,780
We'll talk about them separately.
If it makes sense,

1073
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,980
we'll share it with the group.

1074
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,650
The key point of the game
was the memorization skill.

1075
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:34,519
We had to go to assigned places,

1076
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,460
read or look at something,
and then share everything.

1077
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,860
We had to use the memorized information
to solve the problem.

1078
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:41,429
My role was important in the game,

1079
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:43,570
but the other players had
important roles too.

1080
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,400
How should we organize the clues?

1081
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,039
Should we share them
with the entire group?

1082
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,900
Or should we share them
only with one person?

1083
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,570
So we'll meet back again...

1084
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:54,039
after ten minutes.
We'll come out at the same time.

1085
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:55,809
Since we come out at the same time,

1086
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:57,510
if this is tough on you,
should we start with you, Xitsuh?

1087
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,550
- Then should we go in order?
- Yes.

1088
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:00,449
- That'd be nice.
- He'd have the most.

1089
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,880
So we'll share all the clues
with everyone.

1090
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,650
So everyone will remember the clues...

1091
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,889
and then figure out the culprit together?

1092
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,489
- Okay.
- Great.

1093
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,260
(Picking)

1094
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,630
After we talk about them...

1095
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,829
We have to remember how the room looked.

1096
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,570
Let's go with that for now.
We can think more later.

1097
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:21,170
- Three?
- Yes.

1098
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:23,739
- Jin Ho, come here.
- You know?

1099
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:25,510
- We should all talk there.
- Come here.

1100
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,340
Come here.

1101
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,409
Jin Ho.

1102
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,210
Be quiet.

1103
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,920
We can scratch it.

1104
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,449
We can write on the wooden table.

1105
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,789
I wanted to use a trick.

1106
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:41,420
I didn't know what to memorize.

1107
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,630
I figured there could be
a lot of information to memorize.

1108
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,400
There was a wooden table.

1109
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,900
I used my fingertips to press on it.

1110
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,599
I could make scratches.

1111
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,929
When they were planning,

1112
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,369
I picked up a few stones.

1113
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,239
I said we could write some things
if we couldn't remember them.

1114
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,510
Since the game is based on our memory,

1115
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,340
we weren't allowed to have any tools
we could make notes with.

1116
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,349
But Chungju-Man picked up some stones...

1117
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:05,510
from somewhere.

1118
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,550
So once we come out of the room,

1119
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:11,420
we should stand
in front of the table first.

1120
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,820
Let's stand there first,
so we can hide each other writing things.

1121
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,920
- We have to cover each other.
- Yes.

1122
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,489
We have to write them down
the moment we come back.

1123
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:19,389
But if no one is there, we have to
get people to cover each other.

1124
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,059
So as soon as we come back,

1125
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,429
let's line up around the table,
so we can cover each other.

1126
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,639
Keep going over the clues in your head.

1127
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,639
We will now reveal the first set of clues.

1128
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,039
Players, go to the clue rooms
in the Underground Prison.

1129
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,280
Check the clues assigned to you...

1130
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
for the next ten minutes.

1131
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,449
- You know what to do, right? Let's go.
- Let's go.

1132
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,280
Let's go.

1133
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,750
Slowly. If you fall, you'll get hurt.

1134
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:43,219
Go slowly.

1135
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,059
You might get stung by a bee
when you run here.

1136
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,670
I'm so exhausted.

1137
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,750
(Choi Hye Seon and Yurisa
will check Room 1.)

1138
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,150
(Hong Jin Ho and Acau will check Room 2.)

1139
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:20,360
(Chungju-Man and MJ Kim
will check Room 3.)

1140
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,519
(Lee Gina and Jang Dong Min
will check Room 4.)

1141
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,360
(Steve Yea and Heo Seong Beom
will check Room 5.)

1142
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,500
(Kim Min A will check Room 6.)

1143
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,570
(Joo Eon Kyu will check Room 7.)

1144
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,670
(Xitsuh will check Room 8
which consists of Rooms 6 and 7.)

1145
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:37,469
(Xitsuh must memorize clues
from two rooms.)

1146
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,610
(All players are in the clue rooms.)

1147
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,760
(Room 1: Yurisa and Choi Hye Seon)

1148
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,230
I initially thought that there could be...

1149
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,960
murder weapon or some kind of object.

1150
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,599
But when I entered the room,
I saw a drawing.

1151
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,369
(Clue 1 in Round 1:
Exterior of the abandoned building)

1152
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:12,440
I tried my best
to memorize even the smallest detail...

1153
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,010
in the drawing.

1154
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:16,610
I memorized ten things...

1155
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,110
that stood out as clues and went back.

1156
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,989
(Room 2: Acau and Hong Jin Ho)

1157
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:28,760
(Clue 2 in Round 1: Filmed footage)

1158
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,659
(Numerous footprints
are densely shown in the drawing.)

1159
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,699
Everything can be a clue.

1160
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,869
I paid attention to any type of weaponry.

1161
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:40,969
I noticed the building
that was facing the people.

1162
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,099
The color of their hair and their outfits.

1163
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,010
I memorized everything I noticed.

1164
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,309
(Room 3: Chungju-Man and MJ Kim)

1165
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:53,320
(Clue 3 in Round 1: Tablet PC's screen)

1166
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:58,050
(The 7 photos are placed
in a chronological order.)

1167
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,420
I thought it was an important clue.

1168
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,960
This clue could shine light
on the timeline.

1169
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,130
I thought that my clue
could come in handy in figuring out...

1170
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,800
the sequence of the events.

1171
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:15,300
(And 1 video was recorded
on the day of the incident.)

1172
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:21,880
(Drawing in the air)

1173
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
(Nodding)

1174
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,619
Of all people, Dong Min and I ended up...

1175
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,690
in the same room.

1176
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,199
There was an autopsy report
in the room, nothing else.

1177
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,630
It was too simple.

1178
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,730
I could see her hair and facial features.

1179
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,440
I noticed such features.

1180
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,800
An important clue would be...

1181
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,670
the estimated time of death...

1182
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,769
and the cause of death which was falling.

1183
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:56,550
He kept giving me gestures
to tell me I had to give my team...

1184
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,909
false information.

1185
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,550
He used his hands to communicate.

1186
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,179
He circled the cause of death
with his finger.

1187
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,349
He made an X
when he pointed at the word, "falling."

1188
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,119
He suddenly did this.

1189
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,260
"She died from an injection."

1190
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,400
I couldn't get my head around this,
though.

1191
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:18,400
Here's the thing.
If I were to do what he told me to do,

1192
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,800
I would make my team lose.

1193
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,039
But I couldn't let that happen.

1194
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,340
I wasn't going to listen to him.

1195
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,639
He kept giving me these signals.

1196
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:25,639
I was like, "No way."

1197
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,139
They would catch on right away.

1198
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:28,909
At that moment, I said I got it.

1199
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,309
But he kept trying to communicate.

1200
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:33,449
If he calls me a traitor
because I didn't do what he wanted...

1201
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,119
Gosh, I would be so annoyed.

1202
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:36,690
So that's what happened.

1203
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,659
(Room 5: Heo Seong Beom and Steve Yea)

1204
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:49,429
The journal was written by the editor...

1205
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:52,400
who worked with the dead YouTuber.

1206
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,070
In the diary,
I found out there was a grudge.

1207
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,269
The editor was exploited
by the famous YouTuber.

1208
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,510
The YouTuber took advantage of the editor.

1209
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,849
"You're famous now.
But if I expose you, your career is over."

1210
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:06,750
In the journal,
the editor wanted to take revenge.

1211
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,780
(You ought to be ruined
for thinking people are tools.)

1212
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,789
(You crazy witch.
If I expose you, your career is over.)

1213
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,599
(Steve Yea came down from the clue room.)

1214
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,329
I thought we had too much time.

1215
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,469
The moment I got there,
I looked at the clue.

1216
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:26,070
I memorized everything...

1217
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,500
in a minute.

1218
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,570
But we were given ten minutes
to memorize this. That was too long.

1219
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,340
(Clue 6: Kim Min A)

1220
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,139
(Clue 7: Joo Eon Kyu)

1221
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,679
(Clues 6 and 7: Xitsuh)

1222
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,889
There was a lot of information.

1223
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:49,019
I thought, "I knew it.
This requires memorization skills."

1224
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,059
That's what I thought.

1225
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:52,989
I saw statements from three characters.

1226
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,800
It was the rookie YouTuber,
Ella's statement.

1227
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:58,230
The female influencer,
the girlfriend of the couple, Rosa.

1228
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,170
Then there was Claire, the idol star.

1229
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,139
The three statements were from them.

1230
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:03,909
In the statements,
I didn't spot any clues...

1231
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,239
that were critical or that important.

1232
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,380
"I was there when the incident happened."

1233
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,550
"My relationship with the deceased
is this."

1234
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,909
That's what the statements covered mostly.

1235
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,480
If they were on good terms or close.

1236
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,550
If their relationship
was strictly business.

1237
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,789
I didn't try to memorize
everything word for word.

1238
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:21,320
I tried to focus on understanding
the overall context.

1239
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:24,989
Then the second clue in the other room...

1240
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,530
showed the date
when she opened her channel.

1241
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,960
Then I saw the comments
the other characters wrote...

1242
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,599
on the screen.

1243
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,199
Like some kind of code,

1244
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:35,269
they hid birthdays in their usernames.

1245
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:38,369
For example, Ella was born
on December 30 in 1998.

1246
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:40,380
So I memorized the birthdays too.

1247
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:42,079
I also saw the search history.

1248
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,710
I memorized the order too.

1249
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,920
I saw a picture of Claire.
There were news articles too.

1250
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,579
I tried to memorize
as much information as possible.

1251
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,289
In the search history,

1252
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,690
statute of limitations for murder
was looked up.

1253
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,820
And as for the news articles,

1254
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:58,159
I saw other crime-related keywords
like "stalking."

1255
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,929
That made me think that...

1256
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:02,400
there could be another criminal case
other than the murder case.

1257
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,929
Time is up in Room Four.

1258
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:09,400
Time is up in Room One.

1259
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,269
Time is up in Room Two.

1260
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,110
Time is up in Room Five.

1261
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,010
Time is up in Room Three.

1262
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,820
Time is up in Room Eight.

1263
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,650
Time is up in Room Six.

1264
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,250
Time is up in Room Seven.

1265
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:40,170
(Glancing)

1266
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:45,510
You're back.

1267
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,179
(Engraving)

1268
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:57,250
When we came back,
I picked up the stone first.

1269
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:58,719
I wrote down some stuff...

1270
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,590
like the date of birth
and full names of the characters.

1271
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:02,960
That's what I wrote down.

1272
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,630
(Garnier, Martunez,)

1273
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,829
(Rubio)

1274
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,000
Let's talk about the clues we saw.

1275
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:12,369
- Okay.
- I saw a crime scene photo.

1276
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:13,840
It was a photo of the abandoned building.

1277
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,539
It was a seven-story building.

1278
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,570
Two buildings were connected
in the shape of giyeok.

1279
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,840
- On the right...
- How? Can you draw it?

1280
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,969
Sure. Like this. In the shape of giyeok.

1281
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,409
It had the shape of giyeok
from the aerial view.

1282
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:24,579
So there were
five units horizontally here.

1283
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:25,980
This building had six units.

1284
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,750
A coffee shop and a convenience store
are on the first floor.

1285
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,050
(Choi Hye Seon saw the same clues
as Yurisa.)

1286
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,849
There were 9 units and 3 entrances.

1287
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,150
And there was an entrance here.

1288
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:36,789
I think something could have happened
on the fourth floor.

1289
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,929
So the fourth floor...
Most of the windows were shattered.

1290
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:41,630
Only the windows on the fourth floor
had a different color.

1291
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,769
The windows on the fourth floor...

1292
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,170
were the most complete.

1293
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,309
- That's all I can think of.
- What do you mean by that?

1294
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,539
The other windows are broken
and shattered.

1295
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,710
The color of the windows
on the fourth floor is different.

1296
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,309
The windows on the fourth floor...

1297
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,550
Was the light on there?

1298
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,679
No. Because it was dark
around other broken windows.

1299
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:01,820
It was dark there.

1300
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,320
There can't be lights
since the building was abandoned.

1301
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,590
And...

1302
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,789
a chair was tilted over
outside the building.

1303
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,619
There was a small table.

1304
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:12,360
There were a small table and a chair...

1305
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
in front of the coffee shop.

1306
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,599
It was an abandoned building.
But there were a coffee shop...

1307
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:15,800
and a convenience store
on the first floor?

1308
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,170
Yes. They were outdated, though.

1309
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,570
- So they're not operational now.
- Yes.

1310
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,639
So they closed down.

1311
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:24,940
Everyone knew their information well.

1312
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,039
But it's hard to picture
other people's information.

1313
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:30,349
We have to use words to explain drawings.

1314
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,710
Since I don't know what they saw,

1315
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,179
I don't even know
if they're explaining it well.

1316
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:37,989
This game required a lot of skills.
Seriously.

1317
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,150
We had to remember it for a long time
and couldn't get confused.

1318
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:42,360
But we had to pick out
important information.

1319
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,860
We had to input new information
and memorize it.

1320
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,159
There were two doors.

1321
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,659
One led into a coffee shop.

1322
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,429
And the other one looked like
it would lead into a building.

1323
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:50,429
So there were two rooms.

1324
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:52,699
The door on the right was open.

1325
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,639
The door to the coffee shop was blocked
with a wooden plank.

1326
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:58,409
As for the balcony
in the five-unit building,

1327
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,639
only the top window was not broken.

1328
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,280
The windows were all broken for the rest.

1329
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:04,949
I saw signs on the building
such as "closure,"

1330
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:07,050
"for rent," and "inquire for rent."

1331
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,650
There was a convenience store
on the first floor.

1332
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,880
The condenser unit of an AC was there too.

1333
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,289
It was a crime scene photo.

1334
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:12,820
The photo was taken
from the outside of the building...

1335
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,360
where the incident took place.

1336
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,619
I noticed that
it was a seven-story building.

1337
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,190
There were signs on the building
like "for rent" and "inquire for rent."

1338
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,429
There was also a closure sign.

1339
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:23,969
I saw signs for a coffee shop
and a convenience store.

1340
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,630
There was a condenser unit of an AC.

1341
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,599
There were four bloodstains.

1342
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,269
There was a puddle on the ground.

1343
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:30,440
There were white stones on the ground.

1344
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,070
A big one and a small one
were on the ground.

1345
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,940
The balcony was
in the center of both buildings.

1346
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,280
The balcony on the left took up
enough space for two units.

1347
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,980
The balcony on the right took up
enough space for one.

1348
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,820
But the balcony on the seventh floor
wasn't shattered.

1349
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,260
Overall, the seventh floor had
the lowest number of shattered windows...

1350
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,889
compared to other floors.

1351
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:51,889
The building was in the shape of giyeok,
there were two sides.

1352
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:55,030
On the top floor of the left building,
there wasn't a balcony.

1353
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,630
Up to the fourth floor
of the building on the left,

1354
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,030
there had just glass windows
without any bars.

1355
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,199
I memorized this much.

1356
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:02,969
The players needed
to memorize things accurately...

1357
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,710
and gather to reinterpret in this game.

1358
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:08,179
It was much harder than I expected.

1359
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,679
- What was this picture about?
- The picture of the scene.

1360
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:12,849
Did it say so?

1361
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:13,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

1362
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,480
It's an abandoned building.

1363
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,750
The windows on the top three floors
had bars...

1364
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:22,460
and balconies.

1365
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,400
(The clue that Dong Min saw)

1366
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,329
(Autopsy Report)

1367
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,730
(Cause of death:
Head injury from the fall)

1368
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,469
The way I see it,

1369
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,170
what's important is the number of floors.

1370
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:38,409
- There are seven floors.
- It's...

1371
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:39,610
- Seven floors?
- Yes.

1372
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,139
Which floors have broken windows?

1373
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,380
All the windows are broken...

1374
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,449
- except...
- All seven floors?

1375
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:46,380
Except for the top...

1376
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,719
right balcony.

1377
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,420
It's the only one with unbroken windows
of all the balconies.

1378
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,690
A few guest rooms have unbroken windows.

1379
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,760
Four or five.

1380
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,159
Okay.

1381
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,289
But most of them are on the top floor.

1382
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,860
There were a few members
I thought would memorize well...

1383
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,059
such as Yurisa, Dong Min,

1384
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,429
and Min A, who is an announcer.

1385
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:05,030
Fortunately,

1386
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,429
Yurisa and Dong Min...

1387
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,739
were given a lot of important clues.

1388
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,699
Centering the two of them,

1389
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,969
we gathered the clues
and started reasoning.

1390
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,179
They were very trustworthy.

1391
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,510
I saw the recording screen
of a YouTube video...

1392
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,079
on the rooftop of the abandoned building.

1393
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,079
It was a recording screen...

1394
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,320
with a low battery.

1395
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,050
- You don't know whose it is?
- No.

1396
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:27,289
A woman and a man were standing together,

1397
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:29,320
facing outside.

1398
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,159
It was the rooftop
of the abandoned building,

1399
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:32,690
and there was the Building G
on the other side.

1400
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,630
The woman was opening her arms.

1401
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,800
She had brown hair.
She was in pink clothes.

1402
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,969
She was wearing a long skirt.

1403
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:39,630
She had long hair or short hair?

1404
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,269
- She had a bobbed hairstyle.
- A bobbed hairstyle.

1405
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,570
The man had blue hair.

1406
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,239
And he was wearing blue pants.

1407
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,679
On this side, there was a ladder.

1408
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:50,980
There was a ladder on the right bottom.

1409
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,550
On the left side, there was a box.

1410
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,949
Like some kind of wood.

1411
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:56,650
On top of that,

1412
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,250
there was an iron bat.

1413
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,090
- It looked like an iron pillar.
- Pipe?

1414
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,360
Pipe... It wasn't like a pipe.

1415
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,360
It was round.

1416
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:06,889
What did you say?

1417
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,960
Long iron stick.

1418
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,699
Where was the wood?

1419
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,570
It was on the bottom left on the rooftop.

1420
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:15,039
There was some kind of wood
on the rooftop?

1421
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,309
The two of them were standing
on the rooftop.

1422
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:20,340
On the bottom left,
there was a wooden board at the end.

1423
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,679
- A wooden board?
- A wooden board?

1424
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:22,840
Something like a wooden board.

1425
01:02:23,179 --> 01:02:24,949
There were a lot of footprints.

1426
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,550
The footprints had...

1427
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,650
a lot of lines,
but it's too complicated to tell you.

1428
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,920
- Around...
- How many people's footprints?

1429
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,090
How many different footprints were there?

1430
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,789
I meant to count them,

1431
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:38,389
but a lot of them were
unclear and ambiguous.

1432
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:39,889
So it was hard to count them.

1433
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,570
It would've been better...

1434
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,099
if Acau could tell us...

1435
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,940
what he saw more clearly...

1436
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,670
and precisely...

1437
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,780
because when I heard him explain stuff,

1438
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:56,940
I couldn't picture anything.

1439
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,650
I didn't know what he was saying.

1440
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,820
Acau talked too incoherently.

1441
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:04,389
He kept talking without a point.

1442
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,619
For example,

1443
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,690
if you're asked what you saw,
you've got to say like,

1444
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,389
"I saw a red ball."

1445
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,559
But he went like,
"There was a ball. It was red."

1446
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,960
"The ball had a shadow."

1447
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,659
I mean, it's only natural
that a ball has a shadow.

1448
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:16,400
He was this incoherent.

1449
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,369
So I couldn't hear any details.

1450
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,940
I meant to memorize...

1451
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,369
all the footprints there,

1452
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:26,170
but it actually wasn't easy.

1453
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,679
So I memorized some of them...

1454
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:29,940
and saved it...

1455
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,750
so that I would share it
with them later...

1456
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,280
when this clue turns out to be important.

1457
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,980
I thought if I shared
too much information,

1458
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,989
it'd only confuse...

1459
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,690
my teammates.

1460
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:42,860
I told them
only the important information.

1461
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,190
It wasn't a picture,
but a recording screen.

1462
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,489
A recording scene of a video.

1463
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,030
They seemed like a couple,
and they were on the rooftop.

1464
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:51,929
The man was doing this.

1465
01:03:52,269 --> 01:03:54,340
I could see his facial expression,
but he was facing a side.

1466
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,099
I'm not sure if it was intentional,

1467
01:03:56,269 --> 01:03:57,610
but he didn't look so happy.

1468
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,539
The woman seemed to be in a good mood.

1469
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:00,710
She was standing next to him like this.

1470
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:02,380
It was in the evening.

1471
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,710
The time was 10:39 p.m. on July 15.

1472
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,849
On the left side,
there was a wet pipe dropped on the floor.

1473
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:12,519
And across them, there was the Building G.

1474
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:14,190
(10:39 p.m.)

1475
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,489
(A wet pipe)

1476
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:16,690
(Building G across the couple)

1477
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,429
(Jin Ho memorized the core information.)

1478
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:20,559
There were darn many footprints
on the floor.

1479
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,500
Many footprints on the rooftop floor.

1480
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,030
Some of them belonged to the couple.

1481
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,829
Both of them came out through the door.

1482
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:28,199
But the door was closed.

1483
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,510
I saw all the footprints
in front of the door.

1484
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:33,710
There were five different kinds.

1485
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,980
(Footprint 1, Footprint 2, Footprint 3,)

1486
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,409
(Footprint 4, Footprint 5)

1487
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:42,820
(Unlike Acau who couldn't
differentiate the footprints,)

1488
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,820
(Jin Ho differentiated their shapes.)

1489
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,619
Let me tell you this and go again.

1490
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,559
There were three written statements.

1491
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:50,860
One of them...

1492
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,059
was made by Rosa,
the woman on the rooftop.

1493
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:55,300
Rosa Garnier.

1494
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,170
The rookie YouTuber,

1495
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,969
Ella Martinez.

1496
01:04:59,969 --> 01:05:02,070
And Claire Rubio, the idol singer.

1497
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:05,809
I saw some answers to a questioning.

1498
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:07,679
- By the police?
- Yes, police questioning.

1499
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,239
They were statements on July 16,

1500
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,510
the next day of the accident.

1501
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,150
There is a woman named Ella.

1502
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,849
To talk about her statement first...

1503
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:17,119
- What's her name again?
- Ella.

1504
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,250
- Ella?
- Yes.

1505
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,920
I forgot her full name.

1506
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,260
I memorized it, but I forgot.

1507
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,360
That's why I'm saying this.

1508
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,659
- Elena?
- Ella.

1509
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:25,789
- Ella?
- Ella.

1510
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,400
So...

1511
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:29,699
Well...

1512
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,730
It was so... Well...

1513
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,469
Claire...

1514
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,739
Gosh, I can't remember much about Claire.

1515
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,380
- It's okay. You can go take a clear look.
- Right.

1516
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,480
It will disappear eventually,
so go and take another look at it.

1517
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:47,780
(The 1st clue will disappear
when the 2nd clue is open.)

1518
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,820
I've come to know that I'm bad...

1519
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,889
at memorizing.

1520
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:53,989
(During the Deathmatch)

1521
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,920
(He was supposed to spot the difference
during Round 1.)

1522
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,730
- How many did you do?
- Three.

1523
01:05:58,730 --> 01:05:59,730
- Three?
- Yes.

1524
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:00,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1525
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,099
We're done.

1526
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,869
Joo Eon Kyu and Pani Bottle,

1527
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,670
you have failed.

1528
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,099
(He couldn't even memorize 3 things.)

1529
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:22,880
(He checks the full name again.)

1530
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,150
A little before 11 p.m.

1531
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,030
All three of them are female.

1532
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,030
And about the statements,
the YouTuber said...

1533
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:36,800
she used to hate her. She was exploited.

1534
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:39,300
She was called over for filming
and shoved around as a filming director.

1535
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,570
She was paid only 20 to 30 dollars.

1536
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,170
She wanted to kill the victim,

1537
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,239
but she had a lot to be paid,
so she didn't kill her.

1538
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,469
And...

1539
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:48,139
she was organizing stuff on the rooftop...

1540
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,739
when she found a tablet PC.

1541
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,909
There were so many pictures of Danielle...

1542
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,349
saved on it. So...

1543
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:59,090
She noticed someone coming
and hid herself.

1544
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,760
Then, she looked down
when she heard a scream...

1545
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,519
only to find Danielle dead.

1546
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,389
What time was it?

1547
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,230
- It didn't say anything about the time.
- It didn't?

1548
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,400
In the first...

1549
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,429
Rosa's statement was made...

1550
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:11,230
on the same July 16.

1551
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:15,269
Rosa's boyfriend is Roy.

1552
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,409
That day, Danielle told Roy...

1553
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,110
that he was close
to her ideal type of man.

1554
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,539
and kind of expressed her feelings to him.

1555
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,550
When she was asked where she was,

1556
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,849
she answered she was crying.

1557
01:07:26,849 --> 01:07:28,219
Who? Rosa?

1558
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:29,219
- Herself.
- Rosa?

1559
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:30,219
Yes.

1560
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:32,590
Danielle told her...

1561
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,920
that he was actually cheating with her.

1562
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,460
Danielle?

1563
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,130
They argued,
and she cried alone in hiding.

1564
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,500
Danielle and this man argued.

1565
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,130
No, the woman and Danielle.

1566
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,329
Danielle is a woman.

1567
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,199
- I see.
- Okay.

1568
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:48,599
- Right.
- Lastly, the idol singer...

1569
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,699
is Claire Rubio.

1570
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,969
Claire said she helped the victim
when she made a comeback...

1571
01:07:51,969 --> 01:07:53,269
and the victim helped her too.

1572
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,980
They seemed to have a fight,

1573
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,579
and she didn't want to be
subject to any gossip,

1574
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:57,610
- Who...
- so she stayed away.

1575
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,280
A little before 11 p.m.,

1576
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,119
Danielle started arguing with Rosa.

1577
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:05,420
A little before 11 p.m.?

1578
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,420
Yes.

1579
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,920
They started arguing
a little before 11 p.m.

1580
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:12,190
Because she was an idol singer,

1581
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,630
she felt like she shouldn't get involved.

1582
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,199
So she moved to another place.

1583
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,130
A while later,
she heard a scream and went to check.

1584
01:08:21,239 --> 01:08:22,569
She found Danielle dead.

1585
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:24,569
They actually had an affair
for a long time.

1586
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,770
She was aware of it.

1587
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,909
I saw someone's photo album.

1588
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:28,979
The recent picture was...

1589
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,779
on June 30,
and its title was "Darn Horrible."

1590
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:36,649
A woman with brown bobbed hair
and a man with blue hair...

1591
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:38,149
were kissing... No, putting arms
around each other's shoulders.

1592
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,989
There was this picture on June 30...

1593
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,390
with the title, "I'll Kill Her."

1594
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,430
The woman with brown bobbed hair
and the man with blue hair were kissing.

1595
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,600
A woman or a man with blue hair?

1596
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,659
- It's a man.
- A man?

1597
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:52,170
- The woman had brown curly hair.
- The man with blue hair.

1598
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,869
Wait. They're the couple
on the rooftop I saw.

1599
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:58,170
The woman had brown curly hair
and the man had blue hair.

1600
01:08:58,409 --> 01:08:59,470
They were kissing each other.

1601
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,039
It's plausible...

1602
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:04,010
that the man with blue hair is Roy.

1603
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:06,850
If it's him, he did cheat with her.

1604
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,420
On June 30, Danielle and Roy...

1605
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:10,850
- kissed each other.
- Right.

1606
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,319
The picture on June 30...

1607
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,060
is about Danielle and Roy together.

1608
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,229
On July 1, "Her Friend."

1609
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,100
The woman with brown bobbed hair
was seated by a table...

1610
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,569
across her friend with blonde long hair.

1611
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:28,569
And on July 10, "Her Friend."

1612
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,069
They were just side by side
in the picture.

1613
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:34,439
I can still describe the pictures
as they are.

1614
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:39,510
The woman with bobbed hair
and the man with blue hair...

1615
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,550
were kissing each other and putting arms
around each other's shoulders.

1616
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:43,180
They seemed affectionate.
They were on a date.

1617
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,050
Another picture was titled "Her Friend."

1618
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,090
It was a woman with blonde hair.

1619
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,689
There was this picture
titled as "Her Outing."

1620
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:52,789
The woman with bobbed hair
was holding a cup of coffee.

1621
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,659
One was titled "Her House."

1622
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,069
The woman with bobbed hair
was seated in front of a monitor.

1623
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,739
She was leaning on a chair
with her eyes closed...

1624
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:04,270
in another picture.

1625
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:07,069
The last one was a video.

1626
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:11,409
The woman with orange... Red long hair.
The man with blue hair...

1627
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,250
and the woman with brown bobbed hair.

1628
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:15,649
Yes, I remember all the details.

1629
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:17,050
(MJ Kim memorized
the details of every picture.)

1630
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,420
I was really surprised.

1631
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:22,189
MJ memorized the dates...

1632
01:10:22,189 --> 01:10:23,659
and all the details...

1633
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:26,029
so precisely.

1634
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,600
She surprised me.

1635
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:32,630
On July 1, the woman with blonde long hair
was staring at a phone.

1636
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,569
She seemed a little gloomy.

1637
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:35,640
Who was seated next to her?

1638
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,369
Her friend with blonde hair.

1639
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,170
It's too confusing because we talk...

1640
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:42,109
about those unidentified women
with different hair.

1641
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:43,539
- This is not precise.
- No, it's...

1642
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,949
Whenever it says "her,"

1643
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:47,250
it's the woman with brown hair.

1644
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,949
The woman with brown hair is Danielle.

1645
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:51,619
The woman with orange hair is Rosa.

1646
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,449
The way I see it,
whoever took these pictures...

1647
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,760
may be a subscriber.

1648
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,930
You know, there was this article
about a stalking subscriber.

1649
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,800
But it didn't say
whose photo album it was.

1650
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,000
Then, on July 1...

1651
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:06,329
"Her Friend."

1652
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,439
- Yes, her friend...
- With blonde hair.

1653
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:09,539
had blonde hair?

1654
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:12,810
She may be Claire Rubio.

1655
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,810
- Blonde hair.
- No.

1656
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:17,880
Did anyone see a picture of Claire?

1657
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,880
I saw her ad picture.

1658
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,119
Her ad picture?

1659
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:22,680
An ad picture and article picture of her.

1660
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:24,119
Blonde wavy long hair.

1661
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,250
- Right, it's the same.
- How long?

1662
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:26,789
Around this long.

1663
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:28,159
(Her friend is Claire Rubio,
the idol singer.)

1664
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:30,489
We went through a process...

1665
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:32,060
of identifying those in the pictures.

1666
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:34,729
And the clearest difference
was the hair color.

1667
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:38,170
Their hair colors were
evidently different...

1668
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,630
such as brown, red, yellow, and blue.

1669
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,600
It helped our reasoning.

1670
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,970
There's quite a lot...

1671
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:48,140
of information.

1672
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,079
All right, let's sum up.

1673
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:53,079
All the figures...

1674
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,180
are female
except for the boyfriend, right?

1675
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:57,920
Oh, and the subscriber.

1676
01:11:58,449 --> 01:12:01,819
His ID was just user something.

1677
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:04,060
But there was
an identifiable picture of him...

1678
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,630
next to his comment.

1679
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,600
It was a man with brown...
How should I put it?

1680
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,329
A man's usual hairstyle.

1681
01:12:11,329 --> 01:12:13,069
So the subscriber is a man?

1682
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:14,170
The subscriber is a guy.

1683
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,569
Danielle had coily hair
almost like Yoon Taek.

1684
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:17,670
- Right, curly hair.
- Wait, no.

1685
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,670
- Brown...
- The rookie YouTuber had coily hair.

1686
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,409
- What?
- The rookie YouTuber.

1687
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:23,979
- Are you sure?
- Danielle's hair...

1688
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,779
- was a little like...
- Wavy.

1689
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:27,680
- The ends were curly.
- Right, wavy.

1690
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:30,220
The rookie YouTuber had
coily hair like Yoon Taek.

1691
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,250
(Danielle, Ella)

1692
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,250
- Okay.
- What you just said...

1693
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,789
- What about you?
- I saw a journal.

1694
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,420
Whose journal?

1695
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,560
- The rookie YouTuber, I think.
- The rookie YouTuber.

1696
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:41,159
I saw a journal of the rookie YouTuber...

1697
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:43,199
named Ella Martinez.

1698
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,399
"We filmed all day long."

1699
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:48,600
"Does she think
I'm her maid or something?"

1700
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:50,800
"She shoved me around for ten hours..."

1701
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,640
"and said she'd pay me only 14 dollars."

1702
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,109
"I seriously want to report
that crazy wench."

1703
01:12:54,109 --> 01:12:55,779
"I'll make it big and crush her."

1704
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:58,310
Another journal on July 12.

1705
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:01,119
"She called me over all of a sudden..."

1706
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:02,880
"and made me drive,
saying she had a drink."

1707
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,590
"Doesn't she have money
to call a chauffeur service?"

1708
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,520
"That crazy wench.
I wish I could kill her."

1709
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:10,760
Tell us what you saw in the search box...

1710
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,859
of Danielle's computer again.

1711
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,029
What was on the top was
the most recent one.

1712
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,800
"Claire's new ad."

1713
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,869
"Roy's MBTI."

1714
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,630
"Rumors about the R-R couple's conflicts."

1715
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,869
"A statute of limitations for murder."

1716
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,100
"An abandoned building."

1717
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:30,079
The words that Danielle searched
basically are...

1718
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:31,180
important clues.

1719
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,210
They're very important.

1720
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:35,449
Danielle searched a statute
of limitations for murder, right?

1721
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:38,220
So the chances are high...

1722
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,220
that she wanted to kill someone.

1723
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,659
- No, it's rather...
- No?

1724
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:42,789
The way I see it,

1725
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,760
this word holds a crucial meaning.

1726
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:48,800
If Danielle had wanted to kill someone,

1727
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:50,260
she would've searched stuff...

1728
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,300
like how to murder someone.

1729
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:54,430
But she searched a statute
of limitations for murder.

1730
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,039
It means she's waiting for it to end.

1731
01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,810
- Right.
- It may be something from the past.

1732
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,909
- In the past?
- So...

1733
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:04,710
At the end of Ella's journal,

1734
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,149
it said, "Your streaming career
will be over..."

1735
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:08,350
"only if I spill the beans."

1736
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,880
Then, Danielle may have
murdered someone in the past.

1737
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,989
She may have wondered
when the statute of limitations was up...

1738
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:15,689
because she committed murder.

1739
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:16,689
Right.

1740
01:14:16,689 --> 01:14:19,289
For your information,
it was Danielle's laptop screen.

1741
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,130
Danielle's laptop screen.

1742
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:24,300
So it's most likely hers.

1743
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,899
Yes, she searched for those keywords.

1744
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,140
She searched "an abandoned building."

1745
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,539
Someone murdered Danielle...

1746
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,409
and looked up a statute
of limitations for murder...

1747
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:35,409
with Danielle's laptop.

1748
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:37,539
You don't know
where this laptop was found?

1749
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,579
(Is the search record
a trace of the culprit?)

1750
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,380
To sum up,

1751
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:44,279
we know the gender of the figures.

1752
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,819
In the given situation,

1753
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:48,859
the boyfriend of this couple...

1754
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,930
cheated on his girlfriend for a long time.

1755
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:56,199
His girlfriend found it out
and argued with him.

1756
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,100
And the rookie YouTuber...

1757
01:14:59,569 --> 01:15:01,170
was assumed to be on good terms with her,

1758
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:03,939
but it turned out she was rather bullied
without getting paid.

1759
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,210
I think all of us need to be aware...

1760
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,810
of the whole situation...

1761
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:10,079
behind this case.

1762
01:15:10,109 --> 01:15:12,210
And later when we're given
additional information...

1763
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,380
We have less time than I thought.

1764
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:17,479
It takes too much time talking.

1765
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:19,119
So when we share any information,

1766
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:22,460
let's filter what's important...

1767
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,619
and what's not.

1768
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,760
I'd like you to do that.

1769
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,760
I'll do just the same.

1770
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,699
All right, let's see.
There are six figures.

1771
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,270
Except for the dead victim,
there are five of them.

1772
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:39,670
You must all be aware...

1773
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,239
of what I saw.
The victim died from a fall.

1774
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:44,909
She died from a fall.

1775
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:49,680
You all know the relationships
of these five people, right?

1776
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,390
They're all connected,

1777
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,689
and they all have
good reasons to kill her.

1778
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:56,819
Any of them may have killed her
for a reason.

1779
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:58,130
(Danielle Rodriguez, a rookie YouTuber,)

1780
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,960
(a popular idol singer,
an influencer couple, a subscriber)

1781
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,229
(Danielle Rodriguez: A famous YouTuber,
Ella Martinez: A rookie YouTuber,)

1782
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,329
(Claire Rubio: Danielle's close friend
and an idol singer,)

1783
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:06,529
(Rosa and Roy: An influencer couple,
Danielle's YouTube fan)

1784
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,100
The clues for Round Two will be revealed.

1785
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:13,239
All players,
please move to Underground Prison...

1786
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:15,180
- and check the clues.
- Gosh.

1787
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,409
This is darn hard.

1788
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,630
(All the players have entered
the clue rooms.)

1789
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,810
(Room 1: Choi Hye Seon...)

1790
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,510
(and Yurisa)

1791
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:51,510
(Clue 1: A picture of the scene)

1792
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:56,619
(There are a lot of footprints
in the scene too.)

1793
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:00,090
First off, I saw bars on a balcony.

1794
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:02,760
I could tell it was one of the rooms
with a balcony.

1795
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:06,329
There were so many footprints
on the floor.

1796
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,229
I counted the different kinds,

1797
01:17:09,229 --> 01:17:10,329
and there were six.

1798
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:14,529
(Clue 1: Balcony)

1799
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:30,720
(Clue 2: 6 different footprints)

1800
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:35,420
It was showing that people came and went.

1801
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,930
(Room 2: Acau...)

1802
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:44,130
(and Hong Jin Ho)

1803
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,630
(Clue 2: Written statements of 2 people)

1804
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,539
(Name: Jose Mortin, Date: July 17, 2024)

1805
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,100
(What was your relationship
with the dead Danielle?)

1806
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,439
(I was her fan ever since she started
her YouTube channel.)

1807
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,369
(Did Danielle called you over
to the abandoned building herself?)

1808
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,479
(Name: Roy Ceres, Date: July 17, 2024)

1809
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:58,310
(What was your relationship
with the dead Danielle?)

1810
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,149
(My girlfriend, Rosa,
introduced me to her.)

1811
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:01,779
(Danielle expressed her feelings to me.
I was flustered because Rosa was there.)

1812
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:04,319
The first clue was an easy journal,

1813
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:05,449
but in the second clue,

1814
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,489
there were many descriptions...

1815
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:08,760
about going up and down.

1816
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:11,090
(Roy entered the abandoned building
with Danielle and Rosa.)

1817
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,189
(I rushed up to the rooftop.)

1818
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:14,899
(I went downstairs
when Danielle called me...)

1819
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,529
(as she went upstairs.)

1820
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,630
It wasn't easy to figure out...

1821
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,069
exactly which floor they were.

1822
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,340
I thought our reasoning
would get confusing...

1823
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:28,279
if I didn't share
this information correctly.

1824
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,090
(Room 3: MJ Kim...)

1825
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:41,420
(and Chungju-Man)

1826
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,460
(Clue 3: Danielle's laptop screen)

1827
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,789
(Photo evidence, Danielle's laptop screen)

1828
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:50,399
(Video files and the building's map)

1829
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:52,199
We'd agreed to bring objective information
and leave out...

1830
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,270
what was emotional.

1831
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,899
So I tried my best...

1832
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:56,399
to accurately deliver objective facts.

1833
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:04,909
(Room 4: Lee Gina and Jang Dong Min)

1834
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,720
(Clue 4: Someone's study)

1835
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,060
(There are footprints this time again.)

1836
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:21,659
I saw a picture of a study.

1837
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,199
It seemed like Danielle's room.

1838
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,630
One of the two different footprints...

1839
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:29,270
was facing toward the laptop...

1840
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:30,899
and then away from it.

1841
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,270
Whether this person checked
or deleted something,

1842
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:35,210
the purpose was to get rid of evidence.

1843
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:38,079
From this picture, I could guess...

1844
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,149
that these footprints were
those of the culprit.

1845
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,590
He enthusiastically made hand gestures,

1846
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:53,359
continuously asking
if I did the mission...

1847
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:54,729
he mentioned earlier.

1848
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:58,170
My survival was at stake.

1849
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,699
I didn't know what was going on.

1850
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:00,930
I had so much to think about.

1851
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:04,369
I motioned that I was frustrated.

1852
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,409
(Frustrated)

1853
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:14,180
I don't know how he understood it,

1854
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,380
but he made an okay sign
and gave me a break.

1855
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,420
I thought to myself, "That's meaningless."

1856
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,520
"That's meaningless right now."

1857
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,130
"I can only survive if I win."

1858
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:27,630
"A fortune of 260,000 dollars
is meaningless right now."

1859
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,930
I was busy and exhausted.

1860
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,399
I was all over the place.

1861
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:37,899
(Room 5: Heo Seong Beom and Steve Yea)

1862
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:46,979
(Clue 5: Ella's laptop screen)

1863
01:20:53,619 --> 01:20:55,619
I thought the difficulty level
would be the same as the first one.

1864
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,260
But there were a lot more details.

1865
01:20:58,289 --> 01:20:59,960
It was something like a laptop screen.

1866
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,630
In the middle was an editing program.

1867
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,100
On the memo pad, there were...

1868
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,270
so many bank statements.

1869
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,970
I did my best...

1870
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,569
to memorize them verbatim.

1871
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:16,979
(Room 6: Kim Min A)

1872
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,609
(Room 7: Joo Eon Kyu)

1873
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:20,710
July 15.

1874
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
(Room 8: Xitsuh)

1875
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,020
Okay.

1876
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:33,130
(Clue 6: 4 people's bank statements)

1877
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:34,260
As for the bank statements,

1878
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:37,359
I realized that there was no way...

1879
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,569
we were supposed to memorize the numbers.

1880
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,369
I decided to memorize...

1881
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:43,600
only the bank statements...

1882
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,600
that stood out.

1883
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,579
(Clue 7: Photo evidence)

1884
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,439
In some kind of a room,

1885
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:53,050
three people were standing.

1886
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:56,050
They seemed to be fighting in the photo.

1887
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:58,520
They were fighting...

1888
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,449
and there were footprints.

1889
01:22:01,789 --> 01:22:03,659
I thought that it was a hint.

1890
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:07,390
(Photo evidence)

1891
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:15,039
Time has run out in all clue rooms.

1892
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:16,899
Please go back to the headquarters.

1893
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,640
- May I go first?
- Yes.

1894
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,640
The ones with important clues
should go first.

1895
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:25,310
There were four people's bank statements.

1896
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:26,779
- Four people?
- Since there was so much information,

1897
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:28,319
I gathered the things that stood out.

1898
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,750
As for Claire,

1899
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,920
she withdrew 30,000,
40,000, and 80,000 dollars...

1900
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,220
in cash.

1901
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:38,060
(Claire's Bank Statements)

1902
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,529
(Withdrawal, cash: 30,000 dollars)

1903
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:41,060
(Withdrawal, cash: 40,000 dollars)

1904
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,600
(Withdrawal, cash: 80,000 dollars)

1905
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,170
She withdrew a lot of money in cash.

1906
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:46,930
The dates were July 1, 10, and 15.

1907
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,439
Those were the dates
she met up with Danielle.

1908
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,170
- The dates were July 1, 10,
- The dates were July 1, 10, and 15.

1909
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:53,239
and 15. Was there a photo on July 15?

1910
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:54,909
There was a video.

1911
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:56,640
(She withdrew cash
on the days she met up with Danielle.)

1912
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,909
The most important clue is...

1913
01:22:58,909 --> 01:23:00,850
Claire's bank statements.

1914
01:23:00,979 --> 01:23:03,250
On July 15, she withdrew...

1915
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,250
eighty thousand dollars in cash.

1916
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:07,520
As for Ella,
all the deposits are editing fees.

1917
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,189
I think she received the money
from Danielle...

1918
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:10,420
because the amounts are small.

1919
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:13,189
She received 20 to 30 dollars
about 3 times.

1920
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:15,899
(Ella's Bank Statements)

1921
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:17,829
(Deposit, editing fee: 21.65 dollars)

1922
01:23:17,829 --> 01:23:20,229
(Deposit, editing fee: 14.43 dollars)

1923
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:22,739
(Deposit, editing fee: 17.23 dollars)

1924
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,770
She received an allowance from her dad.

1925
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:28,109
Her spendings were quite small.

1926
01:23:28,109 --> 01:23:30,079
- I think she's poor.
- Okay.

1927
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:31,340
As for Jose,

1928
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,350
there was a deposit of 1,500 dollars
from his part-time job.

1929
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:36,250
There was that,

1930
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,850
but he spent 1,000, 3,000,
and 5,000 dollars on donations.

1931
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:40,250
- I don't think he's rich.
- Okay.

1932
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,960
The last one was Rosa.
As for Rosa's bank statements,

1933
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,890
all of them were expenses.

1934
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:48,430
Like a common female influencer,

1935
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,329
she spent money at a movie theater
and a skin care clinic.

1936
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:52,369
But there was one deposit
from a nail salon.

1937
01:23:52,369 --> 01:23:53,369
That was a deposit.

1938
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:54,600
A nail salon?

1939
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,199
(Claire's suspicious cash withdrawals)

1940
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,609
(Danielle and Ella's financial situation)

1941
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:07,380
(The man who donated money to Danielle,
Jose's financial situation)

1942
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:12,350
(A suspicious deposit among expenses)

1943
01:24:12,689 --> 01:24:14,020
I got a photo.

1944
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,689
It said, "Evidence."

1945
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,789
The image wasn't vertical,

1946
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:21,560
but horizontal. It was wide.

1947
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,529
I think it was taken with a tablet PC.

1948
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,300
The room looked like this.

1949
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,770
Roy stood in the middle.

1950
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:30,300
Danielle was here and Rosa was here.

1951
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,470
That was what I saw.

1952
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:40,279
On the wall were...

1953
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:41,279
two stars.

1954
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,680
- It's the same room I saw.
- The same room?

1955
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,590
The three of them are fighting.

1956
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:47,750
It was taken at 11:18 p.m., July 15.

1957
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,289
Hold on.

1958
01:24:49,989 --> 01:24:51,760
That was ten minutes before her death.

1959
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:54,890
(Estimated time of death: 11:30 p.m.)

1960
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,529
(The photo was taken
10 minutes before Danielle's death.)

1961
01:24:58,729 --> 01:25:00,369
As for the footprints,

1962
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,539
one set had...

1963
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:06,840
the tire shapes on the top.
On the bottom...

1964
01:25:07,409 --> 01:25:09,079
You know how there are three lines...

1965
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,739
on the top of the Korean flag?

1966
01:25:11,409 --> 01:25:13,880
It looked like the top line was gone.

1967
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,220
But the bottom was cut off in the middle.

1968
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,189
That was one set.
As for another set of footprints,

1969
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,850
it looked like this.

1970
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,789
There were a big circle at the top
and a small circle at the bottom.

1971
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:28,960
(3 sets of footprints were in Clue 7.)

1972
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,699
(Footprint 1, Footprint 2, Footprint 3)

1973
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:32,229
Among the footprints,

1974
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:33,729
was there a one with an upward arrow?

1975
01:25:34,069 --> 01:25:36,239
What I saw had the same background.
But the difference is this.

1976
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,939
There were six sets of footprints.
There were a lot.

1977
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:40,270
- Was there no time?
- No.

1978
01:25:40,409 --> 01:25:41,909
There were six sets of footprints.

1979
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,140
The six were dry.

1980
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,850
And there were two new footprints.

1981
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,350
They looked like this.

1982
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:48,880
If the shoe is like this...

1983
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:51,890
(She draws the footprints with water.)

1984
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:52,949
It dries so fast.

1985
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,119
The pattern looked like this.

1986
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:57,119
- This pattern.
- It wasn't there.

1987
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,329
Wasn't it there?
Then the culprit wasn't on that floor.

1988
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:03,229
Eon Kyu talked about what he saw.

1989
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,970
It was the same place as mine.

1990
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:07,800
On Eon Kyu's photo,

1991
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,840
it said something like "Reference photo."

1992
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,039
But mine said, "Crime scene photo."

1993
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:14,869
So Eon Kyu's photo...

1994
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,039
was taken before the crime.

1995
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:19,180
Mine was taken after the crime.

1996
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,149
I asked him if there was
the footprint with an arrow.

1997
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:22,149
He said no.

1998
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:24,020
Thus, Roy and Rosa aren't the culprits.

1999
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:27,590
(The place where
Danielle, Roy, and Rosa fought)

2000
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:32,029
(There weren't any footprints
with the triangular shapes.)

2001
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:33,029
(Crime scene photo)

2002
01:26:33,029 --> 01:26:35,760
(But at the crime scene,)

2003
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:39,529
(two footprints were new
among the dried ones.)

2004
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:43,840
(It's a new set of footprints
that's different from Roy's and Rosa's.)

2005
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,939
(Characters)

2006
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:49,340
(Are Rosa and Roy excluded
from the culprit candidates?)

2007
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:51,710
I had two statements.

2008
01:26:51,949 --> 01:26:53,479
They were given on July 17.

2009
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:55,979
One was Roy's.

2010
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:59,420
The man answered questions.

2011
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,420
The important part was this.

2012
01:27:00,689 --> 01:27:01,989
That night,

2013
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:04,390
Danielle suddenly confessed
her love to him at the rooftop.

2014
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,189
In that situation, Rosa got mad...

2015
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,300
and a fight ensued.

2016
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:11,229
Since there were other people,

2017
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:12,699
he got embarrassed.

2018
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,699
So he went inside the building
with the two of them.

2019
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,399
Danielle tried to run after him.

2020
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,310
But Danielle went up while he went down.

2021
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:22,539
He ran after Rosa.

2022
01:27:22,539 --> 01:27:23,840
Then he suddenly heard a scream.

2023
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,279
When he went there, Danielle was dead.

2024
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,210
That was Roy's statement.

2025
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,949
Another statement was given
by Jose Mortin.

2026
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,289
He's the subscriber.

2027
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,119
He said that the filming was stopped...

2028
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:37,420
because Danielle was fooled by Roy.

2029
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,029
She seemed to be a bit angry.

2030
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:43,529
"It was because of that stupid punk."
Jose said that.

2031
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,399
Roy, Rosa, and Danielle went...

2032
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:48,739
inside the building.

2033
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,170
They were on the rooftop,
but they went inside the building.

2034
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:55,039
Jose Mortin went inside the building
after them.

2035
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:56,840
He tried to go after them,

2036
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:00,109
but he suddenly received a notification
that someone had logged into...

2037
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,510
his tablet PC.

2038
01:28:01,779 --> 01:28:02,880
- His tablet PC?
- Yes.

2039
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,079
Apparently,
the tablet PC on the rooftop...

2040
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:06,250
belonged to Jose Mortin.

2041
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,890
His phone was connected to it.

2042
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:11,119
When he received a notification,
he went up to the rooftop hurriedly.

2043
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:14,090
He went up to the rooftop hurriedly.

2044
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:18,029
That was when he heard a scream.

2045
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,029
My clue was Ella's laptop screen.

2046
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,640
- Ella.
- There were two open programs. One was...

2047
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,170
a video editing tool.

2048
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:27,840
The one on the back was
the Windows memo pad.

2049
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,180
The rest were meaningless.

2050
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:31,079
On the video editing tool,

2051
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:34,710
it said that the video was filmed
from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.

2052
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,449
As for the memo pad...
Since this was Ella's laptop,

2053
01:28:37,449 --> 01:28:38,819
I saw the deposits.

2054
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,119
They were related
to what she filmed and edited.

2055
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:42,189
The format was like this.

2056
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,760
"June 28, vlog editing."

2057
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:46,359
"From this time to that time."

2058
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,829
In parentheses,

2059
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,159
the amount was something like
13.32 dollars.

2060
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,600
The cents were specified too.

2061
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:54,899
"Paid" and "Unpaid."

2062
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:56,170
The dates were...

2063
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:58,739
May 3, 13, and 27,

2064
01:28:58,739 --> 01:28:59,810
(Steve Yea was in the same clue room
as Heo Seong Beom.)

2065
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:01,939
June 1, 9...

2066
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,640
June 17 and June 29.

2067
01:29:05,649 --> 01:29:06,949
It was 21 or 29.

2068
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:10,850
July 4, 12, and 14.
The dates were the same as before...

2069
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:11,880
when it came to July.

2070
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,390
There were "Paid" and "Unpaid."

2071
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,689
The early ones were paid.

2072
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:19,930
So in your opinions,

2073
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,289
those were the dates she didn't get paid.

2074
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,960
- Yes.
- Right?

2075
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:25,800
The three bottom ones
are connected to the journal.

2076
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,500
(Photo evidence: Ella's laptop screen)

2077
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,699
(2024 Danielle payments)

2078
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:30,800
(July 4, 12, and 14)

2079
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:36,439
(July 4, 12, and 14)

2080
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,979
On July 4, she worked for 10 hours...

2081
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:41,279
and received 14 dollars. So she got paid.

2082
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:42,949
The bottom one.

2083
01:29:43,619 --> 01:29:45,149
She was a chauffeur.

2084
01:29:45,149 --> 01:29:48,050
Eight hours. I don't know
why the duration was so long.

2085
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,859
On July 14... It's strange.

2086
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:55,060
It says, "Danielle's requested video."

2087
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,300
- What day in July?
- July 14.

2088
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,500
My clue was the screen
of Danielle's laptop.

2089
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,899
- It was a photo evidence.
- Okay.

2090
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:05,000
But it was old.
It was from April 28, 2017.

2091
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:08,710
There were two open windows.
One was a folder.

2092
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:11,409
There were five videos...

2093
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,710
under that date, April 28, 2017.

2094
01:30:13,949 --> 01:30:16,979
They are 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.,
4 p.m. to 5 p.m., and 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.

2095
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:18,479
Then there was a gap of an hour.

2096
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:20,949
The remaining ones were
from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. and 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.

2097
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:24,760
(Folder from Danielle's laptop screen)

2098
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:26,430
(Filmed videos)

2099
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:30,560
(There's a gap of an hour
from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.)

2100
01:30:30,899 --> 01:30:33,729
- No video from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.
- Yes. The gap is between that one hour.

2101
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:35,369
The thing is...

2102
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,170
- I have the one from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.
- Okay.

2103
01:30:38,369 --> 01:30:40,210
It was the screen of Danielle's laptop...

2104
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,479
from April 28, 2017.

2105
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:43,979
There were five videos.

2106
01:30:43,979 --> 01:30:46,109
I'll give you the megabytes later.
They aren't important.

2107
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,579
The second window showed
the layout drawings of the buildings.

2108
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,119
(Chungju-Man didn't realize
that one hour was missing.)

2109
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:53,489
They're shaped like an H. A...

2110
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:56,189
A, B, C, D,

2111
01:30:56,189 --> 01:30:58,260
E, F, G, H. Those are the buildings.

2112
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:00,060
Building B is shaped like a giyeok.

2113
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:01,489
All other buildings are rectangular.

2114
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:02,960
(Building layout
from Danielle's laptop screen)

2115
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:04,329
What I saw...

2116
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:07,829
read, "Photo evidence"
and "Study interior."

2117
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:10,840
It seemed like...

2118
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:13,510
the room of a YouTuber.

2119
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,840
My guess is that it's Danielle's study.

2120
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:20,449
What's important is the footprint.

2121
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:23,680
There were two sets of footprints.

2122
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:27,350
One set was dark in color.

2123
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:29,590
There was a bookshelf.

2124
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:31,090
The footprints went toward the bookshelf
and moved out.

2125
01:31:31,289 --> 01:31:35,090
There was a set of footprints
that was lighter in color.

2126
01:31:35,229 --> 01:31:37,930
It starts from there and goes this way.

2127
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,800
It makes a stop...

2128
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:41,829
at the laptop...

2129
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,739
and goes out to the right.
There were two sets of footprints.

2130
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,039
Let's go over the footprints.
Who has information on the footprints?

2131
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:50,579
In the first clue room,

2132
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:52,609
there were five footprints on the rooftop.

2133
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:55,510
- And...
- Are you sure it was the rooftop?

2134
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,680
Yes, I'm sure. It was the rooftop.

2135
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:01,390
Like I said earlier,
there were footprints like this.

2136
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,189
- I saw them.
- They went toward the wooden board.

2137
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,890
Another set...

2138
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,359
had a simple front.
What I remember is this.

2139
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,529
The back was shaped like a horse hoof.

2140
01:32:12,729 --> 01:32:14,729
Those footprints went out this way.

2141
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,140
As for another one...

2142
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:19,270
It was a regular shoe print,
but the pattern was different.

2143
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,739
In any case, the pattern was different.

2144
01:32:21,739 --> 01:32:25,380
Five people's footprints were
on the rooftop.

2145
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,550
Among them, which footprints did you see?

2146
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,350
There were dark footprints
of similar size.

2147
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,819
The ones with dots...

2148
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,960
headed out, but didn't come back.

2149
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:38,720
- You think they belong to Danielle.
- Yes.

2150
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:41,529
The footprints of similar size
with the triangular shapes...

2151
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:44,029
went to the terrace and moved to the side.

2152
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,069
They're dark, so they must be recent.

2153
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:47,100
It's that person.

2154
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,670
- I think that person is the culprit.
- So this person...

2155
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,170
came to the study.

2156
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:53,369
I think those are the footprints
in the study with the laptop.

2157
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:59,109
(YouTube video)

2158
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:03,880
(A total of 5 footprints were
on the rooftop.)

2159
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,720
(A total of 6 footprints were
at the crime scene.)

2160
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:14,960
(The footprints that stop
at the terrace belong to Danielle.)

2161
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,130
(The footprints that move to the side
are thought to belong to the culprit.)

2162
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,569
(Danielle, culprit)

2163
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,670
(The same footprints were in the study.)

2164
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:28,109
(Photo evidence, study interior)

2165
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:30,939
If we cancel the unlikely ones,
3 or 2 people remain.

2166
01:33:31,109 --> 01:33:32,350
If the culprit is a woman,
the number is two.

2167
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,350
We need to think about it further.

2168
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,420
I think we can exclude
the rookie YouTuber.

2169
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:40,319
On the day of the crime,
she was on the rooftop.

2170
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:42,590
While cleaning up,
she logged into the tablet PC.

2171
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,659
Then she heard someone come up
to the rooftop.

2172
01:33:45,729 --> 01:33:49,000
Then she heard Danielle's scream.
When she looked, Danielle was dead.

2173
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,369
Jose and the rookie YouTuber
gave the same statement.

2174
01:33:52,729 --> 01:33:54,699
So we can exclude the two.

2175
01:33:54,699 --> 01:33:55,840
It isn't Ella.

2176
01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:58,170
Jose saw...

2177
01:33:58,170 --> 01:34:01,170
- a notification on his phone...
- Yes.

2178
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:02,939
and went to the rooftop.

2179
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:04,539
Their stories are in sync.

(Claire Rubio, Idol
who is Danielle's best friend)

2186
01:34:21,859 --> 01:34:23,060
Now,

2187
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:25,770
repeat Claire's statement once more.

2188
01:34:25,829 --> 01:34:27,029
In Claire's statement,

2189
01:34:27,229 --> 01:34:30,199
she said that they were fighting
before 11 p.m.

2190
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:34,140
But according to the photo,
they were fighting at 11:18 p.m.

2191
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:36,380
I see. What else?

2192
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,810
What else was in the statement?

2193
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,979
In the third photo,

2194
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:43,520
Danielle was stretching out
her hand to Claire angrily.

2195
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:44,649
She was grimacing.

2196
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:47,850
(I get it!)

2197
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,460
Jin Ho.

2198
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,159
Claire's bank statements
showed cash withdrawals.

2199
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:53,289
While listening to them, I realized...

2200
01:34:53,289 --> 01:34:56,600
that the important dates I remembered
from the bank statements...

2201
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,569
and the dates Claire and Danielle met
overlapped.

2202
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:03,899
That means Claire was giving her money.

2203
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:06,069
Claire was being forced to give her money.

2204
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:08,069
In the photo,

2205
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:10,479
Danielle was stretching out her hand
and demanding something. It's certain.

2206
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,779
Claire withdrew money
and gave it to Danielle.

2207
01:35:13,979 --> 01:35:16,819
In the photo you saw, Danielle
was stretching out her hand to Claire.

2208
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:18,680
- She was asking for money.
- Yes.

2209
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:20,850
She was getting extorted.
They weren't friends.

2210
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,319
I thought, "Claire has
a definite motive for the crime."

2211
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,989
"Okay. You're a suspect."

2212
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:27,390
(Withdrawal, cash)

2213
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:29,430
Claire was getting extorted by Danielle.

2214
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,199
- That's right.
- I think that was the case.

2215
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:32,970
She withdrew cash continuously.

2216
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:33,970
That's right.

2217
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:38,239
We didn't get any clues on why
Claire had to give money to Danielle,

2218
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,569
- right?
- That's right.

2219
01:35:39,569 --> 01:35:40,739
- We didn't get anything.
- We didn't get anything.

2220
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:43,810
It seems like Claire is the culprit.

2221
01:35:43,909 --> 01:35:46,279
It seems like Claire is the culprit.

2222
01:35:47,149 --> 01:35:50,479
Those were the dates
when Claire withdrew money...

2223
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,850
and gave it to Danielle.

2224
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,390
- July 10.
- July 10.

2225
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,590
July 1, 10...

2226
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,829
- And July 15.
- And the video from earlier.

2227
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:03,229
It was the clue you saw.

2228
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,130
You don't know whose video it is, right?

2229
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:08,970
It was the video Danielle requested.

2230
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,069
The video Danielle requested. July 14.

2231
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:15,039
Yes. The culprit...

2232
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:17,880
The study I saw.

2233
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:19,680
The culprit entered the study.

2234
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,649
The culprit entered the study
and got to the laptop.

2235
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:25,319
From the laptop,

2236
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:27,289
the culprit took the 1-hour long video
from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.

2237
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,920
Afterward,

2238
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,319
Danielle found out and went,
"Gosh, my video is missing."

2239
01:36:32,689 --> 01:36:35,189
In Danielle's laptop,

2240
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:38,329
there were videos...

2241
01:36:38,329 --> 01:36:40,699
from April 28, 2017.

2242
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:45,069
She had been Claire's friend
for many years.

2243
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:48,239
So perhaps there was a video
of Claire's past wrongdoing.

2244
01:36:48,439 --> 01:36:50,239
There's a chance she threatened Claire.

2245
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:52,109
- Danielle threatened Claire?
- Yes. For money.

2246
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,609
Now, you can use an item...

2247
01:36:56,279 --> 01:36:58,050
and give an answer.

2248
01:37:00,449 --> 01:37:02,590
All right. I'll go over the story briefly.

2249
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:04,920
She was pushed from the rooftop.

2250
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,260
She wasn't pushed from the rooftop.

2251
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,590
Where was it then?

2252
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:08,829
The seventh-floor terrace.

2253
01:37:08,859 --> 01:37:11,399
I got the seventh floor
from the crime scene photo.

2254
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,770
Blood was right under
the seventh-floor terrace,

2255
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:17,369
fourth floor, and first floor.

2256
01:37:17,539 --> 01:37:19,270
She hit the structures as she fell.

2257
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:22,069
She fell after she was pushed
from the seventh-floor terrace.

2258
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,510
Then she died from head trauma.

2259
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:27,010
There's a reason why I say
that it isn't the seventh floor.

2260
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:30,350
In the clue Acau saw,
the Building G was visible.

2261
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:31,949
This building is shaped like a giyeok.

2262
01:37:32,149 --> 01:37:33,449
Since the Building G is here,

2263
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,819
- they saw it from here.
- Yes.

2264
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:39,430
But on this side,
the seventh-floor window wasn't broken.

2265
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:41,930
- So it isn't the seventh floor.
- No.

2266
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,659
But they must've seen it from here.

2267
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,329
- Building G is here!
- Building G is here!

2268
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:49,000
(They think the video was taken
from the rooftop facing Building G.)

2269
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,939
So it was filmed here.

2270
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:52,670
It was filmed here.

2271
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:54,109
And there was a window here?

2272
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:55,979
All the windows were broken.

2273
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:57,710
All the windows were broken
on the seventh floor?

2274
01:37:57,739 --> 01:37:59,380
- Yes.
- All the windows were broken.

2275
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,350
In any case, it wasn't the seventh floor.

2276
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:02,350
(The 7-member team's memories
become blurry.)

2277
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,380
What? Hold on. From here...

2278
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,090
- The seventh floor.
- No. I'm sorry. I got confused.

2279
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:08,850
Were all the seventh-floor windows broken
on this side?

2280
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:11,090
I was talking about the balconies.

2281
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:12,489
- They were broken.
- Yes.

2282
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,130
If we want to use the item,

2283
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:16,859
- we should be certain about this.
- Yes.

2284
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:19,600
There might be a floor
without a balcony on this side.

2285
01:38:19,899 --> 01:38:21,130
- Okay.
- One floor.

2286
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,640
- It was a photo from Round One, right?
- Yes.

2287
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,899
We were certain that it happened
on the balcony,

2288
01:38:26,069 --> 01:38:27,970
so the question was which balcony.

2289
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:31,279
I knew that the top floor
didn't have a balcony.

2290
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:34,710
But we decided to check just in case.

2291
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:37,680
How nice.

2292
01:38:38,649 --> 01:38:39,750
How nice.

2293
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:42,960
(The 7-member team enters to use an item.)

2294
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,460
- Will you use the item?
- Yes.

2295
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:49,529
Which clue from which round
will you check?

2296
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:51,029
Round 1, Clue 1.

2297
01:38:51,029 --> 01:38:52,829
- Round 1, clue room 1.
- Round 1.

2298
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,630
The 1st clue of Round 1 will be revealed.

2299
01:38:56,069 --> 01:38:57,170
(Crime scene photo)

2300
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:58,300
It isn't on the top floor.

2301
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,510
- I see.
- Yes.

2302
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,340
It isn't this one.
I saw a crime scene photo earlier.

2303
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,979
- Right.
- There was this.

2304
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,880
- This shape.
- Yes, there was this.

2305
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:11,380
Was it on one side or both sides?

2306
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:13,420
It was cut off in the photo.

2307
01:39:13,789 --> 01:39:15,920
- It's 1 of the 2.
- It's 1 of the 2.

2308
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,420
- I think it's this one.
- Hold on.

2309
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,229
- In the photo...
- No. Not the photo.

2310
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:22,899
- The shape of the broken window.
- They went up and down.

2311
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:24,229
- It's this one.
- Yes.

2312
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:25,300
- Round One.
- Yes.

2313
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,229
Gosh, I also saw the shape
of the broken window.

2314
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:30,369
It's this one. I would've remembered
had this been the shape.

2315
01:39:30,739 --> 01:39:32,039
Wasn't it a photo from Round Two?

2316
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:33,670
Then we can go and look.

2317
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,810
I'll go and look.

2318
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,710
Please don't lie.

2319
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:39,649
I don't want to go to Team Remaining.

2320
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,050
I'll go now.

2321
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:43,079
Okay.

2322
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,489
Eon Kyu and I saw the crime scene photos.

2323
01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:50,319
We thought it's be best to determine
the location by the window shape.

2324
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:52,060
To make it certain,

2325
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,430
Eon Kyu went and looked
at the shape of the window.

2326
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:56,460
(Photo evidence)

2327
01:40:01,069 --> 01:40:02,069
Which floor is it?

2328
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:04,800
Which floor is the saw-toothed shape?

2329
01:40:04,939 --> 01:40:06,140
It was the sixth floor.

2330
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:07,569
They were both saw-toothed.

2331
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,779
- There was one with an awkward bend.
- Yes.

2332
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:11,640
- One that's flat.
- Yes.

2333
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,550
Oh, then it's the fifth floor.

2334
01:40:14,350 --> 01:40:15,449
Yes, it's the fifth floor.

2335
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,279
Would you like to give your answer?

2336
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:19,390
Yes, I would.

2337
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,390
(The team of 7 gives their first answer.)

2338
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:22,149
I will open the first question.

2339
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:23,960
"Who is the culprit?"

2340
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,890
The culprit is Claire Rubio.

2341
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:31,029
That is correct.
I will open the second question.

2342
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,500
"Which floor did Danielle fall from?"

2343
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,100
The fifth floor.

2344
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:41,970
That is incorrect.

2345
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,239
The question will be revealed
to the other team as well.

2346
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,510
Please go back to the headquarters.

2347
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,119
Hey, Danielle didn't fall
from the fifth floor.

2348
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:51,520
It was the sixth.

2349
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:54,189
Seong Beom said it wasn't the 5th floor...

2350
01:40:54,189 --> 01:40:55,220
but the 6th.

2351
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:58,520
Then, Dong Min got a little annoyed,

2352
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,489
but when I looked at
how the other team was doing,

2353
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:03,300
their faces didn't look...

2354
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,430
all that great.

2355
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:07,800
So, I figured they didn't have...

2356
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,329
a good idea of things yet.

2357
01:41:09,329 --> 01:41:11,800
So, to summarize,

2358
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:16,640
it was around 11:18 p.m.
that Danielle and Rosa had a fight.

2359
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:19,579
Then, Danielle suddenly... No.

2360
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:20,710
Roy... I mean, Danielle...

2361
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:26,319
But remember the example earlier?

2362
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,050
There was something like,
"Which weapon did the culprit use?"

2363
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:31,090
We didn't die from blunt force trauma.

2364
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:32,420
You said it was death by falling.

2365
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,029
Well, that's...

2366
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:38,199
We don't make things up that don't exist.

2367
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,869
With the given evidence,

2368
01:41:39,869 --> 01:41:41,899
we only remember the clear facts.

2369
01:41:42,329 --> 01:41:43,569
- Do you need time to think?
- You know what I mean?

2370
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:44,739
- What?
- But the five...

2371
01:41:44,739 --> 01:41:45,770
No, there's nothing to think about.

2372
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:46,939
Honestly, we have all the information.

2373
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,069
But I can't complete the scenario
with this information right now.

2374
01:41:49,939 --> 01:41:52,210
I can, to a certain degree.

2375
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:55,250
Now, we have to take what we have...

2376
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,250
and use our imagination.

2377
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,180
- There's no answer.
- Yes, with what we have...

2378
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,319
- So, what I think is...
- But...

2379
01:41:59,319 --> 01:42:01,319
I don't think we should talk about
things that aren't stated.

2380
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:04,060
This isn't about imagining things
to get it right.

2381
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,859
The broken window?

2382
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:06,960
But the...

2383
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,029
There were a lot of broken windows.

2384
01:42:08,729 --> 01:42:11,130
But out of everything we saw,

2385
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,670
Claire and Danielle's...

2386
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:14,899
exact relationship...

2387
01:42:14,899 --> 01:42:16,170
Other than the fact that their friends,

2388
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,970
and that they seem to have fought.
Other than that, any exact...

2389
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:19,970
- resources or...
- The deposit and withdrawal.

2390
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,470
- But did anyone see it?
- The deposit and withdrawal?

2391
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,680
That was just Claire's one-sided claim.

2392
01:42:24,039 --> 01:42:26,649
- But...
- They did meet on those dates.

2393
01:42:26,909 --> 01:42:28,109
Then, she was attacked.

2394
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:30,449
In the pictures, they met on those dates.

2395
01:42:30,449 --> 01:42:31,479
(The team members say they can make
deductions from the current information.)

2396
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:32,479
I'm sure this is right.

2397
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:33,920
Look, this is what I think.

2398
01:42:34,289 --> 01:42:35,949
We can just go for it, and if it's not,

2399
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:37,060
- we can just check.
- Hang on.

2400
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,289
I mean, we're not getting anywhere.

2401
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,159
We have to do something
with what we have so far.

2402
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,199
I spoke up because I was frustrated.

2403
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,029
"Then, let's try
making deductions with this."

2404
01:42:45,029 --> 01:42:46,369
We weren't getting anywhere.

2405
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,729
So, I said that
we should connect the dots. So, first,

2406
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:50,739
I said we should name the culprit.

2407
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:52,770
Then, he was like...

2408
01:42:52,939 --> 01:42:54,710
"We need clear evidence!"

2409
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:56,380
And he was getting really annoyed.

2410
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:59,239
I mean, we're thinking this hard
about things since we don't have proof.

2411
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:00,449
If we did, why would we even give it
a second thought?

2412
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:03,250
So, I tried to make my point...

2413
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:05,350
and spoke up.

2414
01:43:05,449 --> 01:43:07,619
All right.
Then, let me put the story together.

2415
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:12,390
Claire has been friends with Danielle
since a long time ago.

2416
01:43:13,029 --> 01:43:15,329
If you watch the video from
April 28, 2017...

2417
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:18,130
that's on Danielle's computer...
This is what was used to threaten her.

2418
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,100
And Claire became a star.

2419
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:23,439
- Then, we can predict this question.
- Is that why they fought?

2420
01:43:23,539 --> 01:43:24,640
Where did she kill her?

2421
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,840
It's the terrace on the seventh floor.

2422
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,840
Who killed her?

2423
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,840
It's Claire.

2424
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:31,180
Ask me questions based on my scenario.

2425
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,810
I'll answer them.

2426
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:34,079
Quickly.

2427
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:35,250
If she was born in 1995,

2428
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:36,880
and this was in 2017?

2429
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:39,079
- Yes.
- Then, she's an adult in 2017.

2430
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:40,220
It could be before her debut.

2431
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,819
And other questions. What could we expect?

2432
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:44,189
Claire is...

2433
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:46,359
Anyway, I think we need...

2434
01:43:47,489 --> 01:43:49,159
to see the extra information.

2435
01:43:49,329 --> 01:43:50,560
After we hear the questions,

2436
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,729
we should use the items to see, and...

2437
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:54,470
No, we can't use the items yet.

2438
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,500
I think there will be lots of questions.

2439
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,369
Those guys seem to be confident.

2440
01:44:00,369 --> 01:44:01,439
I bet they got about five.

2441
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:02,609
Because we...

2442
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,310
Look, ask me more questions.

2443
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:05,779
Why aren't you asking me questions?

2444
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:07,380
Let's see their questions first...

2445
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,180
Well, we'll get to hear
their questions anyway.

2446
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:12,850
- We could...
- But that's just going along with them.

2447
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:14,220
I'm saying we should come up with
some questions first.

2448
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,250
There's no need to do that right now.

2449
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:18,859
I think it's better to review
with the questions...

2450
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:20,159
- we can come up with.
- No, I don't mean we'll just go now.

2451
01:44:20,289 --> 01:44:21,789
I mean,
think of some questions and ask them.

2452
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:24,399
But it's harder to ask questions
than you think.

2453
01:44:24,699 --> 01:44:26,369
- What kind of questions...
- Okay.

2454
01:44:26,369 --> 01:44:27,470
It's not like we're not asking them
for no reason.

2455
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:30,500
I was so frustrated. So, we could have...

2456
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,699
kept asking questions as we went along.

2457
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,310
We were having a hard time
deciding how to proceed,

2458
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,310
and we kept...

2459
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,579
playing so passively.

2460
01:44:36,579 --> 01:44:38,039
We put together the whole story,
but we kept going over it...

2461
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:40,380
and checking it several times.

2462
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:42,210
And I don't know if Jin Ho was...

2463
01:44:42,210 --> 01:44:43,949
feeling mixed up about things,

2464
01:44:43,949 --> 01:44:45,079
but he kept talking nonsense.

2465
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:47,119
So, I think that made me...

2466
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:49,050
get a little worked up without meaning to.

2467
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,090
I insisted that we just had to go for it.

2468
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:52,420
I was frustrated.

2469
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:55,930
As the team of seven answered incorrectly,
the question will be revealed.

2470
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,359
The first question.

2471
01:44:59,329 --> 01:45:00,899
Who is the culprit?

2472
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:03,770
The second question.

2473
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:07,569
Which floor did Danielle fall from?

2474
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:09,270
Okay.

2475
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:10,840
That's good.

2476
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:14,079
- What? They got this wrong?
- They got this wrong?

2477
01:45:14,449 --> 01:45:15,850
Then, let's go for it now.
It doesn't matter.

2478
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,649
(The team of 7 can't answer
for 10 minutes.)

2479
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:19,420
It doesn't matter if we try now.

2480
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:20,850
Yes, try it.

2481
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:24,420
(The team of 6 comes to answer
for the 1st time.)

2482
01:45:24,619 --> 01:45:26,289
- Would you like to give your answer?
- Yes.

2483
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:28,289
Who is the culprit?

2484
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,699
Claire Rubio.

2485
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,060
That is correct.

2486
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:33,930
Which floor did Danielle fall from?

2487
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:34,970
The seventh floor.

2488
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:37,770
That is incorrect.

2489
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,569
Please go back to the headquarters.

2490
01:45:39,569 --> 01:45:41,170
(The team of 6 also got
the 2nd question wrong.)

2491
01:45:41,970 --> 01:45:42,970
Incorrect.

2492
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:45,380
- Starting with the 1st question?
- No, the 7th floor was wrong.

2493
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:46,680
Oh, the seventh floor was wrong.

2494
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:48,579
We just have to find out
which floor it was.

2495
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:50,579
We don't have to think about
anything else.

2496
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:52,279
Which floor did Claire push her off of?

2497
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:53,920
I'm sure she fell off from the terrace.

2498
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,420
That was where the footprints ended.

2499
01:45:56,119 --> 01:45:57,590
Then was the terrace on the fourth floor?

2500
01:45:57,789 --> 01:45:59,119
- They're on all floors.
- All floors.

2501
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,130
Oh, is that so?

2502
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,489
Do we have to compare
the shapes of the windows?

2503
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:04,800
My window was an arch.

2504
01:46:05,229 --> 01:46:07,229
No, not that.
The shape of the broken window.

2505
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:09,229
Then, let's look at it again.

2506
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:10,399
We have to use an item.

2507
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:12,640
Those guys are trying to use an item
to get this right.

2508
01:46:13,239 --> 01:46:14,239
Shall we look at the windows?

2509
01:46:14,609 --> 01:46:16,680
Then, since I remember the shape...

2510
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,710
of the edge of the window on the terrace,

2511
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:21,279
let's look at that part.
On the first floor...

2512
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:23,649
- Let's check.
- When did you see that?

2513
01:46:23,649 --> 01:46:24,979
- In Round 1?
- In Round 1.

2514
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:30,859
Which clue
from which round will you check?

2515
01:46:30,859 --> 01:46:33,060
We'll check the 1st room from Round 1.

2516
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:36,260
Here is the 1st clue from Round 1.

2517
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:39,829
(The team of 6 checks
the 1st clue as well.)

2518
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:42,199
This is it.

2519
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:44,069
It's the sixth floor.

2520
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,670
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2521
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:48,340
This is what it looked like on the side.

2522
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:51,210
On the terrace where the footprints ended,

2523
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:52,710
- the glass...
- That's what the window looked like.

2524
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:53,949
It looked like this?

2525
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,979
- This is the most likely, right?
- Right.

2526
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:57,779
The sixth floor.

2527
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:00,949
Don't we get unlimited answers now?

2528
01:47:00,949 --> 01:47:02,750
- Yes.
- Let's find out the questions as we go.

2529
01:47:02,789 --> 01:47:03,789
Okay, I'll try it.

2530
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:06,659
Here is the first question.

2531
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:08,359
Who is the culprit?

2532
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,590
It's Claire.

2533
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:12,359
That is correct.

2534
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:15,329
Which floor did Danielle fall from?

2535
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:16,470
The sixth floor.

2536
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:18,939
That is correct.

2537
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:22,510
Where did the culprit visit
after committing the crime,

2538
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:24,710
and what did the culprit do there?

2539
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,149
When she asked where the culprit went,

2540
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:33,489
I didn't know.

2541
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:40,229
But when I thought about it,

2542
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:42,229
there was that thing that Gina had said.

2543
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:44,329
What if the culprit
stopped by the computer?

2544
01:47:45,899 --> 01:47:47,430
Claire could've tried to check...

2545
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:50,140
or delete something on the computer.

2546
01:47:51,369 --> 01:47:53,770
It was Danielle's house. There,

2547
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:56,979
she deleted the video of herself
from the past.

2548
01:48:01,479 --> 01:48:04,319
That is correct.
I will open the fourth question.

2549
01:48:04,819 --> 01:48:08,350
What was in the video
that the culprit deleted?

2550
01:48:21,699 --> 01:48:22,770
I'll be back later.

2551
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:32,210
(Criminal Memory Questions)

2552
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:36,779
(4. What was in the video
that the culprit deleted?)

2553
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,220
He's back.

2554
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:39,920
I guess we got question four wrong.

2555
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:41,689
- What?
- Oh, really?

2556
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:43,260
He's scratching his head.

2557
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,920
- Which question did you get wrong?
- I got to question four.

2558
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,960
What video did Claire delete?

2559
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:48,659
What video did Claire delete?

2560
01:48:48,659 --> 01:48:49,689
That wasn't in any of the clues.

2561
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,060
- I think...
- You said that...

2562
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,630
there was an old video
that was deleted, right?

2563
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,329
- Do you remember what it was?
- That wasn't me.

2564
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:57,140
What?

2565
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,670
I kept thinking something had been deleted
but didn't know what it was about.

2566
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,979
But my teammates said
they couldn't remember.

2567
01:49:03,979 --> 01:49:05,840
What picture did they see
that they missed it...

2568
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:07,880
and didn't pass on the information?
I was so angry.

2569
01:49:08,649 --> 01:49:10,420
In the video editing tool,

2570
01:49:10,579 --> 01:49:12,319
on the screen,

2571
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,520
it looked like it was shot from
inside the room.

2572
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,420
On the left, there is a curtain.

2573
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:17,890
And on this side,
it's the wall of the room.

2574
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,960
And right along this wall,

2575
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:23,090
there's a brown building over there,
in the shape of a rhombus.

2576
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:27,170
The important thing is,
there's a woman pushing someone off here,

2577
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:28,770
and another woman is falling off.

2578
01:49:29,369 --> 01:49:31,470
But the person on top...

2579
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:33,470
has short hair in the color of beer.

2580
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,109
But it was too small,
so I couldn't really see well.

2581
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:38,210
But this was between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.

2582
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:39,640
So, this is a separate incident.

2583
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,649
- Right.
- And what I think is also important is...

2584
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:43,520
that they were wearing the same clothes.

2585
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,649
They both had white tops and red bottoms.

2586
01:49:45,649 --> 01:49:47,350
So, I think it could be a school.

2587
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,350
This is just my guess.

2588
01:49:48,489 --> 01:49:50,420
But is Danielle the one
with beer-colored hair?

2589
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,920
- Yes.
- So,

2590
01:49:52,119 --> 01:49:54,090
Claire...

2591
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,560
No.

2592
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,229
- I think...
- No, it's not that.

2593
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,329
Claire killed someone in the past,

2594
01:50:01,329 --> 01:50:02,770
and Danielle knew about it.

2595
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:05,170
She was taking money
by threatening her with that information.

2596
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:06,340
So, Danielle...

2597
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:07,609
searched for the statute of limitations...

2598
01:50:07,609 --> 01:50:09,210
to see how long she could keep...

2599
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:10,979
taking money from Claire.

2600
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:13,239
And when Claire shoots a commercial,
she'll get more money.

2601
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:15,479
She looked up the commercial
and found out she shot a new one.

2602
01:50:15,479 --> 01:50:17,350
She decided to rip off more money.
I think that's what happened.

2603
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,720
Okay, go.

2604
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:20,350
Yes, so lastly...

2605
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,890
Her name is Claire...

2606
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:22,890
(Yurisa put together
the clues in a flash.)

2607
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:24,689
Claire Rubio.

2608
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:30,859
(The team of 7 goes to give their answers
for the 2nd time.)

2609
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:33,529
Who is the culprit?

2610
01:50:33,529 --> 01:50:35,170
It's Claire Rubio.

2611
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:38,039
Which floor did Danielle fall from?

2612
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:39,170
It was the sixth floor.

2613
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:43,170
What was in the video
that the culprit deleted?

2614
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:45,979
It was a video of
Claire killing someone else.

2615
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:48,979
That is correct.
I will open the final question.

2616
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:50,819
Where did Danielle film...

2617
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:53,949
the murder video in the past?

2618
01:50:54,489 --> 01:50:57,119
(Yurisa gives her final answer.)

2619
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,529
I will not reveal your answer
for the final question.

2620
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,689
Please go to the closed room and wait.

2621
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:10,699
She just passed by.

2622
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,300
She just passed by that way.

2623
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:16,069
They don't tell us
whether we got question five right.

2624
01:51:16,069 --> 01:51:17,840
- So, we got up to question four right.
- Yes, we did.

2625
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,210
(Glancing)

2626
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:23,310
They must've given their answer
for the final question.

2627
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:24,319
It's over.

2628
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:26,380
- We don't know if they got it right.
- I know.

2629
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,420
They at least tried.

2630
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:29,720
But they got up to question four right.

2631
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:33,119
They specifically asked
which video was deleted.

2632
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,689
It wasn't like...

2633
01:51:34,689 --> 01:51:37,159
the video from April 28, 2017?

2634
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:38,760
What the video was about.

2635
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,770
We need to know what the video was about.

2636
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:42,100
But the thing is,

2637
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,699
we didn't have information on Claire.

2638
01:51:43,699 --> 01:51:44,699
- Right.
- There wasn't any.

2639
01:51:45,369 --> 01:51:47,609
So, we must've missed something...

2640
01:51:47,609 --> 01:51:48,640
from the first hint.

2641
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:50,079
I didn't miss anything.

2642
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:52,380
Was there anything related to
April 28, 2017?

2643
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,149
We need to know what this video was about.

2644
01:51:54,909 --> 01:51:57,350
Did anyone see material on something
related to a video?

2645
01:51:57,649 --> 01:51:58,920
So, over there... My gosh.

2646
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:00,750
Someone saw evidence that could be
the answer...

2647
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,850
for this question.

2648
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,989
We need to know who that was.

2649
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:07,029
Let's think about it for a second.

2650
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:08,329
(The team of 6 still hasn't found
the clue about question 4.)

2651
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:09,930
Anyway, our team was...

2652
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:11,699
focused on the details of the evidence,

2653
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:15,500
and we were getting quite confused.

2654
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:17,100
But could it be such a hard question?

2655
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:19,600
And there were...

2656
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:22,340
so many clues that were hard to memorize
in the pictures.

2657
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:25,039
You could just go off of your instincts
when it comes to deductions.

2658
01:52:25,479 --> 01:52:27,149
Try to recall your clues.

2659
01:52:27,149 --> 01:52:31,119
In Round One,
I just saw Danielle and Roy...

2660
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:32,149
on the rooftop.

2661
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,619
- That was it.
- Murder.

2662
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:35,350
- The extra information.
- Murder.

2663
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,390
- A murder video?
- She searched for...

2664
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,460
the statute of limitations
on murder cases.

2665
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:39,189
A murder video?

2666
01:52:39,859 --> 01:52:40,989
Yes, that's it.

2667
01:52:40,989 --> 01:52:44,000
She wasn't looking up something
about this current murder case.

2668
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,859
- She was looking up an old case.
- Something from the past.

2669
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,399
Claire was in this news article,

2670
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,369
saying that she had donated
50,000 dollars to her school.

2671
01:52:51,369 --> 01:52:52,699
She has been making donations every year.

2672
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:54,869
So, did she maybe kill someone at school?

2673
01:52:54,869 --> 01:52:56,039
- Right, that could be true.
- Did she kill someone?

2674
01:52:56,039 --> 01:52:57,039
That could be true.

2675
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:58,979
She killed someone once,
she could do it again.

2676
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,949
Xitsuh was making guesses.

2677
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:04,319
Xitsuh is good at other games too,
but I think he's especially good...

2678
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:06,750
at making deductions and inferences...

2679
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:08,619
and using his imagination.

2680
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:10,920
Go over the details,

2681
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,119
in case you remember anything.

2682
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:14,729
(Chungju-Man goes to give his answer.)

2683
01:53:14,729 --> 01:53:18,630
(If Chungju-Man gets the question right,)

2684
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:21,899
(and Yurisa gets
the last question wrong...)

2685
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:23,500
Here is the fourth question.

2686
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:27,609
What was in the video
that the culprit deleted?

2687
01:53:27,869 --> 01:53:30,439
It was a video of a murder.

2688
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:34,279
Please include the subject
and give a detailed answer.

2689
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:37,750
I gave my answer,
thinking it was obviously Claire's doing,

2690
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:39,619
but she told me to give a detailed answer.

2691
01:53:39,819 --> 01:53:42,989
From my perspective,
I got hooked on the "who."

2692
01:53:43,989 --> 01:53:45,489
I have to get the "who" right too.

2693
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,859
It was a video of Danielle being murdered.

2694
01:53:51,729 --> 01:53:52,829
That is incorrect.

2695
01:53:52,829 --> 01:53:54,229
Please go back to the headquarters.

2696
01:53:54,229 --> 01:53:56,600
You cannot give an answer for ten minutes.

2697
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,600
(The team of 6 gets it wrong.)

2698
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,699
(The team of 7, you are incorrect.)

2699
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,039
Yurisa, please return to headquarters...

2700
01:54:02,039 --> 01:54:03,880
and continue with your deductions.

2701
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:08,380
Where did she film the video...

2702
01:54:08,409 --> 01:54:09,479
of Claire killing someone?

2703
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:11,619
We talked about this before.

2704
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,550
Gosh.

2705
01:54:13,989 --> 01:54:16,890
I didn't see that video.

2706
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:18,189
Since I didn't see it,

2707
01:54:18,489 --> 01:54:20,289
I heard that they filmed the murder...

2708
01:54:20,289 --> 01:54:23,260
that happened on Building B
from another building.

2709
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,130
So, at first,
I thought that she had filmed the video...

2710
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:27,300
from the opposite side,
which is Building G.

2711
01:54:28,029 --> 01:54:29,699
From what I think,
it has to be at their school.

2712
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:31,470
If there was really nothing else
in Round One,

2713
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:34,170
she killed a classmate at school.

2714
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,439
I think it's right
since she makes donations to her school.

2715
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:39,409
- Right.
- Then, let's assume that's right.

2716
01:54:39,909 --> 01:54:40,909
- Okay.
- A classmate.

2717
01:54:41,149 --> 01:54:42,479
- A classmate at school...
- Right.

2718
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:44,949
Number five will be hard, right?

2719
01:54:44,949 --> 01:54:46,079
- Those guys...
- Right.

2720
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:47,949
But number five could be
based on something we already know.

2721
01:54:58,899 --> 01:55:00,130
- Would you like to give your answer?
- Yes.

2722
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:01,130
(The team of 7 gives their answer.)

2723
01:55:01,130 --> 01:55:02,500
- Here is the first question.
- Okay.

2724
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,600
Who is the culprit?

2725
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:06,069
- It's Claire Rubio.
- That is correct.

2726
01:55:06,069 --> 01:55:08,239
Which floor did Danielle fall from?

2727
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,279
- It was the sixth floor.
- That is correct.

2728
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,979
Where did the culprit visit
after committing the crime,

2729
01:55:12,979 --> 01:55:14,979
and what did the culprit do there?

2730
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:16,779
She deleted a video at Danielle's house.

2731
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:19,850
What was in the video
that the culprit deleted?

2732
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:25,260
The video was of Claire murdering
a classmate.

2733
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,630
I will open the final question.

2734
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:29,960
Where did Danielle film...

2735
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:32,800
the murder video in the past?

2736
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,869
It was from Building B.

2737
01:55:37,939 --> 01:55:39,340
Where did Danielle film...

2738
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:42,439
the murder video in the past?

2739
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:47,680
(Shutting his eyes tight)

2740
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:53,750
(Unlike Yurisa, who didn't see the map...)

2741
01:55:54,189 --> 01:55:56,090
The place where she could see that...

2742
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:57,159
I had information about that map too.

2743
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:59,489
(Chungju-Man had seen the map himself.)

2744
01:56:07,529 --> 01:56:09,000
(Where did Danielle film
the murder video in the past?)

2745
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,130
It was from Building H.

2746
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:16,239
The game has come to an end.

2747
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,680
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2748
01:56:19,579 --> 01:56:21,909
I will reveal the results
of the Money Challenge.

2749
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:26,680
I will tell you how many questions...

2750
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:27,689
each team got right.

2751
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,020
The team of 6, out of 5 questions,

2752
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:40,829
you got four questions right.

2753
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:44,140
The team of 7, out of 5 questions,

2754
01:56:44,569 --> 01:56:46,670
you got five questions right.

2755
01:56:51,909 --> 01:56:53,579
When will we win? Darn it.

2756
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:57,619
Where did Danielle film
the murder video in the past?

2757
01:56:57,619 --> 01:56:58,649
(For the final question,)

2758
01:56:58,649 --> 01:57:00,250
(Chungju-Man answered with Building H.)

2759
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:02,149
I had information about that map too.

2760
01:57:02,289 --> 01:57:03,520
But the other team was...

2761
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,189
already on their 2nd try for question 5.

2762
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,560
But based on common sense,
it just had to be Building B.

2763
01:57:08,489 --> 01:57:09,689
But they got it wrong.

2764
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:11,460
So, this was how I thought about it.

2765
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:13,300
It must not be B.

2766
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:15,470
It's not B.

2767
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:16,670
Where else could she see that scene from?

2768
01:57:17,069 --> 01:57:18,140
Then, it's either G or H.

2769
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:20,340
But G was at an angle, so it must be H,

2770
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:22,970
since it's facing the broad side
of the building. That's what I thought.

2771
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:26,039
So, in the end,

2772
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:27,850
we were bound to lose.

2773
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:30,310
The player who contributed the most?

2774
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:31,979
Wouldn't that be me?

2775
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,350
When we were making deductions,

2776
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:38,119
I took the lead and took the team
in the right direction.

2777
01:57:38,119 --> 01:57:40,489
We won in a team competition,
so it doesn't really mean much.

2778
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:44,000
I learned a lot about how the team works,

2779
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,960
and I think that was quite meaningful
in this game.

2780
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,970
The team that won in the last
team competition of Bloody Game is...

2781
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:51,770
the team of seven.

2782
01:57:53,739 --> 01:57:55,409
Every player in the team of seven...

2783
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:57,380
will receive 20,000 dollars
in personal funds...

2784
01:57:58,079 --> 01:57:59,739
and an Elimination Exemption Card.

2785
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:01,680
According to the rules of Bloody Game,

2786
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,979
your funds will be stored in the vault.

2787
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:06,779
As soon as I saw my clue,

2788
01:58:06,779 --> 01:58:08,720
the moment I saw that someone was falling,

2789
01:58:09,149 --> 01:58:11,390
I realized that it was
a very important clue.

2790
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,489
(Heo Seong Beom was in Room 4
with Steve Yea.)

2791
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:19,430
There was a building on this side
and on that side.

2792
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:21,630
But when I took a close look
at the buildings,

2793
01:58:22,029 --> 01:58:25,300
someone was pushing another person
off of a building.

2794
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:28,210
So, this video is the evidence,
and because of this evidence,

2795
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:30,479
this murder case would've started.

2796
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:32,010
My thoughts went all the way there.

2797
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:36,680
(Seong Beom's clue played a big part
in their deductions.)

2798
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,149
I'm so happy to think
that we'll be staying here.

2799
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,460
- What? Who was killed?
- Yes.

2800
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:45,920
(Before the results were announced)

2801
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:49,789
So, question four was asking
what the video was about.

2802
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,260
So, it was a video of someone
pushing another person off of a building.

2803
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:54,529
- Darn it.
- Seriously.

2804
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,399
A video of someone pushing another
off of a building?

2805
01:58:57,399 --> 01:58:59,470
Was that in the clues?

2806
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,840
How do you know that?

2807
01:59:01,039 --> 01:59:02,609
- What?
- Didn't you share that with them?

2808
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:04,039
What?

2809
01:59:04,609 --> 01:59:06,079
- I shared everything.
- I know, so...

2810
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:07,649
In the video that she filmed,

2811
01:59:07,649 --> 01:59:09,510
someone was pushing another
off of the rooftop.

2812
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:12,020
In my video?

2813
01:59:12,149 --> 01:59:13,720
What were you doing? Didn't you see it?

2814
01:59:13,819 --> 01:59:15,720
The blonde girl. So that's Claire, right?

2815
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,319
Claire was pushing someone
off of a building.

2816
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,760
I didn't see that at all.

2817
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,090
I think you're acting.

2818
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:25,430
No, seriously. I didn't see that at all.

2819
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,600
That was such an important clue,

2820
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,069
so actually, if we had just had that,

2821
01:59:29,069 --> 01:59:31,340
we could've reduced our time by so much.

2822
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,770
And we would've proceeded faster...

2823
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:35,270
according to that clue.

2824
01:59:35,369 --> 01:59:37,210
I don't know
how he couldn't have seen that.

2825
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:39,180
But then,
what did he memorize from his clue?

2826
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:40,340
Which floor was it?

2827
01:59:41,149 --> 01:59:42,149
The number of windows?

2828
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:45,350
I really want to see that picture.

2829
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:47,180
What was the picture about
that he missed that part...

2830
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,119
and failed to tell us about it?
I was so angry.

2831
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:51,960
The team of six who lost
in today's Money Challenge...

2832
01:59:52,189 --> 01:59:55,859
must vote to choose one teammate
as the elimination candidate.

2833
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:57,359
Before the voting,

2834
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:00,630
I will announce the elimination candidate
designated by the new rule.

2835
02:00:00,729 --> 02:00:01,970
- What?
- What?

2836
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:06,539
- What?
- What?

2837
02:00:07,539 --> 02:00:08,609
What?

2838
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:10,710
- The new rule?
- What?

2839
02:00:10,739 --> 02:00:13,640
The elimination candidate
designated by the new rule is...

2840
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:17,079
Lee Gina.

2841
02:00:17,079 --> 02:00:19,380
(Lee Gina)

2842
02:00:19,619 --> 02:00:21,390
- What's going on?
- What?

2843
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,090
You don't know?

2844
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:24,359
- I don't know.
- What is going on?

2845
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:25,760
What is going on?

2846
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:34,770
Did they not go home?

2847
02:00:35,399 --> 02:00:36,399
Those who were eliminated.

2848
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:39,140
The losing team
will enter the voting room...

2849
02:00:39,569 --> 02:00:42,810
and vote for one player
to advance to the Deathmatch.

2850
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:46,340
Please vote for the elimination candidate.

2851
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:50,079
Additional voting rights
are 20,000 dollars per vote...

2852
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:53,720
and can only be purchased in
the voting room during the voting period.

2853
02:00:54,590 --> 02:00:56,989
Voting will end in an hour.

2854
02:00:58,289 --> 02:00:59,890
You know there's a key...

2855
02:01:00,289 --> 02:01:03,430
in number five in the rule book, right?

2856
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,100
Is there anything else
that could be the new rule?

2857
02:01:05,159 --> 02:01:06,460
- Did you open something?
- Sorry?

2858
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,470
- Did you open something?
- No.

2859
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:09,899
- I didn't.
- We have no idea about the new rule.

2860
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,770
There hasn't been an event
that would give us...

2861
02:01:12,939 --> 02:01:14,069
- such abilities or authority.
- Anyway,

2862
02:01:14,069 --> 02:01:15,909
we should vote.

2863
02:01:15,909 --> 02:01:17,140
So will you please
get the heck out of here?

2864
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:21,079
This punk is up for something.

2865
02:01:22,279 --> 02:01:24,180
What do you mean? We all lost.

2866
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:26,319
Why would Gina go then?

2867
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:28,789
- That's why it's ridiculous.
- He's acting like he doesn't know.

2868
02:01:30,619 --> 02:01:33,560
Did Dong Min teach them how to act?

2869
02:01:33,659 --> 02:01:35,060
How can they all act so naturally?

2870
02:01:35,829 --> 02:01:37,930
- Let's go for now.
- Yes. Let's go for now.

2871
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:39,260
I guess only some of us know about it.

2872
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:41,000
Yes. It seems some people know.

2873
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:50,640
The new rule?
Does Seong Beom not know about it either?

2874
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:52,180
They could be acting.

2875
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:53,640
They could be acting or not.

2876
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:55,210
They act like they don't know.

2877
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:56,350
And we really don't know.

2878
02:01:57,479 --> 02:01:58,680
We really don't know.

2879
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:02,949
First of all, it's my fault.

2880
02:02:03,619 --> 02:02:05,060
We just made a wild guess.

2881
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:07,760
It's our fault anyway.

2882
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:09,359
I'll go to the Deathmatch.

2883
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:10,899
Because I led it and failed.

2884
02:02:10,899 --> 02:02:12,100
Let's think about it for now.

2885
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,600
Vote for me. I mean it.

2886
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,800
Don't waste your private funds.

2887
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:18,069
Vote for me. I'll go.

2888
02:02:18,369 --> 02:02:20,470
I thought it was right for the person
who took the most responsibility...

2889
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:22,039
and led the game...

2890
02:02:22,609 --> 02:02:25,439
to take responsibility
when losing the game.

2891
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,180
The game was led by me,

2892
02:02:28,649 --> 02:02:29,810
so I blamed myself a lot.

2893
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:31,319
I was angry at myself.

2894
02:02:31,979 --> 02:02:34,520
I actually thought
I couldn't avoid responsibility.

2895
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:37,319
So I told them to vote for me.
I volunteered to go.

2896
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,159
Vote for me. I'll go.

2897
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:44,159
I can't do this anymore
in this mental state.

2898
02:02:44,859 --> 02:02:46,960
You're mad at yourself anyway. Right?

2899
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:48,470
I'm so angry. And Jin Ho,

2900
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:50,899
I heard there was a murder scene.

2901
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:52,300
I really didn't see it.

2902
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:54,310
- A scene where the woman fell.
- I actually talked about this.

2903
02:02:54,409 --> 02:02:56,409
I talked about this,
but I didn't see it at all.

2904
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:57,979
If we had known...

2905
02:02:57,979 --> 02:02:59,909
It's definitely what we regret the most.

2906
02:02:59,909 --> 02:03:02,680
It's obviously his fault.

2907
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:04,420
I couldn't see it by mistake.

2908
02:03:05,079 --> 02:03:07,489
I even checked it twice.

2909
02:03:07,619 --> 02:03:08,750
But I didn't see it at all.

2910
02:03:08,789 --> 02:03:10,050
We were looking at it together,
but I didn't see it.

2911
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:12,020
I even checked
how many megabytes it was...

2912
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,529
and how many minutes and seconds it took.

2913
02:03:14,529 --> 02:03:16,489
As soon as I went, I asked
if there was a 300MB video on the list.

2914
02:03:17,130 --> 02:03:18,529
That's the first thing I asked.

2915
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,930
How come I didn't see it?

2916
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:25,399
- Honestly...
- I mean...

2917
02:03:25,399 --> 02:03:27,170
It's my fault too.

2918
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:30,369
I'm so disappointed in myself.

2919
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,739
I can't believe
I lost seven times in a row.

2920
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:37,550
Vote for me.
I'll lose for the eighth time and leave.

2921
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:50,430
Stay here for a moment.

2922
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,260
Steve, do you want to smoke with me
up there?

2923
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:53,359
Yes.

2924
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,869
It was iffy. I want to believe it's not,

2925
02:04:00,909 --> 02:04:05,310
but I'm not sure
if Steve really didn't see it.

2926
02:04:05,409 --> 02:04:07,779
I thought he was either an amazing player
who was a spy...

2927
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:10,079
or he was overestimated.

2928
02:04:10,949 --> 02:04:12,050
Why did he do that?

2929
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:15,989
It didn't make any sense,
which made me not suspect him.

2930
02:04:16,189 --> 02:04:17,590
The spy...

2931
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:20,319
can subtly give us
distorted information...

2932
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:22,359
or claim that they were mistaken,

2933
02:04:22,359 --> 02:04:24,699
but saying they didn't see anything at all
doesn't make sense.

2934
02:04:27,029 --> 02:04:28,170
Did you really not see it?

2935
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:29,430
I mean...

2936
02:04:30,069 --> 02:04:31,539
I also think it's ridiculous.

2937
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:33,739
Let's say I'm the spy.

2938
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:35,869
The information is so important.

2939
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:37,640
It doesn't make sense
that I didn't see it.

2940
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:39,979
- I don't think you're the spy at all.
- I really didn't see it.

2941
02:04:40,279 --> 02:04:41,850
I checked it twice. Darn it.

2942
02:04:43,779 --> 02:04:45,020
How come I didn't see it?

2943
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:51,920
In this situation,

2944
02:04:52,289 --> 02:04:54,630
it's true you missed
an important piece of information.

2945
02:04:54,829 --> 02:04:56,829
Why don't you go and win?

2946
02:04:57,489 --> 02:04:59,430
- I thought about it too.
- That's what I want to say.

2947
02:04:59,899 --> 02:05:02,630
If you insist, I could do that.

2948
02:05:03,399 --> 02:05:05,170
But I'm so tired now.

2949
02:05:05,170 --> 02:05:06,539
My brain stopped working.

2950
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:10,909
Darn it. I'm so tired.

2951
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:14,979
I could do that with no problem, but...

2952
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:23,420
We all worked hard anyway.

2953
02:05:24,289 --> 02:05:25,789
But you made a mistake,

2954
02:05:25,789 --> 02:05:27,489
and the clue was critical.

2955
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:30,189
Moreover, I saw you...

2956
02:05:30,289 --> 02:05:32,260
nod off...

2957
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:34,300
and lose concentration
while playing the game today.

2958
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,699
In a situation like this,
if you go and win confidently,

2959
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:40,439
- it'd be...
- I also thought about it by myself.

2960
02:05:40,539 --> 02:05:43,369
I'm not saying this
because I don't want to go.

2961
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:45,109
The other team might think
you're abandoning me...

2962
02:05:45,109 --> 02:05:47,710
because I made one mistake
and our bond isn't as strong as before.

2963
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:50,949
But you should know
we're not playing a friendship game.

2964
02:05:50,949 --> 02:05:52,920
Of course, we're not.
I'm not making an excuse...

2965
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:55,390
- or saying I don't want to go.
- Okay.

2966
02:05:55,850 --> 02:05:57,590
It doesn't seem right to say I'll go.

2967
02:05:58,289 --> 02:06:02,060
Steve is a little suspicious.

2968
02:06:02,989 --> 02:06:05,529
I could do the Deathmatch.

2969
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,600
But I'm in a bad condition.

2970
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,770
So I really didn't want to go.

2971
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:13,239
Are you organizing your thoughts?

2972
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:15,310
Are you?

2973
02:06:16,939 --> 02:06:18,340
Is it because you're not confident?

2974
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,149
To be honest, that's one of the reasons.

2975
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:24,479
I didn't think you'd back off like this.

2976
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,949
- I normally wouldn't.
- That's what I'm saying.

2977
02:06:25,949 --> 02:06:27,819
I want to see you take responsibility.

2978
02:06:27,819 --> 02:06:28,949
Make the decision for me.

2979
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:31,220
Let me have a cup of coffee.

2980
02:06:31,989 --> 02:06:33,020
Xitsuh.

2981
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:35,289
In the end,
he wants us to make the decision.

2982
02:06:36,029 --> 02:06:37,359
Do you know what I mean?

2983
02:06:50,569 --> 02:06:52,210
I couldn't steal Steve's money.

2984
02:06:52,909 --> 02:06:54,140
You don't know what will happen.

2985
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:55,909
(Steve Yea)

2986
02:06:55,979 --> 02:06:57,350
Show us what you got. Okay?

2987
02:07:00,989 --> 02:07:02,720
I said I couldn't do it.
Why does he keep saying that?

2988
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:04,960
(Steve Yea)

2989
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,529
(Steve Yea)

2990
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,770
Voting is over.

2991
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:23,069
I will announce the elimination candidate.

2992
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:26,979
As a result of the vote, the player
who will play the Deathmatch is...

2993
02:07:28,449 --> 02:07:30,180
Steve Yea.

2994
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:34,590
(Steve Yea)

2995
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,390
You got this.

2996
02:07:36,689 --> 02:07:37,689
You can do it.

2997
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:39,319
This game sucks.

2998
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:40,720
I'll see you in the Remaining.

2999
02:07:41,159 --> 02:07:43,859
Gosh, what's this?

3000
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:46,060
I'll just send them myself.

3001
02:07:47,359 --> 02:07:48,729
There was no one to vote among us.

3002
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
That's why I became the target.

3003
02:07:51,069 --> 02:07:52,640
I think I'll do well.

3004
02:07:53,569 --> 02:07:55,340
It'll be embarrassing if I lose.

3005
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:01,109
Deathmatch players,
please gather at the Main Hall.

3006
02:08:03,149 --> 02:08:04,149
Lee Gina.

3007
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:06,149
Steve Yea.

3008
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:08,050
The two players...

3009
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:11,489
should play a 1-on-1 Deathmatch.

3010
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:15,789
I just hope it's not poker.

3011
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:18,699
If it's something like Blind Bet
we played before,

3012
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,329
I can't win against Steve.

3013
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:24,130
I will reveal today's Deathmatch.

3014
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:26,140
Today's Deathmatch is...

3015
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:29,340
Expression Maze.

3016
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:31,039
(Expression Maze)

3017
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:32,739
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

3018
02:08:33,109 --> 02:08:34,409
Expression Maze is a game...

3019
02:08:34,649 --> 02:08:36,909
where you have to find
the combination of numbers...

3020
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:39,420
among the randomly written numbers
that can make the answer value...

3021
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:43,689
and complete the path
faster than the opponent player.

3022
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,590
There are three rounds in total.

3023
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,289
Two in Round One.

3024
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,060
Two in Round Two.

3025
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:51,899
One in Round Three.

3026
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:55,100
A total of five questions
will be presented in order.

3027
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:57,939
As soon as each round begins,

3028
02:08:58,239 --> 02:09:01,569
the front side of the game board
with 16 numbers will be revealed.

3029
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:06,039
After one minute, it will be replaced
with the back side with letters.

3030
02:09:07,409 --> 02:09:09,979
The letters at the starting point
and the ending point,

3031
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:12,020
and the answer value for each question...

3032
02:09:12,279 --> 02:09:13,819
will be revealed.

3033
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:16,750
Players must recall the numbers
on the front side...

3034
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:20,119
and complete a path from
the starting point to the ending point...

3035
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:22,430
to create the answer value.

3036
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:26,199
All numbers connected by the path
are summed,

3037
02:09:26,359 --> 02:09:29,199
and you can only connect numbers...

3038
02:09:29,399 --> 02:09:32,340
that are adjacent to each other
vertically or horizontally.

3039
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:37,109
The player should say they will answer
after completing the path...

3040
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:39,380
and say the letters used.

3041
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:41,210
(Summed value: 47, answer value: 47)

3042
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:43,609
If it's correct,
the player earns one point.

3043
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,850
If it's incorrect,
no points will be deducted,

3044
02:09:46,949 --> 02:09:48,420
and the opponent player
will be given 30 seconds...

3045
02:09:48,649 --> 02:09:51,460
to say the answer.

3046
02:09:52,819 --> 02:09:55,960
Moving on to the next round
after each round ends,

3047
02:09:56,359 --> 02:09:58,500
the numbers on the front side
of the game board are replaced,

3048
02:09:58,899 --> 02:10:01,430
and you'll be given another minute
to memorize them.

3049
02:10:02,869 --> 02:10:04,470
The player with the higher score...

3050
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:07,939
at the end of all three rounds wins.

3051
02:10:08,909 --> 02:10:11,810
The Expression Maze will begin shortly.

3052
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:13,779
It's a difficult game.

3053
02:10:13,909 --> 02:10:15,210
They should've made us play poker, right?

3054
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:17,449
They should make us play poker.

3055
02:10:17,979 --> 02:10:21,350
Poker players are so good
at counting and calculating numbers.

3056
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:25,960
They're trained for it.

3057
02:10:25,989 --> 02:10:28,590
And he's the world champion poker player.

3058
02:10:28,859 --> 02:10:30,829
So it felt like a match...

3059
02:10:30,829 --> 02:10:32,760
between a professional soccer player
and an ordinary person who enjoys soccer,

3060
02:10:33,399 --> 02:10:35,170
but I'm also good.

3061
02:10:35,329 --> 02:10:38,770
I also have a very good memory
and not weak with numbers.

3062
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:42,310
If I win two Deathmatches in a row,
survive, and come back...

3063
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:43,640
in such a cool way,

3064
02:10:44,239 --> 02:10:47,239
I'll become the main character.

3065
02:10:47,409 --> 02:10:50,449
I will reveal the front side
of the game board in Round One.

3066
02:10:50,449 --> 02:10:53,449
(The front side of the game board
in Round 1 is revealed.)

3067
02:10:53,649 --> 02:11:00,090
(Round 1)

3068
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:03,159
I should memorize the numbers
in a short period of time.

3069
02:11:03,630 --> 02:11:06,529
So I memorized them
as if I were memorizing a phone number.

3070
02:11:06,529 --> 02:11:09,569
For example, if there's number 11
in the 1st row, I memorize it as 1, 1.

3071
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,170
So I memorized them
as 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 1, 1, 1, 0.

3072
02:11:14,539 --> 02:11:16,810
This kind of question is very intuitive.

3073
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:18,609
It's about memory.

3074
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:21,609
So I didn't use any tricks.

3075
02:11:25,050 --> 02:11:26,520
One minute has passed.

3076
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:28,520
I will open the game board.

3077
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:31,489
(The back side of the game board
is revealed.)

3078
02:11:37,489 --> 02:11:39,399
I will reveal the first question.

3079
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:47,239
(Round 1, answer value: 66)

3080
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:50,470
It's doable.

3081
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:54,979
I think I can do it
if I just stay focused, but...

3082
02:11:57,449 --> 02:11:59,020
- I'll answer.
- My gosh.

3083
02:11:59,979 --> 02:12:01,750
I was like,

3084
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:04,250
"There were numbers like this."

3085
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,260
"Oh, it's blocked.
Should I add these numbers?"

3086
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:07,789
But he already said he would answer.

3087
02:12:07,789 --> 02:12:09,060
(Steve Yea said
he would answer so quickly.)

3088
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:12,529
"It's impossible to be that fast.
What's going on?"

3089
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:14,359
"Is he trying to intimidate me first?"

3090
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:17,069
I'll answer. C, G, F, J, I, M.

3091
02:12:17,399 --> 02:12:19,300
C, G, F...

3092
02:12:19,470 --> 02:12:21,310
- J, I, M.
- J, I, M.

3093
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:22,739
Let me check.

3094
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:25,239
C is five.

3095
02:12:25,239 --> 02:12:26,739
(Summed value: 16, answer value: 66)

3096
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:27,939
G is 11.

3097
02:12:28,479 --> 02:12:29,649
F is seven.

3098
02:12:29,649 --> 02:12:30,850
(Summed value: 23, answer value: 66)

3099
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:32,079
J is 19.

3100
02:12:32,079 --> 02:12:33,850
(Summed value: 42, answer value: 66)

3101
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:34,989
I is ten.

3102
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:37,319
(Summed value: 52, answer value: 66)

3103
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:38,859
M is 14.

3104
02:12:38,859 --> 02:12:41,390
The summed value is 66,
which is the answer value.

3105
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:42,430
(Steve Yea got it right.)

3106
02:12:42,430 --> 02:12:44,899
Steve Yea has earned one point.

3107
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:46,130
(Steve Yea: 1, Lee Gina: 0)

3108
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:49,069
"Is he crazy?"

3109
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:52,399
I suddenly lost motivation.

3110
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,069
Actually, I think innate talent...

3111
02:12:55,069 --> 02:12:58,180
is the most important in any field.

3112
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,979
When I heard the rules of the game
in the beginning,

3113
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:02,510
I was like,

3114
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:04,380
"Goodbye, Gina."

3115
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:07,079
I will reveal the second question.

3116
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:13,659
(Round 1, answer value: 70)

3117
02:13:16,029 --> 02:13:19,399
(Lee Gina let him answer too easily.)

3118
02:13:19,399 --> 02:13:22,029
I thought I could make the number...

3119
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:24,869
even if I don't calculate it perfectly.

3120
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:28,770
Did I spend too much time
calculating everything seriously...

3121
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:30,770
and hesitate to answer?

3122
02:13:32,539 --> 02:13:35,750
L, H, G, C, B, F, E, I.

3123
02:13:36,409 --> 02:13:37,649
Let me check.

3124
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:40,319
L is six.

3125
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:42,689
H is four.

3126
02:13:42,689 --> 02:13:44,250
(Summed value: 10, answer value: 70)

3127
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:45,359
G is 11.

3128
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:46,420
(Summed value: 21, answer value: 70)

3129
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:47,520
C is five.

3130
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:49,289
B is eight.

3131
02:13:49,289 --> 02:13:51,060
(Summed value: 34, answer value: 70)

3132
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:52,199
F is seven.

3133
02:13:52,199 --> 02:13:53,329
(Summed value: 41, answer value: 70)

3134
02:13:53,329 --> 02:13:54,430
E is nine.

3135
02:13:54,430 --> 02:13:56,170
(Summed value: 50, answer value: 70)

3136
02:13:56,170 --> 02:13:57,470
I is ten.

3137
02:13:57,869 --> 02:13:59,770
The summed value is 60,
which is incorrect.

3138
02:14:00,869 --> 02:14:01,869
I'll answer.

3139
02:14:02,909 --> 02:14:07,079
L, H, G, C, B, F, J, I.

3140
02:14:08,750 --> 02:14:10,210
Darn it.

3141
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:12,880
- Do you think it's correct?
- Let me check.

3142
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:14,949
I'm doomed.

3143
02:14:15,489 --> 02:14:16,750
It's annoying.

3144
02:14:19,590 --> 02:14:20,760
F is seven.

3145
02:14:21,659 --> 02:14:22,890
J is 19.

3146
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:25,600
(Summed value: 60, answer value: 70)

3147
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,829
I is ten.

3148
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:30,029
The summed value is 70, which is correct.

3149
02:14:31,170 --> 02:14:32,970
He has earned one point.

3150
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:36,439
I easily got the second question right.

3151
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:40,380
I will reveal the front side
of the game board in Round Two.

3152
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:41,409
(The new numbers are revealed in Round 2.)

3153
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:47,479
(Round 2)

3154
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:49,920
After Round One,

3155
02:14:50,489 --> 02:14:53,159
I thought about my weakness
compared to Steve.

3156
02:14:53,590 --> 02:14:57,829
He can sum the numbers way faster than me.

3157
02:14:57,890 --> 02:15:02,199
So I thought I should add the numbers
in advance.

3158
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:10,869
One minute has passed.

3159
02:15:10,869 --> 02:15:12,439
(1 minute has passed.)

3160
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:14,340
I'll give you the third question.

3161
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:16,350
(The third question is revealed.)

3162
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:23,920
(Round 2, answer value: 39)

3163
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:26,859
I wanted to seize...

3164
02:15:27,489 --> 02:15:29,130
the opportunity.

3165
02:15:29,130 --> 02:15:31,430
(She must get it right
to turn the tables.)

3166
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:34,159
I'll answer.

3167
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:36,229
A, E, F, G, K, L.

3168
02:15:36,670 --> 02:15:40,470
A, E, F, G, K, L. Let me check.

3169
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:42,710
A is one.

3170
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:44,840
E is eight.

3171
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:46,479
(Summed value: 9, answer value: 39)

3172
02:15:46,539 --> 02:15:49,279
Gosh, he's so fast.

3173
02:15:50,109 --> 02:15:51,350
It's so annoying.

3174
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:53,420
Why did Steve come?

3175
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:58,020
It seemed
Chungju-Man was bad at calculating.

3176
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:59,189
He should've come.

3177
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:01,220
My goodness.

3178
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:03,829
K is six.

3179
02:16:03,829 --> 02:16:05,300
(Summed value: 35, answer value: 39)

3180
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:07,829
L is four.

3181
02:16:07,829 --> 02:16:09,229
(Summed value: 39, answer value: 39)

3182
02:16:09,229 --> 02:16:11,840
The summed value is 39, which is correct.

3183
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:15,609
The game ends
as Steve Yea got three questions right.

3184
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:19,479
My gosh. I can't believe I'm going home
after being defeated so miserably.

3185
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:20,979
I envied him.

3186
02:16:20,979 --> 02:16:23,949
It was a legendary moment for him.

3187
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:28,050
And I ended up being
the foolish sacrificial lamb by his side.

3188
02:16:28,789 --> 02:16:30,050
You faced a tough opponent.

3189
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:31,590
Bye.

3190
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:33,159
(Bye, Gina.)

3191
02:16:33,719 --> 02:16:35,930
I will announce
the result of the Deathmatch.

3192
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:38,700
The eliminated player is...

3193
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:43,030
Lee Gina.

3194
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:44,500
(Lee Gina)

3195
02:16:44,799 --> 02:16:47,500
Lee Gina, please pack your bags...

3196
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:49,370
and leave Bloody Game immediately.

3197
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:53,639
Eliminated players cannot return
to Bloody Game again.

3198
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:55,450
You worked hard.

3199
02:16:55,809 --> 02:16:57,010
You worked hard.

3200
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:58,680
(Lee Gina is the sixth player
to be eliminated.)

3201
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:00,450
My gosh. Thank you.

3202
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,350
I'm so disappointed.

3203
02:17:02,889 --> 02:17:05,459
Every moment,
I didn't think of anything...

3204
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:08,020
and just focused on the mission...

3205
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:10,030
like a racehorse.

3206
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:12,829
Put it in your bra or panties.

3207
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:15,969
(She was so competitive...)

3208
02:17:15,969 --> 02:17:19,770
(that she did anything to win.)

3209
02:17:20,299 --> 02:17:21,540
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

3210
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:22,709
The reality hits me.

3211
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:25,610
When will the deal end? I feel like dying.

3212
02:17:25,639 --> 02:17:27,540
Let me do it.

3213
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:29,209
I think I'll come in last.

3214
02:17:29,409 --> 02:17:31,110
Seventh place is Xitsuh.

3215
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:36,590
(She was honest without any pretense.)

3216
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:37,989
Hi, betrayer.

3217
02:17:37,989 --> 02:17:39,020
I'm back from the wild.

3218
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:41,290
We wanted you to suffer.

3219
02:17:42,559 --> 02:17:44,260
An intruder has been found.

3220
02:17:44,729 --> 02:17:45,899
Acau is gone.

3221
02:17:45,899 --> 02:17:47,559
I didn't know what would happen
and when it would happen,

3222
02:17:47,559 --> 02:17:49,530
so I was waiting anxiously.

3223
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:51,569
What? Did we calculate it wrong?

3224
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:53,299
I was scared that if I said it out loud,

3225
02:17:53,399 --> 02:17:56,270
it'd be like admitting that I'd go.

3226
02:17:57,610 --> 02:17:59,540
I was dragged into the Deathmatch.

3227
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,250
"What am I doing here?"

3228
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:05,219
I thought like that sometimes.

3229
02:18:05,379 --> 02:18:08,450
When I played my first Deathmatch...

3230
02:18:08,450 --> 02:18:10,350
(Just with one Deathmatch,)

3231
02:18:10,350 --> 02:18:12,159
(she proved her abilities.)

3232
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:14,090
- She's good.
- This is legendary.

3233
02:18:14,090 --> 02:18:18,260
(She changed
everyone's opinions about her.)

3234
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:19,559
I felt so accomplished.

3235
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:22,930
I think it was the happiest moment
in my life.

3236
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:24,069
So it's memorable.

3237
02:18:24,469 --> 02:18:27,700
There are so many things
I'm looking forward to in the future.

3238
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:31,409
It feels like something amazing
is waiting for me.

3239
02:18:31,409 --> 02:18:34,540
But I know nothing and act like a fool.

3240
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:37,110
I'm so curious.

3241
02:18:37,350 --> 02:18:38,719
What's happening?

3242
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:42,719
Why?

3243
02:18:42,889 --> 02:18:44,649
(Opening)

3244
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:46,020
Gosh, what's this?

3245
02:18:46,559 --> 02:18:48,959
My goodness. I got goosebumps.
What's this?

3246
02:19:02,809 --> 02:19:05,280
Did someone stab me?

3247
02:19:06,479 --> 02:19:07,579
Is it a curse?

3248
02:19:09,309 --> 02:19:11,280
Who stabbed me like this?

3249
02:19:15,923 --> 02:19:17,923
Dramaday.me
