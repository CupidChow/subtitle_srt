00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,679
Hello.

2
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,420
Welcome to Bloody Game.

3
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,990
Bloody Game is a very unfair...

4
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,560
and irrational game.

5
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,729
You must use any means such as
deceit, betrayal, scheme, and politics...

6
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,100
in order to survive.

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Unless you break the rules of Bloody Game,

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,739
nothing you do for survival
will be a problem.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,109
However, remember that every decision...

10
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,810
has a consequence.

(Si Yoon, Columbia University student,

29
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,060
I saw two legends of all time,

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,930
Hong Jin Ho and Jang Dong Min.

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,099
They called Jang Dong Min and Hong Jin Ho?

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
This is too much.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,199
I lose my reasons
when I'm next to threatening people.

34
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,569
I must kill them off soon.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,870
For goodness' sake.

36
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,080
The worst thing that can happen
to a commoner like me...

37
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,780
is seeing the two of them join forces.

38
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,110
It'll be better to send one home quickly.

39
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,150
The player I'm the wariest of is...

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,150
Hong Jin Ho.

41
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,849
Eon Kyu and I competed
against each other...

42
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,189
on another show.

43
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,729
He played games in a ridiculous way...

44
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,389
and showed a half-psychotic side,

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,330
so I didn't like him very much.

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,729
As soon as I saw him,
I had a bit of a mental breakdown.

47
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,069
Then I saw Jang Dong Min.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,500
I thought he had retired...

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,569
from survival shows.

50
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,639
Is he in need of money? Why is he here?

51
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,639
"Hey, what is Jang Dong Min doing here?"

52
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,479
"Let's get rid of him first."

53
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,379
I'm bound to be the common enemy.

54
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,879
I checked out other members.

55
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,050
Yurisa showed that side of her
in Season Two.

56
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,620
An insufferable side.

57
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,590
She has no common sense.

58
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,289
She needs to be taught a lesson.

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,000
And this show has both me and Hong Jin Ho,

60
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,370
so I'll be able to exert
the most amount of force...

61
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,199
in my lifetime.

62
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,099
Who is the strongest?

63
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,039
I think it'll be proven in Bloody Game 3.

64
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,949
Before starting the game,
an announcement will be made.

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,849
Bloody Game provides private funds
that can be used...

66
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,219
in games and voting.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,360
The fund distribution is based on
the class of the general income tax...

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,860
the players' annual incomes
from last year fall into.

69
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,330
Currently, the players
with the most private funds are...

70
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,069
Hong Jin Ho,

71
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,430
Jang Dong Min,

72
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,069
and Pani Bottle.

73
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,310
(1.5 million dollars: Hong Jin Ho)

74
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,080
(500,000 dollars:
Jang Dong Min, Pani Bottle)

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,479
(Players' private funds:
200,000 dollars, 150,000 dollars,)

76
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,210
(100,000 dollars, 80,000 dollars,
60,000 dollars)

77
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,349
In front of you is a pile of money...

78
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,979
that's a collection
of all players' private funds.

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,789
Through the first game,

80
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,219
take as many private funds as you want.

81
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,389
The private funds you acquired...

82
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,389
can be used
only during the games and voting.

83
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,259
It's fake money that won't be included
in the final prize.

84
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,029
Now, the first game will begin.

85
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,000
Currently, there are nine players.

86
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,639
The number of players
who can enter the Bloody Paradise...

87
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,509
is eight.

88
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,480
As of now, your legs...

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,180
are tied up...

90
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,910
with a combination lock.

91
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,920
The problem that will give you
the password...

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,189
will be shown on the screen soon.

93
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,560
Solve the problem
and acquire the password...

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,819
to open the lock.

95
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,189
Then put money in the sack
in front of you...

96
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,689
and go to the Bloody Paradise.

97
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,060
There is no limit to the number of sacks
or the amount of money...

98
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,199
you can take.

99
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,230
Get out of the building...

100
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,870
and follow the signs
to find your route quickly.

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
Once you arrive at the paradise
and deposit the acquired private funds,

102
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,939
the first challenge will be over.

103
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,550
Once eight players arrive
at the Bloody Paradise,

104
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,319
the remaining player will automatically
become an elimination candidate.

105
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,259
Now, you'll receive
the problem for the password.

106
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,470
What's that?

107
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,610
I thought each location represented
a number...

108
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,769
because there were different locations
and numbers.

109
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,279
It looked like a math equation.

110
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,949
It was about math, nonsense quiz,
or spatial intelligence.

111
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,180
I used the colors and English.

112
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,720
It was so hard.

113
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,750
It was a bit difficult.

114
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,360
It was much harder than the problem
for opening the lock in Season Two.

115
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,529
In Season 2,
Yurisa was the 1st to solve the problem.

116
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,529
Will she be able to do it
this time as well?

117
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,730
Yurisa stood out...

118
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,569
because she solved the problem
very quickly in Season Two.

119
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,439
It involved using the brain.

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,939
I went to a school for gifted students
and graduated from KAIST.

121
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,610
I had confidence in that regard.

122
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,680
I thought,
"I'll solve this problem and leave first."

123
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,709
The figures were very simple.

124
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,779
In "Bloody Game 2,"

125
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,019
Yurisa solved a similar problem
very quickly.

126
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,819
"If I fail to solve it,"

127
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,589
"I'll talk to Yurisa about it."

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,990
I thought it'd be straightforward
like the problem we got in Season Two.

129
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,300
It was easy.

130
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,300
When I get
a straightforward problem like this one,

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,000
I can solve it in 3 to 10 seconds.

132
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,750
(The first answerer, Jang Dong Min)

133
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,120
It happened so fast.

134
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,620
He was unrivaled.

135
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,519
I thought it was unbelievable.

136
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,259
"What? How did he solve it so fast?"

137
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,629
His speed matched
that of Yurisa in Season Two.

138
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,540
(47 seconds ago)

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,939
Now, you'll receive
the problem for the password.

140
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,550
When you're in a survival game,
you should never be in a daze.

141
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,079
You should always be ready
and think about what to do.

142
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,019
When I was blindfolded and gagged,

143
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,589
it was so suffocating
that I sweated like a pig.

144
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,720
I felt like I'd have a panic attack.

145
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,430
But I thought,
"I need to pull myself together."

146
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,230
"We're tied with a combination lock..."

147
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,329
"because we need to use numbers
to figure out a password."

148
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,339
"Which number game will we get?"

149
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,740
I narrowed down some candidates.

150
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,939
A, B, C, D or ga, na, da, ra...

151
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,540
or putting the numbers backward...

152
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,740
(There are only a few number games
that can be used.)

153
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,819
I saw giyeok right away.

154
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,319
Then I saw mieum.
Ga, na, da, ra, ma. Five.

155
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,620
"I'm right." I gained certainty then.

156
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,709
(Dong Min changed
the starting line of the game.)

157
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,090
Once someone solved it,

158
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,490
I began to feel pressured.

159
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,889
I only have one life.

160
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,090
If I get eliminated, it's over.

161
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,799
I moved in order to see the answer.

162
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,809
Seriously,

163
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,610
they came at me like a pack of dogs.

164
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,409
(For goodness' sake)

165
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,629
To be honest, I thought it was too much.

166
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,279
I only have one life.

167
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,539
I need to do anything to survive.

168
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,980
It was too much. It was so annoying.

169
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,080
It was completely chaotic.

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,220
Should I call it the desire for survival?

171
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,460
He had the right mindset for Bloody Game.

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,259
I acted desperately in order to survive.

173
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:50,490
If you have the will to survive,
you'll survive.

174
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,100
I felt relieved.

175
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,269
What?

176
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,470
What? For goodness' sake.

177
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,840
As soon as I solved the problem,
I turned the dials and threw the lock.

178
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,309
When I did that,

179
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,809
people went for it...

180
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,750
as if it was a bone
that still had meat on it.

181
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,879
But it was just a bone.

182
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,889
It's the right password.

183
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,490
(Si Yoon can't let it go.)

184
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,000
(No one else has gotten the answer.)

185
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,899
At first,
I thought they were the coordinates.

186
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,740
I thought of them as the coordinates.

187
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,870
I was anxious and nervous.

188
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,509
(Glancing over)

189
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,980
(My goodness)

190
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,580
Please give me a hint.

191
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,980
A hint?

192
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,279
Please give me a hint.

193
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,720
- A hint?
- Yes.

194
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,019
It's something we know very well.

195
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,990
Dong Min was hesitant at first.

196
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,490
Then he said,
"It's something we know very well."

197
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,830
(Dong Min gets out of the rope.)

198
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,700
Gosh, private funds.

199
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,740
(All players' private funds are
in one place.)

200
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,590
(He can take all players' private funds.)

201
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:31,629
What?

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,330
My goodness.

203
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,570
I wanted to take four sacks.

204
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,740
When I filled up one sack,
it was so heavy.

205
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,039
The money was so heavy.

206
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,279
Gosh, I'm getting a cramp.

207
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,120
"What can I do to have more money..."

208
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,990
"while others have less?"

209
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,620
I thought about it
as I filled up the sacks.

210
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,789
I only took a half.

211
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,139
If it isn't mine,
you guys can't have it either.

212
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,320
That lunatic is burning the money.

213
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,320
He's really evil.

214
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,720
My heart was beating so fast.
It was pounding.

215
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,789
"He's a total lunatic."

216
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,460
I had that thought.

217
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,259
Seriously.

218
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,860
It has been a while
since he starred in a survival show,

219
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,399
so he gritted his teeth.

220
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,750
To give them a mental breakdown,

221
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,379
I put on a show of playing basketball...

222
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,649
by throwing wads of cash into the drum.

223
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,889
It was too much.

224
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,220
I thought to myself,
"Why is he taking it so far?"

225
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,190
I thought,
"That's how he gains the upper ground."

226
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,730
I was so flustered.

227
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,740
I don't even have a clue.

228
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,879
When I stared at the problem,
it looked like a set of figures.

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
The mieum in the middle...

230
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,490
and siot in the problem
became crucial hints.

231
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,029
(Opening)

232
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,669
(Startled)

233
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,480
(Preventing others from cheating)

234
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,509
- It's too much.
- I'm in trouble.

235
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,419
(The second answerer, Choi Hye Seon)

236
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,919
For goodness' sake.

237
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,759
(The pile of money is burning.)

238
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,269
What?

239
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,309
Even though the money was burning,
she tried hard to take some.

240
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,870
She reminded me of Madam Jung.

241
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,720
I was like, "Is this right?"

242
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,549
There were many members
who acted with enthusiasm.

243
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:28,570
(Current 2nd place, Choi Hye Seon)

244
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,500
It might be faster to untie this rope.

245
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
I thought, "I can't solve that problem
with my brain."

246
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,480
Since it's Bloody Game,
we're allowed to use any means.

247
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,700
Gosh, he's breaking the wood.

248
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,480
I thought, "Even if they give me an hour,"

249
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,679
"I won't be able to solve the problem."

250
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,019
"I'll untie the rope,
not solve the problem."

251
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,389
But I already knew...

252
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,419
that I could untie the rope.

253
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,889
I was in the US Army.

254
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,330
My full-time job
involves working at a jail.

255
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:35,769
In the military, I received training...

256
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,700
on getting out of a rope.

257
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,240
A production crew member tied
my left foot 1st and my right foot 2nd.

258
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,440
The rope was thicker than I expected.

259
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:47,809
When the rope is thick,
there's always space.

260
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,649
I kept my right leg stiff
when it was getting tied.

261
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,120
I relaxed it later to untie the rope.

262
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,389
I untied the rope at the right foot first
and moved on to the left foot.

263
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,590
(MJ Kim had a strategy ahead of time.)

264
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,129
(Current 3rd place, MJ Kim)

265
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,190
Did she untie it with her strength?

266
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,660
Really? Can you untie it?

267
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,359
I can't untie it because it's so tight.

268
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,640
Gosh!

269
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,839
(Blocking out the noise)

270
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,680
The figures at the top
represent 1, 5, 3, and 13.

271
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,029
(The chair is almost destroyed.)

272
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,569
I only have one life.

273
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,400
I'll escape no matter what.

274
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,440
May I use the brick?

275
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,579
- What?
- May I use the brick?

276
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:25,710
- Let me use it first.
- Okay.

277
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,809
Let me use it first.

278
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,279
I still need to use it.

279
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,220
Hold on.

280
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,319
I just need to get there, right?

281
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,849
Would you please help me?

282
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,759
You should hit it here.

283
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,430
I think they'll leave first.

284
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,200
(Glancing over)

285
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,170
Other members were untying the rope.

286
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:52,140
I thought,
"At this rate, I'll place last."

287
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,369
So I decided to untie the rope as well.

288
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,410
Behind me, Pani Bottle...

289
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,910
was destroying the chair with a brick.

290
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,410
Seeing MJ Kim get out...

291
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,950
made me think,
"There's a chance I can untie it."

292
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,819
At first, I was determined
to solve it using my brain.

293
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,019
But suddenly, everyone was untying
the rope with force...

294
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,420
and getting out like an octopus.

295
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,359
I was like, "What? Is this allowed?"

296
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,160
But my body was moving already.

297
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,759
I thought, "I need to get out
and catch up at any rate."

298
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,130
They untied the rope.

299
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,569
This is bad.

300
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,099
All right.

301
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:28,940
(Current 4th place, Pani Bottle)

302
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
The money is burning! Darn it!

303
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,180
Gosh, it's hot. For goodness' sake.

304
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,950
Gosh.

305
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,849
(Joo Eon Kyu succeeded in
untying the rope.)

306
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,160
Gosh, it's hot.

307
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,500
(They get out of the rope one at a time.)

308
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,230
(Current 6th place, Yurisa)

309
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,079
I can do it.

310
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,349
After I finished destroying the chair,

311
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:14,650
I saw that my hand was bleeding.

312
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,190
I was flustered, but I needed to survive.

313
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,119
"Let's take the sacrifice and survive."

314
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,660
(Running barefoot)

315
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,829
(His eyes move frantically.)

316
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,170
(Even Heo Seong Beom escapes.)

317
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,640
(Hong Jin Ho is the only one left.)

318
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,769
What's this? Is this right?

319
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,779
I was just in a daze.

320
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,410
Dong Min untied himself
and ran out ridiculously fast.

321
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,420
I was just confused
and wondering what was going on.

322
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,390
Pani Bottle was over there
busting up his chair with a rock.

323
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,819
"What am I doing right now?
This is Bloody Game."

324
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,960
"I feel like I'm the only one
without the proper mindset now."

325
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,359
"Will I actually be eliminated
right away today?"

326
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,559
"Was this how people felt
to get eliminated on the first day?"

327
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,859
I had all sorts of thoughts in my head
and couldn't focus.

328
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,529
(The fall of the survival show legend?)

329
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,769
Where is it?

330
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:20,349
(A little while ago,
at the location of the first game)

331
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,990
(Outside the game location,)

332
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,259
(a car awaits.)

333
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,630
How can I get in?

334
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,529
(The car sets off
after he puts on a blindfold.)

335
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,170
(He gets out of the car
1km before the final destination.)

336
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,769
(The race begins again.)

337
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,579
It was so hard,

338
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,950
but I kept going, thinking I should stay
in the lead until the end.

339
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,490
What's this?

340
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,049
An enormous spaceship.

341
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,150
I felt so giddy. "This will be fun."

342
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:33,890
(A few days later)

343
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,430
Darn it.

344
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,630
Gosh. What is that?

345
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,200
Let's go!

346
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,700
Does that guy have a death wish?

347
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,940
- Darn it!
- Block him.

348
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,240
Darn it.

349
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:49,740
That's mine!

350
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,579
- They brought hammers and everything.
- What is this?

351
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:21,640
The personal fund that you've brought...

352
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,069
is 258,000 dollars.

353
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,609
It will be deposited into the safe.

354
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,259
(Jang Dong Min gets 258,000 dollars
in his personal fund.)

355
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,490
(Choi Hye Seon comes in 2nd.)

356
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,829
- Hello.
- Hello.

357
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,230
Darn it, what is this?

358
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,109
Hello.

359
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,109
I feel like I have to run.

360
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,410
What? Why are you running?

361
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,109
Doesn't it feel like you just have to run?

362
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,619
(Si Yoon comes in 4th.)

363
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,619
(Pani Bottle, Joo Eon Kyu,
and Heo Seong Beom are tied in 5th place.)

364
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,019
Is this a UFO building?

365
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,359
(Yurisa comes in 8th.)

366
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:19,160
Choi Hye Seon, the personal fund
that you've brought is 61,000 dollars.

367
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,599
MJ Kim, the private fund
that you've brought is 37,000 dollars.

368
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,609
Si Yoon, the private fund
that you've brought is 9,000 dollars.

369
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,339
Joo Eon Kyu, the private fund
that you've brought is 27,000 dollars.

370
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,150
Heo Seong Beom, the private fund
that you've brought is 5,000 dollars.

371
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,019
Pani Bottle, the private fund
that you've brought is 28,000 dollars.

372
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,559
Yurisa, the private fund
that you've brought is 29,000 dollars.

373
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,700
(Private Fund Status)

374
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,099
(Hong Jin Ho)

375
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,440
Hey, is Jin Ho in last place?

376
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,440
Jin Ho isn't even here yet.

377
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,809
When I looked back at the end,

378
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:05,339
Yurisa was behind me.

379
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,440
Yurisa is here.

380
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,849
Who do you think is in ninth place?

381
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,809
- Jin Ho?
- How did you know?

382
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,480
Hey, is Jin Ho really in last place?

383
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,650
Right.

384
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,049
I thought it made no sense.

385
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,589
I didn't expect that at all.

386
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,619
Did he lose his drive
because Dong Min was...

387
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,390
so dominating from the beginning?

388
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,730
When I heard he was in last place,

389
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,299
I thought, "There's no way he'd do that."

390
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,130
Jin Ho played the game in a weird way.

391
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,000
Why did he go this far?

392
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,299
Was he really unable to solve it?

393
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,900
Is he really going home just like this?

394
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,339
I thought so much about things like that.

395
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,119
Goodness.

396
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,190
Gosh, where am I?

397
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,960
Today, I solved the question...

398
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,460
in last place.

399
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,369
Honestly, though, this is the funny thing.

400
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,700
Soon, the answer will be revealed.

401
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,309
They just gave me the answer.

402
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,779
I used that to untie myself.

403
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,180
I got out last in a dishonorable way.

404
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,279
Gosh, these psychos.

405
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,250
I felt pathetic...

406
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,220
when I found myself left alone.
I had felt it already.

407
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:31,460
In the moment when I was picking up money,
I thought, "I should hurry up..."

408
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
"and follow those who went before."

409
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,200
That's the thought I had.

410
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,069
Actually, I don't think
I've ever felt like that before.

411
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,769
Especially in a survival game,

412
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,640
it was a rare experience that
I was unable to do anything by myself...

413
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,680
and that I was left behind...

414
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,680
all by myself.

415
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,119
But I had this experience
right at the beginning,

416
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,920
so I just thought,

417
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,289
"What's wrong with me?"

418
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,859
I kept thinking about that.

419
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,160
So, I was blundering around.

420
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,170
Three, four...

421
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,910
Hong Jin Ho, the private fund
that you've brought is 12,000 dollars.

422
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,150
(Hong Jin Ho, 12,000 dollars)

423
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,549
I think I kept feeling anxious.

424
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,289
I became the elimination candidate today.

425
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,390
This could become
my first and last interview...

426
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,660
on Bloody Game 3.

427
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,299
Looking at my current state,

428
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,400
I really think I could be going home.

429
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:45,339
I feel very melancholy.

430
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,509
Players, please gather at the Main Hall.

431
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,940
I will announce the game results.

432
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,710
The player who won in the first challenge
of Bloody Game is...

433
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,480
Jang Dong Min.

434
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,150
And the player in ninth place is...

435
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,819
- Hong Jin Ho.
- Darn it.

436
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,690
Well...

437
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,960
I was doomed.

438
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,900
This makes no sense.

439
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,500
Hong Jin Ho is still called a legend...

440
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,910
on survival game shows.

441
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,769
People around him were
busting up their chairs with rocks...

442
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,279
and getting all bloodied up.

443
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,680
People were going crazy like that,
but he wasn't doing anything...

444
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,079
and showing his weak side?

445
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,450
He should pack up and leave.

446
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,589
You punk,

447
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,690
you should stop being on the show.

448
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,859
As a result of the game, Hong Jin Ho
has become an elimination candidate.

449
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,660
On Bloody Game, a Deathmatch
will decide who gets eliminated.

450
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,130
Hong Jin Ho, who is in last place,

451
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,430
please choose two people you want to
compete with in the Deathmatch.

452
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,269
However, Jang Dong Min,
who won the challenge,

453
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:57,170
will be exempt from being chosen.

454
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,980
All players,
except for Hong Jin Ho in last place,

455
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,380
will vote for the two players
who have been chosen.

456
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,579
The person who receives more votes...

457
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,150
will compete against Hong Jin Ho
in the Deathmatch.

458
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,460
The elimination candidate
who loses in the Deathmatch...

459
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,990
will be the first to get eliminated...

460
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:17,160
and leave Bloody Game.

461
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,839
It's not great. It's freaking bad.

462
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,170
This is my first time to go through
a Deathmatch...

463
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,170
on the first day.

464
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,809
It's a lot worse than I thought.

465
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,509
I'm a little scared.

466
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,319
The first Deathmatch requires
instantaneous judgment skills...

467
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,450
and psychological warfare.

468
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,160
Hong Jin Ho,
please enter the voting room right away.

469
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:51,029
There's nothing worse than competing
against Hong Jin Ho.

470
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,130
He's such a strong competitor,

471
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,500
and he has lots of experience.

472
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,599
I never wanted to be chosen,
no matter what happens.

473
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,670
It's the first day.

474
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,640
Jin Ho always tells me...

475
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,410
that I'm a weirdo or a psycho.

476
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,109
But he might choose me thinking,
"I need to eliminate him."

477
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,049
Gosh, from the first day...

478
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,849
From the first day, this is...

479
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,160
- Here are the selection results.
- Already?

480
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,099
The first player who has been selected...

481
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,529
by Hong Jin Ho is...

482
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:34,500
I thought he wouldn't choose people...

483
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,839
who were already known
for playing games well.

484
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:40,309
If he knew about my college,

485
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,250
he wouldn't have chosen me
so easily, right?

486
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,450
Let's just not get eliminated
on the first day.

487
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,119
Then, I've succeeded.

488
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,390
The first player who has been selected...

489
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,990
by Hong Jin Ho is...

490
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,200
Choi Hye Seon.

491
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,170
(Deathmatch candidate, Choi Hye Seon)

492
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,000
The second player who has been selected...

493
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,500
by Hong Jin Ho is...

494
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,769
It felt like I'd be in big trouble
if I was selected.

495
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,910
I really want to stay here
for a long time.

496
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,180
I think he'd choose me.

497
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,849
We've competed against each other,
and Jin Ho won.

498
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,190
Pani Bottle.

499
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,519
(Deathmatch candidate, Pani Bottle)

500
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,089
Not being able to admit
that you're not smart...

501
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,029
and trying to play mind games
is the most foolish thing to do.

502
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,930
I should keep trying to find things...

503
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,799
that I can do well as much as I can...

504
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,069
and survive in a rather dirty way.

505
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:39,140
I think that's the right thing to do.

506
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,009
Pani Bottle is just a loud voice.

507
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,569
I don't think I'd lose to the adventurer
with a loud voice...

508
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:47,079
when it comes to politics.

509
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,710
From now on, we will begin voting
with the two candidates,

510
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,950
Pani Bottle and Choi Hye Seon.

511
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,720
All players, choose one player...

512
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,549
who will go straight to the Deathmatch.

513
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,789
(Pani Bottle, Choi Hye Seon)

514
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,990
Extra ballots are 20,000 dollars each.

515
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,099
You can only buy them
in the voting room during the voting time.

516
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,829
The voting will end in an hour.

517
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,970
Are you good at games?

518
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,450
Are you planning on going
and coming back after you win?

519
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,619
No, I won't be coming back if I go there.

520
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,390
How would I come back?

521
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,059
How would anyone beat Hong Jin Ho?

522
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:33,819
And they said it was a psychological game.

523
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,559
What do I do? Should I go and buy ballots?

524
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,769
- Ballots?
- Because...

525
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,970
it won't matter if I get eliminated.
I should just use all of my money.

526
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,970
It's too soon to leave on Round One.

527
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,779
I knew that Pani Bottle had less
than me in his private funds.

528
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,680
I didn't think of him as a huge threat.

529
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,250
We have to check our funds inside, right?

530
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,819
Each one costs 20,000 dollars?

531
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,089
Where is the butler's room?

532
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,589
Where did you get this water from?

533
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,799
- It was in the store.
- The store?

534
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,859
The supermarket.

535
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,630
Is it really a supermarket?

536
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,470
I don't know. I think it's just for us.

537
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,369
Can we just take stuff?

538
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,740
I just brought it from here.

539
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,509
I guess we can take it.

540
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,539
I thought I had brought a lot of money,
but I don't have much.

541
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,680
- How much?
- I only have 28,000 dollars.

542
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:28,849
Really?

543
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,380
One, two, three, four...

544
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,549
What will you do? There are five of us.

545
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,079
Why are you sending me such a loving gaze?

546
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,490
Can I make you guys an offer?

547
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,490
- Yes.
- Yes.

548
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,430
If you vote in my advantage...

549
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,059
How much do you want?

550
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,359
The game funds? How much do you have?

551
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,069
- I can't tell you that.
- You can't?

552
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,869
How much will you give me?

553
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,269
How much do you want?

554
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,710
One hundred-thousand?

555
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,839
I want one million.

556
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,039
Will you give us however much we want?

557
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,190
Well...

558
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,030
- What do I do?
- Go after them.

559
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,860
Just keep chasing them around.

560
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,070
Don't let them be alone.

561
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,369
I'm not sure how much of a choice I have.

562
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,510
You should do whatever you can.

563
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,179
Pani Bottle may not have a lot of money,

564
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,579
but he will try to convince people.

565
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,650
- I'm curious about something personally.
- Yes?

566
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,119
I wanted to have someone
I could keep personal secrets with.

567
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,449
That's what I thought.

568
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,920
So, I want to play
this game more with you.

569
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:49,289
I'll make this offer just to you, Yurisa.

570
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:50,460
(Hye Seon suggests
an alliance with Yurisa.)

571
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,429
She approached us by asking
how much we wanted,

572
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,070
but in the end,
she said that we should team up...

573
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,070
and play together in the future.

574
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,840
Since she has good feelings for me,

575
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,480
it would be easy for me to...
I don't know if I can call is using her,

576
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,980
but it would be easy for me to do that.

577
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,750
An alliance?

578
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,019
An alliance...

579
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,750
Do we have to have alliances?

580
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,719
I'm very individualistic.

581
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,889
I'm the individual
who represents all individualists.

582
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,360
Where should I talk about this?

583
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,289
I think there's a room over there.

584
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:27,429
This is what I think. Honestly speaking,

585
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,230
I really hope that
Hong Jin Ho will be eliminated.

586
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,239
But if I go, I'm not sure I can beat him.

587
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,769
To be honest,
I feel like I'd go home if I'm chosen.

588
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:36,340
- Aside from not having confidence...
- You shouldn't feel that way.

589
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:39,639
I felt this earlier
when we were tied up too.

590
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,309
- We've seen Jin Ho a lot before.
- Right.

591
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,210
We know he's good,
so we're not curious about him anymore.

592
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,619
I thought it might be better...

593
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:52,019
if Dong Min and Jin Ho go home earlier.

594
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,659
- So sending the legends home first?
- We know they're good.

595
00:35:56,429 --> 00:36:00,900
Actually, Hong Jin Ho as of now?

596
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,230
Frankly speaking,

597
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,269
I respect him,

598
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,840
but he should leave
if he's not suited for this situation.

599
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,500
He's a good target.

600
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,769
His best performance was in the past,

601
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,039
and he can't perform
like he did back then anymore.

602
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,010
He's the elimination target right away.

603
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,510
I think the person
who can go and beat Hong Jin Ho...

604
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,780
is Hye Seon rather than me.

605
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,550
She came in second earlier too.

606
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,119
But I'm already so grateful...

607
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,059
that you helped me out...

608
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:28,489
when you could've just put down
the brick and left.

609
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:30,289
As repayment of that gratitude...

610
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,030
- And this could become an alliance too.
- Right.

611
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,699
These bonds are important too.

612
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,639
I asked earlier,
and I have 28,000 dollars.

613
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:42,170
Then, I'll buy an extra ballot
since it costs 20,000 dollars.

614
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,809
- Right.
- Then, I don't have enough money left.

615
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:45,309
I'll transfer 8,000 to you.

616
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,809
I was wondering
if you could add 12,000 of your money...

617
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:49,179
to use an extra ballot on me.

618
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,710
Well...

619
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,349
If I get any more money in the future...

620
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,289
(Si Yoon's private funds)

621
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,519
(9,000 dollars)

622
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,989
Can you tell me the amount once more?

623
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,230
You have 9,000 dollars.

624
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,530
That's all the cash I have now?

625
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,070
I didn't bring that much money.

626
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,039
Then, do you not have 12,000 dollars?

627
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,469
It was less than I thought.

628
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,110
So, it's not enough,
even if you add 8,000 dollars?

629
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,280
- No.
- I see.

630
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:21,409
I was a bit disappointed.
He might not be of much help.

631
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,309
He won't be much help at all.

632
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,150
I got my hopes up for nothing.

633
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,579
Yurisa, can we talk outside for a minute?

634
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,949
- With me?
- Yes.

635
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,289
- Simply put,
- Yes?

636
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:33,090
- it's a shame to leave on the first day.
- Yes.

637
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,159
I have exactly 28,000 dollars now.

638
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,159
If I buy an extra ballot,
I have 8,000 dollars left.

639
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,659
I'll give you 4,000 of that.

640
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:42,159
How about you don't vote for me?

641
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,099
- For 4,000?
- Do you want more?

642
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,139
- I don't have any more than that.
- Then, you'll try to win over two people?

643
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:47,800
Wouldn't that be the safe route?

644
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,170
- Win over two people?
- That might not be enough either.

645
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,869
Or...

646
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,840
maybe instead of buying an extra ballot,

647
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:56,710
if I divide 28,000 by 3,

648
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,349
- About 7,000 or 8,000 dollars?
- I could give you at least 8,000.

649
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
I'll give you 8,000 dollars...

650
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,750
You'll win over 3 people
with 8,000 dollars each?

651
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,289
But then, I can't buy an extra ballot.

652
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,889
That's the best I can do.

653
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,590
Pani Bottle was so bad at persuasion.

654
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,090
He came over to me and went,
"I can't give you a lot of money."

655
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,690
"I can only pay two people."

656
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,929
"If I use all of my money,
I can pay three people."

657
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,630
He was only talking about money.

658
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,300
I thought,

659
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,840
"Then, what if I take your money
but don't take your side?"

660
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:23,369
- If you do that... Oh, my.
- Sorry.

661
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,039
- You can come!
- You can stay!

662
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,110
You can join us.

663
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,579
Will you tell him the same thing?

664
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,550
Yes, what I'm doing now is...

665
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:34,519
approaching the people
who might vote for me...

666
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,949
and asking them not to vote for me
by paying them 8,000 dollars.

667
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,760
But from your experience,
was this game money that important?

668
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,389
- It is important.
- It's important.

669
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,989
Come and join us. That's exactly three.

670
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,329
No, I...

671
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,599
- You should talk to everyone.
- I'm just asking you guys.

672
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,070
I'm not forcing you at all.

673
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,269
- Since you're here,
- Yes?

674
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,739
how about I give you each 8,000 dollars...

675
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,639
- Eight thousand each?
- Yes.

676
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,409
He's asking us to help him out
for 8,000 dollars.

677
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,409
- I don't have much.
- Is it not enough?

678
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,880
How much do you have now?

679
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,610
- I have exactly 28,000 dollars.
- Exactly 28,000?

680
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,449
I'm willing to take installments.

681
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,949
- Gosh, that's cool. Indeed, Sinsaimdang.
- You're Sinsaimdang, indeed.

682
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,090
You're just making an investment.

683
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,619
How much in installments?

684
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,289
How much will you accept in installments?

685
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,929
About 6 payments of 5,000 dollars?

686
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,559
- That's a large sum of money.
- That's 30,000 dollars.

687
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,800
I don't care...

688
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,860
if I only have 30,000 dollars more...

689
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,900
- in six-day time.
- Then...

690
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,900
I thought I'd ask for 30,000 dollars
from Pani Bottle,

691
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,469
and if he doesn't accept that deal,
I'll vote for him.

692
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:29,170
If he does, I'll vote for Hye Seon.

693
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,739
With Bloody Game,

694
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,610
it's made up of games and politics.

695
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,210
There's a system of voting.

696
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,010
Then, keep giving me money
for the time that you stay alive.

697
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,380
That's what I mean.

698
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,880
(The creditor and debtor)

699
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,449
But 30,000 dollars over 6 payments...

700
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,349
- It's 5,000 dollars each...
- But what I'm certain about is...

701
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:44,690
I mean, until Day Six.

702
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,260
I might not make it to Day Six.

703
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,090
If you don't, you don't have to pay me.

704
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:51,389
- Then, you'll take my side, right?
- Yes.

705
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,760
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

706
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,530
- Then, I'll pay you 5,000 dollars.
- Okay.

707
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,900
Can we talk for a minute?

708
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,000
- Yes.
- Are you done?

709
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,400
How much did you say you had?

710
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,369
Pani Bottle said he had 28,000 dollars.

711
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,170
- He told you honestly?
- Yes.

712
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,739
I have about three times more.

713
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,480
Is that so? Pani Bottle was trying to
win 3 people over with 8,000 each.

714
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,550
- Did you say you'd do it?
- It was me, Sinsaimdang, and Yurisa.

715
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,489
I think
it would be better for you that way.

716
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,090
You should be more aggressive
with your money...

717
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,590
and get at least...

718
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,730
three or four people on your side.

719
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,099
- Thank you.
- To be honest,

720
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,099
I only have 5,000 dollars in game money.

721
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,670
I do need some money.

722
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,170
You know...

723
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,539
It does seem too early to discuss this,

724
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,179
but later on...

725
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,309
- So...
- I'm worried.

726
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,710
What if I get sent home tomorrow
during the main game...

727
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,150
because I don't have enough money?

728
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,920
That you might come in last place
and lose all your money?

729
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,719
- Could you give me just a little?
- Right now?

730
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,190
Yes. Just as much as you can spare.

731
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,820
The amount doesn't matter.

732
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,659
I'll transfer my money to him.

733
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:01,500
I'll transfer 10,000 dollars.

734
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
(Choi Hye Seon transfers
10,000 dollars to Heo Seong Beom.)

735
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,099
I transferred 10,000 dollars
to Seong Beom.

736
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,469
I had more money than Pani Bottle.

737
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,210
If I can persuade the others
with my money,

738
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,139
I will try to utilize that
as much as I can.

739
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,210
I will try to invest as much as I can
with what I have.

740
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,650
I will try to lead things
in a future-oriented direction...

741
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,019
and I believe I have the advantage
in terms of that.

742
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:24,719
Thank you.

743
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,960
- Gosh.
- It's like she's taking her away.

744
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,829
I'll give you the funds first.

745
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,530
What do you think about helping me out?

746
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,099
I know that I'm saying something
very dangerous.

747
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:42,869
How much will you offer?

748
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,409
- Did you decide on anything?
- What?

749
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:47,409
Did you decide on anything?

750
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:48,980
- Decide?
- I wondered if you had any plans.

751
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,550
I can give you 8,000 dollars.

752
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,320
That's the maximum of what I can offer.

753
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,280
I would rather give you some money.

754
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,949
- Me?
- We can decide on the amount.

755
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,550
How much did he offer you?

756
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:00,159
- He offered 8,000 dollars.
- He offered 8,000 dollars?

757
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,619
How does 10,000 dollars sound
which I mentioned earlier?

758
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,690
Ten thousand dollars?

759
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,989
I think Hye Seon...

760
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,530
is making deals with 10,000 dollars.

761
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,460
I don't have as much money as her.

762
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,440
The important thing now is the vote.

763
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,400
What's the point of having money?

764
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,469
We come empty-handed
and leave empty-handed.

765
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,440
I will purchase an extra vote...

766
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,909
and vote twice.

767
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:22,110
(Pani Bottle purchases an extra vote.)

768
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,750
It would be legendary
if I do this and take the fall.

769
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,349
(Pani Bottle votes for Choi Hye Seon
with 2 votes.)

770
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:27,750
I just didn't want to get eliminated
on the first day.

771
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,420
I would consider it a success
if I manage to do that.

772
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,719
I'm back.

773
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,159
(Choi Hye Seon votes for Pani Bottle
with 1 vote.)

774
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,500
(Thinking)

775
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,829
I will buy an extra vote
with 20,000 dollars.

776
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,300
(Choi Hye Seon purchases an extra vote.)

777
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,269
I don't think I'll lose
in a political battle...

778
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,809
against that loud someone.

779
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,280
(Choi Hye Seon votes for Pani Bottle
with 2 votes.)

780
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:58,650
The one who I can speak the truth with
and the one who won't stab me in the back.

781
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:03,150
I wouldn't say we've formed
any sort of alliance.

782
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,090
I will not trust any of the players.

783
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,230
I'm exactly neutral right now.

784
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,269
I think it's too early...

785
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:19,469
for me to lean toward one side.

786
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,710
I'm not a person
who make choices based on money.

787
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,150
A player I've opened my heart to?

788
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,510
No one.

789
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,679
I hate all of them fair and square.

790
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,849
(Pani Bottle, Choi Hye Seon)

791
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:42,619
Voting is over.

792
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:44,760
Please gather at the Main Hall.

793
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
(Voting is over.)

794
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,300
Between Pani Bottle and Choi Hye Seon
who have been selected by Hong Jin Ho,

795
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,900
the player voted for the Deathmatch is...

796
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,769
I did it will all my heart
without leaving any regret.

797
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:02,610
He looked confident,
so I felt a bit nervous.

798
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,519
The player voted for the Deathmatch
with Hong Jin Ho is...

799
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:15,389
Choi Hye Seon.

800
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,440
(20 minutes ago)

801
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,940
I would rather give you some money.

802
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,610
- Will you take it?
- Sure.

803
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,079
I will transfer 8,000 dollars to Yurisa.

804
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,780
A total of 8,000 dollars have been
transferred to Yurisa from Pani Bottle.

805
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
Right.

806
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,420
Can you give me the money right now?

807
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,989
I haven't voted yet.

808
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,119
Right now,

809
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,059
I have already made financial deals
with two other people.

810
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,670
If I am to make a financial deal with you,

811
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,539
I think I can pay you tomorrow
or after tomorrow.

812
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,110
To be honest, they both offered me money,

813
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,510
so I was going to thankfully accept
the money and not vote for both of them.

814
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,380
But she said she already made deals
with other people.

815
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,420
She said that she would pay me...

816
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,550
if things don't work out with them.

817
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,090
- How are things going for you?
- Well,

818
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,059
Hye Seon said...

819
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,429
she used all of her funds...

820
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,960
to make deals with a few people.

821
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,170
She said that one of them felt suspicious.

822
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:31,929
When you play games,

823
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,139
do you prefer having someone reliable
on your side?

824
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:38,840
Well, wouldn't it be nice
to have someone like that?

825
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,909
Then I can assure you with that.

826
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,710
I think it's very important
to be able to tell...

827
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,880
what kind of person you can trust.

828
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,280
But Hye Seon...

829
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:53,320
If you are to do the opposite
of what I tell you,

830
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:55,389
I will make sure to go against you.

831
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,900
"If you don't help me today,"

832
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,260
"you'll become my enemy."

833
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,800
Gosh.

834
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:12,909
(Pani Bottle, Choi Hye Seon)

835
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,480
(Choi Hye Seon: 6 votes)

836
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,909
(Pani Bottle: 4 votes)

837
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,480
Gosh.

838
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,889
I feel lost. I didn't expect this at all.

839
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:25,619
With this result,
I will not be able to trust anyone.

840
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,590
I think I've made the wrong decisions.

841
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,630
Pani Bottle has more life experience
than me...

842
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,690
and I think the others have thought
he would be of more help to them.

843
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,960
I think it's my job now...

844
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,000
to make them think differently.

845
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,000
Hye Seon didn't seem like someone
who would be great at games.

846
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,139
It's just a matter of me
doing well or not.

847
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:47,139
There's something
I'm personally worried about.

848
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,679
I came here feeling very determined.

849
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,880
In "Bloody Game 2," a pack of cigarettes
was sold at a very expensive price.

850
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,750
I felt a lot of stress from that.

851
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,949
In Bloody Game 3, I didn't want to be
vulnerable to these attacks,

852
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,389
so I quit smoking.

853
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,860
I thought I came prepared,

854
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,630
but I might have ruined
my mental strength on my own.

855
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,559
I'm finding it hard to think
and it might be the lack of nicotine.

856
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,699
I have to get myself together
and get fully focused.

857
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,510
- This place...
- Gosh!

858
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,679
This place feels like...

859
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,280
an abandoned house.

860
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:28,579
I went for the Deathmatch...

861
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,590
and it was so hot and humid.

862
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,730
"They set up the Deathmatch there?"

863
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,730
- How did they find a place like this?
- Exactly.

864
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,969
Did they have to go this far?

865
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Gosh.

866
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,079
I've made some predictions
before coming here.

867
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,710
But this wasn't expected at all.

868
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,550
It's the same for me.

869
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,090
It won't be bad to have this experience
at the start.

870
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,820
If you are to survive that is.

871
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:12,059
I came here from England for this.

872
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,400
- You came from England?
- Yes. It was an 18-hour flight.

873
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,500
Think about how it'll be for me
if I have to head back home.

874
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,769
That's amazing.
You came here with an 18-hour flight.

875
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,300
You can become the winner then.

876
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,170
Let's do this.

877
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,039
It's starting.

878
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,650
Elimination candidate, Hong Jin Ho,

879
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,920
has chosen Choi Hye Seon...

880
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,789
to be in the Deathmatch.

881
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,260
Today's Deathmatch...

882
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,960
is a 2-on-2 Deathmatch.

883
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,400
What? A 2-on-2 Deathmatch?

884
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,630
- Wait. A 2-on-2 Deathmatch?
- What is this about?

885
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,239
The Deathmatch opponents
of the two of you will be revealed.

886
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:56,309
What?

887
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,440
- I'm so scared. What is this?
- What's going on?

888
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,449
The player in last place, Hong Jin Ho,

889
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,920
choose two players you wish to be with
in the Deathmatch.

890
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,360
Please remember that
you will pay the price for all decisions.

891
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,800
We're teams like this?

892
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,500
Or are we teams with someone else?

893
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,869
It felt like I was hit with a hammer
in the head at that moment.

894
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,539
It was totally unexpected.

895
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,480
I felt goosebumps all over.
I didn't know what was going on.

896
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,750
What?

897
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,320
Are they coming?

898
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,219
Who are they?

899
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,300
Gosh. Darn you!

900
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:00,670
(Bloody Mansion)

901
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,699
My lips are dry.

902
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,139
- Yes. I feel nervous.
- You feel thirsty, right?

903
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:07,639
Hello.

904
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,280
Welcome to the Bloody Game.
