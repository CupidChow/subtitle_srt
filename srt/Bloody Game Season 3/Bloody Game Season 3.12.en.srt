1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:03,609
Can we talk for a minute?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,110
- You know...
- Yes.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,980
Well,

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,320
if Yurisa had gone,

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,990
in case you would...

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,489
Of course, you're good.

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,120
But there was a chance
that you might have lost,

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,589
so I decided...

9
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,289
to spend all my money.

10
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,289
But...

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,800
I was surprised to find out
that Yurisa was voted.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,129
Our team's members talked
about spending quite a sum...

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,239
and buying about 3 to 4 extra votes.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,109
Then, I decided to spend all my money,

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,270
so I did.

16
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:39,140
But Seong Beom said that you told him
not to spend any money...

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,750
unless it was to vote for Steve...

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,350
and said that he didn't buy any votes.

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,079
I got mad because of that.

20
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,689
If he had told me beforehand,

21
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,119
I wouldn't have spent all my money,

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,960
so I asked him why he made me do so.

23
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,929
Dong Min told you not to spend
any money...

24
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,390
unless it was to vote for Steve, right?

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,960
- How much did you spend?
- I didn't.

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,530
I thought you knew.

27
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,799
You should have told me that in advance.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,140
We're a team. You could have told me.

29
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,609
There was a little trouble
between me and Seong Beom.

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,750
I was pretty suspicious of him.

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,079
But...

32
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:24,159
I mean,

33
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,760
we could use every member possible,

34
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,959
so...

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,930
we should be uniting as a team.

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,260
Instead,

37
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,700
they were telling me,
"This seems strange,"

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,799
and "He's a little suspicious."

39
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,040
They've been doing that,

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,439
and they should not be doing that.

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,340
Let's unite as a team!

42
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,040
Is that so hard?

43
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:49,909
Gosh. I've been getting a headache
since yesterday.

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,049
I...

45
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,219
didn't want to send her there.

46
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,659
I never played politics in this team.

47
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,200
I really...

48
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,700
liked that about us. When I first came,

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,469
you, Seong Beom, and Si Yoon...

50
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,169
were hitting it off really well...

51
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,409
and told me that you never played politics
because we were a team.

52
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,110
When I heard that, I was so glad...

53
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,979
and decided that I should be sincere.

54
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,849
- But as we lose more members,
- Yes.

55
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:25,819
we're left with no choice.

56
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Someone had to be eliminated.

57
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,919
Yes, but I didn't think
it was such a bad idea to do that...

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,860
among ourselves...

59
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,060
when we all survived.

60
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,629
(Seong Beom joins them.)

61
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,030
They were so convinced.

62
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,840
If we had known that,

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,639
we should have noticed that...

64
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,639
in the first round.

65
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,680
- That's true.
- Their strategy?

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,050
Emotionally, there was tension between us.

67
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,419
It's true that I've been playing politics,

68
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,219
but I decided...

69
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:02,050
to stop doing it within our team...

70
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,620
after seeing how united our team was.

71
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,560
But...

72
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,590
I believe
Seong Beom is playing politics...

73
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,860
to be the winner in the finals.

74
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,969
I didn't think...

75
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,639
that anyone was
playing politics in our team.

76
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,669
That's why I participated sincerely.

77
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,870
But I changed my mind last night.

78
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,039
I spent my money...

79
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,150
because I could do that much for the team.

80
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,919
Then, Seong Beom said,
"Did Dong Min tell you too?"

81
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,719
"He told us to only spend money
to eliminate Steve..."

82
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,250
"and not otherwise."

83
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,860
Then... Darn it. He should have...

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,159
told me that.

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
I wouldn't have spent my money, then.

86
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,199
I suddenly got a headache.

87
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,669
That means he saved his money...

88
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,229
while making us spend ours.

89
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,000
He's been subtly telling me...

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
to buy the extra votes,

91
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,710
and it could have been...

92
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,409
because they weren't buying them.

93
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,180
There has to be
a strategic battle within the team.

94
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,349
I was so flustered.

95
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,580
You're supposed to play politics
when you're in this game.

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,879
But...

97
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,750
I was the one who suffered
when I wasn't doing that,

98
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:10,889
and it felt like a smack on the head.

99
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,159
In that team,

100
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,289
Dong Min and Seong Beom have...

101
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,000
a strong bond.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,060
That's what it feels like.

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,800
Even when I present a good opinion,

104
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,569
it's rarely accepted.

105
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,339
I had been noticing that before this.

106
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,569
Let's have you...

107
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,709
- be the leader in calculation.
- Okay.

108
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,480
And who else is confident in calculating?

109
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:33,910
Look. Among us,

110
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,180
Seong Beom is the one
who can get the most points.

111
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,720
Let's keep assisting him.

112
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,750
He keeps placing first,

113
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,319
and the reason is...

114
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,620
that he calculates things
to make him the winner.

115
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,329
Like, "I can place first
if you help me out in this one."

116
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,459
Last night, Seong Beom was assigned
to the triple box,

117
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,129
and he said, "We need to go with the plan
to make me place first."

118
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,300
Okay. I might place first...

119
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,470
if you get minus points.

120
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,839
He's from KAIST.

121
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,970
He has the desire
to prove how intelligent he is,

122
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,839
so when I make a mistake
from time to time,

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,379
he points it out on purpose.

124
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,779
(During the third team match,
Criminal Memory)

125
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,779
You keep questioning me, so...

126
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,279
No, I'll tell you why.
Here's how you speak.

127
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,850
It also applies when you see a photo.

128
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,850
You need to explain
in the way for the listeners...

129
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,759
to understand at once.

130
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,430
(Seong Beom points out Acau's mistake.)

131
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,060
It would have been worth it
if Dong Min suggested something...

132
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,860
and I could learn from that.

133
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,370
But I didn't exactly understand
why other players would...

134
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,939
challenge me.

135
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,399
Because he also has...

136
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,009
a lot to learn from this game.

137
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,079
We don't point it out
when he makes a mistake,

138
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,310
but when others make mistakes,

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,079
he tends to point that out.

140
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,680
I had been stressed out about that...

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,180
little by little.

142
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,350
Like, "Why did you do this?"

143
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,550
But we don't point it out
when he makes a mistake.

144
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,160
We're like, "It happens."

145
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,220
That's when I thought,

146
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,129
"He's not going to win."

147
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,560
KAIST isn't good enough.

148
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,199
I've gotten too soft.

149
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,939
I should have played
like when I was in the Mansion.

150
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,740
Please gather at the Main Hall.

151
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,750
Where should I sit?

152
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,589
One, two, three, four.

153
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,490
Twelve people.

154
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,970
There is an announcement.

155
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,529
(Startled)

156
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,899
There's more.

157
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,269
Before the announcement,

158
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,639
the Evil Spirit who's been caught,
Jang Dong Min,

159
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,910
will leave this place
and wait in a separate room.

160
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,110
(Doubting)

161
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,519
(Dong Min, the Evil Spirit, leaves.)

162
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,250
From now on,
you will judge the additional Evil Spirit.

163
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,819
(Judging the Evil Spirit?)

164
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,730
Additional Evil Spirit?
There's another one?

165
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,500
The players will take turns...

166
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,399
to visit a hidden location
on the first floor...

167
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,699
and pick a player that you think...

168
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,730
is the Evil Spirit.

169
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,240
It must be the altar!

170
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,639
They did something with the altar.

171
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,939
You can only judge the Evil Spirit...

172
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,110
if five or more of you vote for them.

173
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,180
When you succeed
in judging the Evil Spirit,

174
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,720
they will instantly be
an elimination candidate...

175
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,319
and be exempted...

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,250
if they receive an Immunity Pass...

177
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,920
in today's Money Challenge.

178
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,430
On the other hand,
when you fail to judge the Evil Spirit,

179
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,699
they will be given an Immunity Pass
in today's Money Challenge.

180
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,629
You will now begin
judging the Evil Spirit.

181
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,470
We have to catch another one?

182
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,269
It's never easy here, is it?

183
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,480
I was like, "Who's the other one?"

184
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,480
Who would it be?

185
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,350
So, there's another Evil Spirit among us.

186
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,620
Do you have a guess?

187
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,360
- Do you have a hunch?
- Tell us who it is.

188
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
It's you.

189
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,430
- Me?
- Yes.

190
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,730
Seriously.

191
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,170
Because of the photo?

192
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,800
Fine. Vote for me. Do whatever you want.

193
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,100
That tells me that he's not.

194
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,170
He's not.

195
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm really good at Mafia.

196
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,550
I poured my heart into acting.

197
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,449
I don't think Xitsuh is an Evil Spirit.

198
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,049
- We can exclude him.
- It can't be him.

199
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,419
To rule out the certain ones,

200
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,820
Xitsuh and Hye Seon can't be it.

201
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,220
I don't think it's Hye Seon either.

202
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,960
It's Steve, guys.

203
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,960
Stop trying to frame me.

204
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm usually great at the game of Mafia.

205
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,460
She's framing me!

206
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,870
(Pouring his heart into acting)

207
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,039
But do you think
the additional Evil Spirit...

208
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,409
has the same abilities as Dong Min?

209
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,809
- They must.
- They must.

210
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:00,080
But we need to know
what happened to the Evil Spirit.

211
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,350
Let's think about the people
who went through the same things...

212
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,220
that Dong Min went through.

213
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,250
If there's a storyline
of how one becomes an Evil Spirit,

214
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,059
we can find similar cases.

215
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,460
- Right.
- But the one who's gone through...

216
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,059
the same thing was Seong Beom.

217
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,629
You were the one
who's been playing with him.

218
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,230
Logically speaking,
I think it's fair that you vote for me.

219
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,899
So, I wouldn't mind
if you were suspicious of me.

220
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,740
But I'm clearly a regular player.

221
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,940
I bet my everything.

222
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,070
I bet my career, my real-life assets,

223
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,610
- and all the private funds here.
- And his YouTube subscribers.

224
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,639
I'm not Evil Spirit.

225
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,279
I think I did a good job of hiding.

226
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:42,190
The number of wins...

227
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,019
and the Deathmatch voting...

228
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,360
all match.

229
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,559
So, you just want to vote for me.

230
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,029
That's not it.

231
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,230
Go and stick the dagger.

232
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,259
That's not what I mean.

233
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,929
I thought...

234
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,700
that Seong Beom might be
the other Evil Spirit.

235
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,340
Dong Min was the Evil Spirit,

236
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,940
so I reckoned that the other one would
have the same pattern.

237
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,110
The one who had similar wins and losses...

238
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,980
and patterns on Dong Min's team was...

239
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,110
Seong Beom.

240
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,879
He's an Evil Spirit candidate.

241
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,980
(Seong Beom followed Dong Min's tracks.)

242
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,419
No matter how hard...

243
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,289
we try to guess,

244
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,320
there are too many possibilities.

245
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,419
We're not likely to find the one.

246
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,659
But what's fortunate is...

247
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,100
that there's no penalty, even if we fail.

248
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,429
Let's just give it a try...

249
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,970
- Let's give it a try.
- and go forward.

250
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,769
- One by one...
- No need to keep wondering.

251
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:31,870
Let's go one by one.

252
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,139
(They all move to the Purgatory
to vote for the Evil Spirit.)

253
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,350
Oh, it's scary.

254
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,279
Gosh.

255
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,250
Seriously. What is...

256
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,120
this place?

257
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,759
(It's their first time
seeing this mysterious place.)

258
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,830
It looked like a place
where Evil Spirits were possessed...

259
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,899
to send negative energy
to the people they didn't favor...

260
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,100
like they would to a voodoo doll.

261
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,200
That scared me.

262
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,340
Oh, is this what it is?

263
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:16,580
Stick the knife to the person
you think is the Evil Spirit.

264
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,820
It was obviously Steve.

265
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:29,690
I say it's Seong Beom.
There's a high chance that it's him.

266
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,460
Sorry.

267
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,629
Maybe it's not you. I'm not sure.

268
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:38,470
Right on the crown of the head.

269
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,940
I didn't know
when I'd get to stick it again,

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,169
so I stabbed it hard,
and it went all the way in.

271
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,379
I wasn't sure, to be honest.

272
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,450
I didn't have any information
on how an Evil Spirit...

273
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,019
was chosen.

274
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,350
I was especially clueless this time,

275
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,720
so I was frustrated.

276
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,889
Take this!

277
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,860
Darn Evil Spirit.

278
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,100
(The Evil Spirit enters.)

279
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,200
I think I'll get caught too soon.

280
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,269
I'll just vote for anyone.

281
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
The Evil Spirit has been judged.

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,779
(The Evil Spirit Judge ends.)

283
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,649
The player with the most votes is...

284
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,659
Steve Yea.

285
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,789
(Steve Yea)

286
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,100
(The players found the Evil Spirit
with pinpoint accuracy.)

287
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,970
Based on our grounds,

288
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,470
we can narrow it down to two people.

289
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,570
One, someone who has been...

290
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,740
experiencing
the same wins and losses as Dong Min.

291
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,539
Seong Beom has the most wins,

292
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,279
so there's a chance
that he's an Evil Spirit.

293
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,480
On the other hand,
the one who played the same role.

294
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,750
Among us, Steve...

295
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,090
made the most suggestions
as he was the leader.

296
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,460
Considering the role,

297
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,990
Steve was the same as Dong Min.

298
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,960
Then, we can pick 1 of the 2...

299
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,330
based on what we think.

300
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,500
(They narrowed it down
to Seong Beom and Steve.)

301
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,629
I thought
Steve would be the Evil Spirit...

302
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:16,429
if there was another one.

303
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,840
When we played Criminal Memory,

304
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,940
he made...

305
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,639
such a fatal mistake.

306
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,039
Then, what's your opinion, Steve?

307
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,039
Who do you think is the Evil Spirit?

308
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,350
I can't tell.

309
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,279
There was no way he would be that calm...

310
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
if he wasn't the Evil Spirit.

311
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,519
He would have thrown a tantrum,

312
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,990
like, "I'll kill you if it turns out
that I'm not the Evil Spirit."

313
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,389
But he was just sitting modestly.

314
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,059
Steve is too quiet.

315
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,860
When you become the Mafia in Mafia,

316
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,529
some people get extremely quiet
unless they're really good.

317
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,470
Because they don't know what to do.

318
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,470
Considering that, I have a feeling...

319
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,470
that it's Steve.

320
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,370
Everyone was thinking...

321
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,879
that it might be Steve...

322
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,909
if there was another Evil Spirit.

323
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,179
Chungju-Man's revenge!

324
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,320
I think we all voted for Steve...

325
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
without delay.

326
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,990
Oh, no.

327
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,960
I judge Steve as the Evil Spirit.

328
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Take this!

329
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,600
(Steve Yea: 8 votes, Hong Jin Ho: 1 vote)

330
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,629
The success of the Evil Spirit Judge...

331
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,200
will be revealed
after today's Money Challenge.

332
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,000
- Oh, gosh.
- Gosh. I have a headache.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,700
I think it's him.

334
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,409
You guys are stupid.

335
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,710
(Still pouring his heart into acting)

336
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,980
Then,

337
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,139
we will now begin today's Money Challenge.

338
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,379
What? We're starting right away?

339
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,950
- Right away?
- Right away?

340
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,379
Today's Money Challenge is...

341
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,649
Good and Evil.

342
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,919
(Good and Evil)

343
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,330
Good and Evil is
a ten-player individual match...

344
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,799
where players must uncover
the identities of the opponents...

345
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,230
through suspicion and persuasion...

346
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,000
while keeping their own identities hidden.

347
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,440
It's like Mafia.

348
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,909
At the start of the game,
each player enters the voting room...

349
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,210
to draw one of the role cards,
Angel or Devil.

350
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,110
Players will be assigned...

351
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,149
one of 6 Angels or 4 Devils.

352
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,720
Team Angel is composed
of Deity, the Archangel,

353
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,860
and four Angels.

354
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,759
Only the Archangel knows
the identity of Deity.

355
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,899
Team Devil is composed
of Lucifer and three Devils,

356
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
who know each other's identities.

357
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,970
After the roles have been assigned,

358
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,470
players can accumulate...

359
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,909
either Good Deed cards or Evil Deed cards.

360
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,639
A Representative candidate is selected...

361
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,080
in random order,

362
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,750
and they nominate...

363
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,820
an Executioner candidate...

364
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,549
to choose cards with them.

365
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,519
Players, then,
vote to approve or reject...

366
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,830
the Representative
or Executioner candidates.

367
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,029
If more than half approve,
they are elected.

368
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,899
If the vote fails, you skip a round
and move on to the next round.

369
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:06,070
Once elected,
the Representative and Executioner...

370
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,169
select cards for the round as follows.

371
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,580
A deck containing...

372
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,980
twenty Evil Deed cards
and ten Good Deed cards is shuffled.

373
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,509
Three cards are randomly drawn,

374
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,820
and the Representative discards
one card first.

375
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,549
The Executioner discards another card...

376
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,360
from the remaining two.

377
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,220
The final card is...

378
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,529
accumulated in that round.

379
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,659
As the rounds go on,

380
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,230
if five Evil Deed cards are
accumulated first,

381
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,139
the game ends with Team Devil's victory.

382
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,169
Each time an Evil Deed card is added,

383
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,610
one Devil's identity, excluding Lucifer,

384
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,149
is revealed to Deity.

385
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,320
Upon the fourth Evil Deed card,

386
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,179
the round's Representative gains...

387
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,820
the ability to eliminate one player.

388
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,460
The eliminated player's identity
is revealed,

389
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,759
and they're isolated until the game ends.

390
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,200
If five Good Deed cards...

391
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,359
are accumulated first,

392
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,700
Team Devil gets
one last chance to identify...

393
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,140
and eliminate Deity.

394
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,210
(Heaven)

395
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,980
If the Devils successfully
eliminate Deity,

396
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,279
they win.

397
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,309
If not,

398
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,079
the game ends with Team Angel's victory.

399
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,720
The losing team must send three players...

400
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,319
to the Deathmatch.

401
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,789
If a revealed Evil Spirit is
on the losing team...

402
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,660
due to the additional vote,

403
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,529
that player automatically goes
to the Deathmatch.

404
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,970
The other two participants are...

405
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,930
determined as follows.

406
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,069
(One player is selected through a vote
within the losing team.)

407
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,069
(The winning team nominates
one player after a discussion.)

408
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:50,170
If a revealed Evil Spirit
is on the winning team,

409
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,539
the Deathmatch participants are
decided as follows.

410
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,609
(One player is selected
through a vote within the losing team.)

411
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,609
(The voted player nominates
one additional player.)

412
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,609
(The winning team nominates
one player after a discussion.)

413
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,380
Good and Evil will begin shortly.

414
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,049
So, the teams are split.

415
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,150
- Team Devil and Team Angel.
- Yes, and we can't know yet.

416
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,119
I think it's a game...

417
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,289
where Team Angel and Team Devil compete...

418
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,559
regardless of the existing teams.

419
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,529
I was listening to the rules,

420
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,130
and it sounded
similar to the game of Mafia.

421
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,069
Every time I play Mafia,

422
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,940
people say, "You're a Mafia, aren't you?"

423
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,970
I knew I was in trouble then.

424
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,509
Back in college,

425
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,740
I played Mafia with my friends
every night in my room.

426
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,450
We giggled and had strategy meetings.

427
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,279
It was as if it was our profession.

428
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
This was my profession.

429
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,750
I thought I might win this.

430
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,220
After all, I was a champion...

431
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,759
of a Mafia competition.

432
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,890
I played pretty well,

433
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,000
so I knew I could play it well.

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,529
I'm confident that I can survive
in the Deathmatch,

435
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,099
so I don't mind going.

436
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,170
But there's no reason
to bring the chance...

437
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,170
from 0 percent to 1 or 2 percent.

438
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,309
It'll be essential
to win the Money Challenge.

439
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,380
We'll have to pick
the right Representative and Executioner.

440
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,549
Team Devil needs to make
its member the Executioner.

441
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,349
Team Angel needs to make
its member the Executioner.

442
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:07,849
We'll have to accumulate the right cards.

443
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:11,259
Being picked
as Deity in the end is best for an Angel.

444
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:14,559
From the moment I heard,
"Today's game is Good and Evil,"

445
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,589
I understood nothing.

446
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,769
MJ was the one
who understood the game the least.

447
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,839
She's completely clueless.

448
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,240
Totally. I didn't get anything.

449
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm bad at mind games.

450
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,809
I haven't properly played it before,
so I was worried.

451
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,720
She's innocent,

452
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,819
and she's a bad liar.

453
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,990
If such a player is on my team,

454
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,160
I'm doomed.

455
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,960
The game's over, then.

456
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,960
Six Angels and four Devils?

457
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,089
Angels must...

458
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,200
analyze people's patterns of behavior.

459
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,700
Devils know who each other is,

460
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,670
so there will be people
who approach and talk...

461
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,910
to others with conviction.

462
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,440
Then, you need to be suspicious of them.

463
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,039
The players will now take turns
to enter the voting room...

464
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,480
and draw a role card.

465
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,220
This ought to be fun.

466
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,549
I hope I get a good one.

467
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,160
I didn't mind
getting either a Devil or an Angel.

468
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,359
But rather than a normal Devil
or a normal Angel,

469
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,059
I want an Archangel or Lucifer.

470
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,299
I'm a terrible liar.

471
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,069
If I get a significant role...

472
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,730
or get a Devil card,

473
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,869
I'm worried about ruining the game.

474
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,240
If I can choose, I want a Devil.

475
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm sure I can be persuasive,

476
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,680
and it's time to use that ability.

477
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,980
It's about time that I tricked others.

478
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:44,180
I thought it'd be more fun to be a Devil.

479
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,920
It's a special role, after all.

480
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,319
It's like being a Mafia,

481
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,089
so I thought a Devil would be
more fun to play.

482
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,890
I hope I get an Angel card...

483
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,759
so that I can do my best
in catching Devils.

484
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,960
Being a Devil sounded too arduous...

485
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,130
because I would have to hide...

486
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,970
the fact that I'm a Devil
and act like an Angel.

487
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,470
I wished I'd get...

488
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,039
an Angel with a significant role
rather than a regular one.

489
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,180
The Archangel or Deity.

490
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,279
Either one would be fun.

491
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,950
Keeping a straight face is
the most essential part...

492
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,380
of playing those roles,
so a bad player can't have it.

493
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,950
I was thinking...

494
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,450
I might be a good fit.

495
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,029
Xitsuh, please draw a role card.

496
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,539
Oh, only two cards left.

497
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,609
(Jin Ho enters
when there are only two cards remaining.)

498
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,609
Jin Ho, please draw a role card.

499
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
I will...

500
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,250
pick this one.

501
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,059
(The players randomly draw a card...)

502
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,930
(from the 10 cards
that have been placed...)

503
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,930
(to get their roles.)

504
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,490
Please wait at the Main Hall.

505
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,900
(All players have been assigned
to their roles.)

506
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,069
(Singing)

507
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,000
It looks like you're...

508
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,710
pretending to be excited when you walk.

509
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,039
You're so sharp.

510
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,779
Then, we'll deem you as a Devil...

511
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,450
if you act individually.

512
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:27,220
Devils will find out...

513
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,519
about each other, right?

514
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,549
They're sure about each other.

515
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,960
- Say you and I are Devils.
- Okay.

516
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,130
He's also a Devil,
so we need to be in private...

517
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,460
to come up with a plan.

518
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,200
Team Angel can't lose
if we work as a group.

519
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
(He doesn't want to give
the Devils a chance to strategize.)

520
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,359
- If we move as a group.
- Okay.

521
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:42,869
- Do you get it?
- I like that idea.

522
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,470
- Yes.
- You want to tie us down here.

523
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,740
We, Angels,
must find and kill all the Devils.

524
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,740
- "Kill?"
- We need to take them down,

525
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,039
and Angels will have to win
if we stop the Devils...

526
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,240
- from acting separately.
- Right.

527
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:55,180
Angels need to come together.

528
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,710
I don't know who Deity is,

529
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,380
but let's have all the Angels
move together.

530
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,390
We're finished
the moment Deity gets caught.

531
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,150
You speak like a true Angel.

532
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,759
Let's put handcuffs on each other.

533
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,690
- Don't do that.
- What?

534
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,160
Don't do that. It's too scary.

535
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,299
- What do you mean?
- What?

536
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,529
- What?
- I don't know.

537
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,539
She's being weird.

538
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,240
- Were you possessed by an Evil Spirit?
- She gives off a bizarre energy.

539
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,710
Were you possessed by one of the Devils?

540
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,880
When the Devils go
to check who each other is,

541
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,579
see if MJ is one of you,

542
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,410
and come out crying if she is.

543
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,180
If not,

544
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,619
smile as you come out.

545
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,750
You basically won.

546
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,990
- It's so tricky.
- Do the Devils know each other already?

547
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,190
- No.
- Not yet?

548
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,059
Didn't they say they'd tell them
when we pick a number?

549
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,230
The players will now enter
the voting room one by one...

550
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,200
to draw a card to be the Representative.

551
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,529
Devils will see who each other is,

552
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,869
and the Archangel will see who Deity is.

553
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,609
I'll go first.

554
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,069
Okay.

555
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,740
If we keep staying here,

556
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,309
we'll win, anyway.

557
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,680
Right. We need to keep staying here.

558
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,549
I think that has
the best chance of winning.

559
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:07,619
I won't even go to the bathroom.

560
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,490
The Archangel and Deity...

561
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,789
shouldn't contact each other.

562
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,089
- Right.
- Just don't.

563
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,859
If Deity finds out who the Archangel is,

564
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,829
they'll have a lot on their mind.

565
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:21,259
- Also,
- And you can't play as usual.

566
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,369
it shows.

567
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,839
Right. So, Angels,

568
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,000
the Archangel knows who Deity is,

569
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,069
but don't show it.

570
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,279
Deity, don't think, "Why isn't..."

571
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,809
- "the Archangel approaching me?"
- Good idea.

572
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,680
Archangel, don't approach Deity...

573
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,720
and say, "I'm the Archangel."

574
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,819
- That sounds too risky.
- That's a Devil playing a trick on you.

575
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:44,589
Do all Angels agree?

576
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:45,690
- Yes.
- Aren't you a Devil?

577
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,359
Gosh. You're hopeless.
I'll have to eliminate you.

578
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,799
- He's a Devil.
- He's a Devil.

579
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,200
From an Angel's point of view,

580
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,869
it's better that we all stay here.

581
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,829
It's true that the Devils are the ones
who need to make a move.

582
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,269
- Indeed.
- We need to lock everyone up here...

583
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,500
and stay silent.

584
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,470
But the problem with that is...

585
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,680
that we'll only accumulate
Evil Deed cards...

586
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,509
if we pick the wrong Representative
and Executioner.

587
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,049
I think we'll need to find...

588
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,779
who picks Good Deed cards...

589
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,789
and keep using them.

590
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,319
We can find 2 to 3 of them
and keep replacing them.

591
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,490
- Exactly.
- Right.

592
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,589
We'll form a group of people
who have been verified...

593
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:21,730
and use them only.

594
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,089
If someone else tries to be
the Executioner, they're Devils.

595
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,759
Angels will have to win that way.

596
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,930
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

597
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,329
We can't lose if we keep playing that way.

598
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,740
I believed the Angels had the upper hand.

599
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,640
Because all we had to do was...

600
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,170
pick the verified Angels to be
the Representative and Executioner.

601
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,880
I thought the Angels had an advantage.

602
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,950
Please pick a card
a Representative order card.

603
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,960
(The order of being the Representative
is chosen.)

604
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,019
Number eight.

605
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,630
(Jin Ho picked number 1.)

606
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,660
I'm number one.

607
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:58,930
You're number one?

608
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,059
He picked number one?

609
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,200
That doesn't make sense!

610
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,529
There's no way you can pick number one.

611
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,299
- He should have been number two.
- I was doubtful as I picked it.

612
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,369
Like, "Why did I get number 1?
I should be number 2."

613
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:09,640
Xitsuh, did you get your number?

614
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,869
No, I'm going now.

615
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,380
I'll go last when he comes back.

616
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,910
Xitsuh, Jin Ho is out smoking,
just so you know.

617
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,710
Where is he smoking? Over there?

618
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,750
I won't stop by.

619
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,950
And I don't know who is what!

620
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,420
I'll find out on my way back up.

621
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,420
Why? What do you find out
on your way back up?

622
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,890
- I think he's a Devil.
- He just made a mistake.

623
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,289
- That was a slip of the tongue.
- That was a slip of the tongue.

624
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,529
- That was a slip of the tongue.
- "I'll find out on my way up."

625
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:34,529
Yes, he said that.

626
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,200
Because Angels can't find out anything.

627
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,069
He's too obvious.

628
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,539
(Is Xitsuh a Devil?)

629
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,480
(Sighing)

630
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,880
Archangel Xitsuh,

631
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,720
I will tell you who Deity is.

632
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:02,289
(Xitsuh was...)

633
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:07,200
(the Archangel.)

634
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,099
I got such a significant role
out of the blue.

635
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,069
This role is the busiest,

636
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,240
gets all the attention,

637
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,910
and has the most vital role in the game,

638
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,279
and I got that role?

639
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,980
I thought it was rather good, though.

640
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,519
I was confident
that I wouldn't completely ruin it.

641
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,960
I thought, "I guess it's better
that I'm the Archangel."

642
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,460
All I have to do is...

643
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,930
to keep distracting them
and confusing them...

644
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,230
so they don't know who Deity is.

645
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,029
But...

646
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,529
Oh, Deity.

647
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,670
(Team Angel: Deity, Xitsuh the Archangel)

648
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,940
(Team Devil: Lucifer)

649
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,710
Please gather at the Main Hall.

650
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:59,950
I will now announce the order
of the Representative candidates.

651
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,750
(Representative order)

652
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,559
(Jin Ho, Hye Seon, MJ, Acau,)

653
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,190
(Min A, Eon Kyu, Xitsuh,)

654
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,130
(Dong Min, Steve, and Seong Beom)

655
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,400
You will now pick
the first Executioner candidate.

656
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,269
The first Representative candidate,
Jin Ho,

657
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,339
enter the voting room in 30 minutes...

658
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,869
and nominate an Executioner candidate.

659
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,039
Let's talk.

660
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,980
Rather than picking one by myself,

661
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,880
it'll be better to talk about it first.

662
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,420
Although we don't know...

663
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,480
who each other is...

664
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,549
We don't have any information.

665
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,220
But who do you think is...

666
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,990
likely to be an Angel?

667
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,859
We don't have a conviction,
but let's try nominating...

668
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,230
the ones who we think we are.

669
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,400
I've played Mafia many times,

670
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,140
and some people...

671
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,069
get really quiet when they're the Mafia.

672
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:55,970
- Right.
- The Devils are the Mafias here.

673
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,009
Right.

674
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,680
How are the Devils Mafias?

675
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,579
Devils are the Mafias.

676
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,180
We'll have to think so.

677
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
No, you need to set this straight.

678
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,049
Listen, Angels.

679
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,950
Just like how we try to find
who the Mafia is,

680
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,190
the Angels need to pick...

681
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,059
who Deity is in the end.

682
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,130
- Right.
- Right.

683
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,660
So, the Devils aren't the Mafias.

684
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,130
- Deity is.
- Yes.

685
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,130
Angels are the Mafias.

686
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,799
So, at first,

687
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,539
Devils are Mafias.

688
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,809
But the main point is Deity.

689
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,640
Whether Devils figure out
who Deity is or not.

690
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,480
I hope Deity is a smart one.

691
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,319
So, it's easier for Devils.

692
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,680
That's not exactly true. You keep...

693
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,789
Just throw out
all the Evil Deed cards, okay?

694
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:45,049
Yes. I know that.

695
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,660
I know the basic rules.

696
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,960
But why do you say...

697
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,930
that this game isn't easier for Devils?

698
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,130
I can't tell you that now!

699
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,160
Oh, right.

700
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,470
Seriously.

701
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,839
I vote for MJ as an Angel candidate.

702
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,309
I don't think MJ will be able to lie.

703
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:03,910
She might be pretending...

704
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,309
to be ignorant of the rules
while she's a Devil,

705
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:07,740
but she's not the type to do that.

706
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,980
- Definitely not.
- Right.

707
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,410
She's incapable of doing that.

708
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,519
She wouldn't have asked any questions
if she were a Devil.

709
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,549
- Right.
- We need to...

710
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,349
- play the game, so...
- Yes.

711
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,519
So, you're thinking of MJ, right?

712
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,890
- I agree.
- I agree.

713
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,430
- I agree.
- I agree.

714
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,789
I'll go, then.

715
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,369
(Jin Ho, a Representative candidate,
enters the voting room.)

716
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,240
Jin Ho, please pick
an Executioner candidate.

717
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,069
I pick...

718
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,079
I don't think...

719
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,480
MJ is such a good liar.

720
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,250
Listening to her speak at the time,

721
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,750
she didn't really give off the vibe...

722
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,990
that she was a Devil.

723
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,089
I pick MJ Kim as the Executioner.

724
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,359
The first Representative candidate,
Jin Ho,

725
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,559
has nominated MJ as the Executioner.

726
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,130
Players will now enter the voting room
one by one...

727
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,700
within 30 minutes...

728
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,109
to vote for or against the candidates.

729
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,980
What happens if it's 4 to 4?

730
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,250
It can't be 4 to 4.

731
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,849
- It should be 5 to 5.
- We're 10 people, MJ.

732
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,750
(There's a total of 10 players.)

733
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,319
If it's 4 to 4,

734
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,589
it means
that two people haven't voted yet.

735
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:25,759
So, you will have to nag them.

736
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:27,960
Was that a good enough answer?

737
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,960
- Go ahead and vote.
- That's so funny.

738
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,029
Seriously.

739
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,460
- That was wild, MJ.
- Oh, gosh.

740
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,200
Jin Ho, please vote for or against.

741
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,910
(The voting in Round 1 goes smoothly.)

742
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,839
(Approval)

743
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,839
I approve.

744
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,609
Xitsuh is too obvious.

745
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,779
I think so too.

746
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,019
There are three others.

747
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,890
Hye Seon is pretty quiet.

748
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,329
She's a Devil.

749
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:04,829
You're the type to read the room first.

750
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,700
She's been reading the room
without speaking.

751
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,099
She's taking notes of everything we do.

752
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,230
(She takes observation notes
without speaking.)

753
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,039
I'm certain...

754
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,970
that Seong Beom, Min A, Eon Kyu,

755
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,940
and either Jin Ho or Steve are...

756
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,069
the Devils.

757
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,740
Hye Seon seems strange.

758
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,279
I feel like she's lying.

759
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,250
I can't get a read on her.

760
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,849
It's all right to suspect people,

761
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,519
but try not to instigate things.

762
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:30,890
We need to be careful.

763
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,089
It's very risky
when an Angel suspects another Angel.

764
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,890
You know what happens
in the game of Mafia.

765
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,329
"I think Hye Seon is a Mafia."

766
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,700
I hate that when I play the game.

767
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,059
- We ask, "Why?"
- They say that I have a weird look.

768
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:45,339
I try to keep a straight face...

769
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,500
when I tell a lie,

770
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:50,410
but I don't know
how I look when I do that.

771
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm not so good at that.

772
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,539
(Is this the look when he lies?)

773
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,650
Eon Kyu, you're likely to be an Angel.

774
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,150
If you were a Devil,

775
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,750
you would have been anxious.

776
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,019
It's 100 percent.

777
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,220
They'll tell us the number of votes,
right?

778
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,430
I don't think they will.

779
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,430
It'll be easier to guess if they tell us.

780
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,430
- Really?
- It gets easier. Of course.

781
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,259
You and I are the candidates,

782
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,369
and the vote is 6 to 4.

783
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,730
That means all the Devils voted
against us,

784
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,400
so you and I are safe.

785
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,400
We're safe?

786
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,410
It means we're Angels.

787
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,279
(She obviously didn't get it.)

788
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,309
What was that?

789
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:28,809
Seriously.

790
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,519
She's hilarious.

791
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,150
How did Dong Min carry her...

792
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,220
for eight straight days?

793
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,519
(Sighing)

794
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,059
- How did you carry her?
- I give up.

795
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,089
I'll make it look like it was an accident.

796
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,529
I'll explain.

797
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,369
If one of you is a Devil,

798
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,970
what will the Devils do?

799
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,069
They'll want you to be elected...

800
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,509
because the Devil will pick
an Evil Deed card.

801
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,769
If even the Angels vote for you,

802
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,380
and the vote is 10 to 0,

803
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,109
we know that one of you is a Devil.

804
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,609
Devils know who each other is,

805
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,519
so they'll approve of these candidates...

806
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,849
- if one of them is a Devil.
- They approve... Right!

807
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,949
- Now you get it, right?
- Awesome.

808
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,190
I got it now. Okay.

809
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,789
Voting is over.

810
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,530
The first Representative candidate,
Jin Ho,

811
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:24,329
and the Executioner candidate, MJ...

812
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:27,170
(Approved)

813
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,400
have been approved.

814
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,769
(Approved)

815
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,070
- Approved.
- They don't tell us the number.

816
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,980
Representative Jin Ho and Executioner MJ,

817
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,510
please enter the voting room...

818
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,610
and pick which card to discard.

819
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,179
Shall we?

820
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,619
Don't discard a Good Deed card.
You know that, right?

821
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,219
Gosh. I'm Jin Ho.

822
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,690
If you say all three of them were
Evil Deed cards, you're a Devil.

823
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,960
If you're going to say
that all three of them were...

824
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,059
Evil Deed cards,

825
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:51,929
use that...

826
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,260
to stab your thigh before you say it.

827
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,030
- "Please believe me!"
- Yes.

828
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,769
We need that much proof, at least.

829
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,070
(Then, we approve.)

830
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,570
But it might actually happen,
statistically.

831
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,170
It's going to happen
more often than you think.

832
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,739
It might happen twice in a row.

833
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,239
We'll have to count the cards well.

834
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,480
But it might go wrong
if we blindly trust that.

835
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,219
After shuffling 20 Evil Deed cards
and 10 Good Deed cards,

836
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,289
when the three cards are revealed...

837
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,989
to the first Representative,

838
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,590
the probability of them
being three Evil Deed cards...

839
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,260
is 28.07 percent,

840
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,130
which is close to one-third.

841
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:33,199
(Representative Jin Ho enters
the voting room.)

842
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,969
Jin Ho,
please pick 1 of the 3 cards to discard.

843
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,579
(Sighing)

844
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:50,190
(What's the outcome of the first cards?)

845
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,519
- We need to count them.
- Will he say it right away?

846
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,559
Yes, tell us right away.

847
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,260
Don't get me wrong. It really was...

848
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
three Evil Deed cards.

849
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,829
I mean it.

850
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm telling the truth.

851
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,860
- I'm serious!
- Where's the dagger?

852
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,269
- It was actually three Evil Deed cards.
- Get the dagger.

853
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,369
It was actually three Evil Deed cards!

854
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,199
Then, we'll...

855
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,539
stab you with that from behind,

856
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,639
so scream three times.

857
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,079
I went in, and there were three red cards.

858
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,880
The moment I saw them, it was...

859
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,780
hopeless. But I didn't have a choice,

860
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,949
so I stepped out.

861
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,420
(Executioner MJ enters
the voting room next.)

862
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,920
MJ, please discard...

863
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,989
one of the two cards.

864
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:30,860
I don't have a choice.

865
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,500
(She has no choice
but to pick an Evil Deed card.)

866
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,269
In Round One,

867
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,570
one Evil Deed card has been accumulated.

868
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,300
(Heaven, Inferno)

869
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,840
Now,

870
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,039
one Devil's identity is revealed to Deity.

871
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:49,309
All players will take turns
to enter the voting room.

872
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,019
We might be at a disadvantage at first,

873
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,590
but we got to rule out
three Evil Deed cards.

874
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,590
It's not so bad.

875
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,389
Deity will now find out one Devil.

876
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:00,489
I beg you. Just pretend you didn't see it.

877
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,590
If you're so worried,
close your eyes as you go in.

878
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,059
Just keep your eyes closed. You know,

879
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,559
like how you close your eyes...

880
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,829
so that you don't see
the kidnapper's face.

881
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,329
Keep your eyes closed.

882
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,300
Even if you find out who it is,

883
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,610
act natural when you come back here
and act innocent.

884
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,909
(The first Devil to be revealed to Deity)

885
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,639
(Deity will pick 1 of the 3 Devil cards,)

886
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,510
(excluding Lucifer, and check who it is.)

887
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,219
(1 of the 4 Devils' identities
has been revealed.)

888
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,829
The Representative candidate
in Round Two is Hye Seon.

889
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,530
Hye Seon will now...

890
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,570
enter the voting room in 30 minutes...

891
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,139
and nominate the Executioner candidate.

892
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,769
I have a question.

893
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,139
- What is it?
- There are 20 Evil Deed cards, right?

894
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,239
What if we get three Evil Deed cards...

895
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,780
five times in a row?

896
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,480
Then...

897
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:00,619
- But the probability...
- That's the probability...

898
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,489
of winning Mega Millions.

899
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,550
- Wait.
- I'm right, aren't I?

900
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,690
- It's automatically...
- We don't have a choice, then.

901
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,920
(Acau is deep in thought.)

902
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,360
It felt like a smack on the head.

903
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,559
I thought, "This is bad."

904
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,760
"We might lose at this rate."

905
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,570
When the Representative picks the cards,

906
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,409
the chance of getting
three Evil Deed cards consecutively...

907
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:24,269
decreases significantly.

908
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,739
But if you include the cases...

909
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,210
when a Devil Representative
secretly discards...

910
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,480
a Good Deed card,

911
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,949
the probability increases significantly.

912
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,550
Isn't it worse for Angels
to be in the same room?

913
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:38,920
Why?

914
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,889
I think it's better to stick together.

915
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,590
We can't stop the Devils...

916
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,690
from being approved.

917
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,429
Shouldn't we be moving around freely?

918
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,929
Yes, we're supposed to.

919
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,429
- Really? Wait.
- If we all stay here...

920
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,829
I don't get why, though.

921
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:50,900
- Can you tell me?
- Why?

922
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,070
In this type of game,

923
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,570
the Archangel needs to carry the team.

924
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,869
But the Archangel can't do that
without any information.

925
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,480
I figured...

926
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,710
that it wasn't a good situation
for the Angels.

927
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,280
Now that the Archangel can't...

928
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,420
communicate with Deity,

929
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,880
I thought that we'd need to create...

930
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:09,789
chances for people...

931
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,050
to meet up in private.

932
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,860
That's why I said that.

933
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Acau said,

934
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,559
"It's disadvantageous
for Angels to stick together."

935
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,929
"We can't win this way."

936
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,000
I didn't understand.
No, I couldn't understand.

937
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,039
I misjudged things.

938
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,610
I realized it was wrong.

939
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,579
Right. We shouldn't be playing this way.

940
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,780
Hold on. We'll be in huge trouble.

941
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,920
The Angels who we're sure of...

942
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,989
(Dong Min supports Acau's opinion.)

943
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,059
Those guys...

944
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:47,760
The Archangel knows who Deity is.

945
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
Those two...

946
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:52,500
and one more Angel should gather.

947
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,929
That way, Angels will have an influence.

948
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,329
(Tilting his head)

949
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,739
I don't get why we should move around.

950
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,940
At least the Archangel...

951
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,710
Team Angel's goal is...

952
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,239
to accumulate Good Deed cards
without getting caught who Deity is.

953
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,309
The chance of Deity
being caught goes up...

954
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:10,710
- if we talk.
- That's true.

955
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,750
We just need to sit here
and pick the right Executioner.

956
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,849
We only have two jobs, don't we?

957
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:17,219
You're right. Deity can just sit here...

958
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,889
without saying anything,
even if they know who the Devils are.

959
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,230
We add...

960
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,730
MJ to the list...

961
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,099
and find a few combinations.

962
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,269
- I think we can win that way.
- We can't stay still.

963
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,800
I don't see...

964
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,539
the need for the Archangel and Deity...

965
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:33,900
to be separated from the Angels.

966
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,340
I believe we can win this game
without finding out...

967
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
who the Devils are.

968
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,679
- I agree.
- If we stay here.

969
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,940
There's no need to expose Deity.

970
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,750
We, Angels, can stay here
and have a meeting...

971
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,550
to count the cards
and eliminate the Devils.

972
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,980
This isn't a mathematical game.

973
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,679
We can't win by counting the cards.

974
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,690
What are the chances
of getting two Good Deed cards...

975
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,260
among the three?

976
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,360
- He's right.
- The Devil can discard it...

977
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,960
when there's only one Good Deed card.

978
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,960
No, it's not!

979
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,360
- He's a Devil.
- That's why...

980
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,900
He's saying that because he's a Devil.

981
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,030
- Can't you tell?
- I can tell.

982
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,239
But...

983
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,340
(Is Seong Beom a Devil?)

984
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:13,480
When he says such things,

985
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,409
just observe how he behaves.

986
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,250
Don't try to convince him to stop.

987
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,750
What makes you think he doesn't know that?

988
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,650
Just watch.

989
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:28,519
(They'll watch for now.)

990
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,559
I'm not saying
that we should talk about the chances.

991
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,800
We, Angels, think...

992
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,630
that we only need...

993
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,869
a couple of verified Angels...

994
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,429
- to have them...
- But how can we verify...

995
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:38,469
the Angels in this situation?

996
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,070
- We can do that.
- How?

997
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,610
We can just tell.

998
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,110
That's what this game is about.

999
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,239
(Finding it odd)

1000
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,380
From my point of view,
I couldn't get that.

1001
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,980
I saw him saying
that we should stay together...

1002
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,650
and leading the discussion,

1003
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,849
and I knew...

1004
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,389
he was a Devil immediately.

1005
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,760
Who do you think the Angel is, then?

1006
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,929
MJ and I are Angels.

1007
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:05,659
That's for sure.

1008
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,760
And maybe Eon Kyu.

1009
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,800
How are you sure?

1010
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,469
What's the reason?

1011
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:12,570
- I just...
- I was agreeing...

1012
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,670
- with Seong Beom's opinion,
- We can just tell.

1013
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,809
but the moment I heard
his reason for verifying Angels...

1014
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:17,809
I was like, "What is this?"

1015
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,739
But we can't logically say,

1016
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,710
"I picked a card,
and it said I was an Angel."

1017
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,809
That's not logically fair.

1018
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,380
So, we observe their behavior and words.

1019
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,719
MJ, Eon Kyu,

1020
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,320
and I stayed together
for quite a long time,

1021
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
and we're the same.

1022
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,820
The three of us are honest people,

1023
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,320
so we would have acted differently
if we were Devils.

1024
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,719
There are things that seem unusual.

1025
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,190
That's why I'm saying it's safe...

1026
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,389
to find the ones
who are clearly on our side...

1027
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,699
in this room.

1028
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,030
I get what you mean.

1029
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,000
It seemed to me like the Devils were...

1030
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,369
anxious to get out of here...

1031
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,440
so that they could come up with a scheme.

1032
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,840
But Devils know who each other is.

1033
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,670
Should they be scheming?

1034
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,940
Even though they know each other,

1035
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,579
it's not like they can talk
through telepathy.

1036
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:57,510
- They still need to talk.
- Right.

1037
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,510
So, we're trying to stop that.

1038
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:01,480
Seong Beom was leading the discussion...

1039
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,989
and saying,

1040
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:04,750
"All Angels,
stay right here in this hall."

1041
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,820
But that makes no sense.

1042
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,190
Devils know each other,

1043
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,789
so they don't need to speak in private.

1044
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,599
They only need to incite the Angels.

1045
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,929
Their only job is to confuse the Angels.

1046
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:19,099
On the contrary,
the Angels must spread out,

1047
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,070
while the Archangel approaches Deity.

1048
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
The Angels need to observe them...

1049
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,039
and guess who the Devils are.

1050
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,179
The fact that he's saying,
"We should all stay here,"

1051
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,550
"you're a Devil if you step out..."

1052
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,719
told me that he was trying to distract us.

1053
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:36,320
(Is Seong Beom a Devil?)

1054
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,550
- The Devils...
- You see,

1055
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,590
I've played with Seong Beom
for a while, right?

1056
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,690
I've been playing with him from the start.

1057
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,389
He never makes decisions...

1058
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:45,860
for such a reason.

1059
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,230
(Seong Beom seems
particularly different than usual?)

1060
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,530
He's the type to play the game...

1061
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:53,400
- by always proceeding with caution.
- Actually, for the Angels...

1062
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,039
- Right?
- Yes.

1063
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,269
Can I join?

1064
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,670
(Approaching)

1065
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,480
- No?
- If you're in a group...

1066
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,440
- For now...
- Devils already know each other.

1067
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:04,679
- For now...
- Excluding Lucifer.

1068
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,849
- Should I get lost?
- What?

1069
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,150
Because... Yes.

1070
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:12,590
I...

1071
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,389
want to believe that you're an Angel.

1072
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:17,289
But how could you be certain
that they are Angels?

1073
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:18,889
(Hesitant)

1074
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:21,159
Then let me just say it to everyone. Yes.

1075
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,730
You could think that way.

1076
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,929
So far,
Seong Beom has been playing games...

1077
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,969
by always proceeding with caution.

1078
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:32,639
But the style of game
he's suggesting now...

1079
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,280
is quite similar to gambling.

1080
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:39,650
I'm not saying that you're a Devil.

1081
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,179
Who? Me?

1082
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,050
- No, Seong Beom.
- I see.

1083
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,719
I feel threatened now.

1084
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,889
If this continues,

1085
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,360
Angels might be in a predicament.

1086
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,900
- That's how I feel.
- I should put him on the list for now.

1087
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,530
(The players are divided into two groups
in no time.)

1088
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,469
- If we just all stay here...
- If we don't do anything,

1089
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:57,869
Angels might be in trouble.

1090
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,139
I want to continue with the combination
of people who we know as Angels.

1091
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,769
No, it's not about
the right combination of people.

1092
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,070
I'm saying that...

1093
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,780
we have to think of a way
on how to utilize...

1094
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,949
the good cards Angels have.

1095
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,150
But eliminating
the Devils one at a time...

1096
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,949
and securing the Angels one at a time...

1097
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,989
- No, we can't eliminate the Devils now.
- We can't do that now.

1098
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,090
- We can't kill them off...
- Only Deity knows.

1099
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,219
- unlike the Mafia Game.
- Only Deity knows.

1100
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,860
I've been playing with Dong Min
for the past several days.

1101
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,500
I figured out his patterns
and behavioral psychology...

1102
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,099
to a certain degree.

1103
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,500
But when we began playing,

1104
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,139
he didn't behave like himself.

1105
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:38,110
He initially suggested
to go with Strategy A.

1106
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,739
But he behaved the opposite way.

1107
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:42,139
He exaggerated his gestures
and the way he talked to people.

1108
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,150
I found that suspicious.

1109
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,219
I was 100 percent sure
that Dong Min was a Devil.

1110
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,650
Only Deity is frustrated.

1111
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,989
So now, Deity knows
one of the Devils' identities.

1112
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,860
But Deity can't speak up now.

1113
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,030
If we just sit here and do nothing,

1114
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,159
the Angels can't share that information.

1115
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,900
"What? Why? I thought he was an Angel."

1116
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:05,900
That could happen.

1117
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,670
Then can I share my opinion?

1118
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,610
Only the Angels can pay attention.

1119
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:14,539
MJ is going 3rd. Acau is going 4th.

1120
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,510
Eon Kyu is going 6th. And I'm going 10th.

1121
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,210
In my opinion,
the four of us are indeed Angels.

1122
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,050
- Why? On what grounds?
- So...

1123
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,679
- Tell us the reason.
- So if you don't want to believe me,

1124
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:23,750
then don't.

1125
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,289
But that's just my strategy.

1126
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,090
So there are players
whom we deem as Angels for sure.

1127
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,690
When it's their turn
to be the Representative,

1128
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,159
we can pick another Angel
to be the Executioner.

1129
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,900
MJ is going third.

1130
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,659
We're certain that she's an Angel.

1131
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:36,699
Why?

1132
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:37,969
We were certain,
so we chose her for Round One.

1133
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,969
- That's...
- No, that can change.

1134
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,500
- Listen.
- Just because you were an Angel once,

1135
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,869
it doesn't mean...

1136
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:44,239
- you'll always be an Angel.
- Here's an example.

1137
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,880
I would appreciate
if you can let me finish.

1138
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,139
- Okay. Let's hear him out.
- Please.

1139
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,809
It's difficult to voice my opinion
because there are people...

1140
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:51,980
who are overly opinionated.

1141
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,980
Anyway, we all agreed that MJ was
the most likely to be an Angel.

1142
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,019
- Okay.
- So MJ...

1143
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,860
is going third.
You go in as the Representative.

1144
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,659
Save all the Good Deed cards you can.

1145
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,630
But if we end up with the Evil Deed card,
one more Devil will be exposed.

1146
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,800
We can split up then.
The Archangel and Deity can meet up.

1147
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,170
They can exchange information
about the two Devils.

1148
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,769
But why must we wait until then?

1149
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,239
Why must we wait
until there are two Devils?

1150
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,039
What will you do if you don't wait?

1151
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:18,440
(What will you do if you don't wait?)

1152
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,309
I thought Seong Beom was a Devil for sure.

1153
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:23,210
So I just left.
I bolted out of there first.

1154
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,050
"Fine. Think of me as a Devil then."

1155
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,550
"I don't think we should play like this."

1156
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,889
I'm leaving.

1157
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,590
Where are you going?

1158
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,860
(Xitsuh is leaving in the end.)

1159
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,860
The Archangel must meet with Deity.

1160
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,059
By staying there,
we'll only be instigated by the Devils.

1161
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,269
Devils already know
each other's identities.

1162
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,699
They must be Seong Beom...

1163
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,739
and the players who follow Seong Beom.
The people who agree with Seong Beom.

1164
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,670
Heo Seong Beom, Kim Min A,
Hong Jin Ho, and Joo Eon Kyu.

1165
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,679
The four of them...

1166
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:55,739
(Devil candidates: Heo Seong Beom,
Kim Min A, Hong Jin Ho, Joo Eon Kyu)

1167
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,309
I'm considering them
to be the Devil candidates.

1168
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,820
I think
we ought to talk to people in private.

1169
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,719
Are we just going to split up? What?

1170
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,989
No. There's nothing we can do now.

1171
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:09,889
It will be better to talk to people
in private for the sake of your team.

1172
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,059
- This is so sudden. This is a bust.
- If you're an Angel,

1173
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,659
just strike up a conversation with people.

1174
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,670
My first strategy was making it possible
for Deity and the Archangel...

1175
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,639
to communicate in private.

1176
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:26,639
But if it's too obvious
that Deity and the Archangel...

1177
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,980
are talking in private,

1178
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,579
Deity can be easily exposed.

1179
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,449
Even if I didn't need to talk to everyone,

1180
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:38,150
I invited everyone for a talk in private.
I kept doing that.

1181
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,489
Who do you think is an Angel?

1182
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,190
Just based on your gut feeling.

1183
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,530
- At first, Dong Min took an active role.
- Yes.

1184
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,530
I thought he was an Angel
because he said all the right things.

1185
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,230
But he talked to Xitsuh
in private earlier.

1186
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,699
So now, I'm certain that he's a Devil.

1187
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,039
I see.

1188
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,469
But we talked about not sharing...

1189
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:00,079
any information with anyone.

1190
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,579
But you want to mislead the Devils.
That's your strategy.

1191
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,849
In an attempt to mislead them,

1192
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,119
we might end up giving away a hint.

1193
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:11,489
It feels like I'm being interrogated.
It feels weird.

1194
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,360
- Dong Min seems a bit suspicious.
- Okay.

1195
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,019
He rarely changes his strategy
once the game starts.

1196
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,730
He said we should all stay together.

1197
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,789
After talking to Xitsuh,

1198
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,829
- he changed his stance.
- Yes.

1199
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:22,429
I was like, "What? Dong Min changed
his mind? It's a major change."

1200
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:26,070
Dong Min said we had to stay together...

1201
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,570
and shouldn't split up.

1202
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:30,969
Then at one point, he said...

1203
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:34,110
that the Angels had to split up,

1204
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,510
so the Archangel and Deity could meet.

1205
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,610
He argued that
we should talk to people in private.

1206
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,780
So I suspected him for it. Yes, that's it.

1207
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,989
In my opinion,
Seong Beom is a 100 percent Devil.

1208
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:47,989
I think Min A and Jin Ho
are highly likely to be Devils.

1209
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,960
When we drew the cards...

1210
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,730
- for the order of Representatives,
- Yes.

1211
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,500
- we didn't have much information.
- Right.

1212
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,369
But after coming back from it,
Jin Ho made notes.

1213
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,769
(He made notes
when there wasn't much information?)

1214
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,699
He could've written down the order.

1215
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,340
In my opinion, Acau is the Archangel.

1216
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,780
- I think he wants to lead the game now.
- He wants to lead.

1217
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,610
That's why he wants to split up.

1218
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,219
Then will the Archangel know who Deity is?

1219
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,349
Probably. But Acau thinks...

1220
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:18,690
that he's super sharp.
But sometimes, he makes clumsy mistakes.

1221
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:21,059
If he's exposed while meeting up
with Deity, we'll lose this game.

1222
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,760
I'm really at ease because I'm an Angel.

1223
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,429
I didn't draw the Archangel or Deity.

1224
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,829
You can totally trust me.

1225
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,260
Dong Min is a Devil.

1226
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,230
- I'm certain of it.
- Yes.

1227
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,900
I became sure of it just now.

1228
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,269
Seong Beom is not the type
to insist on his opinion like that.

1229
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,269
- Right. I've never seen that before.
- Yes.

1230
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,409
If Steve did that, I would've understood.

1231
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,079
But this kind of behavior from Seong Beom
doesn't make sense.

1232
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,949
So anyway,

1233
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:51,250
it's not that we hate Seong Beom.
We just have to win the game.

1234
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,019
- Min A and Seong Beom are together.
- What?

1235
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,420
- Min A and Seong Beom are together.
- Really?

1236
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:57,289
I think Acau is an Angel.

1237
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:00,199
Among all the strategies I heard,
his strategy was the only one...

1238
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,360
that was advantageous to the Angels.

1239
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,230
If the Archangel doesn't do anything,
this game will be a bust.

1240
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:07,769
Right now,
the Devils know each other's identities.

1241
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:09,869
The Angels will be easily influenced
since they don't have the information.

1242
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:12,769
But since the Devils know,
they can easily shape the public opinion.

1243
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,610
This is the biggest problem.

1244
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,309
Deity cannot be exposed
in whatever circumstances.

1245
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:21,320
But Deity must do something.

1246
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,090
So the Archangel and Deity must meet up.

1247
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,489
Well, I must meet Deity
as soon as possible...

1248
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,690
and share my identity,

1249
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,590
so I could get some information.

1250
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,860
So I asked a lot of people...

1251
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:37,130
without making it look too obvious.

1252
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,670
"Who do you think is the Devil?"

1253
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,409
Whom do you suspect the most?

1254
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:44,539
(Xitsuh asked everyone, including Deity.)

1255
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:45,610
You're an Angel, right?

1256
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,809
Of course. Darn it.

1257
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,679
Whom do you suspect the most?

1258
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:51,050
Pick the most suspicious player.

1259
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,050
- The Devil.
- You can pick me.

1260
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,179
Tell me the most suspicious player.

1261
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:56,380
- You and Dong Min.
- Okay.

1262
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:01,190
So I heard from Deity.

1263
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,329
Deity said,
"I think this person is the Devil."

1264
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,329
So I was like, "Okay."

1265
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,260
I was given an oracle from Deity.

1266
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:15,099
Be quiet, you Devil.

1267
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,539
- I'm not a Devil.
- We're talking.

1268
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,210
See? He's calling me a Devil
without proof.

1269
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,510
- Dong Min is making them think I'm it.
- The first Devil.

1270
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,139
(The first Devil singled out by Deity)

1271
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,309
Min A.

1272
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:26,309
(Kim Min A)

1273
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,590
We have all forgotten that
we have the Archangel.

1274
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,719
- I know.
- And the Archangel knows...

1275
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,719
who the Devil is.

1276
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,130
I didn't have to hide the fact
that I was the Archangel.

1277
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,269
Even if the Devils find out
that I'm the Archangel...

1278
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,199
So what?

1279
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,170
What could they do?

1280
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:53,380
In this game,
the Archangel has to take an active role.

1281
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,510
The Archangel must lead
the other Angels...

1282
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,880
and let them know who the Devils are
while covering for Deity.

1283
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:01,050
Did they meet?

1284
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,650
Did Deity and Archangel meet?

1285
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,920
Let me tell you how far we've gotten.

1286
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:07,219
And I think we're right.

1287
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,030
- Okay.
- Min A is a Devil.

1288
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:13,130
(He shares the information
with Dong Min too.)

1289
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:17,929
My gosh, this is getting interesting.

1290
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,900
- So you know what's going on now.
- Yes.

1291
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,269
- Min A is the Devil.
- Yes.

1292
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,010
What if...

1293
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:27,210
Seong Beom is Lucifer?

1294
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:29,380
Then we're basically doomed.

1295
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:32,849
The only person who can be this active
is Lucifer.

1296
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:34,079
(The 1 Devil who was not revealed
to Deity is Lucifer.)

1297
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,250
My gosh, this is really iffy.
This is crazy.

1298
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,849
(The 1 Devil who was not revealed
to Deity is Lucifer.)

1299
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,119
Anyway,

1300
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,789
you have to lead the Angels.

1301
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:46,130
If you see anyone
with suspicious behaviors, tell me.

1302
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,969
Then I'll make a gesture, and you observe.

1303
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,269
The Representative candidate,
Choi Hye Seon, for Round Two...

1304
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:56,139
has ten minutes
to nominate the Executioner.

1305
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:59,510
This round could go wrong.

1306
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:02,110
He has some kind of plan.

1307
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,210
He assumes that there won't be
any Good Deed cards this round.

1308
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,719
If we end up with two Evil Deed cards,
it will be over. That's his judgment.

1309
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:14,519
(They must make an Angel
to be the Executioner.)

1310
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,289
Choose one player
to be the Executioner candidate.

1311
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,130
(Xitsuh)

1312
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,230
The second Representative candidate,
Choi Hye Seon,

1313
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,329
nominated Xitsuh
to be the Executioner candidate.

1314
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,539
(Representative: Choi Hye Seon,
Executioner: Xitsuh)

1315
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,900
A vote will now be held...

1316
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,610
for the Representative candidate,
Choi Hye Seon,

1317
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,539
and the Executioner candidate, Xitsuh.

1318
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,110
The combination makes no sense.

1319
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,050
- I will vote against it for sure.
- Are you an Angel?

1320
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,079
How many times
must I tell you I'm an Angel?

1321
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,179
Do you feel lonely?

1322
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,389
(Suspecting him)

1323
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,960
When have I ever lied to you?

1324
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,360
You can start today.

1325
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,389
Lying is not my cup of tea unlike someone.

1326
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,500
You're so sly.

1327
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,530
Xitsuh.
Please vote for or against the candidates.

1328
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,900
(Xitsuh's alliance votes
for the candidates.)

1329
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,940
I'll vote for them.

1330
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:04,969
I'll vote for them.

1331
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,380
(Xitsuh's alliance votes
for the candidates.)

1332
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,980
They're not interested in hiding
that they're the Devils.

1333
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,349
Think about it. Dong Min
and Xitsuh are on the same page?

1334
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,750
This can never happen.

1335
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,650
The three of them
might be Devils for sure.

1336
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,050
Xitsuh, Choi Hye Seon, and Jang Dong Min.

1337
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,460
(Heo Seong Beom's alliance
votes against the candidates.)

1338
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,730
You don't think I don't know who you are?

1339
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,760
(Against)

1340
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,699
I was told to vote against them.

1341
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:35,300
- So I did.
- Who told you that?

1342
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Seong Beom.

1343
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:39,039
Initially, I was suspicious of him.

1344
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:41,110
- I'm still not 100 percent sure.
- Okay.

1345
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,280
I think you're an Angel.

1346
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,550
Well, my hunch could be wrong.

1347
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,050
And earlier, Xitsuh slipped up.

1348
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,619
(It was right after
their roles had been assigned.)

1349
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,949
And I don't know who is what!

1350
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,159
I'll find out on my way back up.

1351
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,559
- I think he's a Devil.
- He just made a mistake.

1352
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,130
- That was a slip of the tongue.
- That was a slip of the tongue.

1353
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,400
To think that he was acting then,

1354
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,570
what he said...

1355
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:07,570
clearly gave away his identity.

1356
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,840
Voting is over.

1357
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:12,440
According to the result,

1358
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,610
the second Representative candidate,
Choi Hye Seon,

1359
00:56:15,909 --> 00:56:17,610
and the second Executioner candidate,
Xitsuh,

1360
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,019
were not elected.

1361
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,349
(Representative, Executioner)

1362
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,519
This is crazy.

1363
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:27,159
What are you doing alone?

1364
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,420
What? I'm trying to figure this out.

1365
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,059
Darn it. Nothing is working out.

1366
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,190
Did you vote against us?

1367
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,329
- Me?
- Did you vote against us?

1368
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:37,699
I don't know. I'm not sure anymore.

1369
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,230
- I thought you were an Angel.
- I...

1370
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,869
- Did you vote against us?
- No. We can't assume she's not...

1371
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,840
- just because of this vote.
- I'm an Angel.

1372
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:47,239
The Representative candidate
for Round Three is MJ Kim.

1373
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:49,079
(Representative, MJ Kim)

1374
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,349
MJ Kim, the Representative candidate,

1375
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,719
must enter the voting room
within 30 minutes...

1376
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,250
and nominate an Executioner candidate.

1377
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,320
MJ. Pick Seong Beom
for the Executioner candidate.

1378
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
- Eon Kyu. MJ. Could you come here?
- But...

1379
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,360
- Eon Kyu. MJ. Come here.
- Just now...

1380
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,789
- No. Don't leave.
- Eon Kyu...

1381
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,760
So tell me why you voted
against this round just now.

1382
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,599
All right. I'll tell you.

1383
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,500
Here's when we have to elect
the candidates.

1384
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,670
We must do that when we're certain...

1385
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,300
both the Representative
and the Executioner are Angels.

1386
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,670
That way, we have a higher chance
of getting the Good Deed card. Right?

1387
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,510
But to be honest,

1388
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,809
we didn't have clear proof
that Hye Seon was an Angel.

1389
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:26,250
Everyone was suspecting Xitsuh
from the get-go.

1390
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,550
(Thinking)

1391
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,420
Yes, we'll tell you.
We voted against the round. Why?

1392
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,989
Because we believe you're Devils.

1393
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:39,289
(Because you are Devils.)

1394
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,960
- If you have a different opinion,
- Okay. Let me speak.

1395
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,070
- you can speak up.
- Okay. Let me speak up.

1396
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:47,039
When we were all sitting here earlier,
we listened to each other's strategies.

1397
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,070
The only person to offer
any sound strategy was Acau.

1398
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,840
All the strategies from Seong Beom...

1399
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:55,110
would put the Angels at a disadvantage.

1400
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,510
"Let's try out four rounds first."

1401
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:58,179
I don't understand
what he wants to do with that.

1402
00:57:58,179 --> 00:57:59,710
He wants us to end up
with four Evil Deed cards?

1403
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,019
"Let's keep going
until we get the Good Deed cards."

1404
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,289
What if this happens in Round 2?
"Wait, we got 3 Evil Deed cards?"

1405
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:05,449
That's a possibility.

1406
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,889
So trying to waste
four rounds like that...

1407
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:11,460
If you truly believe
this strategy makes sense,

1408
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,559
I'll just go and blow up.

1409
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,099
- He didn't listen to me.
- He didn't say four rounds.

1410
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:17,670
- He didn't say that.
- That wasn't the strategy.

1411
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,829
No one said that.

1412
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,239
- Earlier, you wanted to experiment.
- No. He didn't say that.

1413
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:23,769
I started off by saying
that was an option we could consider.

1414
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:25,039
- I ended up saying something else.
- So...

1415
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,070
- You didn't listen to the whole thing.
- But you still brought it up.

1416
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,440
You brought it up.

1417
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,909
- Then for your strategies afterward,
- Right.

1418
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:31,250
you said we couldn't split up
and should stay together.

1419
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:33,920
Acau was the only one
who understood the essence of the game.

1420
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,780
He knew the Archangel had to do something.
Why?

1421
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,849
That's the mechanism of this game.

1422
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,760
Deity is the only one
who knows the identities of the Devils.

1423
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,460
When Deity tells the Archangel
about the Devils,

1424
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,829
the Archangel will talk to people
on Deity's behalf.

1425
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:47,500
Xitsuh. If you truly wanted
to listen to what I had to say,

1426
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,059
just like Jin Ho and Eon Kyu,
you would've known exactly what I said.

1427
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,329
You would have known
what kind of strategy I wanted to play.

1428
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,199
But you stopped listening.

1429
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,940
You thought, "Okay. Seong Beom's strategy
will harm the Angels."

1430
00:58:57,139 --> 00:59:00,070
Then the person I suspected the most
was Dong Min.

1431
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,610
Earlier, Dong Min said
he wanted everyone to stay together.

1432
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,050
He made everyone to get on board
and said we shouldn't split up.

1433
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,250
Then Dong Min was the first one
to suspect Xitsuh.

1434
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,250
But back then,
they didn't know each other's identity.

1435
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:13,889
But afterward,
Dong Min stopped suspecting Xitsuh.

1436
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:14,889
After exchanging each other's identity.

1437
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,219
Then up until yesterday,

1438
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,159
they tried to send each other
to the Deathmatch.

1439
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,360
But today, they're perfectly in sync.

1440
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,400
We all know that
they like to play for themselves.

1441
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,900
And Hye Seon
didn't need to play with them.

1442
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,030
Up until now, she didn't have
a friendly relationship with them.

1443
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,269
So it's ironical
how the three of them are together.

1444
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,369
- Can you give me a rebuttal for that?
- So...

1445
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:31,610
- So...
- A Devil...

1446
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,139
As an Angel, I didn't mislead anyone.

1447
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,510
- I did things that raised suspicions.
- Acau.

1448
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,780
- Acau.
- That's what I did.

1449
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,880
(Calling Acau)

1450
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,210
If you listen to me,
you'll know I'm working...

1451
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,619
- for the Angels. Why?
- Acau. Just know this.

1452
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,679
- You're the key player.
- Only Acau...

1453
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:43,889
- What?
- You have the deciding power.

1454
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,119
Here's where I stand.

1455
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,159
From what I've been hearing,
I wasn't sure about Hye Seon.

1456
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,730
I highly thought that
Xitsuh could be an Angel.

1457
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,829
- Xitsuh had a point.
- Yes.

1458
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:00,969
But Seong Beom didn't say anything
about wasting four rounds.

1459
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:03,739
He was trying to say that
we shouldn't do anything...

1460
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,139
that could harm the Angels.

1461
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:06,739
Then put me on trial.

1462
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,280
If you all agree that MJ Kim is an Angel,

1463
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:10,949
put me down as the Executioner
and elect me.

1464
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:13,079
- It doesn't matter if we get...
- Gosh, no. We can't do that.

1465
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:15,650
all three Evil Deed cards or vice versa.
She'll know what they are.

1466
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,190
MJ will tell you what she saw.

1467
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,150
Then see what I do.

1468
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,489
- Then...
- See which card we end up with.

1469
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:23,019
- Then you'd act like an Angel.
- That's a waste. Then pick Seong Beom.

1470
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,289
- I'm 100 percent sure. It's Seong Beom.
- Right.

1471
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,260
- No. Jin Ho...
- Are you a Devil?

1472
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,000
- Why did he say, "100 percent?"
- Jin Ho,

1473
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,570
- MJ, and Min A.
- Nothing is guaranteed.

1474
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,400
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

1475
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:37,170
I'm so angry because he's being
super aggressive but with awful acting.

1476
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,510
- Is Acau a Devil?
- What?

1477
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:44,510
Are you sure Acau isn't a Devil?

1478
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,179
- Hold on. Let's talk.
- Okay.

1479
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,550
- Let me say just one thing.
- Okay.

1480
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,820
- Let's say Acau is an Angel.
- Yes.

1481
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,289
If we lose,
he will have to go to the Deathmatch.

1482
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:58,590
- Yes. He's trolling.
- He's trolling hard right now.

1483
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,260
He thinks
he's the key player of this game.

1484
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,829
He talked to everyone in private.

1485
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,969
He just sat there with his legs crossed.
He's so into gathering information now.

1486
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,130
It's either Acau or Hye Seon.

1487
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,239
What if Hye Seon is acting strange
like that...

1488
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,969
because she truly believes
Dong Min and Xitsuh are Angels?

1489
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,139
- That could be why.
- No. Never.

1490
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:15,380
- No?
- Never.

1491
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,510
Hold on.

1492
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,380
Dong Min could have gaslighted her.

1493
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,780
- Exactly.
- I've made up my mind.

1494
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,820
Acau is an Angel, but he just doesn't know
how to play this game.

1495
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,550
He's easily influenced by them.

1496
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,119
So this is a critical point.

1497
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:28,219
To get the result we want with this vote,

1498
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:30,429
- we need Acau and Jin Ho.
- Right.

1499
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,860
I just want to pick Jin Ho.

1500
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,400
Here's why. Earlier, Jin Ho said...

1501
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,300
we got three Evil Deed cards...

1502
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:38,829
and I saw two Evil Deed cards.
So I want to check...

1503
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,199
- if he removed a Good Deed card.
- Yes.

1504
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:42,699
That's a good call.

1505
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,309
MJ. Nominate an Executioner candidate.

1506
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,079
Here.

1507
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,480
I'll nominate Jin Ho.

1508
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,190
The third Representative candidate,
MJ Kim,

1509
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,590
nominated Hong Jin Ho.

1510
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:04,059
A vote will now be held
for the Representative candidate, MJ Kim,

1511
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:07,900
and the Executioner candidate,
Hong Jin Ho.

1512
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,570
So who has the highest possibility
of being a Devil in your opinion?

1513
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,980
Everyone on the other team?

1514
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,039
I'm 100 percent sure it's Min A.

1515
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,750
But there are two more.

1516
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,809
- And Seong Beom is acting so odd.
- But...

1517
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,320
He was louder than me. All of a sudden,

1518
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,949
- he started to laugh.
- Well, that was...

1519
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,119
That didn't make any sense.

1520
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:33,519
- That's nonsense. It's clear he's acting.
- That's a bit odd.

1521
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,159
- Well, you know me. This is me.
- But...

1522
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:36,960
But what is your proof
for thinking Min A is a Devil?

1523
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,559
- What?
- What's your proof for Min A?

1524
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,429
I have my sources.

1525
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,969
I'm not sure.

1526
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,670
I didn't get any vibe
even when I talked to her up close.

1527
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,539
Given his personality,
he would've done something.

1528
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,409
He would've offered a strategy
or figured out a way.

1529
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:54,679
But he's not doing anything.

1530
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:56,440
(Realizing something)

1531
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,280
(Dong Min quietly pulls Xitsuh aside.)

1532
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,519
You know what I think?

1533
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,090
- Yes?
- I get the feeling...

1534
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,519
- What?
- that we're doomed.

1535
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,820
Because of the Evil Deed card?

1536
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,260
Yes, this is bad.

1537
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:13,329
We need to stay sharp now.

1538
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,159
Here's the thing with the score
of the Good and Evil Deed cards.

1539
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,230
We must have one more Good Deed card...

1540
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:19,969
- to have a somewhat of an equal chance.
- We're not doing well.

1541
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,369
There's a risk with Round Four for us.

1542
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:27,010
- We must lead by one point...
- This is so hard.

1543
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,039
to have similar footing in this game.

1544
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:29,539
But we're actually losing.

1545
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,309
It's 1 to 0 now.

1546
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,179
The score for the Evil and Good Deed cards
is 1 to 0.

1547
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:35,679
It means we're actually losing by two.

1548
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,650
The requirement for the Angels and Devils
to win is the same.

1549
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,760
The Angels must end up
with five Good Deed cards.

1550
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,119
Or the Devils must end up
with five Evil Deed cards.

1551
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,559
However, for the Devils, even if
the Angels collect five Good Deed cards,

1552
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,199
the Devils can win by identifying Deity.

1553
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,800
But when the Devils have
five Evil Deed cards,

1554
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,300
the Angels will lose immediately.

1555
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,840
With more Evil Deed cards,

1556
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:58,710
Team Angels faces a great chance
to lose the game.

1557
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,710
- No.
- So for this round,

1558
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,380
if they don't feel safe,
they will vote against Jin Ho.

1559
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,780
People whom we deem
to be Angels for sure...

1560
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,889
- must pair up.
- Right.

1561
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,250
But why did they pick Jin Ho?

1562
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,489
No, listen. MJ just picked him on her own.

1563
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:16,989
She was influenced by them.

1564
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:18,730
Listen.

1565
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,030
We should've gotten a Good Deed card
in the previous round.

1566
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,769
Right. It's so hard to collect
five Good Deed cards.

1567
01:04:24,769 --> 01:04:25,969
I mean, there aren't a lot of cards,
to begin with.

1568
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,969
The only way to collect Good Deeds
is through the cards.

1569
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:30,440
Look. If this happens...

1570
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:32,869
and they decide to come clean
and just vote for him,

1571
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,610
then this game will be a bust.

1572
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,480
We must stop this from happening.

1573
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,179
I'll go and ask them how they voted.

1574
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:39,480
- We must stop them.
- We must vote against them.

1575
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,679
- You bet.
- I understood you.

1576
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:41,849
- We must vote against them.
- Yes.

1577
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,119
I never stopped suspecting Dong Min.

1578
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:45,150
- Really?
- Yes.

1579
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:46,949
Did you vote?

1580
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:48,889
- Yes, I did.
- Did you vote for or against them?

1581
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,360
I voted for them.

1582
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,190
- Hye Seon.
- Yes.

1583
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,230
They were already elected.
Go and tell Dong Min.

1584
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,730
- Really?
- We outnumbered you, so yes.

1585
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:56,860
I see.

1586
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,969
(Hurrying)

1587
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,230
That's odd.

1588
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,969
He said they were elected
because everyone voted for them.

1589
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:03,739
What?

1590
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:04,969
- Darn it. Already?
- The other group already voted.

1591
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,070
- Darn it. They didn't even talk to us.
- But Seong Beom seemed happy.

1592
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,409
- He was smiling.
- Why did they vote without us?

1593
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,679
They might end up
with two Good Deed cards.

1594
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,579
They might end up
with two Good Deed cards. I must pray.

1595
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,480
Gosh, no.
It will be another Evil Deed card.

1596
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,889
Unless we get three Good Deed cards,
we'll get an Evil Deed for sure.

1597
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:19,489
- Three Good Deed cards.
- Yes.

1598
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:20,489
That's impossible.

1599
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,619
Voting is over.

1600
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,789
The Representative candidate, MJ Kim,

1601
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,059
and the Executioner candidate,
Hong Jin Ho, were elected.

1602
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,030
The Representative, MJ Kim,

1603
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:34,300
and the Executioner, Hong Jin Ho,

1604
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,409
enter the voting room
and choose the card you want to discard.

1605
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:43,210
(Representative MJ Kim
enters the voting room first.)

1606
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:46,179
MJ Kim. Please choose a card
you wish to discard.

1607
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,019
I'll discard this card.

1608
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,820
(MJ Kim discards an Evil Deed card.)

1609
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:55,260
(Executioner, Hong Jin Ho
enters the voting room.)

1610
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,489
Hong Jin Ho, please choose a card
you wish to discard.

1611
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,769
The card selections have ended.

1612
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:13,210
This is wrong.

1613
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,039
This is really wrong.

1614
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,280
- Why?
- Why?

1615
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,880
It's wrong because Dong Min has said so.

1616
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:20,719
We'll get a Good Deed card this time.

1617
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,889
I believe in Jin Ho.

1618
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,559
The result of the card selections
of Round Three will be revealed.

1619
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,190
(5 minutes ago)

1620
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:36,000
(Jin Ho was deep in thought.)

1621
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,800
If I choose this card,
that card will be registered, right?

1622
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:39,570
That's right.

1623
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:41,869
(Good Deed)

1624
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:44,440
(Why did he discard a Good Deed card?)

1625
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:46,170
I was a bit torn.

1626
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,539
Shall I leave behind a Good Deed card...

1627
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,480
and pretend to be an Angel a bit more?

1628
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:53,010
Even if people find out that I'm a Devil,

1629
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,619
shall I accumulate an Evil Deed card?

1630
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:59,019
(It was time to choose his position.)

1631
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,590
I think it'll be fun
to side with the Devils.

1632
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:04,860
It's the Devils' role to bring chaos.

1633
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:06,789
I'll choose this card.

1634
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,199
(He chose 1 of the 2 remaining cards.)

1635
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,800
I chose a card and got
the role of a Devil.

1636
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,239
I thought, "What? I think it'll be fun."

1637
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:18,110
Number one, Hong Jin Ho.

1638
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,269
I got number one.

1639
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,809
I thought that it'd be nice...

1640
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,510
to gain a point from the start.

1641
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,179
Hong Jin Hom please discard
1 of the 3 cards.

1642
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,250
Okay.

1643
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,389
I'll discard this card.

1644
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,360
Seriously, all three were
the Evil Deed cards.

1645
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,159
(A Devil's acting)

1646
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,829
Seriously, all three were
the Evil Deed cards.

1647
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:43,599
- Don't lie.
- All three were the Evil Deed cards.

1648
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:46,030
Of course, people know...

1649
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,969
that there's a chance
of getting three Evil Deed cards.

1650
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,599
They don't know when it'll happen.

1651
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,440
Even if people grow suspicious,

1652
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,809
I'll lie that there were
three Evil Deed cards...

1653
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,179
so that an Evil Deed card
can get accumulated in Round One.

1654
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:00,710
I planned things that way.

1655
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,050
- Can I pick you?
- Me?

1656
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,949
- Yes.
- Go ahead. What is it for?

1657
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:06,289
Then...

1658
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:09,389
If there are 2 Evil Deed cards
and 1 Good Deed card,

1659
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:11,090
I'll leave behind 1 Evil Deed card
and 1 Good Deed card.

1660
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,260
Of course.

1661
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,090
In any case, you did well to choose me.

1662
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,569
I thought it'd be better
to accumulate an Evil Deed card...

1663
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:20,369
when we can, so I chose an Evil Deed card.

1664
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,439
As for the rest,
I'll believe in other Devils...

1665
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:26,609
and look for what I can do.

1666
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,840
In Round Three,

1667
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,050
one Evil Deed card has been accumulated.

1668
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:35,979
Currently, two Evil Deed cards
have been accumulated.

1669
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,220
(Judgment Status)

1670
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:39,020
See? What did I tell you?

1671
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,619
- My goodness.
- Gosh, Jin Ho.

1672
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,220
Are you going to be like that?

1673
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,590
- What?
- Work hard.

1674
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,689
Perhaps he discarded
a Good Deed card earlier too.

1675
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,300
I think this is better.

1676
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,560
- Why did you choose Jin Ho?
- I want to kill him.

1677
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,600
(The players are confused.)

1678
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,329
Let's beat him up.

1679
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,199
What should we do?

1680
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,569
It made my legs go weak once more.

1681
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,710
We can't be certain about MJ.

1682
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,180
- Okay.
- It's because...

1683
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,119
I told you this earlier.

1684
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,720
Seong Beom might be completely wrong.

1685
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,859
This is driving me crazy.

1686
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:16,920
- This is seriously driving me crazy.
- Xitsuh.

1687
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,590
Let's think about Hye Seon.

1688
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,800
Are you 100 percent sure?

1689
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:23,560
- Yes.
- Why?

1690
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:28,039
- It's because...
- Tell me about your suspicions.

1691
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:30,170
She was smiling
when the result got announced.

1692
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,569
- That's her usual facial expression.
- Really?

1693
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:34,109
When she was selected
by an Evil Spirit yesterday,

1694
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:36,109
she was taking notes alone
with a smile on her face.

1695
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,250
Is Hye Seon really an Angel?

1696
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:41,779
Can we trust her?

1697
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,819
I think we can trust her.

1698
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,319
I think we can trust her. Dong Min too.

1699
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,520
Why?

1700
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,720
We can trust Dong Min too.

1701
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,189
Is it a hunch?

1702
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,329
My judgment is based on his behaviors.

1703
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,229
Dong Min was the one who wanted to reject
the candidates in Round Two.

1704
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:58,029
Perhaps he did that
because he was a Devil.

1705
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:00,729
Here's what I wrote down.

1706
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,899
(They have different ideas
regarding Dong Min's identity.)

1707
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:05,270
I think he might be a spy.
I continue to be suspicious.

1708
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,609
- We can't be sure about his identity.
- You know,

1709
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,649
I honestly had a reality check.

1710
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:13,449
What did I do wrong?

1711
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:15,279
What failed?

1712
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,779
So...

1713
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:20,489
(At that moment, someone visits Xitsuh.)

1714
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:22,460
What is it?

1715
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:24,359
What is it?

1716
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:28,600
(Acau gives them room.)

1717
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,739
(A moment later)

1718
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,800
(Sighing)

1719
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,869
For goodness' sake.

1720
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,710
What nonsense is this?

1721
01:10:44,649 --> 01:10:45,750
We're doomed.

1722
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:51,350
Xitsuh, why aren't you persuading me?

1723
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,989
I'm an Angel.

1724
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,760
I'm the Archangel.

1725
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,560
Let me tell you this for sure.

1726
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:01,229
Min A isn't a Devil.

1727
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:08,039
(The identity of the first Devil)

1728
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:09,140
It's Steve Yea.

1729
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,909
(It's Steve Yea.)

1730
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:17,439
That happened
because Deity was thorough...

1731
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,449
and lied to me.

1732
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,420
Deity couldn't believe someone
who claimed to be the Archangel,

1733
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,149
so he tested me.

1734
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,050
Apparently, Deity lied to me.

1735
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:28,420
Deity didn't believe
that I was the Archangel.

1736
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:32,060
Min A's identity is a mystery.

1737
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,500
In Round One, Steve Yea
was revealed to be a Devil.

1738
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:37,529
In Round Two, Jin Ho
was revealed to be a Devil.

1739
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:38,770
Round Two.

1740
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,800
The problem is that Min A can be an Angel.

1741
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,409
In any case, 1 of the 3 is a stupid Angel.

1742
01:11:44,409 --> 01:11:45,710
(At least 1 of the 3 is an Angel.)

1743
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:48,140
There can't be two stupid Angels
in that trio.

1744
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:50,109
Thus, Dong Min is an Angel.

1745
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:52,880
Dong Min.

1746
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,720
I'm the Archangel.

1747
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,149
- What?
- I'm the Archangel.

1748
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:58,550
- Okay.
- In Round One, Deity lied to me.

1749
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,520
Deity belatedly told me...

1750
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,159
that Steve and Jin Ho were Devils.

1751
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,489
It was Steve in Round 1
and Jin Ho in Round 2.

1752
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,600
So we need to find the other two.

1753
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:11,300
Seong Beom has to be a Devil.

1754
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:12,899
Right.

1755
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,340
I don't think Min A is acting.

1756
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:20,039
Only two remain.

1757
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:22,079
If Seong Beom is definitely a Devil,
we're looking for the last one.

1758
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,810
So only Eon Kyu remains.

1759
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,119
I think we should go in there together.

1760
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:31,090
Think about it logically.
Two Evil Deed cards got accumulated,

1761
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:33,319
but Hye Seon and Jin Ho
are laughing out loud...

1762
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:34,760
with Xitsuh.

1763
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:37,489
Xitsuh is the type who often acts...

1764
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:40,489
- in an emotional way.
- It definitely isn't Xitsuh.

1765
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,899
- A Devil?
- That's right. That's what I think...

1766
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:44,970
from his behaviors.

1767
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,069
Right now, the suspicious one is...

1768
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,270
Steve Yea is a bit suspicious.

1769
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,670
Who else?

1770
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,170
As for Jin Ho, we know for sure.

1771
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,239
Yes.

1772
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,979
Hong Jin Ho and Steve Yea. Are those all?

1773
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,319
It's just a probability.
I can't be certain.

1774
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,079
How many Devils got revealed?

1775
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,949
- We're certain about one Devil, right?
- Yes.

1776
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,359
Dong Min, Xitsuh, and Hye Seon
are alive and well,

1777
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:10,420
but I...

1778
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,130
I guess Acau knows.

1779
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,329
- The Devils?
- Yes.

1780
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,170
I see.

1781
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:26,369
- Min A, shall we talk?
- Okay.

1782
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:30,579
- Min A.
- Yes?

1783
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,079
Are you having a mental breakdown?

1784
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,850
- What?
- Are you having a mental breakdown?

1785
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:35,220
Yes.

1786
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,050
I guess I believe people's words
too easily.

1787
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,149
- That's right.
- It's so...

1788
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:43,260
Min A, are you really an Angel?

1789
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,329
- Yes.
- I'll give you definite information.

1790
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:46,329
Okay.

1791
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,029
Steve is...

1792
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,270
a Devil.

1793
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,869
I also think Steve is a Devil.

1794
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:56,300
- Jin Ho is a Devil.
- Yes.

1795
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:58,369
It's Seong Beom.

1796
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,409
We don't know about Seong Beom.
Perhaps he's trolling.

1797
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,239
- But...
- Isn't he trolling too much then?

1798
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,979
I think either Seong Beom and Eon Kyu
are Devils...

1799
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:09,479
or Seong Beom alone is a Devil.

1800
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,390
I see.

1801
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:14,960
Why do I feel like
Seong Beom is a trolling Angel?

1802
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:19,689
Seong Beom said that
you were a trolling Angel.

1803
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:23,300
Perhaps you guys are mistaken
about each other.

1804
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,770
Perhaps Seong Beom is a Devil.

1805
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:28,199
I'm certain that you're an Angel.

1806
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,569
But Eon Kyu has been behaving strangely.

1807
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:34,039
Did three Devils come upstairs to talk?

1808
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,310
(Seong Beom and Eon Kyu visit Min A.)

1809
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,750
- Gosh.
- I see why you're confused.

1810
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:39,979
Yes.

1811
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:43,479
You and MJ are getting swayed...

1812
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,050
because you guys aren't the Deity.

1813
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,550
Deity knows who the Devils are.

1814
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:47,720
That's right.

1815
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,659
But both Eon Kyu and I are Angels.

1816
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:53,890
Acau and someone else...

1817
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:55,960
can be the Deity and the Archangel.

1818
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,000
But Eon Kyu, it doesn't make sense.

1819
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:00,600
Let's say Xitsuh is the Deity.

1820
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,369
No. I think Acau is the Deity.

1821
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,710
Is Xitsuh the Archangel?

1822
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:06,869
- The Archangel?
- The Archangel?

1823
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,680
Isn't he getting too swayed then?

1824
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,840
- Who?
- Xitsuh.

1825
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:13,609
He isn't getting swayed.

1826
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,880
- Perhaps he has an idea.
- He has an idea.

1827
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,560
Please excuse me.

1828
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,390
Why? Let me join you guys.

1829
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,199
Why? Let me join you guys.

1830
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:33,170
Dong Min, can we talk for a second?

1831
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:34,470
Yes.

1832
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,210
I suspected Jin Ho of being a Devil.

1833
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,840
But MJ said,

1834
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:43,279
"I want to pick Jin Ho."

1835
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,850
I didn't understand why
she would make such a decision,

1836
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,880
but Seong Beom and Eon Kyu said,
"That's a good idea."

1837
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,989
So I didn't say anything in the end.

1838
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:56,189
Thus, I became very suspicious of the two.

1839
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:59,489
If you suddenly behave this way,

1840
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:02,399
- Seong Beom will find another target.
- You're right.

1841
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:05,670
I'll tell the others that I persuaded you.

1842
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:08,340
- So just pretend to listen to them.
- Okay.

1843
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:11,239
- Devils did another prey.
- Yes.

1844
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,909
So stay with them.

1845
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:14,409
- Should I pretend to be on their side?
- Yes.

1846
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,579
You know what I mean, right?

1847
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:17,579
- I don't know what to do.
- That way,

1848
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:19,750
- we can come from behind by voting.
- Yes.

1849
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,819
I began to figure out who the Angels were.

1850
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:24,449
I thought, "We can keep going this way."

1851
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:27,350
We can approve
of the candidates we trust...

1852
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:29,920
and reject the candidates we don't trust.

1853
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,890
Since there were more Angels,
it was 100 percent possible.

1854
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:36,199
I thought, "If we keep going this way,
we can accumulate the Good Deed cards."

1855
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:39,369
- If you aren't a Devil...
- Okay.

1856
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:41,100
- Then you're a fool.
- Then you're so mean.

1857
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,270
- Me?
- Yes.

1858
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:43,270
You're either a Devil or a fool.

1859
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,270
Hold on. Let's talk without Hye Seon.

1860
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:49,510
The number won't be right
even if you keep counting.

1861
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,109
The number won't be right without me.

1862
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:54,720
(Sighing)

1863
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,420
Have you talked to the others?
What did they say?

1864
01:16:56,619 --> 01:16:59,119
Xitsuh... I mean, Dong Min is talking.

1865
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,760
The problem is
that Xitsuh trusts Dong Min.

1866
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,630
It makes no sense. They think I'm a Devil.

1867
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,729
- So...
- That isn't it?

1868
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:11,600
- So...
- Their number won't be right.

1869
01:17:11,729 --> 01:17:14,229
They'll wonder why the number isn't right
and we're making a fuss.

1870
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,069
There's an Angel among them.

1871
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:17,670
- That's why.
- Where?

1872
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,739
- That's why.
- Who's an Angel?

1873
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,439
- Xitsuh.
- Xitsuh is an Angel.

1874
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,579
- But...
- Then why are they with them?

1875
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,850
- Exactly.
- They believe...

1876
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,510
- They were gaslit.
- Yes.

1877
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:34,760
What do you know?

1878
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:36,720
Seong Beom is totally flustered.

1879
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,729
- Okay.
- It's obvious that he's flustered.

1880
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:40,659
I don't know yet...

1881
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,399
if Eon Kyu truly trusts Seong Beom...

1882
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:45,970
or is a Devil.

1883
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:49,199
There's a big chance
that one of them is a Devil.

1884
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:55,079
(Is one of them a Devil?)

1885
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,010
- Shall we talk together or...
- We were talking.

1886
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,310
- Let's talk together.
- Together.

1887
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:00,750
Okay. I can't trust you.

1888
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,279
- Suit yourself.
- Right now,

1889
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:03,880
there's one Devil we don't know about.

1890
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,119
I have a feeling
that Seong Beom just didn't know.

1891
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,760
(Frustrated)

1892
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,859
- Doesn't he go to KAIST?
- Exactly.

1893
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:14,460
- How could you fall for the ruse?
- You know,

1894
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,600
I've been on the same team with him.

1895
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,100
I've seen that side of him a lot.

1896
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,069
- If he's an Angel, let's lose.
- Okay.

1897
01:18:20,369 --> 01:18:21,670
- Let's lose.
- Okay.

1898
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:23,600
We can just lose. If he's an Angel,

1899
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,409
- let's lose.
- I understand.

1900
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:26,770
- Then we can pick him for the Deathmatch.
- But...

1901
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,880
The fourth Representative candidate, Acau,

1902
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:31,909
please enter the voting room
in 30 minutes...

1903
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:34,180
and choose the Executioner candidate.

1904
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:38,250
(The fourth Representative candidate,
Acau)

1905
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:42,590
Acau, please select
the Executioner candidate.

1906
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:44,619
The person I choose is...

1907
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,359
Xitsuh.

1908
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:51,899
The fourth Representative candidate, Acau,

1909
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:55,340
chose Xitsuh as the Executioner candidate.

1910
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,770
The game...

1911
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,409
begins now.

1912
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:08,619
My goodness.

1913
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,659
Acau and Xitsuh?

1914
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:17,689
- I'll go and talk.
- I'll approve.

1915
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,529
Please approve.

1916
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,960
Acau.

1917
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,270
I wondered why
the calculation wasn't right.

1918
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:30,399
It's because Xitsuh is an Angel
who has been completely brainwashed.

1919
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:32,010
It's because Xitsuh is on that side.

1920
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,909
Because I kept saying
that the Devils were...

1921
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,979
Xitsuh, Dong Min, and Hye Seon,

1922
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,880
- you suspected me.
- That was why I suspected you.

1923
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,949
Then we need to come up
with a new strategy.

1924
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,819
We need to protect you.

1925
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:45,090
- But...
- Here's the thing.

1926
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:47,750
Right now, Xitsuh...

1927
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,390
- is telling everyone.
- He might be the Archangel.

1928
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:52,489
No, it's okay. It's a feint.

1929
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,159
- Is that so?
- Yes. It's okay.

1930
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,060
- Thank goodness.
- Yes.

1931
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,300
I was worried about...

1932
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,430
Xitsuh getting thoroughly gaslit...

1933
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:02,100
and telling the others
that you were Deity.

1934
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,770
Then it'd be game over.

1935
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,470
It's okay. Everything is a strategy.

1936
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:09,409
- Okay. Then it's okay.
- I knew about it,

1937
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:11,079
but...

1938
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,609
Why didn't you tell us?

1939
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:14,920
You kept being suspicious.

1940
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,420
- You weren't sure about us.
- No.

1941
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,420
- Okay.
- You kept hanging out...

1942
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,449
with suspicious people
and saying that you were 100 percent sure.

1943
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,760
We're 100 percent Angels. People will see.

1944
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:25,960
I'll approve.

1945
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:39,569
(Staring)

1946
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,779
They know about both.

1947
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,449
Both.

1948
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:55,390
Both got caught.

1949
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:57,420
Both.

1950
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,430
I'm completely on their side.

1951
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,930
Whenever I visited a survival show,

1952
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:08,569
I always got...

1953
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,710
the role of a civilian in the Mafia Game.

1954
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,140
I was a bit disappointed about that.

1955
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:20,909
(He chose his role carefully.)

1956
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:23,479
I've always had that thought.

1957
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:26,250
This time, I chose a Devil.

1958
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,489
I was like, "Gosh, this is great."

1959
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,090
"It'll be so much fun today."

1960
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,930
As for me,

1961
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,930
people think that
I have a devil-like image.

1962
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,199
I think I can use it...

1963
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,399
to my advantage.

1964
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:47,140
And as soon as I saw the members,
I thought to myself,

1965
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:49,079
"Xitsuh..."

1966
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,210
"and Seong Beom..."

1967
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:54,310
"will lead the team."

1968
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:58,319
So I decided to break up
Xitsuh and Seong Beom first.

1969
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,720
In that situation...

1970
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,489
(Dong Min argued
that people shouldn't work individually.)

1971
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:09,029
I said, "You shouldn't go someplace else."

1972
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:11,060
"We should work as a group."

1973
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:14,029
Seong Beom showed...

1974
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,800
a small reaction of agreement...

1975
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:19,869
by my side.

1976
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:24,880
It was my cue to create a conflict.

1977
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,880
I said to Xitsuh who was next to me,

1978
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,279
"Hey, we're in trouble."

1979
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,789
"We'll lose if we keep going this way."

1980
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:35,560
Xitsuh bought it and began...

1981
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,960
to argue with Seong Beom.

1982
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:44,829
(Xitsuh fell for the trap.)

1983
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:46,569
What will you do if you don't wait?

1984
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,930
One Devil has been revealed.

1985
01:22:48,699 --> 01:22:53,170
(He even left the group.)

1986
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:55,210
This is so much fun.

1987
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:01,050
(Dong Min succeeded in
dividing up the players.)

1988
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:04,350
There's nothing to do.

1989
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,819
They're fighting against each other.

1990
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:07,750
Gosh.

1991
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:11,220
All right. Since I'm bored,
I'll guess who the Deity is.

1992
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:17,529
After two rounds,

1993
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,899
Xitsuh came to me and said,

1994
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,770
"I'm the Archangel."

1995
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,109
I was like, "Really?"

1996
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,710
"Have you met the Deity?"

1997
01:23:27,939 --> 01:23:29,810
To me, Deity was the important one.

1998
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,310
"Yes, I've met him."

1999
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,710
"So who are the Devils?"

2000
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:36,850
(He said that Min A was a Devil.)

2001
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,250
Min A?

2002
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:40,520
They're ruined.

2003
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:44,619
There's something serious wrong
with Team Angel.

2004
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,489
Gosh, things are getting interesting.

2005
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,800
- You can probably see what's going on.
- Yes.

2006
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,100
- Min A is a Devil.
- I see.

2007
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,329
"What's going on?"

2008
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:55,800
Those guys...

2009
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,140
Team Angel is going mad.

2010
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:05,079
(They even picked a Devil, Jin Ho,
as the Executioner candidate.)

2011
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:08,619
(He summoned Xitsuh right away.)

2012
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,149
I think we're in big trouble.

2013
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,550
If it ends up being an Evil Deed card...

2014
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,050
I think we're in big trouble.

2015
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,020
If he says, "I'm a Devil,"

2016
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,430
and picks an Evil Deed card,

2017
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:19,930
we'll be ruined.

2018
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:22,300
That's why we need to stop him.

2019
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,460
- But getting five Good Deed cards...
- In...

2020
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:28,369
(Dong Min used Jin Ho to avoid suspicion.)

2021
01:24:28,369 --> 01:24:32,409
In Round 3,
1 Evil Deed card has been accumulated.

2022
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:34,609
(He pretended to be an Angel.)

2023
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,109
Dong Min is definitely an Angel.

2024
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:41,250
In any case, he's strategizing...

2025
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,880
for Team Angel with enthusiasm.

2026
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:45,449
So I believe that he's an Angel.

2027
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:50,460
Jang Dong Min,
please stand by for five seconds.

2028
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,430
(He can't help but smile.)

2029
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:58,130
Seriously,

2030
01:24:58,869 --> 01:25:01,399
I should've joined the military
and become a spy.

2031
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,270
It's so much fun to see the team crumble.

2032
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:08,510
(He's very satisfied with his position.)

2033
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:12,380
(A Devil's play)

2034
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,579
(Team Angel: Xitsuh, Acau, Kim Min A,
and Heo Seong Beom)

2035
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:16,479
Round Four will begin.

2036
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,149
(Team Devil: Lucifer, Jang Dong Min,
Hong Jin Ho, and Steve Yea)

2037
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,420
They're giving me
all the information, so stay still.

2038
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,460
Okay.

2039
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,630
(Steve Yea: Rejection)

2040
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,130
(Hong Jin Ho: Rejection)

2041
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,270
Please vote for or against the candidates.

2042
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:35,500
(MJ Kim: Approval)

2043
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,039
(Xitsuh: Approval)

2044
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:40,340
The fourth Representative candidate,
Acau...

2045
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:44,039
and Executioner candidate,
Xitsuh have been elected.

2046
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:49,819
Now, we just need to hope
that a crazy thing won't happen.

2047
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:51,479
Three Evil Deed cards.

2048
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,020
- That's right.
- Yes.

2049
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:55,619
Two Devils have been identified.

2050
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,590
We'll get the full picture
once one more Evil Deed card gets added.

2051
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:01,229
Then...

2052
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:04,760
Team Devil will be
at a serious disadvantage.

2053
01:26:05,329 --> 01:26:08,300
So we just need to protect...

2054
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,840
the King. I mean, the Deity.
If we protect the Deity,

2055
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:14,239
we can receive five Good Deed cards.

2056
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:18,409
It'll be quite a feat if they guess
the Deity's identity correctly.

2057
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:21,210
We used all the smokescreen strategies.

2058
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:22,449
Right.

2059
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:36,460
- I'll go to Min A.
- Yes. Sound her out.

2060
01:26:38,729 --> 01:26:40,430
Do you want to talk to Eon Kyu?

2061
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,600
You know... Think about it.

2062
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,170
We shouldn't give the Devils
time to gather around.

2063
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,770
I'll protect this place, so...

2064
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:51,010
All right.
Tell Eon Kyu that I want to see him.

2065
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,279
- Tell him to come here.
- I need your insight.

2066
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:54,310
Okay.

2067
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,319
Eon Kyu.

2068
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:59,689
- Dong Min wants to talk to you.
- Really?

2069
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,960
Hey.

2070
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,289
Right now,

2071
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:14,369
- we aren't in a good situation.
- Right.

2072
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:19,770
(The identity of the last Devil)

2073
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:23,479
(Lucifer, Joo Eon Kyu)

2074
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,479
The moment I got the Lucifer card,
I thought, "I'm in trouble."

2075
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:31,050
(Sighing)

2076
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,149
"What should I do?"

2077
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:34,819
I was very worried.

2078
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:37,289
But the members made me think,
"We might be able to win."

2079
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,430
Dong Min gave me advice.

2080
01:27:41,729 --> 01:27:45,060
From now on,
you should never talk alone with me,

2081
01:27:45,699 --> 01:27:46,970
Jin Ho,

2082
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,170
- or Steve.
- Okay.

2083
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:50,970
- That's what I was thinking.
- Because...

2084
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:53,109
we'll be exposed more.

2085
01:27:53,409 --> 01:27:55,479
This round is the last time
we can talk like this.

2086
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,579
When we're exposed...

2087
01:27:57,579 --> 01:27:59,479
and they share that information,

2088
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:03,750
we'll no longer be able to talk like this.
So completely exclude and abandon...

2089
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,050
- the three of us.
- Okay.

2090
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,819
- Okay? Just focus on making your allies.
- Yes.

2091
01:28:06,819 --> 01:28:07,989
- Okay.
- Okay?

2092
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:09,060
Yes.

2093
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:13,890
I was keeping Seong Beom only.

2094
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,560
Actually, he was keeping me.

2095
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,069
You're likely to be the Angel, right?

2096
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,600
It's 100 percent.

2097
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,239
Why don't you judge me then?

2098
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,670
If everyone agrees MJ is the Angel...

2099
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:27,770
We can't waste our chance.

2100
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:31,479
Seong Beom rather should be...
It's 100 percent Seong Beom.

2101
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:34,510
I thought I had to do anything
for the team.

2102
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,350
I have no thoughts...

2103
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:38,579
other than that.

2104
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,890
I'm going...

2105
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:44,159
to reveal who the Deity is.

2106
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,090
Xitsuh is mostly leading them.

2107
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,029
And he almost trusts me 100 percent.

2108
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,130
I know who the Archangel is.

2109
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,800
Okay. Who is it?

2110
01:28:53,229 --> 01:28:54,500
Xitsuh is the Archangel.

2111
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:58,710
But he hasn't told me
who the Deity is yet.

2112
01:28:59,109 --> 01:29:00,210
As we keep talking,

2113
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:02,279
I'm trying to figure out
the identity of each person.

2114
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,680
I'm going to find out.

2115
01:29:05,109 --> 01:29:06,510
Who turned out...

2116
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,550
to be the Devils so far?

2117
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:10,579
I'm the only one who isn't exposed.

2118
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,189
It's fine as long as I'm not caught.
So we...

2119
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:16,359
can't have the third Evil Deed card yet.

2120
01:29:17,789 --> 01:29:19,060
- Not yet.
- Okay.

2121
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:22,800
Make a decision when I say
I know who the Deity is for sure.

2122
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:25,500
I'm going to find out who the Deity is
no matter what.

2123
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,369
You should act like you're the Angel.

2124
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:33,970
- Yes.
- Xitsuh is strongly suspecting me.

2125
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,909
- But I can't act differently now.
- Okay.

2126
01:29:36,909 --> 01:29:40,979
I should keep acting the same way.

2127
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:43,979
Darn it. If I were Lucifer,

2128
01:29:44,649 --> 01:29:46,189
I would've selected Evil Deed cards only.

2129
01:29:47,689 --> 01:29:48,960
(Angel: Xitsuh, Acau, Choi Hye Seon,)

2130
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,359
(MJ Kim, Heo Seong Beom, Kim Min A)

2131
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:51,720
(Devil: Joo Eon Kyu, Jang Dong Min,
Hong Jin Ho,)

2132
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,729
(Steve Yea)

2133
01:29:52,729 --> 01:29:57,159
(Xitsuh: Archangel, Joo Eon Kyu: Lucifer)

2134
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:00,300
Acau, please choose a card...

2135
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,470
you wish to discard.

2136
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,770
(2 Evil Deed cards and 1 Good Deed card)

2137
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,270
I will discard an Evil Deed card.

2138
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:13,850
(Executioner Xitsuh)

2139
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:16,550
Xitsuh, please choose a card...

2140
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:17,550
you wish to discard.

2141
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:20,689
I will discard an Evil Deed card.

2142
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,890
The fourth Representative Acau...

2143
01:30:24,689 --> 01:30:27,789
and Executioner Xitsuh chose...

2144
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:30,100
(Judgment Status)

2145
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,159
a Good Deed card.

2146
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,770
Currently, one Good Deed card...

2147
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,140
and two Evil Deed cards
have been accumulated.

2148
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:39,369
(In Round 4, a Good Deed card
was accumulated for the 1st time.)

2149
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:42,340
- Nice.
- Okay.

2150
01:30:42,579 --> 01:30:43,880
Revenge has begun.

2151
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,649
The fifth Representative candidate,
Kim Min A,

2152
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,680
please enter the voting room
in 30 minutes...

2153
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,819
to choose an Executioner candidate.

2154
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:52,789
Min A can skip anyway.

2155
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:54,489
- And you should be skipped.
- Yes. I'll skip.

2156
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:55,890
- Yes. You should be skipped.
- Okay. I will.

2157
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:57,060
Let's skip Eon Kyu...

2158
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:58,659
and move on to Xitsuh. Number seven.

2159
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:00,630
Executioner, just choose anyone.

2160
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:01,760
Okay.

2161
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,500
- Choose Jin Ho.
- Okay.

2162
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,430
You're crazy if you agree with it.

2163
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:10,869
(Executioner candidate Hong Jin Ho)

2164
01:31:10,869 --> 01:31:12,640
Kim Min A chose Hong Jin Ho...

2165
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:14,569
as an Executioner candidate.

2166
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,239
Thanks for choosing Jin Ho.

2167
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:18,239
It's so funny.

2168
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,850
They can't help but reject it this time.

2169
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:23,479
Jin Ho, thanks for being our card.

2170
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,550
Thank you, everyone.

2171
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:26,920
I'm thankful for being anything.

2172
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,859
Save me, Eon Kyu.

2173
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:33,529
I think it's going well now.

2174
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,489
You can pass me.

2175
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,229
- I got it.
- Okay.

2176
01:31:37,329 --> 01:31:38,729
We should do that.
There's no other choice.

2177
01:31:38,729 --> 01:31:39,800
- Right.
- Because...

2178
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,329
if we follow this strategy...

2179
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:42,970
- We'll win.
- Yes.

2180
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,170
Good.

2181
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:45,369
Let's play safe.

2182
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,770
This is the line of defense.
It's Min A this round.

2183
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:50,140
They're skipped.

2184
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:51,739
Then it's you and me.

2185
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,479
- And they're skipped.
- Yes.

2186
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:56,720
- Then it's Hye Seon and MJ.
- Yes.

2187
01:31:57,979 --> 01:31:59,149
I absolutely reject it.

2188
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,550
(Kim Min A: Rejection)

2189
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,689
(Heo Seong Beom: Rejection)

2190
01:32:01,689 --> 01:32:03,159
(Acau: Rejection, Xitsuh: Rejection)

2191
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:04,890
(Choi Hye Seon: Rejection)

2192
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:06,659
(Hong Jin Ho: Approval)

2193
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:08,229
(Jang Dong Min: Approval,
Steve Yea: Approval)

2194
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,159
(Joo Eon Kyu: Approval)

2195
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,399
I hope Lucifer...

2196
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:16,199
does well.

2197
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:23,779
Eon Kyu.

2198
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:25,340
Everyone thinks you're the Devil.

2199
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:26,510
- Me?
- Yes.

2200
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,880
What did I do to be considered a Devil?

2201
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,649
They think you're very suspicious.

2202
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,250
- I did nothing.
- I asked why.

2203
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,359
They said you were very suspicious.

2204
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,390
Voting is over.

2205
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,930
Kim Min A and Hong Jin Ho...

2206
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,460
weren't elected.

2207
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,399
(Representative, Executioner)

2208
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:48,100
The sixth Representative candidate,
Joo Eon Kyu,

2209
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,670
please enter the voting room...

2210
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,869
to choose an Executioner candidate.

2211
01:32:51,869 --> 01:32:52,869
That's not it.

2212
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,239
Please vote for Jin Ho if you're an Angel.

2213
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,039
- Please vote for Jin Ho.
- I want to become an Executioner.

2214
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:58,909
- Vote for Jin Ho if you're an Angel.
- They ignored me.

2215
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:00,949
- I want to become an Executioner.
- Thank you, everyone. I'll do my best.

2216
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:03,220
You should vote for Jin Ho.

2217
01:33:13,029 --> 01:33:15,930
Joo Eon Kyu,
please choose an Executioner candidate.

2218
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:20,329
The sixth Representative candidate,
Joo Eon Kyu...

2219
01:33:20,729 --> 01:33:21,930
chose...

2220
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:24,770
Acau as an Executioner candidate.

2221
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:32,409
I definitely said,
"Vote for Jin Ho if you're an Angel."

2222
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:35,720
"Vote for Jin Ho if you're an Angel."

2223
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,050
But he was like, "What?"

2224
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:40,050
He looked confused when entering
the voting room. Then he suddenly chose...

2225
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,789
Acau.

2226
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,260
I was like, "He's crazy."

2227
01:33:44,859 --> 01:33:47,060
"He's trolling so hard."

2228
01:33:49,699 --> 01:33:50,899
I reject it.

2229
01:33:50,899 --> 01:33:52,329
Why Acau?

2230
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:53,630
Why did you choose me?

2231
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,399
Why should I vote for Jin Ho?

2232
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,300
It's to skip him.

2233
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:02,680
The Angels can skip him for sure.

2234
01:34:03,409 --> 01:34:05,210
We agreed to vote for Jin Ho...

2235
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:06,380
as we could reject it.

2236
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,279
"Vote for Jin Ho if you're an Angel."
Even if we said so,

2237
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:09,680
he suddenly chose Acau.

2238
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,180
So I thought
he was 100 percent suspicious.

2239
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:13,720
"Vote for Jin Ho if you're an Angel."

2240
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,489
But Jin Ho is a Devil.

2241
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,789
And Devils should choose a Devil...

2242
01:34:17,789 --> 01:34:18,859
as a Representative.

2243
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:20,789
So I wasn't sure
if they were sounding me out or not.

2244
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:22,800
I thought they were teasing me.

2245
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,329
- Reject it.
- Reject it if you're an Angel.

2246
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:25,329
Reject it.

2247
01:34:25,899 --> 01:34:26,970
You're not an Angel.

2248
01:34:27,869 --> 01:34:30,000
Jin Ho, why don't you go and approve it?

2249
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,409
Eon Kyu is Lucifer,

2250
01:34:33,409 --> 01:34:35,939
so he could act like an Angel
until the end...

2251
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:38,439
because the Deity wouldn't know.

2252
01:34:38,909 --> 01:34:40,810
So he should've listened to the Angels...

2253
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,210
and cooperated.

2254
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:43,579
The Angels said,

2255
01:34:43,579 --> 01:34:46,390
"You should choose this person
as an Executioner."

2256
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,989
And he tried to play smart.

2257
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,789
But it was the biggest mistake...

2258
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:53,189
for us Devils.

2259
01:34:54,029 --> 01:34:55,029
I said,

2260
01:34:55,029 --> 01:34:56,399
"Please vote for Jin Ho
if you're an Angel."

2261
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,659
And he chose Acau.

2262
01:34:57,829 --> 01:34:58,829
- It's strange.
- So...

2263
01:34:58,829 --> 01:35:00,270
it made us suspect him.

2264
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:01,430
He's one of the Devils.

2265
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,539
(Eon Kyu's suspicious behavior
made them think he's a Devil.)

2266
01:35:02,539 --> 01:35:03,899
Or he wanted to make us...

2267
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:05,939
approve it no matter what.

2268
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:09,579
Is Eon Kyu not an Angel?

2269
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:11,010
That's impossible.

2270
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:14,880
(Going crazy)

2271
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:19,720
Even though he's Lucifer,

2272
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:22,760
the only person...

2273
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:26,060
whose identity can't be revealed
until the end,

2274
01:35:26,529 --> 01:35:28,329
he basically declared...

2275
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,029
that he was a Devil.

2276
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:35,699
That punk. I told him to choose Jin Ho.

2277
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,140
I told him to choose Jin Ho. Darn it.

2278
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,869
There's no one to believe in the world.

2279
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:44,409
(Heo Seong Beom: Rejection)

2280
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,250
(Xitsuh: Rejection)

2281
01:35:46,579 --> 01:35:47,579
I reject it.

2282
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:49,180
I reject it.

2283
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:50,579
(Acau: Rejection)

2284
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:51,579
(Kim Min A: Rejection)

2285
01:35:51,949 --> 01:35:55,220
Joo Eon Kyu and Acau weren't elected.

2286
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:56,560
(Representative, Executioner)

2287
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,890
Why did you not vote for Jin Ho?

2288
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:01,359
What? Because I didn't know
what was going on.

2289
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:03,399
I told you to vote for Jin Ho.

2290
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:05,529
I said you shouldn't do anything
that will make them suspect you.

2291
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:07,970
Gosh, I was stupid.

2292
01:36:09,369 --> 01:36:11,340
- You guys shouldn't approach me now.
- Okay.

2293
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:18,510
The only thing we can do now
is to find out who the Deity is.

2294
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,350
That punk.

2295
01:36:20,579 --> 01:36:21,649
Don't approach me from now on.

2296
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:26,050
They identified me as the Evil Spirit.

2297
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:27,750
I had to receive the Immunity Pass...

2298
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,189
to avoid the Deathmatch.

2299
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:31,460
And Eon Kyu basically confessed
that he was a Devil.

2300
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,659
I couldn't understand.

2301
01:36:33,659 --> 01:36:35,789
His identity won't be revealed
because he's Lucifer.

2302
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:37,960
But he confessed he was a Devil.

2303
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,970
I couldn't understand at all.

2304
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,369
I was at a disadvantage after that.

2305
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:43,800
(Steve Yea must have a Deathmatch
if the Devils lose.)

2306
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,869
The things I hoped wouldn't happen...

2307
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:49,680
happened.

2308
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,739
In one word,

2309
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:52,680
it's messed up.

2310
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:55,550
Devils, please stay away from me.

2311
01:36:56,279 --> 01:36:57,420
Don't approach me.

2312
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:01,850
In a situation like this,

2313
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:05,289
I can show...

2314
01:37:05,289 --> 01:37:06,789
my true worth.

2315
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:09,560
The seventh Representative candidate,
Xitsuh...

2316
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,329
has chosen Choi Hye Seon...

2317
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,369
as an Executioner candidate.

2318
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:16,000
(Representative: Xitsuh,
Executioner: Choi Hye Seon)

2319
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,340
Please vote from now on.

2320
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,340
Devil.

2321
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,979
Why do we have to choose Jin Ho?

2322
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:25,609
I've known Eon Kyu...

2323
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:26,649
for a while,

2324
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:28,250
but I don't know what he's thinking.

2325
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,520
(He cut ties with him
even though he's also a Devil.)

2326
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,250
- What?
- It's nothing.

2327
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:32,720
It's because I don't know well.

2328
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:35,390
Gosh, I can't play Mafia.

2329
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,630
(Devil Dong Min is working hard
by himself.)

2330
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:41,630
Hey.

2331
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:45,729
Xitsuh.

2332
01:37:45,729 --> 01:37:47,300
Dong Min. Let's talk.

2333
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:49,199
Is there anyone here?

2334
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:50,800
Acau and Hye Seon.

2335
01:37:51,939 --> 01:37:53,510
Among the seven people,

2336
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:56,340
there's a spy, a Devil.

2337
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,239
And we haven't found out...

2338
01:37:58,239 --> 01:37:59,479
who it is yet.

2339
01:37:59,649 --> 01:38:01,680
- You trust Hye Seon 100 percent.
- Yes.

2340
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,750
I think she's the riskiest.

2341
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:06,520
- Do you think it's risky?
- Yes.

2342
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,489
Does Hye Seon know who the Devils are?

2343
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,090
- She does.
- She does?

2344
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:12,119
- So...
- Does she know?

2345
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:13,689
- About Steve and Jin Ho?
- Yes.

2346
01:38:13,689 --> 01:38:14,729
Of course, she knows.

2347
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,399
- Hye Seon told MJ...
- Yes?

2348
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:19,970
that Steve wasn't the Devil.

2349
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:21,430
- When?
- Just now.

2350
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:25,739
- Gosh, I want to tear everything.
- That's why...

2351
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:28,770
That's why I asked you about Hye Seon.

2352
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:30,380
Gosh. Give me a moment.

2353
01:38:30,579 --> 01:38:31,680
- Ask MJ.
- I'll bring her.

2354
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:40,890
Tell me quickly.

2355
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:43,289
The key was to find out...

2356
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:45,189
who the Deity was among them.

2357
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,430
And I was sure Xitsuh was the Archangel.

2358
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:50,560
So I kept trying...

2359
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,869
to make him suspect others.

2360
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,569
I tested him.

2361
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:56,239
Are you sure?

2362
01:38:56,399 --> 01:38:57,840
Did Hye Seon tell you...

2363
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,369
that Steve wasn't a Devil just now?

2364
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:01,069
She said, "Why are you suspecting Steve?"

2365
01:39:01,609 --> 01:39:04,439
That's how she feels people out. Wait.

2366
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,510
- That's what she said?
- Yes.

2367
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:07,750
She asked why you were suspecting him.

2368
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:08,909
- She didn't say he wasn't a Devil.
- No.

2369
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:10,119
She was trying to feel her out.

2370
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:11,979
- It doesn't sound like it.
- I agree.

2371
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:13,449
- She knows I'm an Angel.
- Because MJ is so suspicious.

2372
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:15,520
You chose Jin Ho.

2373
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,720
She was feeling her out
because she suspected her.

2374
01:39:17,319 --> 01:39:18,890
She was feeling her out
because she thought MJ might be a Devil?

2375
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:22,229
The voting will be closed in ten minutes.

2376
01:39:23,329 --> 01:39:24,359
Who are the Representative
and the Executioner candidates right now?

2377
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,029
- Xitsuh and Hye Seon.
- Okay.

2378
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:29,229
Please stack Good Deed cards.

2379
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:34,409
I approve it.

2380
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:36,739
(Kim Min A: Approval)

2381
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:38,880
(Choi Hye Seon: Approval)

2382
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,479
(Heo Seong Beom: Approval)

2383
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:42,550
(Xitsuh: Approval)

2384
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,550
(Jang Dong Min: Approval)

2385
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:46,119
I approve it.

2386
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:47,119
(MJ Kim: Approval)

2387
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:48,689
The voting is over.

2388
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,359
The seventh Representative candidate,

2389
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:52,390
Xitsuh,

2390
01:39:53,289 --> 01:39:55,159
and the Executioner candidate,
Choi Hye Seon,

2391
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:56,960
have been elected.

2392
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,829
Thank you.

2393
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:02,199
(Representative Xitsuh
is going to choose a card.)

2394
01:40:02,199 --> 01:40:04,100
I hope they're not all Evil Deed cards.

2395
01:40:09,409 --> 01:40:10,409
Thank you.

2396
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,479
Thank you.
I'll discard the Evil Deed card.

2397
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:13,479
I'll be good.

2398
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,350
I'll discard the Evil Deed card.

2399
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,880
Okay. There's 1 Good Deed card
and 1 Evil Deed card.

2400
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:19,649
Were there 2 Evil Deed cards
and 1 Good Deed card?

2401
01:40:19,649 --> 01:40:20,949
We got 2 Evil Deed cards
and 1 Good Deed card.

2402
01:40:20,949 --> 01:40:22,250
- Oh, yes.
- There were two Evil Deed cards?

2403
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:24,260
- I discarded the Evil Deed card.
- Okay.

2404
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,460
I will discard this.

2405
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:28,229
I will choose the Good Deed card.

2406
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:31,159
The seventh Representative, Xitsuh,

2407
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:35,069
and the Executioner, Choi Hye Seon,
have chosen...

2408
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:37,800
a Good Deed card.

2409
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,939
(Judgment Status)

2410
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:41,170
Currently, two Good Deed cards...

2411
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:43,779
and two Evil Deed cards
have been accumulated.

2412
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:46,210
It's a tie. My gosh.

2413
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,880
The eighth Representative candidate,
Jang Dong Min,

2414
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:51,949
please enter the voting room
in 30 minutes...

2415
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:54,550
to choose an Executive candidate.

2416
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,090
I'll choose Xitsuh.

2417
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:02,489
The Representative candidate,
Jang Dong Min,

2418
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:05,300
has chosen Xitsuh
as an Executive candidate.

2419
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:08,069
Please vote from now on.

2420
01:41:08,869 --> 01:41:09,869
Let's go.

2421
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,100
I'll approve it.

2422
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,270
(The Angels proceed to vote
without hesitation.)

2423
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:14,109
Let's hurry up.

2424
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:16,479
I approve it.

2425
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,710
I approve it.

2426
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:20,710
- Eon Kyu.
- Yes?

2427
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,550
Let's just smoke.

2428
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:23,819
I'm an Angel.

2429
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:28,449
Things will not be going well for us,

2430
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:29,989
but we should keep trying to meddle in...

2431
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:31,720
and find out who the Deity is.

2432
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,529
It'll be Hye Seon, Xitsuh, or Acau anyway.

2433
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:36,560
That's for sure. It's 1 of the 3.

2434
01:41:36,829 --> 01:41:39,500
I think Hye Seon
is either the Deity or Archangel.

2435
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,770
I think Acau is the Deity.

2436
01:41:42,069 --> 01:41:43,069
Hey.

2437
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:47,069
You should gather with Steve...

2438
01:41:47,069 --> 01:41:48,439
and whisper...

2439
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:51,079
as if you were guessing who the Deity was
to make them waver.

2440
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:53,010
I'll get more information then.

2441
01:41:53,949 --> 01:41:55,609
You shouldn't let them feel at ease.

2442
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,380
"What?
I think they figured something out."

2443
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,890
"I think they noticed it."
You should make them think like this.

2444
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:01,819
- We'll act like that.
- Yes.

2445
01:42:01,819 --> 01:42:02,890
Yes.

2446
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:05,220
And... Okay.

2447
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,760
Gosh! Darn it.

2448
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,630
- Steve...
- The voting is over.

2449
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,560
The eighth Representative candidate,
Jang Dong Min,

2450
01:42:12,869 --> 01:42:15,930
and the Executioner candidate, Xitsuh,
have been elected.

2451
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:17,470
- Xitsuh.
- Yes, Dong Min.

2452
01:42:17,939 --> 01:42:19,970
- Let's pray.
- Will it work?

2453
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,840
- Let's pray. I'm serious.
- Will it work?

2454
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:24,439
Please give us a Good Deed card.

2455
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:26,010
Please.

2456
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:27,949
- Dong Min.
- Please.

2457
01:42:27,949 --> 01:42:29,250
Please give us a Good Deed card.
I'll be good.

2458
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:30,350
We'll be good.

2459
01:42:30,619 --> 01:42:32,220
- See you later.
- Yes. See you.

2460
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:36,220
The chance of getting
three Evil Deed cards is quite high.

2461
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:38,390
No. But quite a lot
of Good Deed cards are left.

2462
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:39,960
We'll get an Evil Deed card at least once.

2463
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:44,600
Please.

2464
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,199
Please give me a Good Deed card.

2465
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:50,939
I'll be good. Please.

2466
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:53,869
Please give me a Good Deed card.
I'll be good.

2467
01:43:05,319 --> 01:43:06,319
Gosh.

2468
01:43:06,619 --> 01:43:07,649
No way.

2469
01:43:08,819 --> 01:43:09,890
My goodness.

2470
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:11,390
Hold on. No way.

2471
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,489
There were three Evil Deed cards, right?

2472
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:14,859
Don't suspect me and go.

2473
01:43:14,859 --> 01:43:15,960
Okay. So there were
three Evil Deed cards, right?

2474
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,699
- This is annoying.
- I knew it.

2475
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,539
(Executioner Xitsuh
came to check the cards later.)

2476
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:26,409
My gosh. This is annoying.

2477
01:43:29,539 --> 01:43:30,939
So it'll be an Evil Deed card this time.

2478
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:32,279
It doesn't matter.

2479
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:33,710
Because we'll get more information
about a Devil.

2480
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,149
Why do you think
it'll be an Evil Deed card for sure?

2481
01:43:35,149 --> 01:43:36,279
Because he got three Evil Deed cards.

2482
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,020
Yes. It's nice to know more about Devils.

2483
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:42,489
Darn it. I knew it.

2484
01:43:42,489 --> 01:43:43,689
I knew it too.

2485
01:43:43,819 --> 01:43:44,819
I told you.

2486
01:43:54,369 --> 01:43:55,369
Was it a Good Deed card?

2487
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:57,039
It was a Good Deed card.

2488
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:58,399
- Oh, yes!
- You startled me.

2489
01:43:58,399 --> 01:43:59,970
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

2490
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:03,340
(In the voting room earlier)

2491
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,979
I'll be good.
Please give me a Good Deed card.

2492
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:10,619
(Devil Dong Min
can still hide his identity.)

2493
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:14,189
Dong Min, please choose a card
you wish to discard.

2494
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,689
I should throw away...

2495
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:18,520
all the Evil Deed cards.

2496
01:44:18,689 --> 01:44:20,289
You must not do bad things.

2497
01:44:20,989 --> 01:44:22,390
Please choose a card you wish to discard.

2498
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:23,800
This is so annoying.

2499
01:44:26,869 --> 01:44:28,430
I'll discard an Evil Deed card.

2500
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,340
Let me tell you now.

2501
01:44:30,539 --> 01:44:33,109
Whether Seong Beom is an Angel or a Devil,

2502
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:34,109
I'm going to put off the plan,

2503
01:44:34,109 --> 01:44:35,609
so don't take anyone out.

2504
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:37,079
Don't try too hard.

2505
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:41,279
Currently, three Good Deed cards...

2506
01:44:41,409 --> 01:44:43,750
and two Evil Deed cards
have been accumulated.

2507
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,350
(Judgment Status)

2508
01:44:45,649 --> 01:44:48,689
So you think...

2509
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,159
they don't know anything...

2510
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,159
to figure out who the Deity is, right?

2511
01:44:53,489 --> 01:44:56,699
If they find any clue,

2512
01:44:56,699 --> 01:44:57,800
we should confuse them.

2513
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,100
- Hold on, Dong Min.
- Then you...

2514
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:00,630
Let's test it.

2515
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,670
Tell me who you think might be the Deity.

2516
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,399
I'm not going to say anything.

2517
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:07,310
- What? Do you want me to tell you?
- Guess who the Deity is.

2518
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:08,869
I'm not going to answer.

2519
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:11,140
You're going to test me
if I'm hiding it well.

2520
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,140
You guess.

2521
01:45:13,579 --> 01:45:15,609
I was like, "What's going on?"

2522
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,949
I think...

2523
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:22,119
Gosh, this is really hard.

2524
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:24,060
I thought it was Hye Seon at first.

2525
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:26,289
Because I heard
she had said something strange.

2526
01:45:28,529 --> 01:45:29,729
Okay.

2527
01:45:29,729 --> 01:45:30,729
(Okay. Let's stop here.)

2528
01:45:30,729 --> 01:45:31,729
What was that?

2529
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:33,399
I can't tell you anything.

2530
01:45:33,399 --> 01:45:35,369
- I know.
- I was testing...

2531
01:45:35,369 --> 01:45:37,199
- if I was hiding it well.
- Okay.

2532
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:40,739
So you tried not to give any hint...

2533
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:42,310
to anyone, right?

2534
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:43,539
- Yes.
- Okay.

2535
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,039
- Okay.
- If it's hard for you to guess,

2536
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,810
- Yes. Okay.
- it'll be even harder for them.

2537
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:51,020
It's one of the biggest roles
the Archangel has.

2538
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,850
Even if you know something, you
should pretend you don't until the end.

2539
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:54,420
It depends on
how good you are at hiding it.

2540
01:45:54,989 --> 01:45:56,760
The fewer people know about it,
the better.

2541
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,090
I should be the only one who knows.

2542
01:45:58,689 --> 01:46:00,630
No matter how much I trusted someone,

2543
01:46:00,859 --> 01:46:02,930
I didn't tell anyone.

2544
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,960
The ninth Representative candidate...

2545
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:08,100
is Steve Yea.

2546
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:10,899
- Hey, who should I choose?
- Choose Jin Ho.

2547
01:46:10,899 --> 01:46:12,100
- Who should I choose?
- Me.

2548
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,640
Vote for Jin Ho.

2549
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:15,310
Someone raised her hand to volunteer.

2550
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:16,340
Choose her then.

2551
01:46:16,779 --> 01:46:17,880
Please choose Hye Seon.

2552
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,409
We can't skip four times anyway.

2553
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:22,750
We can't skip four times anyway.
Or Evil Deed cards won't be stacked.

2554
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:26,850
For Round Ten, we have Seong Beom.

2555
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:29,420
If you're suspecting me, you can skip me.

2556
01:46:29,789 --> 01:46:31,260
We're going to skip you no matter what.
What are you talking about?

2557
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,789
- Okay.
- They'll skip me too.

2558
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:34,689
- Okay. So that's how it is for us.
- Yes.

2559
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:36,760
- We should just vote.
- Okay.

2560
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,600
(They're guilty
of suspecting Archangel Xitsuh.)

2561
01:46:42,069 --> 01:46:44,340
The ninth Representative candidate,
Steve Yea,

2562
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:47,710
has chosen Choi Hye Seon
as an Executioner candidate.

2563
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,409
(Representative: Steve Yea,
Executioner: Choi Hye Seon)

2564
01:46:50,109 --> 01:46:51,109
Let's go and reject it.

2565
01:46:54,409 --> 01:46:55,409
I reject it.

2566
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:57,420
I reject it.

2567
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:58,520
I reject it.

2568
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,449
(Kim Min A: Rejection)

2569
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:01,989
Let's keep it this way...

2570
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,789
if you're an Angel.

2571
01:47:04,619 --> 01:47:06,319
I reject it.

2572
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,430
(Acau: Rejection)

2573
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:08,590
(Heo Seong Beom: Rejection)

2574
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:10,460
(Jang Dong Min: Rejection)

2575
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:12,460
Where are those guys?

2576
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:14,770
They don't have to participate.

2577
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,199
Please vote.

2578
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:20,909
We talked with Seong Beom.

2579
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:23,310
Acau is the Deity.

2580
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,439
Xitsuh is the Archangel.

2581
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:27,510
That's Seong Beom's prediction, right?

2582
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:28,779
He said so based on his predictions,
didn't he?

2583
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:31,119
That's his prediction.

2584
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:32,819
Let me vote.

2585
01:47:32,819 --> 01:47:34,189
We can talk after voting.

2586
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:35,189
Okay.

2587
01:47:36,489 --> 01:47:37,920
Are all the Devils here?

2588
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:39,760
We were just talking.

2589
01:47:40,729 --> 01:47:42,289
(Steve Yea: Approval)

2590
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,500
(Joo Eon Kyu: Approval)

2591
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,300
(Hong Jin Ho: Approval)

2592
01:47:46,329 --> 01:47:49,029
They started feeling nervous...

2593
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,539
and discussing.

2594
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:54,140
They will analyze the patterns so far.

2595
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,680
Gosh, they're good actors.

2596
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:59,609
Be careful until the end.

2597
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:03,380
Skip three people, including Jin Ho.

2598
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,050
Don't skip Hye Seon and MJ.

2599
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:07,449
If it's not over by then...

2600
01:48:07,449 --> 01:48:08,550
How can it not end?

2601
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:10,020
It won't end
if they're all Evil Deed cards.

2602
01:48:10,619 --> 01:48:12,659
Skip Acau, Min A,

2603
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:14,229
and Eon Kyu. Then it's me again.

2604
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:15,229
(Team Angel's plan
for selecting the Representative)

2605
01:48:15,229 --> 01:48:16,229
(Choi Hye Seon, MJ Kim, and Xitsuh)

2606
01:48:16,229 --> 01:48:17,529
- We'll win then.
- Okay?

2607
01:48:17,529 --> 01:48:18,529
Why do we skip Acau?

2608
01:48:18,729 --> 01:48:19,829
It's to exclude everything.

2609
01:48:20,029 --> 01:48:21,170
Every possibility.

2610
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:23,569
The voting is over.

2611
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:26,840
The ninth Representative candidate,
Steve Yea,

2612
01:48:27,539 --> 01:48:29,369
and the Executioner candidate,
Choi Hye Seon,

2613
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:31,039
weren't elected.

2614
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:33,510
Who should I choose?

2615
01:48:34,409 --> 01:48:35,810
Just choose Jin Ho.

2616
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:36,880
Yes. Bother him.

2617
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:40,050
(They're going to bother the Devil.)

2618
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,250
The tenth Representative candidate,
Heo Seong Beom...

2619
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:45,460
has chosen Hong Jin Ho
as an Executioner candidate.

2620
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:46,829
(Representative: Heo Seong Bom,
Executioner: Hong Jin Ho)

2621
01:48:49,329 --> 01:48:51,560
(The Devils are reasoning.)

2622
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,600
Okay. Now,

2623
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:55,229
we don't have to think...

2624
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:58,100
unless it's important information...

2625
01:48:58,739 --> 01:48:59,970
with a level of certainty.

2626
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:01,909
- We don't have to think.
- We don't have to.

2627
01:49:02,539 --> 01:49:04,239
- So what I'm saying is...
- Yes.

2628
01:49:06,539 --> 01:49:07,579
Someone is standing over there.

2629
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:15,649
Oh, my gosh.

2630
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:16,689
Look at you.

2631
01:49:16,689 --> 01:49:18,319
You must be crazy. Hey.

2632
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:19,489
I was going to open the door.

2633
01:49:19,489 --> 01:49:21,090
This punk.

2634
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,460
- What were you doing?
- Excuse me.

2635
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,060
- Doing what?
- What were you doing?

2636
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,560
- What do you mean?
- What?

2637
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,569
- Why do you ask?
- I heard nothing, though.

2638
01:49:27,569 --> 01:49:29,069
- What?
- I heard nothing.

2639
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:30,470
- I mean...
- I was going to open the door...

2640
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:31,640
because I heard nothing.
And you came out right then.

2641
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:33,640
We were talking for a moment.

2642
01:49:34,369 --> 01:49:36,640
I had to guess who the Devils were.

2643
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:39,010
To get at least one clue,

2644
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:41,380
I needed to do all that I could.

2645
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:46,380
Nice job. Goodness.

2646
01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:49,449
That itself indicates he's not a Deity.

2647
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,760
What?

2648
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,819
That's why he has such behaviors.

2649
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:56,489
(Acau is an ordinary Angel?)

2650
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,069
I might get goosebumps to know one.

2651
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:02,130
I know.

2652
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:03,970
I can't wait to see the result.

2653
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:07,510
Once a Devil is revealed,
I'm going to hit them real hard.

2654
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:09,539
(Feeling a sting)

2655
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:10,609
I mean it.

2656
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:13,210
- That person...
- Seriously.

2657
01:50:15,149 --> 01:50:16,180
Darn it.

2658
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,850
It doesn't feel like living.

2659
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:22,119
(The voting begins for another rejection.)

2660
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,189

and the Executioner candidate,
Hong Jin Ho,

2672

have not been elected.

(Representative, Executioner)

2674

The 11th Representative candidate,
Hong Jin Ho,

2675
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:56,149
has nominated Joo Eon Kyu
as the Executioner candidate.

2676
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,159
- Eon Kyu?
- Oh, come on!

2677
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:00,760
(A Devil was forced to reveal his identity
by another Devil.)

2678

Eon Kyu!

2679

Jin Ho!

2680
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:04,130
Let's show something now.

2681
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:05,930
Is this the beginning?

2682
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:07,500
We're going to show you what we can do!

2683
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,770
- We'll work hard.
- Support us!

2684
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:11,439
- What will you show?
- Support our misdeeds.

2685
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:13,340
They aren't giving up on hope
until the end.

2686
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,010
- Let's give them a hand.
- Vote for us.

2687

- Please vote.
- Vote for us, guys.

2688

We'll work hard.

2689
01:51:19,479 --> 01:51:20,979
I'll vote against you.

2690

- Nice.
- They deserve votes.

2691

(Jang Dong Min: Rejection)

The 11th Representative candidate,
Hong Jin Ho,

and the Executioner candidate,
Joo Eon Kyu,

2704
01:51:47,069 --> 01:51:48,539
have not been elected.

2705
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:50,979
I'm so confused right now.

2706
01:51:51,779 --> 01:51:54,079
Either Seong Beom or Acau
is a Devil for sure.

2707
01:51:54,279 --> 01:51:56,210
Acau doesn't try to convince others.

2708
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:59,180
- At one point, he let go like an Angel.
- He let go.

2709
01:51:59,649 --> 01:52:01,520
Seong Beom is the only one
who's still making moves.

2710
01:52:02,119 --> 01:52:05,689
He tried to persuade MJ until the end.

2711
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,189
It's driving me even crazier.

2712
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:09,130
(Xitsuh saw the two of them
come out of the pantry.)

2713
01:52:09,329 --> 01:52:10,859
What is it this time? Come here.

2714
01:52:10,859 --> 01:52:11,930
I must win.

2715
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,359
What did Seong Beom say?

2716
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:14,529
What? Seong Beom?

2717
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:17,970
Dong Min, Xitsuh,

2718
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:19,939
Hye Seon, and Acau.

2719
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:22,310
He asked why I was so sure
about these four.

2720
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:24,380
Gosh, he's shaking us until the end.

2721
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:26,380
He's a Devil.

2722
01:52:26,979 --> 01:52:28,279
Acau is...

2723
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:31,079
suspecting me and MJ.

2724
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:37,619
Well, that makes sense.

2725
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,590
Archangel Xitsuh...

2726
01:52:40,729 --> 01:52:42,789
was certain he wasn't a Devil.

2727
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,029
I saw him so sure...

2728
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,569
and figured he couldn't be persuaded.

2729
01:52:47,829 --> 01:52:49,770
I decided to let him have faith
to some degree...

2730
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:51,800
because I could be wrong too.

2731
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:55,409
I don't think I can play
this kind of game again.

2732
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:58,979
- All my trust broke.
- Right.

2733
01:53:00,109 --> 01:53:01,810
I was so glad that I drew an Angel...

2734
01:53:01,810 --> 01:53:03,350
- because I didn't have to tell lies.
- Me too.

2735
01:53:04,649 --> 01:53:07,220
But the bad thing is...

2736
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:09,520
that I can't believe what anyone says.

2737
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,960
- It's hard.
- Right.

2738
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,489
It's so ambiguous.

2739
01:53:13,489 --> 01:53:15,989
It's so ambiguous
in the sense that Angels...

2740
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:17,500
- Right.
- can't trust each other.

2741
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,960
- Devils trust each other tightly.
- Yes.

2742
01:53:21,569 --> 01:53:24,699
The 12th Representative candidate,
Choi Hye Seon,

2743
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:26,970
please nominate an Executioner candidate.

2744
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:34,210
Hye Seon,
please nominate an Executioner candidate.

2745
01:53:36,649 --> 01:53:38,920
I choose to nominate Jang Dong Min.

2746
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:42,649
(The Executioner candidate
is Jang Dong Min.)

2747
01:53:42,989 --> 01:53:44,390
I have a good plan.

2748
01:53:44,619 --> 01:53:45,659
Come here.

2749
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,930
In any case... Look.

2750
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:51,460
When Hye Seon is a candidate...

2751
01:53:52,229 --> 01:53:53,699
Even if she's a Devil,

2752
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,199
just pick a Good Deed card.

2753
01:53:56,529 --> 01:53:58,569
There are no chances
to turn the tables anyway,

2754
01:53:58,569 --> 01:53:59,640
so go for a Good Deed card,
even if you're a Devil?

2755
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,140
Even if you turn out to be a Devil,

2756
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:02,909
- I won't vote to eliminate you?
- That's right.

2757
01:54:02,909 --> 01:54:04,140
- I got it.
- Do you understand?

2758
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:05,880
It's a completely supplementary plan.

2759
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:09,550
I called Xitsuh...

2760
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:14,050
and said Hye Seon was suspicious
although we had a way.

2761
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:17,920
I told him to say,
"Even if you're a Devil,"

2762
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:21,760
"go for the Evil Deed,
not for the Good Deed."

2763
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:24,960
"Then even if you turn out to be a Devil,"

2764
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:29,170
"my team won't point you out."

2765
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:32,670
And he said it was a good idea.

2766
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:35,569
I believe that you're an Angel,

2767
01:54:36,109 --> 01:54:38,609
but everyone's suspecting each other,
okay?

2768
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:41,609
So Dong Min suggested a deal with you.

2769
01:54:41,609 --> 01:54:43,579
Even if you're a Devil,

2770
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:46,119
go for the Good Deed card.

2771
01:54:46,119 --> 01:54:48,189
Then we'll never point you out...

2772
01:54:48,189 --> 01:54:49,989
even if you're revealed to be a Devil.

2773
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:52,359
- You know, the other team...
- I see.

2774
01:54:52,359 --> 01:54:53,520
- can choose a person.
- Right.

2775
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,430
It doesn't matter. Okay.

2776
01:54:56,659 --> 01:54:58,829
I eavesdropped on him to check
in which tone of voice...

2777
01:54:58,829 --> 01:55:00,229
he spoke to Hye Seon.

2778
01:55:01,329 --> 01:55:03,500
The 12th Representative, Choi Hye Seon,

2779
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:05,369
and the Executioner, Jang Dong Min,

2780
01:55:05,569 --> 01:55:09,039
please enter the voting room
and choose which card to abandon.

2781
01:55:16,979 --> 01:55:18,880
This is too cruel.

2782
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,119
Gosh.

2783
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:23,050
What is this?

2784
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:30,930
(Evil, Evil, Evil)

2785
01:55:31,329 --> 01:55:33,770
Please choose 1 of the 3 cards.

2786
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:35,630
This is too cruel.

2787
01:55:35,829 --> 01:55:38,399
It was just too cruel.
I couldn't believe it.

2788
01:55:38,869 --> 01:55:40,369
I knew I'd be suspected...

2789
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:43,109
when I left the room.

2790
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:45,979
What is this?

2791
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,090
- That's not it.
- What is this?

2792
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,449
I guess all three cards are Evil.

2793
01:55:56,119 --> 01:55:57,819
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- Gosh.

2794
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:00,960
This is too cruel.

2795
01:56:01,659 --> 01:56:04,829
(Eliminating 1 of 3 Evil Deed cards)

2796
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:08,970
- All three were Evil.
- Really?

2797
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:10,199
- Yes.
- For real?

2798
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:11,800
For real.

2799
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:13,170
Goodness.

2800
01:56:17,079 --> 01:56:18,079
Darn it.

2801
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:20,850
Darn it.

2802
01:56:21,149 --> 01:56:23,109
(Evil, Evil)

2803
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:29,850
(He needs to reveal his identity himself.)

2804
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:30,960
Dong Min,

2805
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:33,489
please choose 1 of the 2 cards to abandon.

2806
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:35,189
Come on.

2807
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:37,760
Evil Deed.

2808
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,130
(Jang Dong Min chooses Evil.)

2809
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:44,600
Take a seat.

2810
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:49,670
It was a purposeful fluke to give you one.

2811
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,979
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

2812
01:56:53,239 --> 01:56:55,750
The 12th Representative, Choi Hye Seon,

2813
01:56:56,609 --> 01:56:58,979
and the Executioner, Jang Dong Min,

2814
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:01,119
have selected...

2815
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:04,289
(Judgment Status)

2816
01:57:04,289 --> 01:57:06,020
an Evil Deed card.

2817
01:57:06,289 --> 01:57:09,930
Currently, 3 Good Deed cards
and 3 Evil Deed cards...

2818
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:11,159
have been accumulated.

2819
01:57:12,699 --> 01:57:15,300
Now that three Evil Deed cards
have been accumulated,

2820
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:16,899
one Devil...

2821
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:20,140
will be revealed to the Deity.

2822
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:27,380
(The players enter in turn...)

2823
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:31,319
(to reveal a Devil to the Deity.)

2824
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:34,989
I've come this far...

2825
01:57:35,319 --> 01:57:38,789
through ups and down.

2826
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:43,560
Goodness.

2827
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:46,130
- Gosh.
- Dong Min.

2828
01:57:46,529 --> 01:57:48,130
Wait five seconds.

2829
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:58,479
The third Devil has been revealed
to the Deity.

2830
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:02,380
(The third Devil has been revealed.)

2831
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:06,149
(One of them...)

2832
01:58:06,149 --> 01:58:13,020
(One of them...)

2833
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:16,789
(is aware of Dong Min's identity.)

2834
01:58:16,789 --> 01:58:19,430
The 13th Representative candidate, MJ Kim,

2835
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:22,899
has nominated Xitsuh
as an Executioner candidate.

2836
01:58:22,899 --> 01:58:25,170
(Representative: MJ Kim,
Executioner: Xitsuh)

2837
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:28,140
The voting will begin now.

2838
01:58:28,569 --> 01:58:31,109
(Xitsuh moves to meet the Deity
in secret.)

2839
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:40,949
I finally did all that I needed to do.

2840
01:58:42,289 --> 01:58:45,390
I did all that I could do, and there...

2841
01:58:45,789 --> 01:58:48,960
I was curious about
who the last Devil would be.

2842
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:50,460
I wanted to see it too.

2843
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:54,600
Who?

2844
01:58:56,199 --> 01:58:57,970
What? Just come and say it out loud.

2845
01:58:58,140 --> 01:58:59,239
Dong Min is a Devil.

2846
01:58:59,869 --> 01:59:01,010
Dong Min?

2847
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:02,270
Dong Min is a Devil.

2848
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:13,319
What is going on?

2849
01:59:16,489 --> 01:59:19,289
It's because he's a Devil.
Can't you figure it out?

2850
01:59:23,289 --> 01:59:24,460
- I'm Archangel.
- What?

2851
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:25,859
- I'm Archangel.
- I see.

2852
01:59:25,859 --> 01:59:27,899
In Round One, the Deity lied to me.

2853
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:34,010
You can trust me and Dong Min.

2854
01:59:34,439 --> 01:59:35,510
Why?

2855
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:36,670
You can trust Dong Min too.

2856
01:59:38,609 --> 01:59:40,210
It was horrible.

2857
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:45,279
What...

2858
01:59:52,789 --> 01:59:56,960
I had my faith in Dong Min until the end.

2859
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:59,630
I thought he was an Angel...

2860
02:00:00,529 --> 02:00:03,770
because too many players
seemed like Devils.

2861
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:06,300
In the midst of that,
he kept making plans for Angels.

2862
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:08,939
Of course,
a Devil could make plans for Angels.

2863
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:12,409
But in that case,
things would get too confusing.

2864
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,750
With even more Devil candidates,
I wouldn't have anyone to trust.

2865
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:17,779
It made me so confused.

2866
02:00:18,149 --> 02:00:19,880
I did all that I could,

2867
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:23,119
but it was still not easy to the end.

2868
02:00:24,359 --> 02:00:28,289
(Xitsuh gathers all the Angels.)

2869
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,260
All right. All of us here are Angels.

2870
02:00:34,970 --> 02:00:36,500
Now, we just need to hide
the identity of the Deity.

2871
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,640
All of us here are Angels.

2872
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:39,500
What?

2873
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:43,439
Honestly speaking,

2874
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:44,939
I couldn't believe it at that time.

2875
02:00:45,479 --> 02:00:48,880
Xitsuh trusted Dong Min too much at first,

2876
02:00:49,579 --> 02:00:52,449
so I just assumed he was also an Angel.

2877
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,020
He totally brainwashed me.

2878
02:00:54,449 --> 02:00:57,590
He usually has such a big plan...

2879
02:00:58,189 --> 02:00:59,920
that it's perfect for people like me
to be played.

2880
02:01:01,529 --> 02:01:03,130
Dong Min doesn't even come.

2881
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:05,600
Gosh, Dong Min...

2882
02:01:06,329 --> 02:01:07,970
I'm not made for games like this.

2883
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:10,770
This is crazy.

2884
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,670
- What do we do?
- What do you mean?

2885
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:16,770
We still have the last possibility.

2886
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:18,539
We can only pray.

2887
02:01:18,779 --> 02:01:21,279
It's going to be over soon anyway.
There's no need to drag it on.

2888
02:01:21,909 --> 02:01:23,979
- Let's just end this quickly.
- Let's just hold our tongues.

2889
02:01:23,979 --> 02:01:26,079
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Let's keep silent.

2890
02:01:27,079 --> 02:01:28,989
Once we win this game,
we can all say, "Good work."

2891
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:31,260
- They're going to pick one anyway.
- Right.

2892
02:01:33,859 --> 02:01:34,989
I'm sure they're confused.

2893
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:38,159
At least, I was...

2894
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:41,729
confident about
hiding the Deity's identity.

2895
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:44,239
I kept it from Dong Min until the end.

2896
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:48,310
I believe I tried my best not to show it.

2897
02:01:49,239 --> 02:01:52,039
Gosh, it was darn hard.

2898
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:56,149
Did you see their faces?

2899
02:01:56,149 --> 02:01:58,479
When did you get caught?

2900
02:01:58,779 --> 02:02:00,079
- Now.
- Just now?

2901
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:01,520
- Yes.
- You survived so well until now.

2902
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,890
The Deity entered the room
and found out about me just now.

2903
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:05,119
- Right.
- Yes.

2904
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:08,689
If the upcoming round has...

2905
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:12,100
three Evil Deed cards, I'll be eliminated.

2906
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:13,359
(If 4 Evil Deed cards are accumulated,
1 Devil can be eliminated.)

2907
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:20,739
MJ, please choose a card
you wish to discard.

2908
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:29,079
Xitsuh, please choose a card
you wish to discard.

2909
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,390
Let me announce the card
that has been selected.

2910
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:39,760
- If it's Evil...
- The 13th Representative, MJ,

2911
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:43,560
and the Executioner, Xitsuh,
have selected...

2912
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:46,329
If it's Evil, I'll be eliminated.

2913
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:53,470
A Good Deed card.

2914
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:55,369
(Judgment Status)

2915
02:02:55,609 --> 02:02:57,710
We just need one more. We'll win, then.

2916
02:02:58,539 --> 02:03:01,350
The 14th Representative candidate...

2917
02:03:01,479 --> 02:03:03,750
will nominate
an Executioner candidate now.

2918
02:03:04,149 --> 02:03:06,720
The 14th Representative candidate, Acau,

2919
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:09,090
please nominate an Executioner candidate.

2920
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,489
Nominate just anyone.

2921
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:14,659
- Okay.
- You can choose anyone here.

2922
02:03:14,989 --> 02:03:16,859
No, except for him.

2923
02:03:16,859 --> 02:03:18,260
That's for sure.

2924
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:20,659
(Embarrassed)

2925
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,500
Why isn't this punk coming?

2926
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,869
He went down there to confuse them.

2927
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,369
Goodness.

2928
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:30,210
Until now?

2929
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:33,210
He's Lucifer, darn it.

2930
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:35,649
Such a trick isn't needed anymore.

2931
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:38,520
The 14th Representative candidate, Acau,

2932
02:03:38,949 --> 02:03:42,590
has nominated Choi Hye Seon
as an Executioner candidate.

2933
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:44,659
(Representative: Acau,
Executioner: Choi Hye Seon)

2934
02:03:49,689 --> 02:03:52,899
Acau, please choose a card
you wish to discard.

2935
02:03:53,329 --> 02:03:54,430
I...

2936
02:03:56,829 --> 02:03:57,899
choose this card.

2937
02:03:57,899 --> 02:03:59,100
(Acau chooses an Evil Deed card.)

2938
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:02,770
Hye Seon, please choose a card
you wish to discard.

2939
02:04:06,279 --> 02:04:07,310
I choose this card.

2940
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:08,310
(Hye Seon chooses to discard
an Evil Deed card.)

2941
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:10,180
The 14th Representative, Acau,

2942
02:04:10,649 --> 02:04:13,779
and the Executioner, Choi Hye Seon,
have selected...

2943
02:04:15,819 --> 02:04:17,119
a Good Deed card.

2944
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:18,319
(Judgment Status)

2945
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,420
A Good Deed card!

2946
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:22,829
Five Good Deed cards
have been accumulated.

2947
02:04:22,829 --> 02:04:24,529
(Five Good Deed cards
have been accumulated.)

2948
02:04:24,529 --> 02:04:26,729
The Devils should enter the voting room
and point out the Deity...

2949
02:04:26,829 --> 02:04:29,270
after enough discussion.

2950
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:33,470
Let's go, Angels. Let's run away.

2951
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:34,640
Follow me.

2952
02:04:35,609 --> 02:04:37,140
(All the Angels leave.)

2953
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,239
Let's go.

2954
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:40,680
(All the Angels leave.)

2955
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:46,220
Let's stay gathered here,
and when a Devil comes,

2956
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:47,920
- Let's send them out.
- just run away.

2957
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:49,390
Don't even speak with them.

2958
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,989
- Never. It's not over yet.
- Let's send them out.

2959
02:04:50,989 --> 02:04:52,189
It's not over.

2960
02:04:54,289 --> 02:04:55,729
But it's unpredictable...

2961
02:04:56,359 --> 02:04:59,029
because the chances are 1 in 6.

2962
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:01,729
We'll have to wait for the result.

2963
02:05:02,529 --> 02:05:05,470
It's hard to figure out with suspicion.

2964
02:05:05,739 --> 02:05:07,710
I think there's a 50-percent chance.

2965
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:09,369
But Dong Min has...

2966
02:05:09,369 --> 02:05:11,109
- such a good hunch.
- I think there's a 50-percent chance.

2967
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:13,310
- So, what do you think?
- What?

2968
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:15,380
My gut feeling says...

2969
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:17,350
it's Acau.

2970
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:20,279
- And...
- Hye Seon is faking it?

2971
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:21,750
Hye Seon is an Archangel.

2972
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,989
I've guessed it the other way.

2973
02:05:29,829 --> 02:05:31,600
- I think it's Hye Seon.
- Hye Seon?

2974
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:34,630
But it feels like she's faking it.

2975
02:05:36,029 --> 02:05:37,029
What do you think?

2976
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:38,439
Who do you think it is?

2977
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:42,739
You don't have any concrete information,
do you? Do you?

2978
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:53,550
(The Devils are done
pointing out the Deity.)

2979
02:05:54,619 --> 02:05:56,520
Everyone, please gather at the Main Hall.

2980
02:05:58,390 --> 02:05:59,619
To eliminate the Deity,

2981
02:06:03,529 --> 02:06:05,029
the Devils...

2982
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:09,369
Please.

2983
02:06:11,569 --> 02:06:14,569
I honestly think they'll guess it wrong.

2984
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:21,050
(Deity)

2985
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:26,250
(Deity)

2986
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:29,619
(MJ Kim)

2987
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:30,989
Gosh, what do I do?

2988
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:36,329
(Archangel Xitsuh is given
the Deity's identity.)

2989
02:06:36,329 --> 02:06:37,800
Goodness.

2990
02:06:38,729 --> 02:06:39,760
Oh, my goodness.

2991
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:43,229
(He can't believe what he's seeing.)

2992
02:06:43,229 --> 02:06:45,939
It feels like the game has become
about five times harder.

2993
02:06:46,539 --> 02:06:47,600
I literally thought,

2994
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:51,039
"Dear Deity, why would you
give me such a hardship?"

2995
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:52,279
It was all that I thought.

2996
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:54,310
That's why...

2997
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:55,380
(After the first Devil was revealed)

2998
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:56,409
Right.

2999
02:06:56,710 --> 02:06:59,319
I thought I should...

3000
02:06:59,819 --> 02:07:01,289
let her know who I was,

3001
02:07:01,289 --> 02:07:03,149
and get information from her
as soon as possible.

3002
02:07:03,289 --> 02:07:04,590
Who do you think is most suspicious?

3003
02:07:04,689 --> 02:07:06,090
- What?
- Who do you think is most suspicious?

3004
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:07,829
I'm clueless.

3005
02:07:07,829 --> 02:07:10,329
Goodness. At first, I...

3006
02:07:10,329 --> 02:07:12,100
You know who.

3007
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:13,600
- What...
- Who's most suspicious? Hurry.

3008
02:07:13,699 --> 02:07:15,369
- One person.
- Min A?

3009
02:07:16,029 --> 02:07:17,600
Okay, the first Devil.

3010
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,369
- Min A?
- Yes, I'm sure of it.

3011
02:07:20,369 --> 02:07:21,409
Min A is a Devil.

3012
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:23,310
(But the Deity is totally off guard
around Min A.)

3013
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:26,010
- So anyway for now...
- But Jin Ho...

3014
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:28,850
This is driving me nuts.

3015
02:07:28,909 --> 02:07:30,079
Why? Where are you going?

3016
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,750
You know Min A is a Devil,
and you're the Deity.

3017
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:33,880
Why do you keep acting like that?

3018
02:07:34,649 --> 02:07:36,789
I'm the real Archangel, and...

3019
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:39,789
It's her. It's the two of them.

3020
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,489
- You lied to me?
- Yes.

3021
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,029
Darn it.

3022
02:07:48,699 --> 02:07:50,930
I didn't know what to do.

3023
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:54,300
It's fortunate at least
because no one would know your identity.

3024
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,770
- No one. Okay?
- Okay.

3025
02:07:55,770 --> 02:07:56,840
We must be winning from now on.

3026
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:00,079
We'll talk and go inside naturally.

3027
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:02,979
I honestly didn't tell MJ...

3028
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:05,949
to do anything.

3029
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,619
I'll just act like I'm clueless.

3030
02:08:09,649 --> 02:08:10,649
Okay.

3031
02:08:10,649 --> 02:08:12,560
I'll act like I still don't get the rules.

3032
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:16,460
(MJ acted like
she didn't understand the rules.)

3033
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:17,659
It makes no sense.

3034
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:18,899
I'm an idiot.

3035
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:19,899
What...

3036
02:08:21,170 --> 02:08:22,199
Go inside.

3037
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:23,729
I'm an idiot.

3038
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:26,539
- Don't get fooled, and trust my info.
- Okay.

3039
02:08:26,539 --> 02:08:27,840
- Please!
- Got it.

3040
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:31,380
And I hardly talked to MJ.

3041
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:33,279
(After checking Dong Min's identity)

3042
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:34,409
Hye Seon.

3043
02:08:35,979 --> 02:08:38,720
Go to Xitsuh and tell him it's Dong Min.

3044
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,720
I'm the Deity.

3045
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:42,720
(MJ sends Hye Seon
in case someone follows her.)

3046
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,989
I shouldn't get caught.

3047
02:08:45,659 --> 02:08:47,359
MJ is the Deity, and Dong Min is a Devil.

3048
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:50,130
MJ, and... Dong Min is a Devil?

3049
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:52,430
MJ is the Deity, and Dong Min is a Devil.

3050
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,260
MJ told me so.

3051
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:56,770
I did my best to hide it.

3052
02:08:56,770 --> 02:09:00,140
I just needed to confuse them
so they wouldn't know who the Deity was.

3053
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:02,039
Right now...

3054
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:03,069
(Acau acts like he's the Deity.)

3055
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:05,340
I'm a little suspicious of Steve.

3056
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:06,680
And who else?

3057
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:08,949
- Jin Ho for sure.
- I see.

3058
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:10,880
Acau might know.

3059
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:13,020
- Who the Devils are?
- Yes.

3060
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:14,750
What...

3061
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:16,890
(Hye Seon approaches
the Devils on purpose.)

3062
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:19,289
Who do you think is an Angel for sure?

3063
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,289
I don't know who's foolish.

3064
02:09:21,289 --> 02:09:22,689
- A foolish Angel?
- Yes.

3065
02:09:22,829 --> 02:09:25,859
It's either Hye Seon,
Xitsuh, or Acau, right?

3066
02:09:26,199 --> 02:09:27,899
Hye Seon seemed a little suspicious.

3067
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:31,340
I honestly think it'd be hard...

3068
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:32,470
for the Devils...

3069
02:09:33,239 --> 02:09:37,010
to guess MJ as the Deity.

3070
02:09:37,979 --> 02:09:39,109
To eliminate the Deity,

3071
02:09:43,079 --> 02:09:44,520
the Devils...

3072
02:09:46,579 --> 02:09:47,649
have succeeded.

3073
02:09:47,649 --> 02:09:49,090
(They have guessed
the Deity's identity right.)

3074
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:51,189
The Devils are the winners.

3075
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:53,960
I saw you acted like crazy.

3076
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:56,960
Did you think I'd fall for such a trick?

3077
02:09:59,399 --> 02:10:00,560
(Sighing)

3078
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,399
It makes no sense.

3079
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:07,399
I couldn't even think of anything else
that I could've done.

3080
02:10:07,670 --> 02:10:09,239
It was just impossible
to hide her identity...

3081
02:10:09,239 --> 02:10:10,840
from Dong Min.

3082
02:10:11,539 --> 02:10:12,680
He probably saw it.

3083
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:15,750
We won thanks to Dong Min.

3084
02:10:15,909 --> 02:10:18,380
He lives up to his name and reputation.

3085
02:10:18,779 --> 02:10:20,350
I was surprised by
how he led the team to victory.

3086
02:10:20,649 --> 02:10:22,920
I realized how easy it was...

3087
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,420
to team up with Dong Min.

3088
02:10:24,859 --> 02:10:27,659
You guys need...

3089
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:29,890
to believe me 100 percent.

3090
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:32,100
- Unconditionally?
- Yes, unconditionally.

3091
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:33,399
The Deity is...

3092
02:10:35,029 --> 02:10:36,229
MJ Kim.

3093
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,340
But why is it MJ?

3094
02:10:39,939 --> 02:10:41,039
Can you explain it to us?

3095
02:10:42,909 --> 02:10:44,239
First off,

3096
02:10:44,439 --> 02:10:47,539
I checked where Xitsuh moved...

3097
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,380
and paid attention...

3098
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:53,250
to his honest remarks,

3099
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:55,119
which couldn't be fake.

3100
02:10:55,590 --> 02:10:59,920
I crossed the players out 1 by 1 that way.

3101
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:02,930
First, Seong Beom...

3102
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:04,930
Who are you suspecting?

3103
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:07,199
- Seong Beom, for sure.
- I see.

3104
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:10,170
His actions and behaviors...

3105
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:12,739
- Right.
- make no sense.

3106
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:15,739
He's taking the opposite direction.

3107
02:11:15,970 --> 02:11:18,510
Xitsuh, why wouldn't you convince me?

3108
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:21,079
Why wouldn't you convince me
that you're an Angel?

3109
02:11:21,510 --> 02:11:24,210
He didn't deal with Seong Beom
for several rounds.

3110
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:26,750
That meant he wasn't the Deity.

3111
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:28,949
And Acau.

3112
02:11:28,949 --> 02:11:30,050
(Deity Candidate 2: Acau)

3113
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:34,930
I figured out that Acau wasn't
the Deity during the first round.

3114
02:11:35,659 --> 02:11:39,260
Xitsuh had to talk to the Deity,

3115
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:40,399
so he left the room.

3116
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:41,470
I'm leaving.

3117
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:42,470
(He left the room first.)

3118
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:44,069
He had work to do.

3119
02:11:44,399 --> 02:11:46,869
But the one who started it...

3120
02:11:46,869 --> 02:11:48,039
was Acau.

3121
02:11:48,039 --> 02:11:49,670
In this kind of game,

3122
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:51,779
the Archangel plays an important role,
no matter what.

3123
02:11:51,909 --> 02:11:54,109
But the Archangel can't do
anything without information.

3124
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:56,479
The Deity can't do it.

3125
02:11:56,979 --> 02:11:58,449
So I deleted those two from the list.

3126
02:11:59,779 --> 02:12:01,420
(Candidate 3 for the Deity, Kim Min A)

3127
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:04,390
Xitsuh said that the Deity
gave him misinformation,

3128
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,659
and he heard it was Min A.

3129
02:12:06,859 --> 02:12:08,659
The Deity told me a lie in Round One.

3130
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:10,460
- A lie?
- I heard it was Min A.

3131
02:12:11,159 --> 02:12:12,159
It was to sound me out.

3132
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:14,329
And now the Deity says,

3133
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:16,470
Steve Yea and Hong Jin Ho were Devils.

3134
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:18,569
In Round 1, it was Steve Yeah,
and Hong Jin Ho in Round 2.

3135
02:12:19,069 --> 02:12:20,800
But what was said was all true,
so I thought, "Okay."

3136
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,369
I deleted Min A from the list too.

3137
02:12:22,869 --> 02:12:24,810
Now, only two were left,

3138
02:12:25,079 --> 02:12:28,079
MJ Kim and Hye Seon.

3139
02:12:29,079 --> 02:12:31,619
I saw Xitsuh communicating
a lot with Hye Seon.

3140
02:12:31,619 --> 02:12:32,880
I was confused about Hye Seon all along.

3141
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:36,220
From the beginning, Hye Seon and Xitsuh...

3142
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:37,989
participated a lot.

3143
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:40,460
I wondered if my guess was right.

3144
02:12:40,619 --> 02:12:42,789
I couldn't make up my mind.

3145
02:12:42,930 --> 02:12:46,600
So I, to make sure for the last time...

3146
02:12:47,159 --> 02:12:49,569
Anyway, look at this.

3147
02:12:50,529 --> 02:12:51,670
When Hye Seon is a Representative,

3148
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:53,399
even if she is a Devil,

3149
02:12:54,770 --> 02:12:55,810
she needs to choose a Good Deed card.

3150
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:58,079
She has no chance
of turning the tables anyway,

3151
02:12:58,210 --> 02:12:59,340
so she needs to choose a Good Deed card
even if she's a Devil.

3152
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:01,010
If it turns out you're in Team Devil...

3153
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:02,579
You won't be picked.

3154
02:13:02,579 --> 02:13:03,579
I got it.

3155
02:13:03,579 --> 02:13:05,119
If you choose a Good Deed card,

3156
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,520
even if it turns out you're in Team Devil,

3157
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:08,890
we will never pick you.

3158
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:11,390
I heard him talking to Hye Seon.

3159
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:12,619
I wanted to know how he said it.

3160
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:15,890
He just said it
like a casual conversation.

3161
02:13:16,189 --> 02:13:19,600
But when MJ Kim had to come forward...

3162
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,930
as a Representative for the next round...

3163
02:13:21,869 --> 02:13:22,869
Dong Min.

3164
02:13:23,369 --> 02:13:25,340
Don't we need to make a deal with MJ Kim?

3165
02:13:25,470 --> 02:13:26,640
- Will you talk to her?
- Shall I?

3166
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:29,840
MJ, can we talk for a minute?

3167
02:13:30,909 --> 02:13:32,039
Xitsuh might have thought,

3168
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:34,640
"Why is he not doing the same thing..."

3169
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:36,479
"to Hye Seon..."

3170
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:38,479
"and MJ?"

3171
02:13:38,649 --> 02:13:40,779
We have accumulated...

3172
02:13:41,619 --> 02:13:43,550
a lot of Good Deed cards anyway.

3173
02:13:43,619 --> 02:13:44,619
So we have a chance...

3174
02:13:44,619 --> 02:13:46,289
of winning anyway, right?

3175
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:49,130
He said it intentionally
where everyone could see him.

3176
02:13:49,489 --> 02:13:51,159
At first, MJ was puzzled thinking,

3177
02:13:51,159 --> 02:13:53,659
"Has he gone mad?
Why is he saying this to me?"

3178
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:57,430
Okay? I said the same thing to Hye Seon.

3179
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:03,710
Now, I was sure that MJ Kim was the Deity.

3180
02:14:03,939 --> 02:14:07,010
The moment I was 100 percent sure...

3181
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:10,479
was when my identity was revealed.

3182
02:14:10,909 --> 02:14:13,750
So I kept watching to catch the moment...

3183
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:16,819
when she was coming out
of the voting room.

3184
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:18,920
Next.

3185
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:35,609
Are you drawing a moving picture?

3186
02:14:37,970 --> 02:14:39,039
It looked most unfamiliar.

3187
02:14:40,779 --> 02:14:43,550
It was a moving picture.

3188
02:14:46,779 --> 02:14:49,649
I'd never seen a look like that
on her face...

3189
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:51,890
ever since I was acquainted with MJ.

3190
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:56,229
She definitely looked
like she was betrayed...

3191
02:14:56,229 --> 02:14:57,329
by someone she trusted.

3192
02:14:58,930 --> 02:14:59,930
It was at that moment...

3193
02:15:00,529 --> 02:15:01,600
that I got confident.

3194
02:15:02,899 --> 02:15:05,069
I knew her so well,

3195
02:15:05,569 --> 02:15:06,840
so I could catch it.

3196
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:10,270
It's MJ Kim.

3197
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:11,270
(Devil Dong Min chose MJ Kim.)

3198
02:15:11,579 --> 02:15:13,680
Today, MJ Kim...

3199
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:15,050
truly gave the best performance.

3200
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:18,479
Xitsuh gave his best performance too.

3201
02:15:19,079 --> 02:15:21,220
If we had played the game
with me in Team Angel...

3202
02:15:21,619 --> 02:15:24,720
and the others in Team Devil,

3203
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:26,319
I wouldn't have guessed
that it was MJ Kim.

3204
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:28,289
Her performance was terrific.

3205
02:15:28,829 --> 02:15:31,090
But she was going...

3206
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,630
against me.

3207
02:15:32,899 --> 02:15:34,359
She gave the best performance,

3208
02:15:35,329 --> 02:15:36,470
but she faced me.

3209
02:15:37,899 --> 02:15:39,000
I just feel sorry for her.

3210
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:42,510
Today, everyone on the winning team
of the Money Challenge...

3211
02:15:43,069 --> 02:15:45,010
will be given an Immunity Pass.

3212
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:50,479
Today's Evil Spirit Judgement
results will be announced.

3213
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:53,550
We will judge the extra Evil Spirit.

3214
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:55,119
(A new announcement
before Money Challenge)

3215
02:15:55,319 --> 02:15:56,590
Gosh, I'm sorry.

3216
02:15:56,590 --> 02:15:58,520
It seems it's not you, but I'm not sure.

3217
02:16:01,189 --> 02:16:07,859
(Almost a landslide vote for one person)

3218
02:16:08,529 --> 02:16:10,600
The player who was selected
as the extra Evil Spirit...

3219
02:16:11,229 --> 02:16:13,300
is Steve Yea.

3220
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:14,539
(Players brought Steve Yea to justice
as the Evil Spirit.)

3221
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:18,739
The players succeeded...

3222
02:16:18,909 --> 02:16:19,979
in judging the Evil Spirit.

3223
02:16:21,310 --> 02:16:22,449
I knew it!

3224
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:24,250
Come on.

3225
02:16:24,409 --> 02:16:25,920
With Team Devil's win today,

3226
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:29,119
Steve Yea won an Immunity Pass.

3227
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:32,319
From Team Angel,
who lost in the Money Challenge today,

3228
02:16:33,659 --> 02:16:36,059
there will be
three elimination candidates in total.

3229
02:16:37,829 --> 02:16:40,129
By voting, a team member...

3230
02:16:40,129 --> 02:16:41,770
needs to be selected
as the elimination candidate.

3231
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:45,069
The one selected by voting...

3232
02:16:45,069 --> 02:16:48,170
must select a team member
to go against in a Deathmatch.

3233
02:16:50,209 --> 02:16:52,239
And the last person...

3234
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:55,180
will be selected by the winning team.

3235
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:59,049
Voting will now begin.

3236
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:03,250
Vote for one player
to send to the Deathmatch.

3237
02:17:04,989 --> 02:17:07,319
Voting will close after one hour.

3238
02:17:08,659 --> 02:17:11,459
Players can transfer money
among themselves,

3239
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:14,360
but they need to execute it...

3240
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:15,399
in the voting room with the butler.

3241
02:17:16,299 --> 02:17:18,770
(Voting begins.)

3242
02:17:19,899 --> 02:17:20,969
(Team Angel gathers in the pantry.)

3243
02:17:20,969 --> 02:17:22,040
This is insane.

3244
02:17:22,469 --> 02:17:24,139
We did our best today.

3245
02:17:24,309 --> 02:17:26,139
- You worked hard.
- You really worked hard.

3246
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:28,579
- Xitsuh worked so hard.
- Totally.

3247
02:17:28,579 --> 02:17:29,579
Thank you for your work.

3248
02:17:29,579 --> 02:17:30,680
Today, I...

3249
02:17:33,079 --> 02:17:34,680
I hope we exclude Xitsuh.

3250
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:37,120
- No, I mean...
- He worked so hard.

3251
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:40,920
To be honest, I wanted to send Xitsuh.

3252
02:17:41,829 --> 02:17:43,430
He trusted Dong Min until the end,

3253
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:45,600
and it led the team to lose.

3254
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:47,129
I'll speak now.

3255
02:17:47,129 --> 02:17:50,729
(Xitsuh had conflicts
with Seong Beom all along.)

3256
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:52,100
You should just stay here.

3257
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,010
Don't take anyone out
or do something like that.

3258
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:56,670
- Are you uncomfortable with it?
- Don't try too hard.

3259
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:57,709
Okay.

3260
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,040
Well, I don't mind it.

3261
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:03,209
He can play games as he likes.

3262
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:04,479
But he should win.

3263
02:18:04,909 --> 02:18:06,219
The result matters, after all.

3264
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,520
So I wanted to send Xitsuh.

3265
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:12,059
Anyway, I played the Deity,

3266
02:18:12,059 --> 02:18:13,190
and I was caught.

3267
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:15,229
So I want to go to the Deathmatch.

3268
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:17,030
And don't say something like,

3269
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:18,559
"That's not fair."

3270
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:20,430
I don't want to kill the clock.

3271
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:24,000
That's what I want, first of all.

3272
02:18:24,969 --> 02:18:28,170
I felt that MJ Kim...

3273
02:18:29,809 --> 02:18:31,069
wanted to go.

3274
02:18:31,909 --> 02:18:32,940
I sensed it.

3275
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:35,479
I didn't feel that
she was forced to say so.

3276
02:18:35,709 --> 02:18:38,850
So, if she had said she'd go
although she didn't want to,

3277
02:18:39,049 --> 02:18:41,549
I'd have protected her,
even if I had to spend money.

3278
02:18:41,719 --> 02:18:44,549
I was also responsible as an Archangel.

3279
02:18:44,649 --> 02:18:46,690
Still, when she said that first,

3280
02:18:47,590 --> 02:18:50,930
I pitied her,
and I felt thankful at the same time.

3281
02:18:51,129 --> 02:18:53,360
She might have stopped their criticism...

3282
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:55,000
from coming toward me.

3283
02:18:55,069 --> 02:18:57,600
First of all, I played the Deity today.

3284
02:18:57,870 --> 02:19:00,739
Also,
I've been acquainted with Dong Min...

3285
02:19:00,739 --> 02:19:02,639
for a long time.

3286
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:04,340
In fact, I could have predicted...

3287
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:05,809
that he was a Devil.

3288
02:19:05,809 --> 02:19:08,010
That was my mistake,

3289
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:10,479
and I think I need to take responsibility.

3290
02:19:11,049 --> 02:19:13,250
Actually, in the hour...

3291
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:16,350
given to us, we could discuss it.

3292
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:18,959
People would feel
they didn't do a good job,

3293
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:20,520
but they don't want to go.

3294
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:22,760
So after the hour is up,

3295
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:25,600
they can't decide,
and someone is forced to leave.

3296
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,129
I didn't want that.

3297
02:19:27,129 --> 02:19:29,600
I said I'd go
because there's a chance I can come back.

3298
02:19:30,270 --> 02:19:32,299
I'll take responsibility and go.

3299
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:36,840
(The first voter, MJ Kim)

3300
02:19:38,879 --> 02:19:40,680
Can I transfer my money?

3301
02:19:40,909 --> 02:19:42,350
You can transfer money.

3302
02:19:43,309 --> 02:19:44,379
Seong Beom.

3303
02:19:46,549 --> 02:19:49,719
(MJ Kim calls Heo Seong Beom.)

3304
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:51,520
She says you need to be there.

3305
02:19:55,629 --> 02:19:56,659
I hope you go and come back.

3306
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:00,000
How much would you like to transfer?

3307
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,799
I'll transfer everything I have.

3308
02:20:02,530 --> 02:20:04,299
Since the first day, Seong Beom...

3309
02:20:04,299 --> 02:20:06,600
has been my team member
who played with me.

3310
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,440
He was the youngest in the team,

3311
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:10,770
and he was the brain.

3312
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:13,540
I hoped Seong Beom could advance...

3313
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:15,680
to the final and give a good performance.

3314
02:20:15,809 --> 02:20:18,620
I actually didn't have
a lot of money left,

3315
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:21,250
but I wanted to give it to Seong Beom.

3316
02:20:21,790 --> 02:20:22,989
(MJ Kim transfers all her money
to Heo Seong Beom.)

3317
02:20:22,989 --> 02:20:24,989
MJ Kim transferred 57,000 dollars...

3318
02:20:25,159 --> 02:20:27,159
to Heo Seong Beom.

3319
02:20:27,790 --> 02:20:29,030
Why are you crying?

3320
02:20:30,729 --> 02:20:31,799
Why are you crying?

3321
02:20:35,299 --> 02:20:36,299
It's okay.

3322
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:40,500
I might come back after this.

3323
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,239
I hope you come back.

3324
02:20:43,409 --> 02:20:44,540
I really can come back.

3325
02:20:49,049 --> 02:20:50,049
Let's go.

3326
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:52,680
Why are you crying?

3327
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:59,219
I don't shed tears easily.

3328
02:20:59,219 --> 02:21:01,989
I'm definitely a thinker.

3329
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:04,930
But in that situation,

3330
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:07,530
I couldn't help but cry.

3331
02:21:07,729 --> 02:21:10,170
I grew very attached to her.

3332
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:13,170
It felt like my family was going to war,

3333
02:21:13,170 --> 02:21:14,370
and she might not be able to come back.

3334
02:21:14,569 --> 02:21:16,569
And the money she saved hard...

3335
02:21:17,309 --> 02:21:20,010
could be received like inheritance,
I thought.

3336
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:22,879
Back then,

3337
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:26,350
I really couldn't control my tears.

3338
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:33,059
(Seong Beom kept crying like that
for quite a while.)

3339
02:21:33,059 --> 02:21:37,590
(Seong Beom kept crying like that
for quite a while.)

3340
02:21:42,370 --> 02:21:45,899
(Voting carries on.)

3341
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:49,670
(The second voter, Choi Hye Seon)

3342
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:51,639
(MJ Kim)

3343
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:56,379
(Choi Hye Seon votes for MJ Kim.)

3344
02:21:56,709 --> 02:21:59,280
(MJ Kim)

3345
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:03,920
(Kim Min A votes for MJ Kim.)

3346
02:22:05,989 --> 02:22:08,090
(Xitsuh and Acau vote for MJ Kim.)

3347
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:13,930
(MJ Kim)

3348
02:22:16,329 --> 02:22:17,770
Voting is over.

3349
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:19,899
Please gather at the Main Hall.

3350
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,110
- Already? It's done quickly.
- Already?

3351
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:24,139
They made a quick decision.

3352
02:22:25,010 --> 02:22:26,479
Then we need to think about it now.

3353
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:30,479
Let's see who is left and think about it.

3354
02:22:30,879 --> 02:22:32,950
Could I have more say?

3355
02:22:32,950 --> 02:22:33,979
Of course.

3356
02:22:33,979 --> 02:22:35,290
Do you have anyone in mind
you want to save?

3357
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,590
No, I'll think about it.

3358
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:43,389
Goodness, look at our baby.

3359
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:48,969
- Our baby is in big trouble.
- He's crying.

3360
02:22:48,969 --> 02:22:50,969
People might think
we eliminated Seong Beom today.

3361
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:54,399
The voting results will be announced.

3362
02:22:55,139 --> 02:22:56,209
The voting results say...

3363
02:22:57,639 --> 02:23:00,340
MJ Kim is an elimination candidate.

3364
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:01,709
(MJ Kim)

3365
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:03,010
My goodness.

3366
02:23:04,809 --> 02:23:07,780
MJ Kim,
please enter the voting room now...

3367
02:23:08,989 --> 02:23:11,489
and select one person
to go against at the Deathmatch.

3368
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:13,590
MJ?

3369
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:17,030
I guess they caught...

3370
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:18,799
that MJ lied.

3371
02:23:19,399 --> 02:23:20,700
Gosh.

3372
02:23:22,829 --> 02:23:23,930
I'm sorry...

3373
02:23:25,899 --> 02:23:26,899
to hear...

3374
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:29,510
the unfortunate news.

3375
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:32,510
I feel like I sent her to the Deathmatch,

3376
02:23:32,809 --> 02:23:35,180
so I feel bad.

3377
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:41,120
(MJ Kim goes to select
her opponent in the Deathmatch.)

3378
02:23:44,819 --> 02:23:47,219
MJ Kim, please select one person...

3379
02:23:47,219 --> 02:23:49,430
you will bring to the Deathmatch.

3380
02:23:53,629 --> 02:23:58,569
(5 people are left.)

3381
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:03,610
I thought they would need someone...

3382
02:24:03,610 --> 02:24:04,610
to reinforce their strength.

3383
02:24:04,610 --> 02:24:06,879
I thought I'd be the first card
they'd discard.

3384
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:10,209
The only people...

3385
02:24:10,209 --> 02:24:14,280
who didn't play games
with MJ Kim usually...

3386
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:16,190
were Xitsuh and me,

3387
02:24:16,719 --> 02:24:19,959
so I thought it was highly probable
that she selected me.

3388
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:23,059
I felt very nervous back then.

3389
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:25,030
It's Bloody Game.

3390
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:26,829
I think anything can happen here.

3391
02:24:31,569 --> 02:24:33,799
You selected your opponent
for the Deathmatch.

3392
02:24:34,469 --> 02:24:37,170
MJ Kim, please leave this place now,

3393
02:24:37,170 --> 02:24:39,209
and move to the Deathmatch place.

3394
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:44,110
The result will be announced.

3395
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:49,090
The player MJ Kim selected
as her Deathmatch opponent...

3396
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:56,430
(Choi Hye Seon)

3397
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:57,889
is Choi Hye Seon.

3398
02:25:00,959 --> 02:25:03,569
Choi Hye Seon,
please leave this place now,

3399
02:25:03,569 --> 02:25:05,569
and move to the Deathmatch place.

3400
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:07,799
The time has come.

3401
02:25:08,809 --> 02:25:10,909
Since she hasn't played any game with me,

3402
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:13,139
I guess we had...

3403
02:25:13,139 --> 02:25:15,409
a psychological distance.

3404
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:18,719
I never thought she showed...

3405
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:21,379
a wonderful individual performance.

3406
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:24,049
I might survive today and come back,

3407
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:26,120
but I wished...

3408
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,430
Min A and Seong Beom
would make it together.

3409
02:25:34,799 --> 02:25:36,729
Today,
the winning team of the Money Challenge...

3410
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:40,639
can select one elimination candidate
from the losing team.

3411
02:25:42,809 --> 02:25:45,340
A representative player
should enter the voting room...

3412
02:25:45,709 --> 02:25:47,780
and select one elimination candidate.

3413
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:50,450
You should go, Dong Min.

3414
02:25:56,850 --> 02:25:58,219
The decision is already made.

3415
02:26:00,059 --> 02:26:01,319
- Oh, gosh.
- See you later outside.

3416
02:26:03,129 --> 02:26:05,629
- Is it me? Okay.
- Darn it.

3417
02:26:05,629 --> 02:26:07,799
- Why are you making us nervous?
- I'll get myself ready.

3418
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:09,170
You should prepare to cry.

3419
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:11,870
Dong Min won't let Seong Beom be selected.

3420
02:26:12,139 --> 02:26:13,139
You can't be sure.

3421
02:26:15,469 --> 02:26:17,639
Please select one elimination candidate.

3422
02:26:21,479 --> 02:26:24,209
(Xitsuh)

3423
02:26:24,209 --> 02:26:26,579
(Kim Min A)

3424
02:26:26,579 --> 02:26:28,180
(Heo Seong Beom)

3425
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:30,190
(Acau)

3426
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:32,219
Much to my regret,

3427
02:26:36,889 --> 02:26:39,399
I should pick someone
who showed the poorest performance.

3428
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:58,549
The Deathmatch player
selected by the winning team...

3429
02:27:01,319 --> 02:27:03,590
is Kim Min A.

3430
02:27:03,989 --> 02:27:06,989
(Jang Dong Min chose Kim Min A.)

3431
02:27:06,989 --> 02:27:09,329
Kim Min A, please leave this place now...

3432
02:27:09,329 --> 02:27:11,360
and go to the Deathmatch place.

3433
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:14,430
- I'll be back.
- Go for it.

3434
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:15,569
- Yes.
- You can do it.

3435
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:16,600
You can do it.

3436
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:18,229
In my perspective,

3437
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,069
in today's game...

3438
02:27:20,569 --> 02:27:23,370
Although I'm on Team Devil now,

3439
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:27,239
I've been on Team Angel
from the beginning to end.

3440
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:30,049
It's about the contribution.

3441
02:27:30,049 --> 02:27:31,250
That's important.

3442
02:27:31,379 --> 02:27:35,079
Considering the contribution,
Min A is ranked the lowest.

3443
02:27:35,549 --> 02:27:39,790
It's not an exaggeration
to say I'm on Team Angel.

3444
02:27:39,790 --> 02:27:42,059
I've put in effort for Team Angel.

3445
02:27:42,989 --> 02:27:45,389
Among them, she was...

3446
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:49,430
the least active person.

3447
02:27:49,430 --> 02:27:51,799
That's what I thought.

3448
02:27:52,129 --> 02:27:56,209
She kept saying,
"Am I stupid? Am I a stupid Angel?"

3449
02:27:56,209 --> 02:27:57,770
I'm a stupid Angel.

3450
02:27:59,139 --> 02:28:02,709
(Kim Min A blamed herself
all throughout the game.)

3451
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:05,049
Gosh, how can this happen?

3452
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:07,180
Since she kept saying so,

3453
02:28:07,579 --> 02:28:09,719
I thought she was...

3454
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,950
the least active one today,

3455
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:14,290
so I picked Min A.

3456
02:28:14,459 --> 02:28:16,129
To be honest,
I wanted to play the Deathmatch...

3457
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:17,889
and win.

3458
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:20,860
Why can't I? I can give it a try.

3459
02:28:21,629 --> 02:28:22,799
We're all similar.

3460
02:28:23,329 --> 02:28:27,700
(The last Deathmatch candidate, Kim Min A)

3461
02:28:30,969 --> 02:28:34,209
Today's Deathmatch will now begin.

3462
02:28:35,610 --> 02:28:36,680
MJ Kim,

3463
02:28:37,409 --> 02:28:38,479
Choi Hye Seon,

3464
02:28:39,149 --> 02:28:40,219
and Kim Min A.

3465
02:28:41,180 --> 02:28:42,420
Three players here...

3466
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:47,190
need to have a 1-on-1 Deathmatch.

3467
02:28:47,889 --> 02:28:50,530
I'd rather win the Deathmatch today,

3468
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:51,930
and show them I'm back.

3469
02:28:51,930 --> 02:28:53,229
I'll show my competence.

3470
02:28:53,430 --> 02:28:55,059
I think that's better.

3471
02:28:55,129 --> 02:28:58,700
I got a chance to play by myself,

3472
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:00,899
so I felt excited
but was offended as well.

3473
02:29:01,399 --> 02:29:04,510
Making us go against one another...

3474
02:29:05,069 --> 02:29:07,680
felt like everyone
was looking on with indifference.

3475
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:09,209
It was detestable.

3476
02:29:09,579 --> 02:29:12,049
They thought I was an idiot...

3477
02:29:12,649 --> 02:29:13,649
that they picked me.

3478
02:29:13,649 --> 02:29:15,319
To be the last one standing,

3479
02:29:15,549 --> 02:29:17,219
I can't advance
without having a Deathmatch.

3480
02:29:17,219 --> 02:29:18,690
I thought I couldn't be the winner
all of a sudden.

3481
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:20,719
I decided to win and come back,
no matter what.

3482
02:29:20,959 --> 02:29:22,120
Today's Deathmatch is...

3483
02:29:22,959 --> 02:29:24,229
Black Village.

3484
02:29:24,229 --> 02:29:26,629
(Black Village)

3485
02:29:26,629 --> 02:29:29,000
In Black Village, you take turns...

3486
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,030
to place tiles.

3487
02:29:30,129 --> 02:29:31,870
You win scores...

3488
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:33,469
according to your area.

3489
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:37,040
Using your spatial perception
and strategic thinking,

3490
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:40,579
you need to occupy a larger area
than the other players.

3491
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:44,079
For each round, six tiles to select...

3492
02:29:44,079 --> 02:29:46,620
and six tiles for preview
for the next round are revealed.

3493
02:29:47,379 --> 02:29:49,750
Players take turns...

3494
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:51,920
to select one tile left
among the ones that can be selected...

3495
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,219
and place it on the board.

3496
02:29:54,190 --> 02:29:56,690
When you place a tile,
it needs to touch sides...

3497
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:58,030
with previously placed tiles,

3498
02:29:58,229 --> 02:30:00,729
and the shapes of the fields
and roads drawn on the tiles...

3499
02:30:00,729 --> 02:30:01,729
must connect.

3500
02:30:02,899 --> 02:30:05,899
After placing a tile,
if no one owns the fields or roads...

3501
02:30:05,899 --> 02:30:07,670
included in the tile,

3502
02:30:07,770 --> 02:30:09,510
you can place your piece on it...

3503
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:11,510
to make it your area.

3504
02:30:12,409 --> 02:30:13,579
On the bottom of the pieces,

3505
02:30:13,879 --> 02:30:15,879
there are numbers from 1 to 3.

3506
02:30:16,409 --> 02:30:19,520
Each player is given 3 pieces with 1s,

3507
02:30:19,579 --> 02:30:23,049
two pieces with twos,
and one piece with a three.

3508
02:30:24,590 --> 02:30:27,290
After all the tiles are placed,
if the whole area of the field...

3509
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:29,260
is surrounded by a complete border...

3510
02:30:29,459 --> 02:30:32,159
or if each end of the road
meets the starting point...

3511
02:30:32,159 --> 02:30:33,899
or a field,

3512
02:30:34,229 --> 02:30:36,500
the area is considered completed,

3513
02:30:36,729 --> 02:30:38,270
and the piece placed on the area...

3514
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:39,870
is returned to the player.

3515
02:30:40,469 --> 02:30:42,639
If you complete a road,

3516
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,239
you get one point
per the number of tiles on it.

3517
02:30:45,809 --> 02:30:47,180
If you complete a field,

3518
02:30:47,709 --> 02:30:49,979
you get two points
per the number of tiles on it.

3519
02:30:49,979 --> 02:30:51,809
That's how players win scores.

3520
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:55,620
If two or more players
have placed their pieces...

3521
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:56,690
on a completed area,

3522
02:30:56,889 --> 02:30:59,959
each player adds up the numbers
written under their pieces,

3523
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:02,889
and the one with the biggest number
wins the score.

3524
02:31:03,430 --> 02:31:05,229
If it's a tie, both players...

3525
02:31:05,229 --> 02:31:06,659
win points.

3526
02:31:08,059 --> 02:31:10,270
The game consists of 12 rounds in total.

3527
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:12,700
After placing all the tiles,

3528
02:31:12,799 --> 02:31:15,870
the player with the highest score
wins the game.

3529
02:31:17,670 --> 02:31:19,510
The rules were very simple,

3530
02:31:19,510 --> 02:31:21,680
and it was such an intuitive game.

3531
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:24,879
I thought it wouldn't be
very hard to play it.

3532
02:31:24,879 --> 02:31:27,479
Actually, I'm someone
who likes to play a game alone.

3533
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:30,020
When it's a 1-on-1 or 1-on-1-on-1 match,

3534
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:32,420
I can concentrate more.

3535
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,760
So I thought
it wasn't that bad of a match.

3536
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:36,889
I like that kind of game very much.

3537
02:31:37,229 --> 02:31:39,860
When I heard the instructions,
I felt confident.

3538
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:44,969
For ten minutes, you'll check the tiles.

3539
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:51,809
(Checking the shape and number of tiles)

3540
02:31:52,010 --> 02:31:53,940
(Road, three branches, right fork,
straight road, endpoint, L-shape,)

3541
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:55,909
(corner and road, 7-shape, 3-way,
3-side field, field and road, spiral,)

3542
02:31:55,909 --> 02:31:58,110
(quarter, tunnel, 3-side large field,
1 half-circle, parallels, large field)

3543
02:31:58,309 --> 02:32:00,250
I tried to memorize the tiles...

3544
02:32:00,250 --> 02:32:02,379
the biggest or smallest in number.

3545
02:32:02,549 --> 02:32:05,590
I memorized the topographical features.

3546
02:32:05,790 --> 02:32:09,159
I mainly look at the fields...

3547
02:32:09,159 --> 02:32:12,030
because a road makes only one point.

3548
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:13,500
As I see, many tiles...

3549
02:32:13,930 --> 02:32:17,670
were of fields bulging like a tomb.

3550
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:21,139
So I thought I could complete
the fields whenever I wanted...

3551
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:22,840
and I needed to expand the fields.

3552
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:26,540
Frankly, I thought memorizing the tiles...

3553
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:28,479
was meaningless.

3554
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:31,979
It will be necessary to memorize tiles
for a big picture,

3555
02:32:31,979 --> 02:32:34,819
but for a small picture,
you can complete it in any way.

3556
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:37,149
I devised a strategy
to keep completing small pictures...

3557
02:32:37,149 --> 02:32:38,590
from the beginning.

3558
02:32:39,049 --> 02:32:40,690
Tiles for Round One are revealed.

3559
02:32:40,690 --> 02:32:45,030
(Tiles for Round 1 are revealed.)

3560
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:48,159
Preview tiles for Round Two are revealed.

3561
02:32:50,129 --> 02:32:51,229
(Tiles for the current round)

3562
02:32:51,229 --> 02:32:54,540
(Preview tiles)

3563
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:55,909
We'll set the order.

3564
02:32:56,709 --> 02:32:58,270
Please pick one card.

3565
02:32:59,239 --> 02:33:00,379
Please give me the card at the center.

3566
02:33:02,850 --> 02:33:04,250
Kim Min A goes first.

3567
02:33:04,510 --> 02:33:05,780
Choi Hye Seon goes second.

3568
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:07,649
MJ Kim is the last one to play.

3569
02:33:07,649 --> 02:33:09,079
Round One will now begin.

3570
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:12,149
Kim Min A, please select a tile you want.

3571
02:33:12,959 --> 02:33:14,559
I'll have tile number three.

3572
02:33:16,329 --> 02:33:18,059
Place it wherever you want.

3573
02:33:19,930 --> 02:33:22,299
- Will you place your piece?
- Yes.

3574
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:26,040
Kim Min A connected two fields...

3575
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,270
and won four points.

3576
02:33:27,700 --> 02:33:30,069
In the case of a field or a road,

3577
02:33:30,270 --> 02:33:32,170
you think
you could win points really easily,

3578
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:33,909
but once you try it, that's not the case.

3579
02:33:33,909 --> 02:33:36,180
I'm sure that I might not win a point...

3580
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:38,209
because I'm missing one tile
after putting everything else together.

3581
02:33:38,209 --> 02:33:39,920
So, I went for winning small points
here and there.

3582
02:33:40,149 --> 02:33:42,889
I should win often
and as many points as possible.

3583
02:33:42,889 --> 02:33:43,989
That was my strategy.

3584
02:33:44,319 --> 02:33:46,959
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3585
02:33:47,090 --> 02:33:48,559
I'll take this tile.

3586
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:50,360
Place it where you want.

3587
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:55,600
(She places a piece on the field tile.)

3588
02:33:55,930 --> 02:33:58,600
MJ Kim, please select the tile you want.

3589
02:33:58,629 --> 02:34:00,069
I'll take number five.

3590
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:02,770
Place it where you want.

3591
02:34:06,610 --> 02:34:09,309
(She places her piece on a field tile.)

3592
02:34:09,309 --> 02:34:11,909
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3593
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:13,379
I'll take number two.

3594
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:20,389
(She places her piece on the field tile.)

3595
02:34:20,389 --> 02:34:22,159
Please select the tile you want.

3596
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:23,790
I'll take this one.

3597
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,700
(She places her piece on a field tile.)

3598
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:30,069
MJ Kim, please place your tile.

3599
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:32,370
(Kim Min A, MJ Kim)

3600
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:34,799
(MJ Kim attempts to connect
to Min A's field territory.)

3601
02:34:34,799 --> 02:34:37,940
Anyway, in order to place over 70 tiles,

3602
02:34:38,639 --> 02:34:40,940
I figured they'd all get connected.

3603
02:34:40,940 --> 02:34:43,549
Then, whoever has more pieces wins.

3604
02:34:43,579 --> 02:34:45,649
So, I went toward Min A's territory,

3605
02:34:45,649 --> 02:34:48,979
and I tried to take the field
that Min A had connected to.

3606
02:34:49,989 --> 02:34:53,159
(Round 1's tile placement is over.)

3607
02:34:53,159 --> 02:34:55,319
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round Three.

3608
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:57,129
(The tiles from this round)

3609
02:34:57,129 --> 02:34:59,430
(The preview tiles)

3610
02:34:59,959 --> 02:35:02,260
Hye Seon, please select the tile you want.

3611
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:03,930
I'll take tile number two.

3612
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:11,170
(She places a piece on the field tile.)

3613
02:35:11,209 --> 02:35:13,010
(Round 2 tiles)

3614
02:35:13,010 --> 02:35:14,579
I'll take number six.

3615
02:35:15,139 --> 02:35:17,079
Place it where you want.

3616
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:22,450
(MJ Kim, MJ Kim)

3617
02:35:23,819 --> 02:35:25,250
(Hesitating)

3618
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:29,430
(MJ Kim tries to expand her field.)

3619
02:35:29,790 --> 02:35:32,430
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3620
02:35:33,659 --> 02:35:34,729
I'll take number four.

3621
02:35:35,629 --> 02:35:37,370
Place it where you want.

3622
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,270
(Choi Hye Seon, Kim Min A, MJ Kim)

3623
02:35:43,270 --> 02:35:45,909
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3624
02:35:46,209 --> 02:35:47,479
I'll take this one.

3625
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:50,049
Place it where you want.

3626
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:58,120
(The tile doesn't fit
with the field on the right.)

3627
02:36:00,819 --> 02:36:01,860
What?

3628
02:36:04,559 --> 02:36:07,459
(She takes the tile back.)

3629
02:36:12,229 --> 02:36:15,299
(Choi Hye Seon)

3630
02:36:15,299 --> 02:36:18,309
(She connects it to the road tile
on the opposite side.)

3631
02:36:18,569 --> 02:36:22,010
I thought Hye Seon didn't
really understand this game very well.

3632
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:26,280
What's that?
I didn't think this game was that simple.

3633
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:27,950
I'll take this one.

3634
02:36:28,850 --> 02:36:30,590
Place it where you want.

3635
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:33,059
(She continues to expand her field.)

3636
02:36:33,059 --> 02:36:35,489
Kim Min A,
please place the tile where you want.

3637
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:38,260
(Kim Min A)

3638
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:41,959
Kim Min A, you connected 3 fields.
You win 6 points.

3639
02:36:41,959 --> 02:36:43,770
(Kim Min A currently has 10 points.)

3640
02:36:48,239 --> 02:36:49,299
(Kim Min A places her piece
on a road tile.)

3641
02:36:49,969 --> 02:36:54,079
Min A was starting to take points
little by little.

3642
02:36:54,079 --> 02:36:56,409
So, I was kind of wary of her.

3643
02:36:56,709 --> 02:36:58,979
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round Four.

3644
02:36:58,979 --> 02:37:00,520
(The tiles from this round,
The preview tiles)

3645
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:02,250
Tell me the tile you want.

3646
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:04,250
I'll take number four.

3647
02:37:04,250 --> 02:37:06,020
(Choi Hye Seon)

3648
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:08,120
(MJ Kim extends Hye Seon's road.)

3649
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:11,829
She was placing some weird tiles,
so I thought that was strange.

3650
02:37:11,959 --> 02:37:13,159
(Choi Hye Seon)

3651
02:37:13,159 --> 02:37:15,000
(MJ Kim places a piece on the field tile.)

3652
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:16,969
- Kim Min A.
- I'll take number six.

3653
02:37:18,329 --> 02:37:19,799
Will you place a piece?

3654
02:37:19,799 --> 02:37:21,840
(Kim Min A places a piece
on the field tile.)

3655
02:37:22,139 --> 02:37:23,840
I'll take number two.

3656
02:37:26,180 --> 02:37:28,540
(Hye Seon connected 6 road tiles.)

3657
02:37:28,979 --> 02:37:30,049
Number three.

3658
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:35,920
(MJ Kim places a piece on the road tile.)

3659
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:37,889
Number five.

3660
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:46,129
Kim Min A, you connected 3 road tiles.
You win 3 points.

3661
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:50,399
(Kim Min A places an extra piece as well.)

3662
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:51,969
Small points can really build up
to be a lot.

3663
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:55,069
I will take points
whenever I can take them safely.

3664
02:37:55,170 --> 02:37:56,469
I won't have any big picture.

3665
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:59,739
Choi Hye Seon,
place the tile where you want.

3666
02:37:59,739 --> 02:38:00,879
(Round 3 tiles, Number 1 tile)

3667
02:38:03,209 --> 02:38:06,450
(Hye Seon connects her road to 7 tiles
as Round 3 ends.)

3668
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:08,920
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round Five.

3669
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:10,590
(The tiles from this round,
The preview tiles)

3670
02:38:10,590 --> 02:38:12,489
Please select the tile you want.

3671
02:38:12,590 --> 02:38:13,620
I'll take number two.

3672
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:15,020
(Kim Min A, MJ Kim)

3673
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:17,430
(She stops MJ Kim's attempt
to combine their fields.)

3674
02:38:17,459 --> 02:38:20,059
MJ was getting too close to me.

3675
02:38:20,159 --> 02:38:22,059
I should never fight with her over land.

3676
02:38:22,059 --> 02:38:23,069
I might get pulled into it.

3677
02:38:23,069 --> 02:38:25,370
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3678
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:26,469
I'll take number four.

3679
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:28,200
(Choi Hye Seon)

3680
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:31,409
(Choi Hye Seon closed one side
of the road.)

3681
02:38:31,409 --> 02:38:33,110
Please select the tile you want.

3682
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:34,139
Number one.

3683
02:38:37,079 --> 02:38:38,149
(Round 4 tiles)

3684
02:38:38,149 --> 02:38:39,450
I'll take the one right in front.

3685
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:47,020
Kim Min A, you connected 2 field tiles.
You win 4 points.

3686
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:49,690
- Will you place a piece?
- Yes, this one.

3687
02:38:50,729 --> 02:38:53,799
(Kim Min A places a piece
on the field tile.)

3688
02:38:53,799 --> 02:38:56,370
(Round 4 tiles)

3689
02:38:56,729 --> 02:38:58,770
(Choi Hye Seon closes off the road.)

3690
02:38:59,069 --> 02:39:01,569
Choi Hye Seon,
you connected ten road tiles.

3691
02:39:01,569 --> 02:39:03,040
You win ten points.

3692
02:39:03,139 --> 02:39:04,340
Your piece will be taken off.

3693
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:05,440
(Choi Hye Seon currently has 10 points.)

3694
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:08,040
Min A collected small points,

3695
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:09,780
so I thought I might have a chance.

3696
02:39:09,950 --> 02:39:11,979
Please place the tile where you want.

3697
02:39:13,479 --> 02:39:14,879
Will you place a piece?

3698
02:39:15,719 --> 02:39:17,690
(MJ Kim places 3 pieces
on a single territory.)

3699
02:39:17,819 --> 02:39:21,520
If I connect two sides of that tile
that looks like a tomb,

3700
02:39:21,659 --> 02:39:25,090
I could complete this area
and take back my game pieces.

3701
02:39:26,559 --> 02:39:29,930
(She had seen
the next round's tile beforehand.)

3702
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:32,600
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round Six.

3703
02:39:32,600 --> 02:39:33,600
(The tiles from this round,
The preview tiles)

3704
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:35,540
Please select the tile you want.

3705
02:39:35,639 --> 02:39:36,809
I will take number two.

3706
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:42,979
(Choi Hye Seon places a piece
on the field tile.)

3707
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:44,350
I'll take number six.

3708
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:46,719
(MJ Kim starts to close off the land
that she had been expanding.)

3709
02:39:46,719 --> 02:39:47,780
MJ Kim.

3710
02:39:47,879 --> 02:39:50,750
You connected 2 field tiles.
You win 4 points.

3711
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:51,989
(MJ Kim connects 2 field tiles
and wins 4 points.)

3712
02:39:51,989 --> 02:39:53,590
Is there a tile you want?

3713
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:54,690
I'll take number five.

3714
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:55,989
Please place it over here.

3715
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:01,500
Kim Min A, you connected 2 field tiles.
You win 4 points.

3716
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:02,760
Your piece will be taken off.

3717
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:04,069
(Kim Min A. currently has 21 points.)

3718
02:40:04,829 --> 02:40:06,100
I'll take this one.

3719
02:40:10,469 --> 02:40:11,569
This one.

3720
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:17,280
(MJ Kim is about to win 14 points
by connecting 7 field tiles.)

3721
02:40:20,549 --> 02:40:22,250
(MJ Kim doesn't complete her field.)

3722
02:40:22,250 --> 02:40:23,819
Will you place a piece?

3723
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:30,729
(She places a piece on the new field.)

3724
02:40:31,629 --> 02:40:34,760
(MJ Kim is going after 9 tiles or more
to win over 18 points.)

3725
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:38,670
I could tell that MJ was going for
one big win.

3726
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:41,500
She kept expanding her field.

3727
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:43,340
But that could be a bit risky.

3728
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:45,139
That won't be easy to complete.

3729
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:48,639
I could connect over ten tiles.

3730
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:51,350
So, I thought I could win
over 20 points at once.

3731
02:40:51,350 --> 02:40:53,250
(Round 5 tiles, Number 1 tile)

3732
02:40:53,250 --> 02:40:54,379
There's nowhere to place it.

3733
02:40:58,090 --> 02:40:59,489
Will you place a piece?

3734
02:41:00,559 --> 02:41:04,229
Kim Min A, you connected 2 road tiles.
You win 2 points.

3735

Please select the tile you want.

3738
02:41:10,299 --> 02:41:11,329
Number two.

3739
02:41:12,229 --> 02:41:14,600
(MJ Kim expands her land
without hesitation.)

3740
02:41:15,370 --> 02:41:16,510
I'll take number six.

3741
02:41:18,469 --> 02:41:19,569
Please place this on the field.

3742
02:41:19,569 --> 02:41:20,879
(Kim Min A places a piece
on the field tile.)

3743
02:41:21,809 --> 02:41:23,309
I'll take this one...

3744
02:41:24,110 --> 02:41:25,809
Please place the tile where you want.

3745
02:41:26,149 --> 02:41:27,219
All right.

3746
02:41:27,219 --> 02:41:29,850
(Their two fields are connected.)

3747
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:31,520
Are we being connected?

3748
02:41:34,319 --> 02:41:37,989
Choi Hye Seon, you connected 4 road tiles.
You win 4 points.

3749

3752
02:41:42,159 --> 02:41:45,229
(Round 6 ends as they each place a tile.)

3753
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:47,739
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round Eight.

(The tiles from this round,

3755
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:52,110
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3756
02:41:52,309 --> 02:41:53,340
I'll take number two.

3757
02:41:54,239 --> 02:41:55,280
Over here.

02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:39,180
You connected 2 road tiles.
You win 2 points.

3798
02:43:39,979 --> 02:43:42,079
If I just keep building up
points safely...

3799
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:44,620
in the beginning
without getting too greedy,

3800
02:43:44,850 --> 02:43:47,219
I was sure I would win this game.

3801
02:43:47,219 --> 02:43:49,059
Please select the tile you want.

3802
02:43:49,489 --> 02:43:50,530
I'll take number one.

3803
02:43:50,530 --> 02:43:53,959
(Hye Seon is far behind Min A.)

3804
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,600
(With 9 tiles,
this field will be at least 18 points.)

3805
02:43:57,799 --> 02:44:00,239
I thought I should take those points,
no matter what it took.

3806
02:44:00,969 --> 02:44:02,040
The one over there.

3807
02:44:06,170 --> 02:44:07,709
- Will you place a piece?
- Yes.

3808
02:44:07,739 --> 02:44:09,479
(MJ Kim places a piece on the field tile.)

3809
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:11,079
I'll take the road tile.

3810
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:16,180
(Kim Min A connects 4 road tiles
and wins 4 points.)

3811
02:44:16,180 --> 02:44:19,520
Kim Min A, you connected 4 road tiles.
You win 4 points.

3812
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:20,760
Your piece will be taken off.

3813
02:44:21,290 --> 02:44:23,829
Choi Hye Seon,
place the tile where you want.

3814
02:44:23,829 --> 02:44:27,530
(Round 9 tiles, Number 3 tile)

3815
02:44:27,530 --> 02:44:31,129
(She can't place the tile
in the empty spot.)

3816
02:44:32,899 --> 02:44:36,170
(Choi Hye Seon, Kim Min A)

3817
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:38,739
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round 11.

3818
02:44:38,739 --> 02:44:39,909
(The tiles from this round,
The preview tiles)

3819
02:44:40,209 --> 02:44:42,780
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3820
02:44:43,350 --> 02:44:46,250
(In order for Hye Seon
to complete her field area,)

3821
02:44:46,250 --> 02:44:49,989
(she absolutely needs the number 2 tile.)

3822
02:44:49,989 --> 02:44:52,590
(Desperate)

3823
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:56,829
I'll take number two.

3824
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:02,260
Place it where you want.

3825
02:45:04,799 --> 02:45:07,500
(Min A has the number 2 tile in her hand.)

3826
02:45:14,739 --> 02:45:16,180
Will you place a piece?

3827
02:45:16,809 --> 02:45:19,450
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3828
02:45:20,479 --> 02:45:21,579
I'll take number six.

3829
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:23,690
Place it where you want.

3830
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:27,059
(She completes the lower side first.)

3831
02:45:27,059 --> 02:45:28,889
Please select the tile you want.

3832
02:45:29,059 --> 02:45:30,129
Number five, please.

3833
02:45:32,590 --> 02:45:33,930
Will you place a piece?

3834
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:37,229
MJ Kim, you connected 3 field tiles.
You win 6 points.

3835
02:45:37,530 --> 02:45:38,799
Your piece will be taken off.

3836
02:45:38,799 --> 02:45:40,239
(MJ Kim currently has 20 points.)

3837
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:42,239
Please select the tile you want.

3838
02:45:42,540 --> 02:45:43,639
Number one, please.

3839
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:51,110
(Kim Min A places a piece
on the road tile.)

3840
02:45:51,549 --> 02:45:54,319
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3841
02:45:58,889 --> 02:46:01,889
Choi Hye Seon, you connected 2 road tiles.
You win 2 points.

3842
02:46:01,889 --> 02:46:03,159
Your piece will be taken off.

3843
02:46:04,030 --> 02:46:06,629
MJ Kim, please place it where you want.

3844
02:46:06,629 --> 02:46:09,059
(MJ Kim places a piece on the road tile.)

3845
02:46:09,059 --> 02:46:11,569
I'll reveal the preview tiles
for Round 12.

3846
02:46:11,569 --> 02:46:12,930
(The tiles from this round,
The preview tiles)

3847
02:46:13,129 --> 02:46:17,139
(All 72 tiles have been revealed.)

3848
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:20,280
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3849
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:22,040
(Choi Hye Seon)

3850
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:25,809
(The next round's tile that
Hye Seon can use to complete her field)

3851
02:46:26,719 --> 02:46:29,479
(Contemplating)

3852
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:36,829
(She wins 3 points for now.)

3853
02:46:36,829 --> 02:46:40,030
Choi Hye Seon, you connected 3 road tiles.
You win 3 points.

3854
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:41,530
I'll take the first one.

3855
02:46:45,430 --> 02:46:48,639
(She connected the road tiles, but...)

3856
02:46:48,639 --> 02:46:49,670
(MJ Kim)

3857
02:46:49,670 --> 02:46:56,579
(But MJ Kim doesn't have
any more pieces to place.)

3858
02:46:56,850 --> 02:46:59,409
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3859
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:00,680
The second one.

3860
02:47:02,979 --> 02:47:06,149
Kim Min A, you connected 3 field tiles.
You win 6 points.

3861
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:08,760
(Min A doesn't allow them
to chase after her.)

3862
02:47:10,129 --> 02:47:11,989
(Hye Seon needs a big win.)

3863
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:17,569
(She places a road tile...)

3864
02:47:17,569 --> 02:47:20,239
(and places a piece.)

3865
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:21,469
The one on the bottom.

3866
02:47:21,969 --> 02:47:23,469
Place it where you want.

3867
02:47:28,209 --> 02:47:31,549
(She can win 6 points
if she just places 1 tile.)

3868
02:47:31,549 --> 02:47:34,620
(However,
MJ Kim doesn't have any pieces to place.)

3869
02:47:34,620 --> 02:47:36,520
I was thinking about that.

3870
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:38,950
They were connected in three strands,

3871
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:41,959
but I didn't have any pieces to place.

3872
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,760
Kim Min A, place it where you want.

3873
02:47:47,459 --> 02:47:49,899
(Round 11 ends
with Min A's tile placement.)

3874
02:47:49,899 --> 02:47:51,299
Will you place a piece?

3875
02:47:51,299 --> 02:47:53,170
(Round 11 ends
with Min A's tile placement.)

3876
02:47:53,170 --> 02:47:55,000
(The tiles from this round,
The final round)

3877
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,840
I'll reveal the tiles for Round 12.

3878
02:47:57,540 --> 02:47:58,870
These are the last tiles.

3879
02:47:59,069 --> 02:48:02,979
(Hye Seon absolutely needs
the number 2 tile to win 18 points.)

3880
02:48:02,979 --> 02:48:05,510
Unfortunately,

3881
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:08,120
I wasn't the first player in that round.

3882
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:10,920
(Choi Hye Seon is the third player.)

3883
02:48:11,319 --> 02:48:14,290
MJ Kim, please select the tile you want.

3884
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:15,520
I'll take number five.

3885
02:48:20,399 --> 02:48:24,399
MJ Kim, you connected 7 field tiles.
You win 14 points.

3886
02:48:24,399 --> 02:48:25,600
(MJ Kim currently has 34 points.)

3887
02:48:26,030 --> 02:48:28,870
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3888
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:30,940
Please.

3889
02:48:35,879 --> 02:48:38,149
(Round 12 tiles)

3890
02:48:38,149 --> 02:48:39,250
I'll take number two.

3891
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:42,079
Place it where you want.

3892
02:48:43,889 --> 02:48:47,120
(Hye Seon can't complete her area
and win big points.)

3893
02:48:47,290 --> 02:48:50,459
Seriously. I was hoping she didn't know.

3894
02:48:50,760 --> 02:48:53,389
But she knew and took it so cleverly.
I resented her.

3895
02:48:54,299 --> 02:48:56,969
I kept looking to see
what would fit in there.

3896
02:48:57,069 --> 02:48:58,270
There was only one.

3897
02:48:58,270 --> 02:49:00,370
If she completed that area,
she would take about 18 points.

3898
02:49:00,370 --> 02:49:02,469
I thought I should keep her in check.

3899
02:49:05,069 --> 02:49:08,780
Kim Min A, you connected 3 road tiles.
You win 3 points.

3900
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:12,049
Choi Hye Seon,
please select the tile you want.

3901
02:49:22,489 --> 02:49:25,930
Choi Hye Seon, you connected 6 road tiles.
You win 6 points.

3902
02:49:25,930 --> 02:49:26,959
(Choi Hye Seon currently has 29 points.)

3903
02:49:27,129 --> 02:49:30,229
MJ Kim, please select the tile you want.

3904
02:49:30,729 --> 02:49:32,829
I'll put this one here.

3905
02:49:36,100 --> 02:49:39,370
MJ Kim, you connected 3 road tiles.
You win 3 points.

3906
02:49:39,370 --> 02:49:42,510
(MJ Kim currently has 37 points.)

3907
02:49:42,979 --> 02:49:45,450
Kim Min A,
please select the tile you want.

3908
02:49:45,649 --> 02:49:46,780
I'll take number four.

3909
02:49:48,620 --> 02:49:50,079
(Kim Min A connects 2 field tiles
and wins 4 points.)

3910
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:53,219
Kim Min A, you connected 2 field tiles.
You win 4 points.

3911
02:49:53,219 --> 02:49:55,389
Choi Hye Seon, place it where you want.

3912
02:49:55,389 --> 02:49:56,860
(Round 12 tiles, number 6 tile)

3913
02:49:59,790 --> 02:50:01,260
The game has ended.

3914
02:50:03,159 --> 02:50:04,229
This...

3915
02:50:04,870 --> 02:50:06,469
I was going to use this one here.

3916
02:50:06,829 --> 02:50:08,340
You knew that when you took it, right?

3917
02:50:09,969 --> 02:50:11,510
I will announce the results.

3918
02:50:11,670 --> 02:50:13,979
Choi Hye Seon, 29 points.

3919
02:50:14,709 --> 02:50:17,479
MJ Kim, 37 points.

3920
02:50:18,850 --> 02:50:21,219
Kim Min A, 52 points.

3921
02:50:22,549 --> 02:50:24,020
Kim Min A wins.

3922
02:50:24,020 --> 02:50:26,620
(Kim Min A is the survivor
of the Deathmatch.)

3923
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:28,219
The Deathmatch is now over.

3924
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:31,459
The reason
I chose the safest strategy was...

3925
02:50:31,459 --> 02:50:33,700
because I didn't want to go home
after gambling.

3926
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:35,899
My goal was to return to Paradise,
no matter what.

3927
02:50:36,399 --> 02:50:38,469
I'm just happy that I won.

3928
02:50:38,629 --> 02:50:40,670
I think I didn't have
much combat power until now.

3929
02:50:40,700 --> 02:50:43,100
But honestly, I only want to win now.

3930
02:50:43,100 --> 02:50:44,739
I want to win so badly right now.

3931
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:46,069
I want to come in first place.

3932
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:48,510
The Deathmatch is over.

3933
02:50:48,610 --> 02:50:50,809
Please gather at the Main Hall.

3934
02:50:53,209 --> 02:50:55,450
The results of the Deathmatch
will be announced.

3935
02:50:57,790 --> 02:50:59,889
Bloody Game's
final eliminated players are...

3936
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:05,159
MJ Kim...

3937
02:51:07,229 --> 02:51:09,129
and Choi Hye Seon.

3938
02:51:09,829 --> 02:51:10,899
Oh, goodness.

3939
02:51:14,299 --> 02:51:16,639
MJ Kim and Choi Hye Seon,

3940
02:51:17,170 --> 02:51:19,440
please leave Bloody Game immediately.

3941
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:24,350
Eliminated players cannot return
to Bloody Game again.

3942
02:51:24,350 --> 02:51:25,780
Good work, guys.

3943
02:51:25,780 --> 02:51:27,379
- Good work.
- You did so well.

3944
02:51:27,450 --> 02:51:28,520
Good job.

3945
02:51:28,819 --> 02:51:30,120
- You did well.
- I was praying.

3946
02:51:30,549 --> 02:51:31,950
It's such a shame.

3947
02:51:32,389 --> 02:51:35,520
It had been a while
since I was on a survival game.

3948
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:37,430
I feel disappointed that I couldn't...

3949
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:38,829
play more boldly.

3950
02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:40,559
Even if I went to the Deathmatch,

3951
02:51:40,559 --> 02:51:43,329
I could've just done
what I wanted to do...

3952
02:51:43,729 --> 02:51:44,799
and go to prison.

3953
02:51:44,799 --> 02:51:47,069
Had I played more boldly like that,

3954
02:51:47,069 --> 02:51:48,770
I might not have regretted it as much.

3955
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:52,739
People might think that MJ is
all about her physical strength,

3956
02:51:53,409 --> 02:51:54,979
but her brain works really fast too.

3957
02:51:54,979 --> 02:51:57,850
(In the 1st game,
MJ Kim read 1 move ahead of time...)

3958
02:51:57,879 --> 02:52:00,950
(and untied the rope quickly.)

3959
02:52:04,649 --> 02:52:08,590
(Before kidnapping Acau)

3960
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:10,790
(They didn't say we all had to go.)

3961
02:52:10,829 --> 02:52:13,090
(Her keen insight put Hong Jin Ho,
the spy, in a difficult position.)

3962
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:17,430
(The last team battle
with going to Remaining on the line)

3963
02:52:17,469 --> 02:52:20,799
(She contributed to their victory
with her meticulous memorization skills.)

3964
02:52:20,799 --> 02:52:23,670
Since she does her best
at the task she's given,

3965
02:52:24,010 --> 02:52:25,940
I can really rely on her.

3966
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:27,309
I feel so grateful.

3967
02:52:27,309 --> 02:52:28,780
Since I'm a newbie at survival games,

3968
02:52:28,879 --> 02:52:30,280
it was kind of hard on my own.

3969
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:32,979
But when things were hard,
MJ helped me out a lot.

3970
02:52:33,350 --> 02:52:35,450
She cherishes her teammates
more than her own self.

3971
02:52:35,450 --> 02:52:37,389
So, I was really grateful to her.

3972
02:52:40,149 --> 02:52:43,559
(Along with her great physicality,)

3973
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:46,930
(she was a player with equally balanced
intelligence, morality, and strength.)

3974
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:51,129
I'm being eliminated
almost at the very end.

3975
02:52:51,129 --> 02:52:52,829
So, I'm really sad.

3976
02:52:52,829 --> 02:52:54,770
I tried really hard to do my best,

3977
02:52:54,770 --> 02:52:57,270
but there were still sides of me
that I couldn't show off.

3978
02:52:57,270 --> 02:52:59,040
Still, this was a great memory,

3979
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:02,079
and I really hope that Seong Beom
goes to the finals.

3980
02:53:03,579 --> 02:53:06,309
Hey, I'm not lying.

3981
02:53:06,450 --> 02:53:07,920
- Here you go.
- Hye Seon, you worked hard.

3982
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:09,950
Good work, Jin Ho. I hope you win.

3983
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:13,350
I feel relieved but sad to go.

3984
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:17,159
When I looked back on everything
that happened in Bloody Game,

3985
02:53:17,159 --> 02:53:19,760
I think I was too rigid.

3986
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:23,360
I thought I was good at handling people,

3987
02:53:23,459 --> 02:53:25,200
but I think that turned out
to be my weakest point.

3988
02:53:27,500 --> 02:53:31,409
(She was 1 of the 2
who solved the 1st problem.)

3989
02:53:33,909 --> 02:53:37,750
(And she made a huge contribution
to successfully rescuing those in prison.)

3990
02:53:39,379 --> 02:53:42,479
(With her persistent observation skills,
she successfully defended the looting.)

3991
02:53:42,850 --> 02:53:45,090
(She has both sensibility and the brains,)

3992
02:53:45,090 --> 02:53:48,190
(but Choi Hye Seon was always let down...)

3993
02:53:48,190 --> 02:53:51,829
(when it came to winning people over
to her side.)

3994
02:53:52,430 --> 02:53:57,299
(She was driven to be
the sacrificial player in the Remaining,)

3995
02:53:57,370 --> 02:54:03,200
(and the team collapsed in Paradise
in the end.)

3996
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:07,909
I thought of people in such a naive way.

3997
02:54:08,110 --> 02:54:10,409
I think that was my greatest mistake.

3998
02:54:10,510 --> 02:54:12,409
There are many different kinds
of people here,

3999
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:14,450
and since these are unique circumstances,

4000
02:54:14,719 --> 02:54:17,120
everyone will have different...

4001
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:20,319
and peculiar thoughts.
But I hadn't expected that at all.

4002
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:22,020
That's what I feel disappointed about.

4003
02:54:22,059 --> 02:54:24,290
This was my first survival game.

4004
02:54:24,290 --> 02:54:26,829
I was able to experience much more...

4005
02:54:26,829 --> 02:54:30,200
than I ever imagined.

4006
02:54:30,469 --> 02:54:33,399
That was really fun,
and I'm grateful for the experience.

4007
02:54:34,569 --> 02:54:35,600
What a shame.

4008
02:54:37,270 --> 02:54:41,639
(Bloody Game's final eliminated players,
Choi Hye Seon and MJ Kim)

4009
02:54:43,189 --> 02:54:45,189
