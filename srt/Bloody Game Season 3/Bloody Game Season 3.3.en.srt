1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,069
Gosh.

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,679
- There's literally nothing.
- I'm dumbfounded.

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,179
(Exclaiming)

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,250
I've never been in such a crazy situation.

5
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,750
I didn't expect to be...

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,320
left unattended
in such a poor environment.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,719
This is my very first time...

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,890
not being able to wash,
experiencing something...

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,199
so dirty, humid, unpleasant, and poor
my entire life.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,800
It looks like there's nothing, but...

11
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,629
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,170
Look at those heaps of rocks.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,640
There are a lot of rocks, though.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,109
But we can't use them for anything.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,380
It's the wild.

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,049
They really make us want to raid them.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,020
They want to infuriate us.

18
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,649
What's that?

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,020
What are they? Pipes?

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,560
Should we use them to hit them
on the Day of the Raid?

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,259
They said that the rules would be lifted
for a moment,

22
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,570
so we could bring them.

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,670
- We can use them?
- Will it actually kill them?

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,969
I have to go back,
even if it means doing that.

25
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,469
I can't live here any longer.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,040
I guess there's nothing we can use
out here.

27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,650
This is hopeless.

28
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,709
I can't wait to take a shower.

29
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,260
(The heat and humidity exhaust them
even when they're doing nothing.)

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
I couldn't get as much sleep as I wanted.

31
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,040
I was sure that I fell asleep
with dry socks,

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,549
but they were weirdly wet when I woke up.

33
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,980
Second, it's too hot.

34
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,819
I was sweating buckets.

35
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,390
The shirt was 11.9 dollars.

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,090
It was made in China.

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,629
It wasn't breathable,
so it drove me insane.

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,550
Why is it leaking?

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,479
I found a type of insulating material...

40
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,620
and was sleeping on it.

41
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,550
It was so humid
that the moisture from the ground...

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,990
wet all my clothes.

43
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,319
On the first day,

44
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,490
I thought I could stay there
for a few days.

45
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,000
Experiencing that today,

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,060
I don't think I can last any longer.

47
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
Hyun Seo!

48
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,300
Where are you?

49
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,039
Hyun Seo.

50
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,879
Where have you gone?

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,620
- Yes?
- Come on over.

52
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,219
I thought you were taken away by a ghost.

53
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,719
How did you cut it?

54
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,090
- I gnawed it off.
- With your teeth?

55
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,789
I gnawed off my short sleeves.

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,469
(Gnawing off)

57
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,539
All right. That's good.

58
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,110
There were many complicated reasons.

59
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,810
First off, it was way too hot.

60
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,080
The sleeves made a huge difference.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,949
I had picked my worst-looking clothes
when I came here...

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,419
to look like a weirdo.

63
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,289
Maybe it's an inferiority complex of mine,

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,219
but I think I was picked
in Round One because of that.

65
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,860
Anyway, I thought I'd look bulkier.

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,659
At least to the players with skinny arms,

67
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,430
I can tell them
that I have bigger arms than them.

68
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,169
I thought it was necessary
not to look like a weakling.

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,270
I kept calling you, but...

70
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,139
I did hear some sounds.

71
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,740
When did you get up?

72
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,710
It was weird when I felt moisture
under my back, so I got up,

73
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,379
and my whole back was wet.

74
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,250
My clothes don't leak.
I'll cut some for you.

75
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,150
Why is it leaking?

76
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,590
The material is holding the moisture.

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,219
Don't sleep here.

78
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,889
The puddle was only here last night.

79
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,529
I think it got under it.

80
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,459
It's holding the moisture. This is bad.

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,170
I knew it was weird
when my clothes kept getting wet.

82
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,670
We should drain it now.

83
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,139
Over here?

84
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,810
No, let's go further. Can you keep going?

85
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,040
- To where?
- Just keep going.

86
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,540
Hold it up.

87
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,420
(They move it to a place
where there's less water.)

88
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,519
I think that's good.

89
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,519
I can't wait to raid them.

90
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,019
That's my goal.

91
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,759
But I didn't get any messages
from Jin Ho, the spy.

92
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,399
So, I had a feeling...

93
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,600
that he was enjoying his time
at Bloody Paradise...

94
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,600
and forgot about us.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Those thoughts came to my mind.

96
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,009
(The spy, Jin Ho, wakes up.)

97
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm the spy, right?

98
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,889
I should work on the symbols...

99
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,720
or social media messages.

100
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,990
But there are too many limits.

101
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,689
The drinks for the survivors.

102
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,160
(Last night at Bloody Paradise)

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,660
Let's have fun tomorrow.

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,870
Great work, everyone.

105
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,899
- Great work!
- Good work, guys.

106
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,069
Great day.

107
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,810
- That's good.
- It's so smooth.

108
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,939
- It's so cool.
- Nice.

109
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,509
It's refreshing.

110
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,850
That's so refreshing.

111
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,949
- Like we're wrapping up the day.
- Exactly.

112
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,050
Has Hye Seon gone home?

113
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,519
- Hye Seon?
- Yes.

114
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,490
There has to be a spy.

115
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,160
Do you have any guesses?

116
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,300
I was at Bloody Paradise,
and everyone seemed to be...

117
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:03,029
suspecting me to be the spy.

118
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,439
It turned out later that...

119
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,839
I'm suspicious of Jin Ho
for not solving it.

120
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,870
I know, right?

121
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,639
He definitely could have solved it.

122
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,579
- Perhaps he didn't.
- Maybe he honestly didn't know...

123
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,980
how to play such a game. Don't you think?

124
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,750
It looked like he was prepared...

125
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,279
to go to the Deathmatch.

126
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,290
People thought, "Jin Ho may not be able
to place first in that game,"

127
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,660
"but it's impossible
for him to place last."

128
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,730
"He placed last on purpose..."

129
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,060
"because he's the spy."

130
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,930
But I'm annoyed to death...

131
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,300
that I placed last due to my incompetence.

132
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,430
And they kept asking
if I placed last on purpose.

133
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,269
Though the process was different,

134
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,370
they started seeing me as the spy.

135
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,810
I had to clear their doubts,

136
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,079
but it was so frustrating
and disadvantageous for me.

137
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,610
I couldn't come up with a way
to overcome it.

138
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,050
- Who wants soju?
- Me.

139
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,180
Okay.

140
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,649
It's sugar-free soju.

141
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,089
- Even alcohol is sugar-free these days?
- Yes.

142
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,620
- Really?
- This is sugar-free.

143
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,189
This has been sugar-free
since the moment it came out.

144
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,360
- Really?
- Yes.

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,529
That's good.

146
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:06,730
I can't believe how neat this soju is.

147
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,730
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

148
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,230
- It's nice and neat.
- Yes.

149
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,610
Jin Ho is an honest type.

150
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,750
It's so obvious when he tells a lie.

151
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,689
I don't think
Hye Seon was completely eliminated today.

152
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,060
Is there a chance that she went somewhere?

153
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,089
- Definitely.
- I totally think so.

154
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:36,089
Was there actually a Deathmatch?

155
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,199
Yes.

156
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,129
I have a feeling...

157
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,730
- that one of you is a spy.
- But...

158
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,399
I even doubt the existence of a spy.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,769
Everyone was suspecting me,

160
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,310
so I had to find a way to break through.

161
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,279
Dong Min is the biggest threat.

162
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,649
He can be pretty sly and quick-witted.

163
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,220
I mixed some of the truths.

164
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,519
Did you solve the final question
when it ended?

165
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,420
- They told us the answer.
- Seriously?

166
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,019
It's so frustrating, though.

167
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,060
Of these 9 players,
only 2 people guessed the answer.

168
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,259
Just Dong Min.

169
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,790
- Dong Min and...
- Hye Seon.

170
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,560
She said that she also got the answer.

171
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,470
The rest of you just smashed it.

172
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,470
That's true.

173
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,939
I couldn't even break mine.

174
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,569
They tied it so hard.
They probably wanted to kill me.

175
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,509
I was the only one who saw the hints.

176
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,980
They gave me a hint,
and I still didn't know.

177
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,879
In the end, everyone left,
and there was just me,

178
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,709
so they said, "The answer is 1, 1..."

179
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,149
I listened to his story,

180
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,049
and I thought, "Maybe he's not a spy."

181
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,919
What do you think, Dong Min?
I don't see anything suspicious.

182
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,559
Well,

183
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,259
Jin Ho has a tell when he's lying.

184
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,259
Okay.

185
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,429
And he has a way of reacting
when he actually doesn't know.

186
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,129
And he genuinely doesn't know.

187
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,639
I don't think he's a spy.

188
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,409
Gosh, I'm starving.

189
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,009
We were supposed to communicate
through messages.

190
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,379
On the second floor...
Was it "surprit" or something?

191
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,549
It was like a shelf.

192
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,820
"The spies can use..."

193
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,419
"the SMS Box in the pantry
of the Bloody Paradise..."

194
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,919
"and exchange messages with each other."

195
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,129
What's a pantry?

196
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,659
It's like a room
where you store groceries.

197
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,860
Like a convenience store?

198
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,529
You could see it
on your way down the stairs.

199
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,529
That was...

200
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,340
I could have been eliminated
while reading it,

201
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,740
so it irritated me.

202
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,509
I figured it had to be
in the convenience store,

203
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,080
so I looked for it.

204
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,190
He seems strange at times.
As if he was looking for something.

205
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,059
I'm still suspicious of him,
so I'm keeping an eye on him.

206
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,269
Gosh.

207
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,580
"In Bloody Paradise,"

208
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,009
"players use virtual cash currency
as personal funds,"

209
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,320
"which are stored in a safe."

210
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,480
- Then...
- What's rule number five, then?

211
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,549
There's a golden key.

212
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,159
(Basic rules at Bloody Paradise)

213
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,490
(The hidden rule is concealed by a key.)

214
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,059
My guess is,

215
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,529
"The winner of the Money Challenge
can open the safe."

216
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,740
"There are advantages and disadvantages
in the safe."

217
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,570
I bet it has something to do
with Pandora's Box...

218
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,769
- from the last season.
- I think it's also a hint.

219
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,370
What would this be?

220
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,809
One of the rules was covered
by a key symbol.

221
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,809
Are we supposed to find a key?

222
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,519
I got the impression...

223
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,279
that it would be a game changer...

224
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,190
and something crucial to the game.

225
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,820
The altar wouldn't be related
to the hidden rule, would it?:

226
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,960
The altar.

227
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,629
About the altar,

228
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,059
I think it's a lie.

229
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,629
(Last night)

230
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,830
I saw the dagger.

231
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,000
- Other than this? A different one?
- Yes.

232
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,340
- There's another one?
- Yes.

233
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,379
- It's on a type of altar.
- What?

234
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,720
With lighting above it.

235
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,620
Is it in Bloody Mansion?

236
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,889
- Can you share the info or not?
- I cannot.

237
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,059
There was a painting of a large dagger,

238
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,590
and she said...

239
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,899
that the same one was on an altar.

240
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,700
Yurisa said that she found a hidden room.

241
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,629
Should I look for it too?

242
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,139
Was she telling the truth or not?

243
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,970
I'll be back.

244
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,080
Gosh.

245
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,879
I don't see anything hidden, though.

246
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,750
She could have told us everything
if she was going to.

247
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,090
I found it strange that she would keep
its location only.

248
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,289
I think she did it
so that we'd waste our energy.

249
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,230
- Was she lying to us?
- Yes, maybe it's a strategy.

250
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,490
- Just tell me this, then. Be honest.
- Okay.

251
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,029
When you said that you saw an altar,
you were lying, right?

252
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,870
- No. Why?
- You actually saw it?

253
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,929
Yes. Why?

254
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,070
But I couldn't find it anywhere.

255
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,009
I didn't know, but there were apparently
many people who looked for it all night.

256
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,539
Everyone said,
"You were lying, weren't you?"

257
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,409
So, I...

258
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,149
Go through the bushes.

259
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,620
- What?
- The bushes.

260
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,490
- Go through the bushes?
- Yes.

261
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,490
That's so random.

262
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,059
Gosh.

263
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,700
This is seriously...

264
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,600
The bushes?

265
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,340
Gosh.

266
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,950
Am I being fooled again?

267
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,149
But I could never find it.
Where on earth is it?

268
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,090
I went through the whole place,
but I couldn't find it.

269
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,649
- I...
- She didn't tell you where it was?

270
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,789
- She only gave me a hint.
- What was it?

271
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,220
She wants me to go through the bushes.

272
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,389
But did you hear that?

273
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,129
- She told him to go through the bushes.
- What?

274
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,230
The bushes.

275
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,360
- The bushes?
- Yes.

276
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,559
Where are the bushes? Over here?

277
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,830
- Who told him to check the bushes?
- Yurisa.

278
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,000
- I'm here.
- You said to...

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,269
Pani Bottle has such a light mouth.

280
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,110
The bush?

281
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,539
You told him to check the bushes?

282
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,039
I should check it out too.

283
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,879
- I'll join you.
- Come.

284
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,179
I want to go too.

285
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,919
Shoot.

286
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,320
- Over there.
- What?

287
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,320
- I doubt that she went down there.
- I don't see it.

288
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,720
She only told us...

289
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,360
that there was an altar...

290
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,389
and not the core information.

291
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:50,899
What are they doing?

292
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,240
They're putting on a show of some sort.

293
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,740
Like this.

294
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,710
The little ball launched by Yurisa...

295
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,610
is going far away.

296
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,049
I only told Pani about it, like,

297
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,480
"Check the bushes."

298
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,049
And he told everyone about it.

299
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,049
That led everyone to go outside
and look for it.

300
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,759
Though I feel bad for them,

301
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,590
my chance of surviving increases...

302
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,629
as my competitors are tired.

303
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,460
I watched their show
while feeling sorry and thankful.

304
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,669
(Bloody Mansion)

305
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,080
The funny thing about Acau was...

306
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,919
that he made me think
he wasn't drunk at all,

307
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,320
although he seemed drunk.

308
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,220
I believe he spoke as if he was
under the influence with a purpose.

309
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,289
You can be my enemy.

310
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:46,490
The four of us will be a team.

311
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,629
And he excessively takes a shot
at Kyung Ran.

312
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,700
When you drink without it...

313
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,570
I'm suspicious of Kyung Ran.

314
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,240
I think she's a spy.

315
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,309
No, don't think about that too hard.

316
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,539
There may not even be any spies.

317
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,740
That's not what I mean.

318
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,750
My gut feeling can be pretty sharp,

319
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,679
and she was so suspicious.

320
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,149
I guess he's building it up,

321
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,590
but I can't tell
what he's building it up to.

322
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,820
I'm not sure yet.

323
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,590
Who do you think is the most trustworthy
among the male players?

324
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,629
Solely based...

325
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:26,799
on the person's capabilities
in these games,

326
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,070
I'd say it's Xitsuh as he's experienced.

327
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,639
But to say that he's trustworthy...
You know,

328
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,039
last night, Chungju-Man was very...

329
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,250
Acau is just crazy about playing games,

330
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:45,919
so I don't think...

331
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,279
he can be trusted.

332
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,789
- He just wants to play the game.
- Yes.

333
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,820
I want to be in a proper match.

334
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,860
A proper battle.

335
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,230
I'm confident that I can win
if we have a match.

336
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,000
Acau was...

337
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,600
incredibly immature.

338
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,399
A man with true skills wouldn't be...

339
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,899
as overconfident as he was.

340
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,909
- What game will we play today?
- I wonder what it is.

341
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,639
Who do you think you'll pick
if you have to go to the Deathmatch?

342
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,009
- I asked him that earlier. He said...
- Did you?

343
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,509
I haven't thought about it.

344
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,879
The Deathmatch...

345
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,620
- You won't go?
- I haven't even thought of going there.

346
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,120
And I won't.

347
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,830
It'd be tough to place last, though.

348
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,659
He says that there's no way
he's going to the Deathmatch.

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,230
You don't even plan on going?

350
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,429
There's no way that he'll place last.

351
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,799
- Never.
- You could think that.

352
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,299
I was pretty confident
in any type of game.

353
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,440
Whether it's a card game, calculation,

354
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,610
or memorization,
I'm confident in all of them.

355
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,440
I don't think that I'll be defeated...

356
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,210
by anyone.

357
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,779
I can't tell what they're thinking.

358
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:50,779
(Many people claim
that they're competent.)

359
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,919
I thought about it,

360
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,649
and we have a higher chance
of being selected...

361
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,990
- as a Deathmatch opponent.
- Yes.

362
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,519
If we have to go,
let's not pick each other.

363
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,860
- Sure.
- Aside from that,

364
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,359
we're voting.

365
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,500
We have elimination candidates.

366
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,329
Let's promise not to vote for each other
at times like that.

367
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,539
For instance...

368
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,200
Well, picking a Deathmatch opponent is...

369
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,640
- their choice, so we can't stop them.
- We can't help that.

370
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,509
Let's just not vote for each other.

371
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,009
I tend to handle things on the spot.
I'm a P in the MBTI test.

372
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,910
I'm doing what I need in every situation.

373
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,380
I'm like a mayfly.

374
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,849
I just need to get through this day.

375
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,950
Tomorrow,
I just need to get through that day.

376
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,890
Please gather at the Main Hall.

377
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,930
- We need to go to the Main Hall.
- Yes, I heard.

378
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,329
I hope it's a fun game.

379
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,559
(The Money Challenge begins
at Bloody Mansion and Paradise.)

380
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,630
It's on.

381
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,630
Today's Money Challenge is...

382
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,799
(Mystery Time)

383
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,200
Mystery Time.

384
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,299
- "Time?"
- Before I introduce the game,

385
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,170
I'll tell you the benefit
of winning the Money Challenge.

386
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,980
The winner gets private funds
of 20,000 dollars,

387
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,380
Pandora's Key,

388
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,349
and two Immunity Passes.

389
00:17:58,349 --> 00:17:59,420
Two?

390
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,589
One of them can be transferred
to another player.

391
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,559
I will now explain the rules
of Mystery Time.

392
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,829
Mystery Time is conducted
as an eight-player individual game...

393
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,059
Mystery Time is conducted
as a seven-player individual game...

394
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,400
where participants must use...

395
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,000
reasoning and judgment to deduce
the causal relationships of a given case.

396
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,039
The case is fictional,
unrelated to any real-life events,

397
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,710
and all characters, settings,
and details are...

398
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,079
purely fictional.

399
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,319
Mystery Time consists of two rounds,

400
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,289
during which a description of the case,
related questions,

401
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,619
and an illustration of the case
will be presented,

402
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,759
and players' time
will simultaneously start.

403
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,930
Players can take two actions
in the voting room...

404
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,200
to find the correct answer.

405
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,670
First, upon entering,
they may ask up to three questions,

406
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,400
with each question adding one minute...

407
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,140
to their time.

408
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,509
Second, they may guess the culprit...

409
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:00,539
by identifying
the causal relationships of the case...

410
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,079
and including the specified main keywords.

411
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,619
A correct answer will stop
the player's timer immediately,

412
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,319
while an incorrect answer will add...

413
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,920
five minutes to their time.

414
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,490
(Incorrect)

415
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,259
Players can take both actions...

416
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,829
when entering the voting room.

417
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:20,400
The butler's responses
to questions will be one of four options.

418
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,369
If the question is entirely correct
about the solution,

419
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,140
the butler will respond
with "Yes, that is correct."

420
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,109
If the question is entirely incorrect,

421
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,009
the butler will answer,
"No, that is incorrect."

422
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,210
If the question contains...

423
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,880
both correct and incorrect information,

424
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,019
the response will be "Possibly."

425
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,349
If the question is irrelevant
to the solution,

426
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,720
the butler will respond,
"It is not important."

427
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,390
If 30 minutes pass...

428
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,130
during the round...

429
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,000
or a correct answer is given,

430
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,599
a hint about the case will be provided.

431
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,299
If three players answer correctly,

432
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,569
the round will end.

433
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,380
Any players who have not answered
correctly by this point...

434
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,009
will have 20 minutes added to their time.

435
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,509
At the end of both rounds,

436
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,349
the player with the least time accumulated
wins.

437
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,390
Mystery Time will begin soon.

438
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,619
It seems crucial
to figure out the culprit...

439
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,490
and say the answer.

440
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,759
But your time is added
when you ask questions,

441
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,430
and you get more time
if you guess incorrectly.

442
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,769
We'll need to get as close to the answer
as possible by asking questions...

443
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,339
- Like 20 questions.
- and guess the culprit...

444
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,670
when you figure it out.
It's like 20 questions.

445
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,740
It's 20 questions.

446
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,940
I've been on case-solving programs...

447
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,109
for years now.

448
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,509
I love detective stories,

449
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,079
and I've been on crime shows.

450
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,049
I was told that it required reasoning.

451
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,589
I've done it before,

452
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,289
so I knew what the important parts were.

453
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,390
I was confident.

454
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,460
I thought, "This is a type of game
I'm good at. It should be fun."

455
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,029
It felt new.

456
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,700
I had never seen such a game...

457
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,529
in any other survival shows.

458
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,670
I was intrigued.

459
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,940
It was like a game
that you play with words.

460
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,880
We had to follow the story
and guess the answer.

461
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,910
And my job is related to words.

462
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,450
I thought I stood a chance.

463
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,750
Maybe I can play this well.

464
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,450
My live streaming is
mostly about detective content.

465
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,759
YouTubers make a living...

466
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,690
by creating stories
based on given information.

467
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,230
I thought, "I could win
by figuring out the causal relationship."

468
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,529
It's possibly my strongest field.

469
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,329
I have a feeling
the YouTubers have the upper hand.

470
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,440
I believed in myself too much.

471
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,640
(4 hours later)

472
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,369
No, I'm angry right now, so...

473
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,180
What am I supposed to ask?

474
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,480
Where's Eon Kyu?

475
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,849
I couldn't stand Eon Kyu anymore.
I had to eliminate him myself.

476
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,890
It's hot. Let's sit here.

477
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,019
(Strategy meeting for Money Challenge)

478
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:02,390
We can practically share
all our information.

479
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,789
Isn't it better to form a team of three...

480
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,029
and take from 1st to 3rd places?

481
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,359
The more teammates we have,

482
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,000
- the more questions we ask.
- Right.

483
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,299
Getting 2 to 3 people
who seem like good detectives...

484
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,470
to play together
would have better synergy.

485
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:20,140
It wasn't a type of game I was good at,
so I was worried.

486
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,710
It's about guessing
someone's thoughts, right?

487
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,579
But my thoughts...

488
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,250
were rarely compatible with others.

489
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,450
It's tough for me to find my way...

490
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,160
when there's a set answer.

491
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,460
I don't want to place last.

492
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,329
Who else do you think will be good?

493
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,930
Apart from you and me.

494
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,630
I'm not sure.
None of them really stood out.

495
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,329
I only see those who are bad.

496
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,670
Let's rule them out, then.

497
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,240
- Who are the bad ones?
- Pani.

498
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,210
- Pani? I agree.
- Right?

499
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,009
- MJ doesn't seem so good at this either.
- Right.

500
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,079
So, she's out.

501
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,880
- I don't think Dong Min will join us.
- He won't.

502
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,450
Eon Kyu is the easiest target to approach.

503
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,720
You two decided to play together, right?

504
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Yes.

505
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,049
We're thinking of inviting you
as our final teammate. What do you say?

506
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,289
- I'd like that.
- Good.

507
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,089
- Are you done talking...
- What?

508
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,130
- with Yurisa?
- Yes.

509
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,390
- You are? Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

510
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,430
Sure.

511
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:12,900
Have you decided on anything?

512
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,799
I talked to Yurisa
about how to play this game.

513
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,099
How should I put this?

514
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,970
When it's a team of three,

515
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,269
one person can't get the Immunity Pass.

516
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,339
Right.

517
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,710
And there are two elimination candidates,
right?

518
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,750
- Yes.
- Is there a way to survive the voting?

519
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,980
Then, three people can play together.

520
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,619
- By not voting for him?
- Exactly.

521
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,180
- To save him?
- Yes, like yesterday.

522
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,220
- That's also possible.
- If we can do that,

523
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,119
I'm willing to risk that
and join a three-person team.

524
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,329
- Are you going to play with Yurisa?
- What?

525
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,660
- Are you going to play with Yurisa?
- It looks like it.

526
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,759
- Really?
- Yes.

527
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,259
But Yurisa won't want me on her team.

528
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,130
I haven't talked to her about that.

529
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,470
Just know that, then.

530
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,500
(Contemplating)

531
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,079
Here's what Pani is saying.

532
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,410
There are only two Immunity Passes,

533
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,480
so the third teammate can't get it.

534
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,710
He says he's willing to risk that...

535
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,450
but wants us to vote for someone else
in the end.

536
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,390
That way, he can live.

537
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,089
He says that's all he asks.

538
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:13,059
He's practically giving us questions
for free.

539
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,720
Precisely. He came straight to us.

540
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,630
I talked to Sinsaimdang earlier,

541
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,700
and he said that he talked to you
and that the alliance...

542
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,369
wasn't 100 percent solid.

543
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,940
So,

544
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,869
it might be better to have Pani
who's trustworthy.

545
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,369
I talked to Jin Ho and her,

546
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,710
but I'm not 100 percent sure
about this team at the moment.

547
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,210
Okay.

548
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
- Is that right?
- Yes.

549
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,950
But he clearly said to me,
"I'd like that."

550
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,450
Just now...

551
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,789
Eon Kyu said, "I'd love that, Jin Ho,"

552
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,289
so we wrapped it up
by deciding to be a three-person team.

553
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,869
Then, Pani came to me
and said he wanted to join us.

554
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,470
But I couldn't give him a sure answer
because we had Eon Kyu.

555
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,470
But then...

556
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,339
There are two Immunity Passes,

557
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,170
so most people will go
with two-person teams.

558
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,809
So, we decided to form a two-man team.

559
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,549
It turned out that Eon Kyu had already
formed a team with Si Yoon.

560
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,549
I was a bit thrown off by that.

561
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:12,819
I was like, "What is this guy?"

562
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,480
I should look for Pani.

563
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,190
Pani!

564
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,089
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

565
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,059
Have you decided on anything?

566
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,460
- Have I decided on anything?
- Yes.

567
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,559
I reckoned that I should never form
a team with someone...

568
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,470
who told the truth...

569
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,470
or someone who played tricks.

570
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,369
So, MJ Kim was the first person
that came to my mind.

571
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,140
And the next person was Pani Bottle.

572
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:42,049
I think it's better
to form a team of three.

573
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,880
- I'm thinking the same.
- Okay.

574
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,619
I brought it up nonchalantly,

575
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,250
and these two were up for it...

576
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,920
and wanted to make a team of three.

577
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,150
- The three of you?
- Yes.

578
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,720
But he's been snooping around...

579
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,859
and talking to other people,

580
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,200
so I was like, "Screw it. You're out."

581
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:00,900
But Seong Beom was next to me,

582
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,900
and he wasn't a bad choice.

583
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,500
So, my last train is gone.
It's already left.

584
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,470
Is Pani over there?

585
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,240
- Pani!
- Yes.

586
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Come here.

587
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
- Me?
- Yes.

588
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,779
- About what you said to me...
- Yes.

589
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,980
I talked to Yurisa about it,

590
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,319
and she said she was fine with it.

591
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:23,150
Then, let's give it a try.
The three of us.

592
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,960
We're going to trust each other,
no matter what, right?

593
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,990
Yes, 100 percent.

594
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,430
We still need to be on good terms
with the other two teams.

595
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,400
I was pretty anxious
because it wasn't a sure win.

596
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,529
There will be three people
who guess the correct answer, right?

597
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,299
We can be the 3 winners in Round 1.

598
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,410
And we can be the 3 winners in Round 2.

599
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,940
What I keep saying is a landslide victory.

600
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,779
I had zero anxiety.

601
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,279
Though I win every time,

602
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,279
I'm hungrier for victory than anybody.

603
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,990
(Meanwhile, in Bloody Mansion)

604
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,990
Three people.

605
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,559
We have too little information at first,

606
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,890
so why don't all 7 of us go inside
and ask 1 question...

607
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,660
to share the time?

608
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:11,230
I don't see the need
to have everyone ask questions...

609
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,640
and share our opinions.

610
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,710
There has to be a loser, after all.

611
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,869
We should split into teams.

612
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,240
Teams of 2 or 3 sound...

613
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,210
- Ideal?
- ideal to me.

614
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,880
You quietly went to him as you said that.

615
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,250
- To Xitsuh.
- We already agreed to play together.

616
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,289
- Did you?
- Yes.

617
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,750
Seriously?

618
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,589
- When did you find the time to do that?
- Is that allowed?

619
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,019
- When...
- Are you two a team?

620
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,490
He asked me first, so I said yes.

621
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,529
A team of two?

622
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,329
To be honest, I don't think it matters
whether it's 2 people or 3 people.

623
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,230
A four-person team sounds pointless.

624
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,470
Steve,

625
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,839
how about you and I form a team of two?

626
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,339
I'm fine with anyone.

627
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,049
Do you want to play with me?

628
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,579
Just like that?

629
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,650
I have two offers already?

630
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,319
You can do whatever you want, Acau.

631
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,089
You asked me to play together, after all.

632
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:07,089
If you think you'll need more teammates...

633
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:09,990
Well, I think there will always be
pros and cons whether we have...

634
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,329
- three, four, or five people.
- Right.

635
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,329
It's pretty much the same
up to three people.

636
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,029
That's the same.

637
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,369
- Then, can I join you?
- I don't mind.

638
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,369
I mean...

639
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,740
I was thinking of teaming up with her...

640
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,710
and sharing the information with them.

641
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,410
- If you two were to form a team.
- I'm fine with that.

642
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,940
Because Min A asked Steve to form a team.

643
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,950
- Oh, in that case?
- Yes.

644
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,549
But he rejected it.

645
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,450
- He didn't reject you.
- That wasn't a rejection.

646
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,150
Didn't he say he didn't care?

647
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,849
- They don't mind either.
- I don't mind.

648
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,150
I think they gave the same answer.

649
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,289
Min A suddenly...

650
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:45,359
joined other people.

651
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,670
Seeing her switch to other teams,
thinking, "They seem strong,"

652
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,329
I thought,

653
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,869
"I guess she's not so confident
about her own skills."

654
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:56,109
Kyung Ran and Gina didn't seem...

655
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,240
like people
who were good at this type of game,

656
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,380
so I didn't want to join them.

657
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,079
Or the potential teammates can...

658
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,420
go to separate rooms and talk about it.

659
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,960
Can we talk about my offer?

660
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,420
- Sure.
- This way.

661
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,289
Why don't you have me on your team
in this round?

662
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,329
Let's talk about it downstairs.

663
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,359
- Okay.
- We'll figure it out.

664
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,559
We'll talk here, then.

665
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,839
(The players in the Mansion split up.)

666
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,480
We agreed to play together
in other games, so...

667
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,109
Compared to my expectations, Min A was...

668
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,210
Yes, she was quick.

669
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,619
I was surprised when she swooped in.

670
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,250
- Right.
- I thought she was joining him, but...

671
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,190
She went over there
because she wanted to play with Xitsuh,

672
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,859
but they were already a team,

673
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,589
- and Steve didn't have a team yet.
- I don't think she wants to play with us.

674
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:50,789
I guess not.

675
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,299
Earlier, she talked
about supporting each other,

676
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,730
and she left instantly. That was fast.

677
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,839
I have a question.

678
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:01,099
This morning, you said...

679
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,309
that you were considering an alliance
of four people.

680
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,440
What we talked about in the morning was
3 people plus 1.

681
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Yes.

682
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,650
The three people
who talked in the morning,

683
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,180
- Xitsuh, and Min A.
- Yes.

684
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,079
(This morning)

685
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,549
- You're up.
- Hey.

686
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,420
Chungju-Man, Acau, and I talked,

687
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:22,289
and our original plan was
to eliminate Kyung Ran today.

688
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,130
We were planning to bring
Xitsuh and Min A into it.

689
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,259
We talked about that early in the morning.

690
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,970
Then, the game began,
and Acau sided with Xitsuh right away...

691
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,700
and notified us.

692
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,869
Chungju-Man and I were talking...

693
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,809
about whether it was betrayal or not.

694
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,240
I'm not sure what Acau is thinking,
though.

695
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,480
He didn't inform us beforehand, though.

696
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,980
- You didn't know, did you?
- No.

697
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,809
It seems to me like...

698
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,220
they're a solid team now.

699
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,690
I honestly wonder what Acau is thinking.

700
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,390
I feel like I should talk to him.

701
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,589
- Yes, go and talk to him.
- I'll talk to him first.

702
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,160
- Yes?
- We were talking about you.

703
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,289
What about me?

704
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,200
We weren't.

705
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,569
- I was joking.
- You can come in.

706
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,500
Is your strategy to get information
from us one by one?

707
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,509
No, that's not it. I'm here to talk...

708
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,440
- about our chat in the morning.
- Right.

709
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,109
Are we still executing that?

710
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,950
- We were just talking about it.
- Right.

711
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,619
I'll bring you up to speed.
It's gotten complicated.

712
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,349
The eliminated player picks
two people, right?

713
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,819
If our teammates who carried us
in the Money Challenge...

714
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,859
are selected, it's the same
as being elimination candidates.

715
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,960
- Right.
- That's true.

716
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,390
So, the person...

717
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,630
in the best position possible
at the moment is Gina.

718
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,630
I see.

719
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,430
If Kyung Ran becomes
an elimination candidate,

720
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,369
- she'll never pick Gina.
- Never.

721
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm jealous of Gina.

722
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,410
- You're right.
- That's also true.

723
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,240
- Because...
- Right.

724
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Come in.

725
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:49,809
- Hey, there.
- Why is everyone here?

726
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,380
- We were...
- Are the four of you scheming?

727
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,119
talking about the unfairness of this game.

728
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,220
I'm jealous of the team
that has an elimination candidate.

729
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,690
Honestly, it's...

730
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,519
- Whatever.
- They're all here.

731
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,359
- Everyone's here.
- Come on in.

732
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,730
- We're all here?
- What's going on?

733
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,900
- Yes.
- How did this happen?

734
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,559
I came to check
if these four were scheming,

735
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,829
and they said they were talking
about something else.

736
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:09,869
We were talking about how unfair it was.

737
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,099
We weren't scheming.

738
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,200
- We were talking about something else.
- What was the subject?

739
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
We're all teams of two,

740
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,769
but you have three teammates.

741
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,509
Yes, we might have the upper hand,

742
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,180
but it's also unfair to us.

743
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,279
Say that one of us places first.

744
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,750
Who should get the Immunity Pass?

745
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,650
So, what's the three-person team's plan?

746
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,519
You all came in as we were talking
about the unfairness.

747
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,849
- So...
- We haven't come up with a plan yet.

748
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,819
I was explaining to them
that we should keep that in mind.

749
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,119
We don't have a plan yet.

750
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,130
We can't play by targeting someone either.

751
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,799
I wanted to talk strategy,

752
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,829
but other teams weren't so happy
with us strategizing,

753
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,500
so we went into our room.

754
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,440
We didn't really have time to strategize.

755
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,569
I was bothered by everyone in the room.

756
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,539
They all got under my skin.
Why did they even come in?

757
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,910
We just wanted to talk.
We didn't disturb them.

758
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,750
I don't get why they do that.

759
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,759
My head hurts.

760
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,259
I don't have a plan.

761
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:14,160
(The strategy meeting ends.)

762
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,630
Now, Mystery Time will begin.

763
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,700
Here is the question and illustration
of Round One.

764
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,339
Okay.

765
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,750
They're kissing.

766
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,480
Chris met Violet at the hotel
for a special occasion.

767
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,720
One hour later, Violet was found dead.

768
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,690
What's the full story behind the incident?

769
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,460
- That's it?
- Yes.

770
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,589
The outline?

771
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,160
"Chris met Violet at the hotel
for a special occasion."

772
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,299
And Violet was found dead an hour later.

773
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,529
Yes.

774
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,099
There's a high chance
that it's infidelity.

775
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:53,400
Is that so?

776
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,240
A poisoned cake sounds too easy
to be the answer.

777
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,539
There are 4 main keywords in Round 1.

778
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,710
Four.

779
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:03,009
And two extra keywords.

780
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:08,550
I checked the illustration,
and there were snowflakes on the cake,

781
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,389
and the two were kissing.

782
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:16,860
I believed that one of the keywords
must be about their relationship.

783
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,000
As soon as I saw it, I thought
they were a couple as they were kissing.

784
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,369
I saw the top of a skyscraper
out the window in the back.

785
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,070
I had two guesses.

786
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,369
Death from a fall or poison.

787
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,579
It should be a room
close to the voting room.

788
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,780
- Someone's already here.
- Yes.

789
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,650
He met Violet at the hotel.

790
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,480
The special occasion must be Christmas.

791
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,179
- Right. I also thought...
- Yes.

792
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,579
- it was Christmas because of that.
- Yes, the winter decorations.

793
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,050
And Violet was found dead.

794
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,849
I'm starting to get it.

795
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,989
He met Violet at the hotel,

796
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,659
but he wasn't there to meet her.

797
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,090
Violet saw him kissing another girl...

798
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,530
and committed suicide.

799
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,769
There's no proof that these two are...

800
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,530
- Chris and Violet.
- Right.

801
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,400
Chris and Violet are the actual couple,

802
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,269
and Violet might not be
in the illustration.

803
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,179
Then, we could ask this.

804
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,510
"Is the woman..."

805
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,079
"Chris kissed on Christmas Violet?"

806
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,420
- We want to ask two things.
- Yes.

807
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,789
We think that Christmas is
one of the main keywords.

808
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:19,719
We need to know if it is Christmas.

809
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:22,730
Second, we need to know
if that woman is Violet.

810
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,260
- Yes.
- That's what we want to know.

811
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,159
- It's about how we frame the question...
- Okay.

812
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,199
- to ask two things.
- Yes.

813
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,400
To save our questions,
we should ask two at a time.

814
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,230
- That must be the maximum.
- Yes.

815
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,599
We wanted to save time
by not asking too many questions.

816
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:38,139
We talked about asking a question
to figure out...

817
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,679
two things at the same time.

818
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,679
- Pani Bottle, will you ask questions?
- Yes.

819
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:47,280
Did Chris meet someone else on Christmas?

820
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,119
Yes, that is correct.

821
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,960
Pani Bottle, 1 minute is added
for asking 1 question.

822
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,019
Okay.

823
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,030
- Now...
- Then...

824
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,030
- Speak quietly.
- I asked,

825
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,699
"Did Chris meet someone else
on Christmas,"

826
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,969
- and she said, "Yes."
- We were right.

827
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:06,300
So, it was Christmas.

828
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,269
- Yes, that's also true.
- It was Christmas.

829
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,369
- Two things we want to know.
- Yes.

830
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,510
Is the woman in the illustration Violet?

831
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,440
Has Violet committed suicide?

832
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,780
- I'll ask that.
- No, I can ask that.

833
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,150
- We still need to ask more questions.
- What?

834
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,320
You two can go together.
Go and ask one more question.

835
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,050
We're still safe.

836
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,119
Is the woman in the illustration Violet?

837
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,289
Has Violet committed suicide?

838
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,829
This is fun.

839
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,730
We'll have ruled out most of them
when we figure this out.

840
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,429
- She is Violet.
- Okay.

841
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,329
And it wasn't suicide.

842
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,000
- So, it was murder?
- We don't know that.

843
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,699
Then, we need to know
if it was murder or an accident.

844
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,809
Our best guess is
that the cake is poisoned.

845
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,739
There's cake,
so that must be important evidence.

846
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,250
But a poisoned cake sounds too easy.

847
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,679
But here's the thing.

848
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,480
If we ask, "Is the cake poisoned,"

849
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,119
we can't know if she died
because of the cake...

850
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,849
if the answer is "No, it's incorrect."

851
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:56,889
We should ask,

852
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,619
- "Did she die because of the cake?"
- "Is the cake related to her death?"

853
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,920
"Is it related to her death?"

854
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,289
We should probably ask about things
in the minimum classification.

855
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:07,599
I enjoy solving cases,

856
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,230
and I've been on such shows
for a long time.

857
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,440
I learned a lot
from criminal profilers and detectives,

858
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:16,469
and it was that an investigation was
about narrowing it down.

859
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,039
Or he put a diamond ring inside the cake
to propose to her,

860
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,409
and she ate it without knowing that...

861
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,050
and choked to death.

862
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,050
- Or they never met before.
- Was it deliberate?

863
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,750
- Yes, that's important.
- Was it deliberate?

864
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,519
It could have been a mistake.
A diamond ring is a mistake.

865
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,590
Was the death intentional?

866
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,420
If it was an accident
and she died because of the cake,

867
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,090
It could have been a ring...

868
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,289
- Or an allergy.
- Yes.

869
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,159
It could be one of those things.

870
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:45,130
Was Violet's death premeditated?

871
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,269
No, that is incorrect.

872
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,110
Did Violet die because of the cake?

873
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,409
Yes, that is correct.

874
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,710
- Yes.
- Yes?

875
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,909
- She died because of the cake?
- Yes.

876
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,679
It wasn't premeditated.

877
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,349
- So, it was a mistake.
- Right.

878
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,909
It was an accidental death
due to the cake.

879
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:04,050
I think we chose excellent questions
to ask at first.

880
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:05,690
The death wasn't premeditated.

881
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,760
That's what sped up our process.

882
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,659
Thankfully, Dong Min tipped me off.

883
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,559
He said that his first question...

884
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,630
was if it was premeditated.

885
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
And that sounded plausible.

886
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,800
If it was an accidental death,

887
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,340
it rules out so many other possibilities.
It was a good question.

888
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,739
- She said, "It's not important."
- I think this is the correct answer.

889
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,150
Can you just give it a go?

890
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,650
- No.
- No, that's too soon.

891
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,820
- It's too soon.
- It's too soon.

892
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,119
I was like, "Already?"

893
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,920
"But we don't know anything."

894
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,090
I believe that it connects everything...

895
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,920
once we have this information.

896
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,989
As soon as I heard it,
I knew it was a great question.

897
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,599
I thought, "We're unlikely to lose."

898
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,570
I'll tell you my strategy.

899
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,570
We need to make the questions
as long as possible...

900
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:55,570
and see if we get, "Possibly."

901
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,409
- Okay.
- You get it, right?

902
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,280
I'll give you an example.

903
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,380
We want to check if Chris killed her...

904
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,110
and if the cake was poisoned.

905
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,050
We keep writing the things
we want to know.

906
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,590
Then, we turn those
into a single question...

907
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,250
and figure out if the keyword is there.

908
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,590
- Then, we can know.
- Yes.

909
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,190
- Okay.
- Then, we only ask one question.

910
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,630
- Okay.
- When we hear, "Possibly,"

911
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,260
we know that it's here.

912
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,570
I chose a strategy to prove our ideas.

913
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,239
Maybe it wasn't a fight between them
and a third party was involved.

914
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,440
Maybe it wasn't murder.

915
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,510
It could have been unintentional murder.

916
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,610
Did a third party,

917
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,780
driven by emotional issues
regarding Chris or Violet,

918
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,349
intervene between Chris and Violet,

919
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,920
leading to Violet's death,

920
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,929
rather than it being an incident
directly between Chris and Violet?

921
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,389
Yes, that is correct.

922
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,099
(Yes, that is correct.)

923
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:56,800
I thought, "No way."

924
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,239
"We're on the right track."

925
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:01,940
"We might win this."

926
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,469
Let's end the game
with our second question.

927
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,550
(The woman in the illustration is Violet.)

928
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,309
(Violet's death wasn't premeditated.)

929
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,050
(Violet's death is related to the cake.)

930
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,219
We will now take questions
about the first case.

931
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,420
We are accepting questions.

932
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,920
(Chris met Violet at the hotel
for a special occasion.)

933
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,420
(One hour later, Violet was found dead.)

934
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,760
Shall we go down?

935
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,190
Wait a second.

936
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,690
Are you done?

937
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,929
Let's go.

938
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,000
Time is ticking.

939
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,199
We have to solve this as a team.

940
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,199
We need to see
if we're going the right way.

941
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,969
Do we have to solve it too?

942
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,110
It would be better if we did.

943
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,610
Were you planning to not do anything?

944
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,079
You haven't forgotten our purpose,
have you?

945
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,719
- I remember.
- It's survival.

946
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,380
- You're not...
- After we solve it, we can...

947
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,150
aiming to be cool, are you?

948
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,820
It's not that.

949
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,590
What is the other team planning to do?

950
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,960
Have you talked to them?

951
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,559
What did Acau say?

952
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,389
I heard...

953
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,860
They're planning to betray, aren't they?

954
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,730
Let's say we have an advantage.

955
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,800
Then we're planning to share it with you,

956
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,969
but not from the start.

957
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:08,300
That means they'll play this separately.

958
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,969
But they don't say it that way.

959
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:14,440
How about we team up into four?

960
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,579
Four?

961
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:20,650
(Are they going to team up
with Kim Kyung Ran and Lee Gina?)

962
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,889
Forming a team of four
might actually be a good idea.

963
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,650
You make the decision.

964
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,590
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Yes?

965
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,329
- How about we team up together?
- How?

966
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,400
How are we going to do that?

967
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,559
It's going to be
us 4 versus the 3 of them.

968
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,300
What kind of deal are we talking about?

969
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:40,539
Let's say one of us wins.

970
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,039
Then we should give someone
the Immunity Pass.

971
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,070
Okay.

972
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,739
And if someone gets chosen
for a Deathmatch,

973
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,079
then we have to use an extra vote
to save that person.

974
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,150
- We'll join only if you agree on that.
- Sounds fair.

975
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,079
This is about who gathers
the most information anyway.

976
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,190
I thought that would be an advantage
in order to win.

977
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,360
It wouldn't be such a bad idea
if someone got eliminated from our team.

978
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,119
I think
the four of them are going to team up.

979
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,090
They lack information.

980
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,659
That's probably why they teamed up.

981
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,630
That's the worst case scenario.

982
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,769
They could team up on the condition
that they don't choose...

983
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:11,530
each other if they lose.

984
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,869
Right.

985
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,670
Should we make it obvious
that we've teamed up?

986
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:18,909
Don't you think it's better that we don't?

987
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,380
Let's talk separately...

988
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,880
and come up with some questions.

989
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,150
Really? Would it be better that way?

990
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,519
They're probably busy
thinking of questions.

991
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,719
Just in case.

992
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,349
We don't know that.

993
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:35,719
I think we have a better chance.

994
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes, we should only share appropriately.

995
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,199
We still have an advantage over them.

996
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,670
Let's just work together
since we've decided to do so.

997
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,869
It could look suspicious.

998
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,030
He said we might end up
doubting each other.

999
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,369
- You mean between us?
- Yes.

1000
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,840
- It could lead to a misunderstanding.
- Okay.

1001
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,269
Why don't you try
coming up with your story first?

1002
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,139
We were also writing it
based on our own perspective.

1003
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,110
We have to come up with questions first.

1004
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,480
- We're not yet done with ours.
- Try coming up with your own story first.

1005
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,250
We'll go ahead and write our story then.

1006
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,250
- This might actually be the flow.
- In my opinion,

1007
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,650
- Hear me out.
- this seems right.

1008
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:06,789
- I think we should do this.
- This sounds more like it.

1009
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:07,820
- I think this is right.
- I agree.

1010
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,360
- I think we should go with this.
- You're right.

1011
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:10,989
So what we know now...

1012
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:15,969
Don't whisper.

1013
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,269
We have to come up
with a conclusion between us first.

1014
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,570
It's okay if we hear it.

1015
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,110
(Ventriloquism)

1016
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,809
Because if we do it the other way,
we'll end up...

1017
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,079
Or...

1018
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,050
We have a question.

1019
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,150
What do you think of this?

1020
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,449
"Is it a suicide?"

1021
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:35,750
"Is Chris a man?"

1022
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,190
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

1023
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,320
Go on.

1024
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,090
Did Violet commit suicide?

1025
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,559
No, that is incorrect.

1026
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,230
Is Chris a man?

1027
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,489
Yes, that is correct.

1028
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,059
What could be another important question?

1029
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,199
The reason and method.

1030
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,900
I think these three are good questions.

1031
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,099
"Is Chris the one who murdered Violet?"

1032
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,440
- Was it intentional?
- "Was it an intended murder?"

1033
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,670
I think these are the important questions.

1034
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:57,369
Let's add one more,
then you can go ask the questions.

1035
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:58,670
- What do you think?
- They should go ask the questions.

1036
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,210
- It would be better that way.
- Right.

1037
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:01,639
We'll take turns.

1038
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,150
Chungju-Man and Steve were on one side,

1039
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,550
and Gina and I were on one side.

1040
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,389
We took turns asking the questions.

1041
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,230
Because we strictly followed that rule,

1042
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,599
we can't really say we were a team.

1043
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,369
It was more like
an exchange of information.

1044
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:25,670
I thought it would be fair to take turns.

1045
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,300
Isn't it more logical to take turns?

1046
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,670
We need to ask closed-ended questions
to obtain as much information as we can.

1047
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,110
Shouldn't we ask if she was murdered?

1048
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,110
It's either a suicide, murder,

1049
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,010
or an accident.

1050
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,750
I'll go and ask first.

1051
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,050
Because they accepted me,
I needed to do something in return.

1052
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,860
I decided to go and ask the question.

1053
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,260
Was Violet murdered?

1054
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,530
No, that is not correct.

1055
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,960
- Was it a suicide?
- No, that is not correct.

1056
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,599
(Thinking hard)

1057
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:00,039
Is eating the cake the cause of her death?

1058
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,239
Yes, that is correct.

1059
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,739
You have asked three questions,

1060
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,170
so you have received three extra minutes.

1061
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,739
Great.

1062
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,340
Eating the cake was
the cause of her death.

1063
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
- Then it's an accident.
- Right.

1064
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,920
What about this?
They said she didn't have a ring.

1065
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,489
- That's right.
- The ring must've been inside the cake.

1066
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:19,389
It got stuck in her throat, and she died.

1067
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,829
I'll go ask if Chris was the one
who bought the cake.

1068
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,599
Okay, go ask if Chris prepared the cake.

1069
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,329
(Kim Min A went to ask again.)

1070
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,800
I had faith in this team,

1071
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,500
so I thought they would save me...

1072
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,469
even by using all the money.

1073
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,969
Did Chris prepare the cake?

1074
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,340
Yes, that is correct.

1075
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:41,309
I'll go and ask the question...

1076
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,849
if it was suffocation,
and if the ring caused the suffocation.

1077
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:45,949
Right.

1078
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,679
I thought...

1079
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,389
one of the keywords would be
the cause of her death.

1080
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:53,889
Was her death caused by suffocation?

1081
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,519
Possibly.

1082
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,730
Was there a ring inside the cake?

1083
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,329
(Was there a ring inside the cake?)

1084
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,929
Jang Dong Min,
would you like to ask a question?

1085
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,599
Did Violet die...

1086
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,639
because of something in the cake?

1087
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,480
It wasn't a planned murder,
but it was because of the cake.

1088
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,619
We need to sort out the relationship.

1089
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,449
We need to know what kind
of relationship Chris and Violet were in.

1090
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,820
We don't know if they were lovers...

1091
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,559
- or if they were married.
- You're right.

1092
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,760
They might not even be lovers.

1093
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:34,230
Were they an ordinary couple?

1094
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,170
No, that is not correct.

1095
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,539
They weren't an ordinary couple.

1096
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:40,900
- They weren't?
- No.

1097
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,440
This is giving me chills.

1098
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,110
Let's ask if she had any allergies...

1099
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,309
or if there was something inside the cake.

1100
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,909
Since they weren't
in an ordinary relationship,

1101
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,110
then it wasn't because of the ring.

1102
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,179
Since the cake caused her death,
it must've been an allergy.

1103
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,019
Let's ask if it was an allergy.

1104
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,650
An allergy?

1105
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,920
But it could be poison
instead of an allergy.

1106
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,090
It could've been caused
by a chemical reaction.

1107
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,260
- That will be too vague.
- Right.

1108
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,389
- So it's an allergy.
- It wasn't an intended murder.

1109
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,460
It wasn't.

1110
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,900
Okay.

1111
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,599
Did Violet die...

1112
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,769
because of an allergic reaction
to the cake?

1113
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,469
Was there a ring inside the cake?

1114
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,480
No, that is not correct.

1115
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,679
Yes, that is correct.

1116
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,280
Jang Dong Min, by asking 1 question,
you have received 1 extra minute.

1117
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,849
An extra minute!

1118
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,260
(A new keyword, allergy)

1119
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,389
It's allergy!

1120
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:36,460
It was an allergy.

1121
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,760
We came up with plans A to D.

1122
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,059
We started with questions
that seemed most likely,

1123
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,099
then we narrowed down,
which turned out to be a good idea.

1124
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,639
It must be an allergy then.

1125
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,099
- She must've had an allergic reaction.
- I'll go ask now.

1126
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,139
Did Violet die because of an allergy?

1127
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,110
We were right. It was an allergy.

1128
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,139
(They confirm it was an allergy.)

1129
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,449
We were right.

1130
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:00,219
(Main keywords for Round One: allergy)

1131
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,179
One more thing we need to know is...

1132
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,349
what kind of relationship they had...

1133
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,559
that he bought a cake,
not knowing she was allergic to it.

1134
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,260
We need to know that.

1135
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,230
They probably hadn't known
each other for that long.

1136
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:12,960
They're not close.

1137
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,559
Either they met for the first time...

1138
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,429
Yes, it probably wasn't that long
since they met.

1139
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,670
I asked if the cake caused her death,
and that's right.

1140
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:24,139
- In that case...
- Next,

1141
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:25,710
what about this?

1142
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,309
I don't think that's important at all.

1143
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,250
- You think so?
- Why would that matter?

1144
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,920
If it was an affair, we should ask...

1145
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,019
- whether it was by Chris or Violet.
- I don't think we don't need to ask that.

1146
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,389
- You don't think so?
- We don't need to ask that.

1147
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,219
We can skip that question.

1148
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,800
What should we ask first?

1149
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,630
- If it was death by suffocation.
- Suffocation.

1150
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,400
But there's no other answer than that.

1151
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,570
Do we need to ask that?

1152
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,769
There's no other cause.

1153
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,099
We can't think of any other cause.

1154
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:59,940
I didn't really understand Steve's story.

1155
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:02,809
We were working on this together.

1156
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,110
I lost the motivation.

1157
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,280
I think it was the words he used...

1158
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,320
while we were exchanging opinions.

1159
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,190
Your questions don't make any sense.

1160
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,320
Let's skip those.

1161
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,519
He must have something to do with it.

1162
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:15,760
We don't need to ask that.

1163
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,289
No, wait.

1164
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,900
We're doing this as a team.

1165
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,199
I don't like it
when someone is too assertive.

1166
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:26,099
That's how I felt while playing this game.

1167
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,400
I think we need to ask this first...

1168
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,070
whether it's true or not.

1169
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:34,210
- Here is the first hint.
- Is it already time?

1170
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,949
Chris and Violet are not lovers.

1171
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,679
(First hint:
Chris and Violet are not lovers.)

1172
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:42,380
But the way they're kissing
looks like they're in love.

1173
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,820
They can't be siblings, right?

1174
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,389
Chris and Violet are not lovers.

1175
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:51,789
So they weren't lovers?

1176
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,559
If they're not lovers,
then they must be having an affair.

1177
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,730
Why are they standing that way
if they aren't lovers?

1178
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:00,170
- What's going on?
- They must be married.

1179
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,340
They were married.

1180
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:05,239
They're not lovers,
so they must be married.

1181
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:06,840
No, married couples are called lovers too.

1182
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,440
No, we don't usually call them lovers.

1183
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,480
Do we refer to people
having an affair as lovers?

1184
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,119
- We call them lovers.
- Right.

1185
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,550
Then they're not having an affair
but just a fling.

1186
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:19,860
How do you kiss so passionately
when you're not lovers?

1187
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,190
Are they celebrating
their special day at a hotel?

1188
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,460
I don't think they're a legitimate couple.
They look like they are having an affair.

1189
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,489
- It might be a one-night stand.
- Right.

1190
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,500
They met through a dating application.

1191
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,760
I think they ran into each other.

1192
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,630
It's not for a proposal, is it?

1193
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,539
They could be a married couple
in the first place.

1194
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,570
Being a couple can't be a hint.

1195
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,840
The keyword is a couple,
so it can be a hint.

1196
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,840
Then let's ask,
"Are they a married couple?"

1197
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,909
I'll go ask.

1198
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:42,780
Are Chris and Violet a married couple?

1199
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,750
What I'm more curious about is whether
there's a third party in this case.

1200
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,250
Is someone else related to the case?

1201
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:51,050
- Go and ask that.
- I will.

1202
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,489
Is there someone else related to the case?

1203
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,860
When it comes to Violet's death,

1204
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,630
is there a third party involved
beside Violet and Chris?

1205
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,840
- Our guess is right.
- All right.

1206
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,380
- Then is it an affair?
- That means they were having an affair.

1207
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,610
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake.

1208
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,949
Then what caused the mistake?

1209
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:26,420
Darn it. This is tough.

1210
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:31,860
Even if we're asking questions,
we're getting fewer clues...

1211
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,530
- than we thought.
- Right.

1212
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:36,570
I think other teams would have asked
similar questions.

1213
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,070
They wouldn't have made
much progress, as I see.

1214
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,369
This is harder than I thought.

1215
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,769
- Is someone in there?
- Yes.

1216
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:44,869
- It's Dong Min.
- Are you going to ask a question?

1217
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:45,909
- Yes.
- Both of you?

1218
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:46,909
- Yes.
- I see.

1219
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,239
People are waiting in line.

1220
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,349
- Are they waiting in line?
- Yes.

1221
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,409
- Who's in there?
- It's Dong Min.

1222
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,780
And there are two more people waiting.

1223
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,619
Are those two in the same team?

1224
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,929
This is crazy. We might take
the last place if things go this way.

1225
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,199
- Right.
- We wasted three questions in vain.

1226
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,699
- I'm furious.
- What happened?

1227
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,699
"Are Chris and Violet a married couple?"
"No."

1228
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,739
"Are Chris and Violet family?"
"No."

1229
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:16,909
"Are Chris and Violet having an affair?"
"No."

1230
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,070
- What's going on?
- I asked since I was dumbfounded.

1231
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,639
They're not a married couple or lovers.

1232
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,280
They're not lovers,
and they're not having an affair either.

1233
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,079
So what I thought was, "Are they family?"

1234
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,349
Actors.

1235
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:28,550
No, I don't think so.

1236
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:31,550
No way.
Is it something like an escort service?

1237
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,159
- The second hint will be revealed.
- Already?

1238
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,360
- Why?
- Someone got the answer.

1239
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,429
- Is that so?
- I think someone got it.

1240
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:39,559
This means someone got it.

1241
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:41,730
- The second hint will be revealed.
- What?

1242
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,030
(The second hint is also announced
in Bloody Paradise.)

1243
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,900
This is the first time
Chris and Violet meet.

1244
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,400
(Second hint: This is the first time
Chris and Violet meet.)

1245
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:53,170
Already?

1246
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,579
Then Dong Min got the answer.
And it will be the beginning.

1247
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:58,809
- It will be the beginning.
- Right.

1248
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:05,949
(The first answerer in Bloody Paradise,
Jang Dong Min)

1249
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,119
I think three people here got the answer.

1250
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:14,059
This is the first time they're meeting?
I'm speechless.

1251
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:16,030
Do people kiss like that
when they first see each other?

1252
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,070
Heo Seong Beom, you got the answer.

1253
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,269
(The second answerer in Bloody Paradise,
Heo Seong Beom)

1254
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,300
MJ Kim, you got the answer.

1255
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,210
With one more additional keyword,

1256
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,179
two minutes will be deducted
from MJ Kim's time.

1257
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,909
The game is over.

1258
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,380
Round One of the Money Challenge
in Bloody Paradise ends.

1259
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,489
(Meanwhile, in Bloody Mansion)

1260
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,090
- What did you say?
- They're seeing for the first time.

1261
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,889
- Then it's something like...
- A random chat.

1262
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,230
Isn't it?

1263
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,159
- An escort service.
- But it's a special day.

1264
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,570
- Is something in the picture wrong?
- An escort service?

1265
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,300
- I'll go ask.
- Okay.

1266
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,440
Seriously.

1267
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,010
We're getting close to the answer.

1268
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,269
- How come we're not getting it here?
- I know.

1269
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,340
- What's the keyword?
- This is so unexpected.

1270
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,480
I'm so stressed out.

1271
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,449
- I guess you didn't get what you wanted.
- I'm angry.

1272
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,750
- We're almost there.
- It's not an escort service.

1273
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,820
- They're not filming either.
- They're not filming?

1274
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,090
But it's the first time they meet.

1275
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,320
- How come?
- It's the first time.

1276
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,130
I still can't see how they're related
to each other.

1277
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,829
- They're not lovers.
- They're not.

1278
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:21,400
They're not a married couple.

1279
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,369
It's the first time they meet,
but it's not an escort service.

1280
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,840
They're kissing. But they're not filming.

1281
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,440
- In what other relationships can they be?
- I know.

1282
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,070
On Christmas, Chris and Violet...

1283
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,440
were in a hotel room.

1284
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,909
Violet ate a cake Chris brought,
and she died from suffocation.

1285
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:39,610
And I'd like to add this.

1286
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:43,179
This...

1287
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,349
This is a bit...

1288
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,920
Because it's the outline of the incident.

1289
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,059
It's a murder, not a suicide.

1290
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,659
It's a death from suffocation,
not a murder.

1291
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:54,460
There's a chance
it's not a death from suffocation.

1292
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,070
That can never happen. Is there other ways
to kill someone using a cake?

1293
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,099
What else can it be?
She died after eating the cake.

1294
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,099
The cake could have gone bad.

1295
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,710
Completely stale.

1296
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,940
It could be something like an allergy.

1297
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,909
- It could be an allergy?
- Is it an allergy?

1298
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,139
It's because they see
each other for the first time.

1299
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,480
- He doesn't know she has an allergy.
- It can be an allergy.

1300
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,380
Is it a death due to an allergy?

1301
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,519
All right. It's an allergy.

1302
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:16,750
(They recognize the keyword
"allergy" one step behind.)

1303
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,519
Then we need to ask about
the death from suffocation.

1304
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,530
The third hint will be revealed.

1305
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,059
- Why? Did someone get the answer?
- I guess so.

1306
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:28,130
Gosh.

1307
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,230
Violet has a lover.

1308
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,130
- What?
- What is he saying?

1309
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,269
Then everything is reset.

1310
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,010
That should be included here.

1311
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,570
Right. He keeps talking
about their relationship.

1312
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,340
They want us to find out
in what relationship they are.

1313
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,650
What shall I do? I'm so confused.

1314
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,780
What if Chris has a twin brother?

1315
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,550
Let's get inside and discuss.

1316
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,559
- Gosh.
- If it's not an affair...

1317
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,119
I'll go ask that.
I think that's a good one.

1318
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,260
- Is it?
- What?

1319
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,829
Does Chris have a twin brother?

1320
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:06,030
Is Violet...

1321
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,869
mistaken Chris for someone else?

1322
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,239
Yes, that's correct.

1323
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,510
(Is Violet mistaken Chris
for someone else? Yes.)

1324
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,219
Does Chris have a twin brother?

1325
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,949
Yes, that's correct.

1326
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:24,090
(Does Chris have a twin brother? Yes.)

1327
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,530
- Thank you.
- Xitsuh...

1328
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,860
asked 2 questions,
and he got 2 extra minutes.

1329
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:35,800
(Keyword 4: Twin)

1330
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:40,170
- He has a twin brother.
- My guess is right?

1331
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,309
"Is Violet mistaken Chris
for someone else?" "Yes."

1332
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:46,340
"Does Chris have a twin brother?" "Yes."

1333
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,880
When Min A mentioned
Chris could have a twin brother,

1334
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,780
it sounded like such a trashy drama.

1335
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,619
So I thought, "No way."

1336
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,920
But it seemed like
the only possible scenario.

1337
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,050
I felt so thrilled.

1338
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,289
We were stuck regarding
their relationship.

1339
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:00,590
When I heard the hint,

1340
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,960
The idea of him being a twin hit my head.

1341
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,989
So I said that to Xisuh,
and he liked the idea.

1342
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:06,630
So he asked that, and we got it.

1343
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,329
We were fortunate. Since then,
we gained speed.

1344
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,670
When we were drinking,
Min A said she wasn't good at games.

1345
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,500
But I saw that she did a pretty good job.

1346
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,070
I thought she could be a dangerous figure.

1347
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,469
Then what happened?

1348
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,010
It went like this.

1349
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,480
She thought that he knew
about her allergy, so she ate the cake.

1350
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,679
But the context sounds strange.

1351
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,320
- He had a secret crush on Violet.
- No, listen to this.

1352
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,349
- The one who appeared wasn't Chris.
- That's right.

1353
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,360
- No, I got it.
- Chris isn't Violet's boyfriend.

1354
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,389
Chris isn't Violet's boyfriend.

1355
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,989
Let's get this straight. I think...

1356
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,869
I'll give you the answer.

1357
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,070
Kim Min A, please say the answer.

1358
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,639
Violet, at a hotel on Christmas,

1359
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:55,610
was mistaken Chris, a twin
of her boyfriend, for her boyfriend.

1360
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:59,179
She ate the cake Chris prepared, and died
from suffocation due to an allergy.

1361
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:02,280
(She ate the cake Chris prepared, and died
from suffocation due to an allergy.)

1362
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,349
Kim Min A.

1363
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,320
- No?
- What you said earlier was right.

1364
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,659
We have one thing missing,
so she said that.

1365
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:13,530
Kim Min A, you have one keyword missing.

1366
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,230
- What? Here...
- This isn't all.

1367
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,900
Darn it. Seriously.

1368
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,730
Isn't it like this? Maybe...

1369
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,539
I think we need to add
something like this.

1370
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,070
- Chris...
- He likes her.

1371
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,710
- He has a secret crush.
- Yes, a secret crush.

1372
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,739
It's a one-sided love.

1373
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,480
At this point,
we need to think about this.

1374
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,909
I've asked all the questions.

1375
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:31,949
Yes.

1376
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,780
- If we have extra questions...
- Holding with diamond hands.

1377
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,250
(Holding with diamond hands)

1378
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,820
They might be faking it.

1379
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,559
- They might ask only a few things.
- And even if we hold out,

1380
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,559
if they get the answer in a row,

1381
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:44,960
we get 20 extra minutes.

1382
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,429
That's equivalent to 20 questions.

1383
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:48,300
- Then the difference is by 20 questions.
- It's the same as 20 questions.

1384
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,429
- Then...
- So you mean we'd better get the answer?

1385
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:55,000
Let's take turns.

1386
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:56,800
It's Chungju-Man's turn.

1387
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,170
Ask only one question each.
Don't ask too many questions.

1388
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,510
- One each.
- Yes.

1389
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,750
- We need to add one more.
- We're not wrong about what we said.

1390
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,179
- We need to add one more thing.
- Yes.

1391
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,079
There are four main keywords.

1392
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,590
Twin, cake, allergy,

1393
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,090
and I guess we need to add something
like "Not knowing."

1394
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,920
- What's the keyword we didn't get?
- That's what I'm saying.

1395
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:19,659
They didn't make an appointment...

1396
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,329
- to meet.
- Right.

1397
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,769
Did Chris and Violet
make an appointment...

1398
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,869
to meet at the hotel
on the day of the incident?

1399
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:27,199
No, they didn't.

1400
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,070
How did they meet?
How did the twin brother meet her?

1401
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,409
You know... She was murdered, right?

1402
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,250
- Is it a murder?
- Yes.

1403
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,880
Isn't it an accidental death?

1404
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,980
Didn't you say it's accidental?

1405
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,789
No.

1406
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,989
- What? What did I say?
- Didn't you tell me it's accidental?

1407
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,320
Downstairs earlier,
didn't you tell me it's accidental?

1408
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,360
- Wait. I don't remember.
- Look at this.

1409
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,489
- She says this is...
- Wait a minute, please.

1410
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,199
- I mean...
- What did I hear? Wait.

1411
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,699
- What did you ask?
- What was the question?

1412
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,369
- Is it a murder or...
- Right.

1413
00:59:58,369 --> 00:59:59,699
- It's a murder.
- She said yes.

1414
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,840
- Yes.
- Right.

1415
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,670
I was confused.

1416
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,440
It's a mistake.

1417
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:07,340
- You're making a face right away.
- Wait.

1418
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,639
No, I mean, when I was going to enter
to ask a question,

1419
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,150
he passed me by...

1420
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,809
and told me, "An accidental death."

1421
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,079
- What?
- It's an accidental death.

1422
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,420
It is an accidental death.

1423
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,849
- Goodness. Come on.
- Come on.

1424
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:20,090
- Wait.
- It's important. How come you confuse it?

1425
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,119
No, wait a minute.

1426
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,460
This doesn't make sense.

1427
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,519
- Wait.
- Excuse me.

1428
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,889
- This is so important.
- Quiet. Wait a minute.

1429
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,159
- How come you confuse this?
- Wait. If it's accidental...

1430
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,940
"Is it a murder?" That was the question.

1431
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,570
When he came out from the room,

1432
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,070
he told me, "It's an accidental death."

1433
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:40,739
"An accidental death."

1434
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:42,309
So I thought, "It's not a murder."

1435
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:44,949
Upstairs, he shared the information
that it's a murder.

1436
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:46,010
It's a murder.

1437
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,320
- Is it a murder?
- She says so.

1438
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,280
Everyone was saying it's a murder,

1439
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,119
so I told him,
"You said it was an accidental death."

1440
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,849
Then Chungju-Man suddenly said...

1441
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,760
that he was confused.

1442
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,389
I thought, "What's going on?"

1443
01:00:57,389 --> 01:01:02,630
I wondered if he and Steve
pulled it together to some extent.

1444
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,969
They could be lying,
and after deserting us,

1445
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:06,530
two of them might have an idea.

1446
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,170
Come on.

1447
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
Wait. What was that?

1448
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,579
Didn't you write it down?

1449
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,710
No, I came out right away
after listening to her answer. Wait.

1450
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:19,650
(Sighing)

1451
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,380
After coming out of the room, you told me
right away, "An accidental death."

1452
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,019
It's an accidental death.

1453
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:25,889
I'm sure it's an accidental death.

1454
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:27,690
Come on. What should we do now?

1455
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,289
The story is totally different now.

1456
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:31,159
It's one of the most important keywords.

1457
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,960
It's not like that. Wait a minute, please.

1458
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:37,269
- Go ahead.
- Both suffocation and allergy...

1459
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,329
Why are you doing this?

1460
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,699
You just said it was an allergy.

1461
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,099
- I mean, both of them are accidental.
- No.

1462
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:46,309
- You can cause an allergy intentionally.
- It can be a murder.

1463
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:47,440
If it's a murder...

1464
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,409
I'm sure it's an accidental death.

1465
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,880
I mean how come you get confused
about something so important?

1466
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,179
How can you confuse this?

1467
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:55,079
- Did he first tell you it's a murder?
- Yes, he said it was a murder.

1468
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,619
Why?

1469
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,190
I guess I was confused. I don't remember.

1470
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,019
What did you ask her?

1471
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:03,389
- Did you ask her, "Is it accidental?"
- "Is it a murder?" She said no.

1472
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,760
Then why did you tell us
it's an accidental death?

1473
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,159
This is the only thing we need to do.

1474
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:09,130
Whatever we do,

1475
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:11,630
we need to figure out
whether it's suffocation or allergy.

1476
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,670
- We figured it out.
- Did we?

1477
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,599
- Is it an allergy? What's wrong with me?
- What is he doing?

1478
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,440
We have two questions left.

1479
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,539
Why did we think about
whether she has a lover?

1480
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,610
One each.

1481
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,239
- So we have two left.
- No. I asked, and they asked too.

1482
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,079
- We have one question left.
- Kyung Ran has a question left.

1483
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,150
Do we need to ask again if it's a murder?

1484
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,519
No, don't ask that. I'm sure about this.

1485
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:28,880
It's neither a suicide nor a murder.

1486
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,449
- It's amazing. I asked three questions.
- I see.

1487
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:38,130
Did the twin know that
Chris went to meet Violet?

1488
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,190
Right.

1489
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:43,059
Did Violet's boyfriend send Chris
to the hotel?

1490
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,969
Did the twin brother have an accident?
No.

1491
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:49,739
A, who was a two-timer,

1492
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:51,710
a twin brother of Chris...

1493
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:52,840
I'll go ask.

1494
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,210
But she's not murdered.

1495
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,380
No, she's not.

1496
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,280
Her boyfriend is a two-timer.

1497
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,409
So, Violet is his girlfriend,

1498
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,920
and he has another girlfriend.

1499
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,250
I have an idea about what to ask.

1500
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,449
The fourth hint will be revealed.

1501
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:05,949
(The 4th hint of Round 1 is revealed.)

1502
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,690
- Here it comes.
- It's not given since someone got it.

1503
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,989
Violet had no idea she'd meet Chris today,

1504
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,659
but Chris knew
that he'd meet Violet today.

1505
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:20,230
You can give them the answer, really.
Darn it.

1506
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,269
Did Violet's real boyfriend...

1507
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,940
send Chris to the promised place
with Violet...

1508
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,710
with a malicious intention?

1509
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,210
Yes, that is correct.

1510
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,650
Is Violet's real boyfriend...

1511
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,920
a two-timer?

1512
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,019
Yes, that is correct.

1513
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,019
Did Violet's real boyfriend...

1514
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,519
have another appointment?

1515
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:43,929
- Yes, that is correct.
- Thank you.

1516
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:46,829
Xitsuh asked 3 questions
and he got 3 extra minutes.

1517
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:51,000
It's over. You were right.

1518
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,369
He was a two-timer...

1519
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:53,429
and he had another appointment.

1520
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,340
Because of his appointment
with another girlfriend,

1521
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,510
he sent Chris to the promised place.

1522
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,739
- I think this will do.
- Right.

1523
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,139
You can go first.

1524
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:03,809
Is that woman Violet?

1525
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,650
She might not be.

1526
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,619
Again?

1527
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,820
Opposite to what we thought,
this woman might not be Violet.

1528
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,349
- It's giving me a headache.
- And this man is Chris.

1529
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:16,219
But that doesn't make sense
with the story we heard.

1530
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:17,960
- I'm going.
- Okay.

1531
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,659
(Min A goes to say the answer
for the second time.)

1532
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:25,829
Here is my answer.

1533
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,969
Violet's boyfriend...

1534
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:30,300
has a twin brother, Chris.

1535
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:33,809
Violet's boyfriend was a two-timer...

1536
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:37,039
and to meet another girlfriend of his
on Christmas,

1537
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,579
he sent Chris, his twin brother,

1538
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,050
to meet Violet instead of himself.

1539
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,449
Violet was mistaken Chris
for her boyfriend,

1540
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,590
ate the cake Chris prepared,

1541
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,960
and died due to an allergy.

1542
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,159
(Violet ate the cake Chris prepared,
and died due to an allergy.)

1543
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,860
Kim Min A, you got the answer.

1544
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:59,829
(Confusion, affair)

1545
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,869
Your answer included one extra keyword,

1546
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,510
so two minutes are deducted
from Kim Min A's time.

1547
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:07,380
you will be isolated
until this round ends.

1548
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:08,780
Thank you.

1549
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,110
(The first answerer in Bloody Mansion,
Kim Min A)

1550
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,219
(20 minutes ago)

1551
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,349
Maybe a one-night stand partner.

1552
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:21,289
Or a dating application.

1553
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,389
They met as one-night stand partners
on Christmas.

1554
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:25,030
- Right.
- They wanted to spend a night together.

1555
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,360
- That's possible.
- But who's the third party involved?

1556
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,500
Who's this third party?
We need to figure it out.

1557
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:32,099
If it's not a premeditated crime,

1558
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,599
it's difficult for a third party
to be involved.

1559
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,539
You're right.

1560
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:39,239
- There's someone else?
- Yes.

1561
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,309
What if... Listen to this.

1562
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,409
I'm Chris.

1563
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:49,420
I've contacted her only through chats.

1564
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,789
We make an appointment to be on Christmas,

1565
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:53,289
but I'm in a situation
where I can't go out.

1566
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:55,519
So I tell him,
"You go and pretend to be me..."

1567
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:58,889
- "since we haven't met in person yet."
- But Dong Min, Chris...

1568
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,559
met Violet. The sentence says so.

1569
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:02,829
Is there another man...

1570
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:04,769
- Or...
- than Chris?

1571
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:06,900
Chris has a twin brother.

1572
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,800
He has a twin brother,

1573
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:12,070
he says, "You should go."

1574
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,610
She's hugging him from the beginning.

1575
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,510
So it's not a premeditated crime,
but a mistake.

1576
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:21,519
MJ Kim, are you going to ask a question?

1577
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,550
Does Chris have a twin brother?

1578
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:28,690
- It's correct.
- That's crazy.

1579
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,989
He has a twin brother.

1580
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,159
Then I'll try giving the answer.

1581
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,260
Wait. But we might be missing one thing.

1582
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,000
Why couldn't the other twin appear?

1583
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,130
There's only one reason he can't show up
on Christmas.

1584
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:42,070
He's cheating on her.

1585
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:46,440
Even if we get one extra point,

1586
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,909
we'd rather ask a question now.

1587
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:51,809
If we miss one thing in the answer,
they'd consider it wrong.

1588
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,949
We'd rather ask a question now.

1589
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:57,690
My gut feeling says
that the only possibility...

1590
01:06:57,989 --> 01:06:59,119
is that he's cheating on her.

1591
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:04,230
I thought getting five extra minutes
was too risky.

1592
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,260
I hoped he could ask one question first...

1593
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,329
and give the answer.

1594
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:09,860
But he kept saying he'd give it a try.

1595
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,300
It's his score, so I couldn't stop him...

1596
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,570
when he wanted to do so.

1597
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,440
Here is my answer.

1598
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:20,269
Violet's actual lover...

1599
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,239
is a twin brother of Chris.

1600
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,980
She ate the cake without a doubt,

1601
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:29,349
but she died because of that.

1602
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,750
Jang Dong Min, you got the answer.

1603
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:34,289
What did I tell you?

1604
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:36,960
By including one extra keyword,

1605
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,329
two minutes are deducted from your time.

1606
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:40,329
(By including 1 extra keyword,
2 minutes are deducted from his time.)

1607
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:43,760
(The first answerer in Bloody Paradise,
Jang Dong Min)

1608
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:46,469
I felt sorry for others.

1609
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,739
The Almighty coming down
and having a competition...

1610
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:54,010
with ordinary people...

1611
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:57,380
makes me feel sorry for the members.

1612
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,880
You could hope for the possibility
that the Almighty makes a mistake.

1613
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,050
Don't lose your hope.

1614
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:06,989
(The game is not over at Bloody Mansion.)

1615
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,159
The fifth hint will be revealed.

1616
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:10,619
- I guess someone got the answer.
- Have 30 minutes gone already?

1617
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:12,260
They couldn't have got the answer.

1618
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:17,630
- It's not been 30 minutes yet.
- Chris had someone's request...

1619
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:19,500
and came to meet Violet.

1620
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,739
(Chris had someone's request
and came to meet Violet.)

1621
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:24,840
Okay.

1622
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,609
- Then it's a murder.
- It's a murder. You said it wrong.

1623
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:32,909
Right. What you just said
makes a huge difference...

1624
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:36,180
- about whether it's a murder or not.
- I think we need to check it out.

1625
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,890
- But...
- You need to revise your question.

1626
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:40,390
- Wait. Someone requested Chris...
- It doesn't make sense.

1627
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,560
He came on behalf of someone.

1628
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,890
Wait a minute, please.

1629
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,159
Gosh, the story doesn't make sense.

1630
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:48,460
Did they get the answer downstairs?

1631
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:49,960
I'll go check if they got the answer
downstairs.

1632
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

1633
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,840
If we don't do anything,
we wouldn't get our points deducted.

1634
01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:00,170
See? Then the proposition
"On Christmas" is wrong.

1635
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:03,140
Everyone, did you get the answer?

1636
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:05,149
No, a member went to ask a question.

1637
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:09,250
Well...

1638
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,649
(Checking)

1639
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,619
Who went to ask the question?

1640
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,989
Acau.

1641
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:20,590
- Where's Min A?
- She went to the restroom.

1642
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:24,569
Gosh.

1643
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,970
The hint was revealed so fast,
so I thought you got the answer.

1644
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:33,939
- It doesn't seem they got it.
- Did they get it?

1645
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:35,779
No. He said they didn't,

1646
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,140
but I can't see two of them.

1647
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,449
- You don't see them? Did you get it?
- Acau went in to ask a question.

1648
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:41,920
What about Min A?

1649
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:43,479
Min A is in the restroom now.

1650
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,119
She's in the restroom?

1651
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,960
- She's over there.
- You can tell us if you get it.

1652
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,390
Right. We're not even close.

1653
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,829
We're at a loss.

1654
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,659
Does this make sense?

1655
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,699
- Min A isn't in the restroom.
- No?

1656
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,069
- No.
- I guess she got the answer.

1657
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,640
You're going to get the answer.

1658
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,069
- You got me.
- Okay.

1659
01:10:11,609 --> 01:10:14,279
- Did I try too hard to understand it?
- That's what I'm saying.

1660
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:15,949
(Xitsuh goes out.)

1661
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:17,520
- Goodness.
- Shall we try?

1662
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:20,149
If he goes in, it's over anyway.

1663
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:21,390
The game's over.

1664
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:30,699
At least for the last one,

1665
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:32,329
I want to know if we were right.

1666
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:35,300
"Requested by Violet's lover,"

1667
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,210
"Chris came to see Violet on Christmas."

1668
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,109
"And Violet..."

1669
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,279
"passed away from an allergic reaction..."

1670
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:45,550
"to the cake Chris brought."

1671
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,310
- Isn't this meaningless?
- Why did they kiss?

1672
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,720
- It is.
- Yes.

1673
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,979
How about this?

1674
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:52,850
Chris and the lover might be twins.

1675
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:56,220
Because they look alike?

1676
01:10:57,989 --> 01:10:59,390
Why are you here?

1677
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,199
Honestly,
I was given the task of stalling you.

1678
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:13,039
If the team above asked fewer questions
and got fewer wrong answers,

1679
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:14,069
(The four-member alliance)

1680
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,439
this would be meaningless.

1681
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:17,949
- Did we ask about...
- This is...

1682
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:20,149
- eight questions each?
- Two, four, six, eight.

1683
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,750
We're near 20 points.

1684
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,279
Right? We need to stall time.

1685
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,390
If only we could buy us 10 to 20 minutes.

1686
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,189
Should we let...

1687
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:31,229
Min A get the answer first?

1688
01:11:31,229 --> 01:11:33,659
Both of us can use Immunity Pass.

1689
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:35,260
- We simply have to avoid coming last.
- Yes.

1690
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,670
- We'll use the Immunity Pass.
- Right.

1691
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:40,600
- We can vote to save members.
- I'll do it.

1692
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,369
We believe 20 minutes is a big score gap.

1693
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:47,539
If we have two members survive first,

1694
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:49,340
freeze the time,

1695
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,350
and take the risk of widening the gap,

1696
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,479
we are surely going to come first place.

1697
01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:58,449
- Will you not guess the answer?
- You'll stall time...

1698
01:11:58,449 --> 01:11:59,890
and not guess the answer.

1699
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,359
That's the mission I was given.

1700
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:02,989
Is that so?

1701
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:05,029
We can't turn the tables
in Rounds 2 and 3.

1702
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,760
- What does that mean?
- He's stalling time.

1703
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:11,329
Our time is being wasted.

1704
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,600
What about him?

1705
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,439
- It doesn't matter. They know the answer.
- Don't mind him.

1706
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,109
If you get the answer correct right now,
I'll be eliminated.

1707
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,770
That's not true. You have the next round.

1708
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:24,109
How did this happen?

1709
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,979
What made this happen?

1710
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:28,720
I felt a great sense of shame.

1711
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,189
How about we take a guess right now?

1712
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,460
Please go and check this one first.

1713
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,560
Okay.

1714
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:39,090
- The question?
- Yes.

1715
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,789
Good idea. What should we check?

1716
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,630
This has to be done either way.

1717
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,399
Read this part.

1718
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:47,970
What?

1719
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,800
Chris went to see Violet
because of someone's request.

1720
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,970
- That's the clue.
- We should...

1721
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,840
check it. Go ahead.

1722
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,880
- Which one?
- Ask.

1723
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,079
Go.

1724
01:12:57,079 --> 01:12:59,380
- Just ask.
- I'm asking which one.

1725
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,050
Choose whichever you want between the two.

1726
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,319
Do I ask this one or that one?

1727
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:04,590
- It doesn't matter.
- This one.

1728
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:05,590
- Do I ask this one?
- Whichever.

1729
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,390
You want to ask this one again? No.

1730
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,689
We need to check.

1731
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,659
- You're confused. We should check.
- I'm not confused. We're right.

1732
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:16,899
- There's no need to ask.
- We need to check.

1733
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:20,199
Wasn't this right? Wasn't it?

1734
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,500
- It was.
- Right?

1735
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,739
Go and ask, Kyung Ran.

1736
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:29,380
- All right.
- Fine. Go ahead.

1737
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,380
- First, look closely.
- Okay.

1738
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,579
- Here.
- Yes.

1739
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,079
On Christmas, Violet's...

1740
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,649
Use this time to ask, not check.

1741
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:41,090
Yes, go and ask. Have that checked.

1742
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:43,789
It's over anyway.

1743
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,229
It's clear.

1744
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:50,800
Why can't I ask?

1745
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:53,630
I felt extreme pressure...

1746
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:57,569
to have to ask a question.

1747
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:01,109
The fact that
I still had one more question to ask...

1748
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:04,079
was a big concern to them.

1749
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,649
I personally wanted to ask
a different question.

1750
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,079
And there was Round Two.

1751
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:14,689
Having to use up my question
was such a shame.

1752
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,359
- How careful of you...
- Why...

1753
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:18,590
- to stall the time.
- Why is he staying behind?

1754
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,189
- Sorry?
- Why is he staying behind?

1755
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,630
It's to drag the time...

1756
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:23,229
and widen the gap.

1757
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:24,800
- It's to widen the gap in Round Two.
- To widen the gap.

1758
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,029
Right. That question is absurd.

1759
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,439
- It's only natural.
- Yes.

1760
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,500
To widen the gap no matter what?

1761
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:32,939
Of course. I don't get why
you can't understand this.

1762
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:34,739
You're totally trolling right now.

1763
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,579
Is there no possibility of coming last?

1764
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,279
Yes, there is.

1765
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,380
It's fine as long as we go first
in Round Two.

1766
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,520
- Were we correct?
- "No, that is incorrect."

1767
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:48,159
What did you ask?

1768
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:49,859
I told you.

1769
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:51,529
- That was...
- Yes.

1770
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:52,529
Right?

1771
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,699
- This was...
- We had to check for sure.

1772
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:57,630
There's nothing else to prove with this.

1773
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,329
We're done. All that's left is to decide
to guess like this or not.

1774
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,039
If we are, we can do it now.

1775
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,670
I'll try with the keyword.

1776
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,270
Is it correct?

1777
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,810
Whatever. Don't come back.

1778
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,590
(Chungju-Man returns)

1779
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:20,920
- It was incorrect.
- What?

1780
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,390
- Was it incorrect?
- It was incorrect.

1781
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,590
"Violet ate the cake from her lover
on Christmas..."

1782
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:29,630
"and passed away from an allergic reaction
in her room."

1783
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:31,930
Chungju-Man, you are incorrect.

1784
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:34,199
Five minutes have been added to your time.

1785
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:37,270
- Was it incorrect?
- It was incorrect.

1786
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,409
She said nothing more. What is it?

1787
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,510
It should be insufficient, not incorrect.

1788
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,310
There's nothing incorrect about it.

1789
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,810
It's incorrect if we're wrong.

1790
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,880
Should I go somewhere else
if I'm in the way?

1791
01:15:49,949 --> 01:15:53,250
How much longer
are you going to stall our time?

1792
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,260
Here's the sixth clue.

1793
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,500
Has it already been 30 minutes?

1794
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:07,029
Violet thinks of Chris as her lover.

1795
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:08,800
(Clue 6:
Violet thinks of Chris as her lover.)

1796
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,399
- I get it now.
- I told you.

1797
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,539
You did.

1798
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:14,340
Goodness. That was a useful clue.

1799
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,180
- I'm off.
- Bye.

1800
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:22,449
He won't return.

1801
01:16:22,449 --> 01:16:24,449
- It can't be helped.
- Is he making a guess?

1802
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:25,449
Yes.

1803
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:37,460
Were you wrong?

1804
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,170
- It was incorrect.
- What did you say?

1805
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:43,069
My answer seems insufficient.

1806
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:44,399
- What was your guess?
- Twins, right?

1807
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:46,109
I said they were twins.

1808
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,880
What did she say?
Incorrect or insufficient?

1809
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:51,479
- Insufficient.
- "Insufficient?"

1810
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,810
He was short on one keyword.

1811
01:16:57,619 --> 01:16:59,850
Did she say "one" or just "insufficient?"

1812
01:17:00,189 --> 01:17:01,960
Just insufficient.
There's more than one missing.

1813
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,789
Why wasn't Chungju-Man insufficient?

1814
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,859
What did you say?

1815
01:17:08,899 --> 01:17:10,899
"Violet ate the cake
from her lover's twin Chris..."

1816
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,229
"on Christmas in the hotel room,"

1817
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:14,739
"and due to an allergic reaction..."

1818
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:19,670
I was really disappointed in Steve Yea
back then.

1819
01:17:20,109 --> 01:17:23,479
He didn't properly share his guess
with us.

1820
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:25,210
I kept asking what he said...

1821
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,949
and what he heard,

1822
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,779
but Steve Yea glossed over the questions.

1823
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:30,880
Something like,
"I guessed as mentioned earlier."

1824
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,590
That can't be true...

1825
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,350
when he had to return.

1826
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:39,289
He's really stalling our time.

1827
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:48,369
- Are you going?
- I'm off.

1828
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:49,439
- I am.
- Okay.

1829
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,840
- Wait.
- Did Xitsuh leave?

1830
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,770
- Yes.
- Did Xitsuh leave?

1831
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:53,840
- He did.
- Yes.

1832
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,939
That means we're done.

1833
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:56,010
Xitsuh went inside.

1834
01:17:56,279 --> 01:17:57,810
He must have thought we got it.

1835
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,380
- Here is my answer.
- Go ahead.

1836
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:09,319
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1837
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:13,390
We have the answerers to Round One.

1838
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:16,260
Players who did not get the correct answer
in Round One...

1839
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,569
get an extra 20 minutes.

1840
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:25,609
Here are the main keywords for Round One.

1841
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:27,409
- They tell us.
- They give us the keywords.

1842
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:29,810
The main keywords are twins,

1843
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,609
food allergy, mistake, and affair.

1844
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:38,390
The extra keywords are Christmas
and ambulance.

1845
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,350
Here's the whole story of the case.

1846
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,789
Violet has promised
to meet her boyfriend Aden...

1847
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:46,590
at a restaurant to celebrate Christmas.

1848
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:51,329
But Aden is having an affair
with a different woman.

1849
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,029
He has made two promises for the same day.

1850
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:58,239
Aden sends his twin brother Chris
to Violet in his stead.

1851
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:00,869
While eating the cake Chris brought,

1852
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:03,779
Violet suddenly has difficulty breathing.

1853
01:19:04,109 --> 01:19:07,350
Violet is highly allergic to ingredients.

1854
01:19:07,579 --> 01:19:10,050
But Chris, who wasn't informed,

1855
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,420
had bought a cake containing
such an ingredient.

1856
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,319
Violet doesn't suspect anything,
eats the cake,

1857
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:16,960
and has an allergic reaction.

1858
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,130
Chris quickly calls for an ambulance.

1859
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,300
But due to the Christmas Day traffic,
the ambulance arrives late,

1860
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:26,029
and Violet passes away.

1861
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,239
- Unbelievable.
- To think there'd be an ambulance.

1862
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,239
Really.

1863
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:34,239
Do we need to go that far?

1864
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,779
The Mansion's Round One results
will be announced.

1865
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,949

1873
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,569
(Mystery Time Mansion Round 1 Result)

1874
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:02,170
(1. Acau, 2. Kim Min A, 3. Xitsuh,)

1875
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:03,739
(4. Lee Gina, 4. Kim Kyung Ran,
6. Chungju-Man, 6. Steve Yea)

1876
01:20:03,739 --> 01:20:06,310
The Paradise's Round One results
will be announced.

1877
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:10,840
The order is from the player
with the least time to the most.

1878
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,380
First place, Jang Dong Min.

1879
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,109
Second place, Heo Seong Beom.

1880
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,479

1881
01:20:15,619 --> 01:20:16,949

01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,149
Sixth place, Joo Eon Kyu.

1884
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,020
Seventh place, Pani Bottle.

1885
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,560
Eighth place, Si Yoon.

1886
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:27,090
What? What was that?

1887
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,199
Pani is in seventh place.

1888
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,529
- In seventh?
- Si Yoon is last.

1889
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,930
I think he got extra time
from guessing the answer.

1890
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,430
- Is Si Yoon in last place?
- Yes.

1891
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,600
"To kill Chris's wife,
the one who made the cake..."

1892
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:41,310
"from the shop Chris is a regular at..."

1893
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,810
Here is my answer.

1894
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:49,119
"The one baking cakes
at Chris's regular shop..."

1895
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:50,720
"planned to poison..."

1896
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,420
"Chris's wife..."

1897
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:55,060
"but ended up dying."

1898
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:56,989
Si Yoon, you are incorrect.

1899
01:20:57,859 --> 01:21:00,090
Five minutes have been added to your time.

1900
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,729
I thought...

1901
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,399
I had quite an imaginative mind.

1902
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,430
I was too full of myself.

1903
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,270
When the game started,

1904
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:14,069
it was completely different
from what I had in mind.

1905
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:16,279
I had a good start.

1906
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:17,380
I did.

1907
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,810
- She said, "It's not important."
- I think this is the correct answer.

1908
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,949
Can you just give it a go?

1909
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:23,479
- No.
- No, that's too soon.

1910
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,619
- It's too soon.
- It's too soon.

1911
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:26,250
There are four keywords.

1912
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,159
I can ask the question,
but there's no need to rush.

1913
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:30,189
What's there to rush?

1914
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:32,859
- We should refine the question.
- Yes.

1915
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,189
We do.

1916
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,100
When we were deciding
whether to ask a question or not,

1917
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,399
we wasted too much time.

1918
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:39,869
An extra one minute
wasn't going to hurt us.

1919
01:21:40,369 --> 01:21:42,739
But we spent 5 to 6 minutes contemplating.

1920
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:44,439
It was as bad as getting the wrong answer.

1921
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,810
(Mystery Time Paradise Round 1 Result)

1922
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:48,310
(1. Jang Dong Min, 2. Heo Seong Beom,
3. MJ Kim, 4. Hong Jin Ho,)

1923
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:49,779
(5. Yurisa, 6. Joo Eon Kyu,
7. Pani Bottle, 8. Si Yoon)

1924
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:55,380
(Mystery Time Round 1 has ended.)

1925
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:56,550
We must have gotten something.

1926
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,720
Let's go. Open it.

1927
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:04,720
What is it?

1928
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:06,689
What does it say?

1929
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:09,000
Si Yoon...

1930
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:11,460
Chungju-Man and Steve Yea will come.

1931
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,300
One of the two will come.

1932
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,369
Si Yoon? Chungju-Man and Steve Yea?

1933
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:18,909
The two are likely to come.

1934
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,579
I'm not too sure about Si Yoon yet.

1935
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:27,079
He didn't give off the feeling of an ally.

1936
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,579
Chungju-Man.

1937
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,319
Veiled feuds are normal
in the civil servant field.

1938
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:34,789
That field is the real Bloody Game.

1939
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:36,760
Act as how he does at work,

1940
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,229
and he'll play an active part
in this show.

1941
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:43,899
Mystery Time Round Two will begin.

1942
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:47,229
Here is the question
and the image for Round Two.

1943
01:22:52,569 --> 01:22:54,470
Leo, who lives in Dia Country,

1944
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,909
heads to the subway station every morning.

1945
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:00,409
Once he arrives at work,
he thoroughly reads the articles.

1946
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:05,020
On a national holiday,
Leo goes to work as he always does.

1947
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:07,489
But he is found dead in the restroom.

1948
01:23:07,819 --> 01:23:09,119
What is the whole story?

1949
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,529
There are five main keywords...

1950
01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:14,859
and 3 extra keywords in Round 2.

1951
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,899
Ask questions about Round Two's case.

1952
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:23,439
The first thing I noticed
was the newspaper on the ground.

1953
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:25,069
I read what was written on it.

1954
01:23:25,369 --> 01:23:27,939
The crumpled-up newspaper
had writing on it.

1955
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:31,279
There was a lot to go over.

1956
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,779
The newspaper had the stock market crash
and the state of emergency.

1957
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:36,649
My plan was to get information
from each...

1958
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,180
and guess the answer.

1959
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:41,720
Ask questions about Round Two's case.

1960
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:44,890
Players who want to ask questions
or guess the answer,

1961
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,659
enter the voting room in order.

1962
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:49,460
(The three-player alliance
heads downstairs.)

1963
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,000
What made me furious...

1964
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,840
was what we had talked about...

1965
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,670
in the morning came to nothing.

1966
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:02,710
I'm someone who tries to keep his word.

1967
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,250
Let's start with this.

1968
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,289
- Let's do our best again.
- Okay.

1969
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:19,260
This time we must ask if it was suicide.

1970
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:21,130
There was a stock market crash.

1971
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,000
Here's what I thought was strange.

1972
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,470
He went to work on a national holiday.

1973
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:27,600
But it's Thursday on the newspaper.

1974
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:30,340
Why did he go to work
on a national holiday?

1975
01:24:31,539 --> 01:24:33,510
Looking at
the state of emergency declaration...

1976
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:34,810
and stock market crash,

1977
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,680
something happened in the country.

1978
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,579
The newspaper was ripped.

1979
01:24:38,909 --> 01:24:40,250
"Is his death connected..."

1980
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,380
- "to the stock market crash?"
- Me too.

1981
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,149
His death... "A man in his 30s"
and "composite sketch."

1982
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:46,250
- It's a flyer about the culprit.
- Yes.

1983
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,460
"Did the man die because he was wanted?"

1984
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,720
Those are my questions.

1985
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,930
- Was Leo murdered?
- Yes, ask that.

1986
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,960
I'll go and ask this question.

1987
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,090
Was Leo murdered?

1988
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:57,930
I believe Leo could've been involved...

1989
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,930
- in manipulating the stock price.
- I see.

1990
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,800
He went to work on a national holiday
as he always did.

1991
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,300
- That was weird to me, too.
- In other words,

1992
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,510
- he likely wasn't an ordinary salaryman.
- Right.

1993
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:07,770
Thinking of the bigger umbrella,

1994
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:10,979
asking if Leo is involved in a crime...

1995
01:25:11,409 --> 01:25:12,949
- sits right with me.
- Yes.

1996
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:15,050
- That and whether he committed suicide.
- Yes. That one too.

1997
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,250
We ask if he took his life.

1998
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:19,850
There were many crime stories
in the newspaper.

1999
01:25:20,189 --> 01:25:22,520
Leo must've been involved in a crime.

2000
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,819
Then what was the crime?

2001
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,630
Was it related to the stock market crash?

2002
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,560
Was he a stock manipulator?

2003
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:30,159
"Is Leo connected to a crime?"

2004
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,729
Yes, that is correct.

2005
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:34,529
"Did Leo commit suicide?"

2006
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:36,670
Yes, that is correct.

2007
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,510
"Did Leo work
in the stock market industry?"

2008
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:41,939
No, that is incorrect.

2009
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:45,810
With 3 questions,
3 minutes have been added to your time.

2010
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:47,909
(Main keywords for Round Two:)

2011
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:51,250
(Suicide)

2012
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,949
Leo took his own life.

2013
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,659
- What is it?
- I'm going to ask.

2014
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,989
- Ask what?
- Did he...

2015
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,460
slip in the restroom?

2016
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,100
- If he slipped.
- No, he committed suicide.

2017
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:07,569
That's an accidental death.

2018
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,270
- Right.
- Yes.

2019
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,569
Leo committed suicide.

2020
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:14,010
When I heard I was in last place...

2021
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,609
before Round Two began,

2022
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:23,380
I couldn't pull myself together.

2023
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,689
Even so,

2024
01:26:26,489 --> 01:26:28,890
Eon Kyu helped me focus...

2025
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,319
and kept playing the game.

2026
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,430
Why did he commit suicide?

2027
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,199
Leo took his own life.

2028
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:40,930
Did he commit a crime
and commit suicide from the guilt...

2029
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:42,840
or because the event turned for the worse?

2030
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,270
Or did he write an inaccurate article...

2031
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,670
and commit suicide...

2032
01:26:47,109 --> 01:26:48,640
from being in a pinch?

2033
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,539
- You're saying he was a reporter?
- Yes.

2034
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:53,109
He was a journalist...

2035
01:26:53,109 --> 01:26:54,710
- and wrote an...
- Should I ask if he was a journalist?

2036
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,989
Isn't that asking one question
out of many possibilities?

2037
01:26:58,989 --> 01:27:00,090
That question is...

2038
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,090
Are we wasting it?

2039
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,659
We lost earlier
because of that very thought.

2040
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:04,760
- Let's not contemplate.
- Okay.

2041
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,829
- Ask everything.
- If the question doesn't sound odd,

2042
01:27:06,829 --> 01:27:08,460
let's ask. Okay. Should I ask that?

2043
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,600
Ask about the mistake, too.

2044
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:14,130
We were being very careful about
which questions to ask.

2045
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:15,369
Rather than that,

2046
01:27:15,739 --> 01:27:17,640
asking questions to get information...

2047
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,340
and using the elimination strategy
was more practical.

2048
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:25,909
Was Leo a journalist?

2049
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:27,250
It is not important.

2050
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,649
Being a journalist is not important.

2051
01:27:38,289 --> 01:27:41,430
Is the composite sketch related to Leo?

2052
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,359
Yes, that is correct.

2053
01:27:45,699 --> 01:27:46,829
I'm losing weight.

2054
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:51,899
Is Dia Country on the verge of war?

2055
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,550
I can tell who it is by the footsteps.

2056
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:01,609
"Is Dia Country on the verge of war?"

2057
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,750
"It is not important."

2058
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,279
Pani must be destroying himself.

2059
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:07,050
He's asking all the questions.

2060
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:12,289
Pani is the questioner,

2061
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:14,029
and they will get 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.

2062
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:18,630
(Meanwhile, in the Mansion)

2063
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:21,600
I think the stock market crash
is a factor.

2064
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,869
Did something happen...

2065
01:28:23,869 --> 01:28:25,199
because of a sense of shame?

2066
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:28,010
Or was he pointed out as the culprit?

2067
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:32,949
- How should we ask the question?
- What questions are we asking?

2068
01:28:35,449 --> 01:28:37,449
I think it's best to ask
the questions quickly.

2069
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:43,720
Let's go.

2070
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,130
- First...
- Which one should we ask first?

2071
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:47,229
Was it a suicide?

2072
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:48,430
Whether it was a suicide or a murder.

2073
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:51,859
- If the cause is inside the newspaper.
- Yes, if it's inside the newspaper.

2074
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,770
I'll be back.

2075
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:57,199
"Did Leo commit suicide?"

2076
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,069
Yes, that is correct.

2077
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:02,079
(On a national holiday, Leo went to work
but was found dead in the restroom.)

2078
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:08,010
- Thank you.
- With one question,

2079
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,819
- one minute has been added to your time.
- Okay.

2080
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,579
We should all ask.

2081
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,960
- Suicide.
- What?

2082
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,390
- Suicide.
- Suicide.

2083
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:21,489
And? Was it related
to the newspaper articles?

2084
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,329
- How many did you ask?
- Just this one.

2085
01:29:24,329 --> 01:29:25,430
- One?
- Yes.

2086
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,529
- If it was suicide or murder?
- Yes.

2087
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:31,939
To be more diligent,

2088
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:34,640
- We should move fast.
- we should group three questions...

2089
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,140
- Let's ask quickly.
- and ask many.

2090
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:38,949
- The gap is wide already.
- We're near the room,

2091
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:41,609
so it's fine to run back and forth.

2092
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,819
Nobody is asking questions.

2093
01:29:48,819 --> 01:29:49,890
We lost because we didn't ask questions.

2094
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,119
But nobody was to ask again.

2095
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,229
They go once in a while...

2096
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:53,960
and refrain from going which was obvious.

2097
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:56,600
Let's try hard and win.

2098
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,130
Okay.

2099
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:00,069
Let's win.

2100
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:03,300
All right. I'll ask
if the composite sketch is of Leo.

2101
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,170
Wait.

2102
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,539
One of you has to go first.

2103
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,369
How many questions did you ask?
What do we ask?

2104
01:30:09,109 --> 01:30:10,880
- But we...
- The composite sketch.

2105
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:13,750
- Five?
- That was because of incorrect answers.

2106
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:17,579
You went voluntarily
without discussing it with us.

2107
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,050
We had to ask...

2108
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,420
To get the answer right.

2109
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:23,859
We're not given unlimited hours
like 1 or 2.

2110
01:30:23,859 --> 01:30:26,189
We didn't discuss who was going.

2111
01:30:26,189 --> 01:30:27,659
You volunteered and went.

2112
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:29,560
It ended right then and there.

2113
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,399
And we played...

2114
01:30:31,399 --> 01:30:34,069
based on the information I had. Didn't we?

2115
01:30:34,069 --> 01:30:35,329
Hold on. Give me a second.

2116
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,470
Hold on. Listen to me.
Are we going to take that account?

2117
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:42,279
Are you telling us to offset
those five points?

2118
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:49,649
- According to the rules, you should.
- At this rate...

2119
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:52,750
You didn't discuss the order
with us beforehand.

2120
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,420
We were surprised
when you went out so suddenly.

2121
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,359
- We clearly knew that it'd be incorrect.
- He told us beforehand.

2122
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,390
Don't you agree? It was clearly incorrect.

2123
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,689
We didn't think that it'd be correct.

2124
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,659
I didn't know at that time.

2125
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:05,000
I mean, we thought
that something was missing.

2126
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:07,829
To be honest, I had given up.

2127
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,039
I was hoping that it wouldn't come up.

2128
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:13,270
For the team, it's better
that it doesn't come up.

2129
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,609
When I came back, I told you
which keywords we lacked...

2130
01:31:15,609 --> 01:31:17,710
- and other things that I heard.
- I mean...

2131
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:18,909
That's what a team is about.

2132
01:31:18,909 --> 01:31:20,409
There are four of us,

2133
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,880
but only two of us are
guaranteed to survive.

2134
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,479
We can't do that.

2135
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:28,520
Telling us to lose five points means...

2136
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,289
that you want us to lose.

2137
01:31:30,289 --> 01:31:32,289
- Right, you're telling us to lose.
- And so,

2138
01:31:32,289 --> 01:31:33,430
tell us more accurately.

2139
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:35,729
What would you have done
if you got the answer correct?

2140
01:31:35,729 --> 01:31:38,060
We would have found
a solution for Round Two.

2141
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,770
We're a team right now.

2142
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:41,130
We're playing to win.

2143
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,000
If no one went out...

2144
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:48,739
That's when I lost it.

2145
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:53,109
I wanted to eliminate her.

2146
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,850
Kyung Ran and Gina were
getting aggressive.

2147
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,550
When the subject of five points came up,
they lost their temper.

2148
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,460
"Didn't you go in just to win?"

2149
01:32:02,659 --> 01:32:04,720
"That was your choice.
It's not our responsibility."

2150
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,859
That's not teamwork.

2151
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:07,829
I don't think it's teamwork.

2152
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,430
I thought, "Gosh, it's over."

2153
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,600
"We lost."

2154
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,369
We'd do the same if you were in our shoes.

2155
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,369
I'd think that it's something
only I have to bear.

2156
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:19,869
- It's me running out.
- Getting the correct answer is...

2157
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,869
- done individually.
- I'm responsible for that.

2158
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,310
In this situation,
guessing the right answer was...

2159
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:26,279
more important than leaving.

2160
01:32:26,979 --> 01:32:28,010
Right?

2161
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:29,680
Is that what you think?

2162
01:32:31,649 --> 01:32:34,189
I was a little angry.

2163
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:35,550
"We're five points behind."

2164
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,220
"Are you telling us to come in last?"

2165
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,359
When they drove us to the corner
very aggressively,

2166
01:32:39,659 --> 01:32:41,930
I wondered why they weren't playing...

2167
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,029
exactly like Round One.

2168
01:32:44,029 --> 01:32:45,600
I became suspicious of them.

2169
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,800
I had a lot to say,

2170
01:32:47,899 --> 01:32:50,439
but I restrained myself
because the clock was ticking.

2171
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:54,340
- What I think is...
- We don't have time to argue.

2172
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,579
- Let's keep playing.
- Right.

2173
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:58,609
We'll let it go for now.

2174
01:32:58,609 --> 01:33:01,449
For now...

2175
01:33:03,449 --> 01:33:04,550
This.

2176
01:33:05,649 --> 01:33:07,020
Any relations to the subway?

2177
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,649
Okay, I'll go.

2178
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:11,020
I was planning to go, but go ahead.

2179
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:13,529
Okay.

2180
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,899
Was his work related to stocks? No.

2181
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:21,329
- Stocks are wrong.
- He has nothing to do with stocks.

2182
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:22,439
His job might be something else.

2183
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:24,300
Did he commit a crime related to stocks?

2184
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,869
- We should take out the stocks.
- I'll ask if he committed a crime.

2185
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:30,010
I also have this hypothesis.

2186
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:33,350
Leo can be the president
of the company that was harmed.

2187
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:36,250
The process could be related
to declaring bankruptcy.

2188
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:38,479
Maybe he committed suicide
because his company shut down.

2189
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,619
Did he commit a crime?
Is he the assailant?

2190
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,020
Okay.

2191
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,020
Did Leo commit a crime?

2192
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,630
Yes, he did.

2193
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,960
This is unbelievable.

2194
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,130
Did Leo commit a crime?

2195
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:54,399
- Yes.
- Nice.

2196
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:56,539
Everything including
the composite sketch...

2197
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,770
Right, he's tracking himself down.

2198
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,470
Does the composite sketch
represent Leo's face?

2199
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,810
I should ask that question, too.

2200
01:34:04,109 --> 01:34:07,050
Was there Leo's composite sketch
in the article?

2201
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,220
Does the composite sketch
represent Leo's face?

2202
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:11,220
Yes, that is correct.

2203
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:14,920
Since there's a composite sketch,
the reason for his suicide...

2204
01:34:15,289 --> 01:34:17,460
If we relate to the newspaper article,

2205
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:19,390
it may be something like
the stock price plummeting.

2206
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,590
- He caused a problem that's big enough...
- Right.

2207
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:22,760
to be an emergency.

2208
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,899
His composite sketch came up,
and he committed suicide.

2209
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:28,470
- "Dia Country."
- What?

2210
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:31,270
I wonder if it's also related
to Dia Country.

2211
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:35,840
Take a look.

2212
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,210
He went to work on a national holiday.

2213
01:34:38,609 --> 01:34:40,750
The country is in a state of emergency.

2214
01:34:41,949 --> 01:34:43,720
It could be a temporary holiday.

2215
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,750
Let's say that there's a pandemic.

2216
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,920
- Right.
- Then everyone is forced to stay home.

2217
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:52,689
"Emergency declaration" seems
to be an important keyword.

2218
01:34:53,329 --> 01:34:55,159
Is it related to stock prices plummeting?

2219
01:34:55,159 --> 01:34:58,359
When an emergency is announced,
stock prices fall.

2220
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,470
If North Korea drops a missile,
all the stock prices will fall.

2221
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:02,840
Should we ask this?

2222
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:06,239
Was the national state
of emergency declared...

2223
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:07,770
because of Leo?

2224
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:10,439
That's a good idea.

2225
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:15,680
The national state of emergency
was declared.

2226
01:35:16,119 --> 01:35:18,649
Was it because of Leo?

2227
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,250
Yes, that is correct.

2228
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,989
Leo did something against the country.

2229
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:28,529
It's something huge.

2230
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,529
I'll ask this.

2231
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,199
Did Leo hold a high-ranking public post?

2232
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,840
Then why did he ride the subway?

2233
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,899
- That's possible.
- That's possible.

2234
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:40,510
It could be for a show.

2235
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:42,609
- To look like an ordinary person?
- Yes.

2236
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,949
Is Leo a civil servant...

2237
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,449
with a high-ranking post in Dia Country?

2238
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:53,020
No, that is incorrect.

2239
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,720
Really? Then why?

2240
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,220
He's not a civil servant.

2241
01:35:58,689 --> 01:35:59,829
He's not a civil servant,

2242
01:35:59,829 --> 01:36:01,590
- or he doesn't hold a high-ranking post?
- The latter.

2243
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:05,460
Here's what we have to figure out next.

2244
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:09,029
This is hard.

2245
01:36:10,869 --> 01:36:13,210
I bet the story will be
out of the ordinary.

2246
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,310
It's a case about a man in his 30s.

2247
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,010
Here's what was written.

2248
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,909
"Emergency announcement,
composite sketch,"

2249
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:22,050
"and process of acting as a proxy."

2250
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,590
- Doesn't the nation declare an emergency?
- It's a national emergency declaration.

2251
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:28,720
Right.

2252
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,890
Maybe the president died.

2253
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:35,689
The man in his 30s killed the president.

2254
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:38,699
And so, there was a proxy
for the president.

2255
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:44,699
Did the man in his 30s kill the president?

2256
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,939
Yes, that is correct.

2257
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:50,039
Eon Kyu, 1 minute has been added
due to your 1 question.

2258
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:51,609
(Joo Eon Kyu's 1 question,
1 minute is added)

2259
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:54,279
(Suicide, Assassination of the President)

2260
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:59,689
The man in his 30s
assassinated the president.

2261
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,869
- In that case...
- Then is Leo a spy?

2262
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:21,909
- Is it about a national issue?
- Yes.

2263
01:37:22,609 --> 01:37:24,439
Leo is a spy.

2264
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:25,779
This happened,

2265
01:37:25,779 --> 01:37:27,750
so he killed himself to hide the secret.

2266
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:29,520
I'll ask if he's a spy.

2267
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:32,449
- Wait.
- "Is Leo a spy?"

2268
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,649
Ask, "Did Leo commit suicide..."

2269
01:37:34,649 --> 01:37:37,060
"to hide a secret as a spy?"

2270
01:37:37,989 --> 01:37:39,159
Are you going to ask?

2271
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:40,789
Yes, it's the right thing to do.

2272
01:37:44,529 --> 01:37:47,369
Did Leo commit suicide in order to hide...

2273
01:37:47,369 --> 01:37:48,569
a secret as a spy?

2274
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:52,439
Yes, that is correct.

2275
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:55,739
Eon Kyu, one minute has been added
due to your question.

2276
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:56,739
(Joo Eon Kyu's 1 question,
1 minute is added)

2277
01:37:56,739 --> 01:38:01,109
(Suicide, Assassination
of the President, Spy)

2278
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,579
Leo committed suicide to hide...

2279
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:06,949
a secret as a spy.

2280
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:09,189
Then it's over.

2281
01:38:10,359 --> 01:38:11,819
How many keywords do we have?

2282
01:38:12,989 --> 01:38:14,060
We have five.

2283
01:38:15,159 --> 01:38:16,359
Then it's over.

2284
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:22,270
Spy Leo pretended to be
an ordinary office worker.

2285
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:25,369
(Joo Eon Kyu and Si Yoon organize
their answers.)

2286
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:27,109
Unbelievable.

2287
01:38:27,869 --> 01:38:29,279
We're on the right path.

2288
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:31,739
We had bad tactics for Round One.

2289
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33,180
Take time to get the right keywords.

2290
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:35,149
Ask questions in detail.

2291
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,149
Let's spread things out after that.

2292
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:39,319
Every time Eon Kyu came back,

2293
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:42,220
he said that it was correct.

2294
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,619
Eon Kyu, you're amazing.

2295
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:46,729
Here is my answer.

2296
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,260
Go ahead.

2297
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,729
Leo lived in Dia Country.

2298
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:54,100
(Joo Eon Kyu's attempt to answer)

2299
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,500
He went to the subway station
every morning.

2300
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:00,210
When he arrived at work,
he perused newspaper articles.

2301
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:04,109
It was because he was a spy.

2302
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:07,680
His goal as a spy was...

2303
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,680
to assassinate the president.

2304
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,649
We had a chance of winning.

2305
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,920
I was sure about the story...

2306
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:18,420
because we had things to support it.

2307
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,000
Here's the 1st clue for Round 2.

2308
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,569
Have 30 minutes already passed?

2309
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,100
Did someone guess the right answer?

2310
01:39:31,369 --> 01:39:33,869
A summit that was scheduled...

2311
01:39:33,869 --> 01:39:36,109
a week later in Dia Country
has been canceled.

2312
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:38,880
- What? A summit was canceled.
- A week later.

2313
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:41,010
- A week?
- It was scheduled a week later.

2314
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,479
State of emergency was declared.

2315
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:44,380
A summit scheduled a week later
was canceled.

2316
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,750
I'm ignorant in this field,
so I have no idea.

2317
01:39:49,189 --> 01:39:50,260
Wait.

2318
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,560
What's this emergency about?

2319
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,100
"Process of acting as a proxy."

2320
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:02,229
When I heard the rules of the game,

2321
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:04,300
I thought that it'd be fun.

2322
01:40:06,409 --> 01:40:09,380
What I really meant was that
I felt like I could do it.

2323
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:13,649
I couldn't come up
with groundbreaking questions.

2324
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:16,520
"State of emergency,"
"Process of acting as a proxy."

2325
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,750
I wasn't familiar with these terms...

2326
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:22,119
or when they typically occur.
I felt quite flustered.

2327
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:23,390
What could it be?

2328
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,890
What are some examples
of national emergency? A war.

2329
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,060
Should I ask, "Is Dia Country
at the risk of war?"

2330
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:31,399
Ask anything you want.

2331
01:40:33,329 --> 01:40:36,100
Is Dia Country at the risk of war?

2332
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:38,270
It is not important.

2333
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:41,510
Is Leo a spy?

2334
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,979
Yes, that is correct.

2335
01:40:42,979 --> 01:40:44,010
Okay.

2336
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:46,649
Pani Bottle, 2 minutes have been added
due to your 2 questions.

2337
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:47,710
(Pani Bottle, 2 questions,
2 minutes are added)

2338
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,220
Leo is a spy.

2339
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:55,720
What was your question?

2340
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,119
"Is Leo a spy? Yes."

2341
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,260
- Really?
- Yes.

2342
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:02,229
"Is Dia Country at the risk of war?"

2343
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:03,300
"It is not important."

2344
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,800
- He's a spy.
- Then he's on the wanted list...

2345
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,270
- with the facial composite.
- Yes.

2346
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,439
- He got caught.
- What did he do as a spy?

2347
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:12,100
Starting Round Two, Pani Bottle became...

2348
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,869
very active.

2349
01:41:13,869 --> 01:41:15,510
He gave many ideas.

2350
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:18,039
His imagination was brilliant.

2351
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:21,210
He guessed that Leo was a spy
out of the blue.

2352
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:23,380
He's a spy...

2353
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:26,520
I made the right guess.

2354
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,359
I think I fell into a trance
because I was sincere about it.

2355
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:32,720
I didn't get tired from running.

2356
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:35,189
I don't even know how time flew by.

2357
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,100
Look at him. It means that we must hurry.

2358
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:41,170
What if he killed someone?

2359
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:43,069
Did he commit a murder?

2360
01:41:43,069 --> 01:41:45,470
Facial composites are made
only for violent crimes.

2361
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:46,810
Right. Also,

2362
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:49,609
a state of emergency was declared.

2363
01:41:50,779 --> 01:41:54,050
What if he murdered the president...

2364
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:57,680
- or the president of a corporation?
- Right.

2365
01:41:59,149 --> 01:42:00,750
The process of acting as a proxy...

2366
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:03,090
could be related to the prime minister.

2367
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:06,060
It could also be related
to acting as a proxy...

2368
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,760
for the president.

2369
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:09,500
- You're right.
- Yes.

2370
01:42:09,829 --> 01:42:13,569
When there's no president,
there has to be an acting president.

2371
01:42:13,569 --> 01:42:15,430
Is there a temporary holiday
when the president gets killed?

2372
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:17,899
Of course.

2373
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:19,939
No one went to work when
President Park Chung Hee was assassinated.

2374
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:22,510
The nation is paralyzed.

2375
01:42:23,409 --> 01:42:24,539
I think this is right.

2376
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:27,810
Did Leo assassinate the president?

2377
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,149
Yes, that is correct.

2378
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,489
Dong Min said that when the president gets
killed, it becomes a temporary holiday.

2379
01:42:33,489 --> 01:42:34,920
It happened for Park Chung Hee.

2380
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:37,989
Thankfully, we have someone older
on my team.

2381
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,090
It's nice to learn things like this.

2382
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,500
I watched "The Whirlwind" recently.

2383
01:42:46,699 --> 01:42:48,970
I'm glad that I did. The president gets
assassinated in that drama.

2384
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:54,739
Here are the reasons
for assassinating the president.

2385
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:58,439
It could be someone...

2386
01:42:58,909 --> 01:43:02,050
who has different political beliefs.

2387
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:04,550
Another reason is...

2388
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:07,949
that he's a spy.

2389
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,960
Is Leo a spy?

2390
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:12,689
Yes, that is correct.

2391
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,899
It's an emergency!

2392
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:27,170
Wait, this is what's important.

2393
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:29,909
I'm sure that everyone else knows...

2394
01:43:29,909 --> 01:43:31,510
that Leo assassinated the president.

2395
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:33,210
The president got killed.

2396
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:36,819
Most of them probably know
that Leo assassinated him.

2397
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:39,649
We'll organize the sentences...

2398
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:41,050
and make our guesses.

2399
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:43,220
- We have almost everything.
- We are almost there.

2400
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:44,359
We have everything.

2401
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:45,659
Let's take a look.

2402
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,090
Listen carefully.

2403
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,189
Leo is a spy.

2404
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,199
He assassinated the president.

2405
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,970
Then he got caught.

2406
01:43:58,939 --> 01:44:00,109
I'll go and give it a try.

2407
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:03,609
Please share the results later.

2408
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:21,689
I'll give it a try.

2409
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:23,229
- Here's my answer.
- Go ahead.

2410
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,100
Leo who's a spy...

2411
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:34,210
He killed the president of Dia Country.

2412
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:36,340
He assassinated him.

2413
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:41,409
After seeing his composite sketch...

2414
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:45,279
Leo was identified.

2415
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,720
He went to work.

2416
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,720
(Hong Jin Ho and Jang Dong Min's
attempt to answer)

2417
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,819
Leo...

2418
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:53,260
He committed suicide in the restroom.

2419
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:57,460
- Good work.
- Are we waiting?

2420
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:58,699
- It's over.
- Is it over?

2421
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:00,699
The game in the paradise is over.

2422
01:45:00,699 --> 01:45:02,100
(Paradise Money Challenge ends.)

2423
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:04,640
(Mansion Round 2)

2424
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:07,970
(30 minutes passed.)

2425
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:10,539
Here's the first clue.

2426
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:12,079
It's already been 30 minutes?

2427
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:16,079
A summit that was scheduled
a week later...

2428
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:18,180
in Dia Country has been canceled.

2429
01:45:19,149 --> 01:45:20,619
Is this part of the story?

2430
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:24,560
- He must have committed a national crime.
- Right.

2431
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,829
Then the issue is bigger than we thought.

2432
01:45:26,829 --> 01:45:29,460
It's not an individual problem.

2433
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,600
Oh, this must be it.

2434
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:35,729
This is it.

2435
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,369
Something like
the assassination of the president.

2436
01:45:40,869 --> 01:45:42,069
That's a possibility.

2437
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:44,880
- He killed the president.
- Right.

2438
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:47,180
When the president is assassinated,
stock prices plummet,

2439
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:48,479
and it's a national emergency.

2440
01:45:48,949 --> 01:45:50,119
The summit would be canceled too.

2441
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,949
Did Leo assassinate the president?

2442
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:56,319
Yes, that is correct.

2443
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:01,390
It's true that Leo killed the president.

2444
01:46:01,659 --> 01:46:02,689
I thought so.

2445
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,000
It's very important,
but we don't have enough keywords.

2446
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,529
Yes, we don't have enough.

2447
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:10,500
I bet the keyword is "Temporary Holiday."

2448
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:13,369
- This proxy...
- And so...

2449
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:15,810
- Could it be the acting president?
- this is what we should ask.

2450
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:18,479
What if he killed the president
because he's really a spy?

2451
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,250
It became a temporary holiday
due to the president's funeral.

2452
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:25,079
Is the process of acting as a proxy
in the newspaper headline...

2453
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:26,750
related to the acting president?

2454
01:46:27,289 --> 01:46:28,449
Yes, that is correct.

2455
01:46:29,289 --> 01:46:31,890
Is Leo's nationality Dia Country?

2456
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,930
No, that is incorrect.

2457
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,100
So...

2458
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
- What did she say?
- It's over.

2459
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:43,170
Is it over?

2460
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,439
"Is Leo's nationality Dia Country?"

2461
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:46,770
- No.
- Right.

2462
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:48,970
Gosh, this is crazy.

2463
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,180
I knew it. I'm good at this.

2464
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:55,810
I wish there were
only questions like this.

2465
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,819
We've already found about three...

2466
01:46:58,079 --> 01:46:59,750
of the most crucial keywords.

2467
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:04,420
It felt like
we broke through this really fast.

2468
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:06,260
There isn't much left.

2469
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,930
Shall we guess the answer?

2470
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,460
I think we're ready.

2471
01:47:14,569 --> 01:47:15,770
Here's my answer.

2472
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:24,210
Did everyone leave?

2473
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,739
Everyone left.

2474
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:27,779
- What?
- All of them left.

2475
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,319
Wait, let's see.

2476
01:47:34,289 --> 01:47:35,590
Did you get the correct answer?

2477
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:36,989
He went to say the answer.

2478
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:38,359
How much did you complete?

2479
01:47:38,789 --> 01:47:40,430
This is our first try.

2480
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:53,909
Leo snuck into Dia Country as a spy.

2481
01:47:53,909 --> 01:47:56,239
While hiding his identity
and pretending to work,

2482
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,539
he assassinated
the president of Dia Country.

2483
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:02,109
On a temporary holiday to commemorate
the president, he went to work.

2484
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:04,949
As his facial composite was shown
in newspaper articles,

2485
01:48:04,949 --> 01:48:06,319
and the police dragnet kept closing,

2486
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:08,850
in order to hide the secret
out of patriotism,

2487
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:10,489
he committed suicide in the restroom.

2488
01:48:10,489 --> 01:48:18,000
(Xitsuh's attempt to answer)

2489
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,579
You're missing one keyword.

2490
01:48:31,579 --> 01:48:34,149
Five minutes has been added to your time.

2491
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:35,609
Okay.

2492
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:39,819
That's a bummer.
Just one missing keyword, right?

2493
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:42,550
- Did you ask any questions?
- No.

2494
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:43,689
Darn it.

2495
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,399
They must have figured something out.

2496
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:54,699
- Right.
- Because of this...

2497
01:48:54,699 --> 01:48:56,000
We're missing one keyword.

2498
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,069
I think...

2499
01:48:57,970 --> 01:49:00,439
it's a method or location of suicide.

2500
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:03,880
Did Leo hang himself in the restroom?

2501
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:06,579
- It is not important.
- Is it not important?

2502
01:49:07,579 --> 01:49:10,579
Did Leo die in the restroom
of a subway station?

2503
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,319
No, that is incorrect.

2504
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,760
Is his company important?

2505
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,359
Does Leo work at the subway station?

2506
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:21,729
No, that is incorrect.

2507
01:49:21,729 --> 01:49:23,760
What kind of keyword
could be missing here?

2508
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,069
(The last keyword under the veil)

2509
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:38,079
We have to win.

2510
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:39,539
This is killing me.

2511
01:49:55,829 --> 01:49:58,699
As everyone was being self-interested,

2512
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,229
we only asked four questions each.

2513
01:50:01,329 --> 01:50:04,739
We asked fewer questions
than the other team.

2514
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,100
In this working atmosphere,

2515
01:50:06,439 --> 01:50:08,409
we can't help but lose again.

2516
01:50:08,609 --> 01:50:10,840
One of us will place last.

2517
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:16,449
Is there a way one of us can place first?

2518
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,550
If we do our best.

2519
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:21,619
That's not what I mean.

2520
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:25,859
If we're determined to make
one of us the winner,

2521
01:50:26,189 --> 01:50:28,789
- the person who's likely to win...
- That person shouldn't ask anything.

2522
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:30,829
- shouldn't ask questions.
- You're right.

2523
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:33,670
- If we distribute,
- If we distribute...

2524
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,229
we'll be able to even it out.

2525
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:38,600
At this rate, Kyung Ran and I
already had...

2526
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,609
higher scores.

2527
01:50:40,609 --> 01:50:43,579
Even if we didn't do anything,
we wouldn't place last.

2528
01:50:43,579 --> 01:50:46,380
It would've been Steve or Chungju-Man.

2529
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:47,609
You're right.

2530
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,380
Okay.

2531
01:50:52,279 --> 01:50:54,550
In that case, will you...

2532
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,890
Will you support me?
Do I have it the best right now?

2533
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:59,520
You can do what you want.

2534
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,760
I was like,
"Are they trying to aggravate me?"

2535
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,970
"I don't know why they're here."

2536
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:08,800
I was so angry.

2537
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,539
In Round Two, the last place was decided.

2538
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:13,000
It was either me or Steve.

2539
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,739
I thought my team was being lazy.

2540
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,310
They had no intention to win.

2541
01:51:17,939 --> 01:51:19,579
My goal was a victory,

2542
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:21,649
but my teammates' goal wasn't a victory.

2543
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:24,520
To place first...

2544
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,789
I focused on what to do.
"What should I do?"

2545
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:31,060
"What should I do to make them move?"
I had such thoughts.

2546
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:39,899
I'll carry the ball.

2547
01:51:40,869 --> 01:51:41,869
What do you mean?

2548
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,770
I'll keep asking questions.

2549
01:51:47,069 --> 01:51:48,909
- I'll do that.
- If you place first,

2550
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:50,680
- give us the Immunity Pass.
- The Immunity Pass.

2551
01:51:50,909 --> 01:51:52,439
If it doesn't work,
let's have the Deathmatch.

2552
01:51:52,609 --> 01:51:54,180
I'll ask all the questions.

2553
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:55,710
But...

2554
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:58,380
No. I'm a bit angry right now.

2555
01:51:59,449 --> 01:52:02,550
I'll ask all the questions from now on.

2556
01:52:03,819 --> 01:52:04,920
You win.

2557
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:08,989
Okay? Let's go with that strategy.

2558
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,960
In that case, the moment...

2559
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,130
- I get a wrong answer...
- The Immunity Pass.

2560
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:15,869
No. I'll ask 400 questions.

2561
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:17,800
There's no way we can't get it right.

2562
01:52:18,039 --> 01:52:20,109
Hurry up and come up with the questions.
Do it right now.

2563
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:24,340
I thought, "This way,
they'll move at the very least."

2564
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:26,180
They had nothing to lose.

2565
01:52:26,409 --> 01:52:29,850
Chungju-Man seemed to be a bit angry.

2566
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:32,720
To be honest, I was thankful.

2567
01:52:32,949 --> 01:52:34,850
This team is doomed anyway.

2568
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:37,220
The last place will come
from this team anyway.

2569
01:52:37,789 --> 01:52:39,159
I just talked to them.

2570
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:40,430
I'll ask all the questions.

2571
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:42,789
I'll make her the first place.

2572
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,760
Hurry up and give me 50 or 400 questions.

2573
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,960
Okay.

2574
01:52:46,829 --> 01:52:47,930
Why are you suddenly doing this?

2575
01:52:48,329 --> 01:52:50,270
We can't win like this.

2576
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,000
Neither of them wants to win.

2577
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,069
They're just testing the waters.

2578
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,369
Chungju-Man made a shocking decision.

2579
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:57,810
I thought, "If that's how
it's going to be, okay."

2580
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:00,180
"Let's do our very best."

2581
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,380
- The method of suicide.
- The method?

2582
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,380
- Yes.
- Okay.

2583
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:05,079
Ask if he used his gun.

2584
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:06,750
Come up with more questions.

2585
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:09,750
Did he commit suicide with a gun?

2586
01:53:10,289 --> 01:53:11,760
It is not important.

2587
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,659
Did Leo think
the national emergency was...

2588
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,760
the president's responsibility?

2589
01:53:20,369 --> 01:53:23,430
Did Leo think the national emergency was
the president's responsibility?

2590
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:25,170
No, that is incorrect.

2591
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,869
Is Leo struggling financially?

2592
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:29,609
It is not important.

2593
01:53:29,739 --> 01:53:31,380
Does he work at the subway station?

2594
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:33,140
No, that is incorrect.

2595
01:53:33,609 --> 01:53:35,350
Was a temporary holiday announced...

2596
01:53:35,479 --> 01:53:37,619
because of the president's death?

2597
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:38,949
Yes, that is correct.

2598
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:44,060
Okay.

2599
01:53:49,359 --> 01:53:51,430
Does Leo work
for the National Intelligence Service?

2600
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,199
Possibly.

2601
01:53:57,239 --> 01:53:59,399
Here's the second clue.

2602
01:54:01,069 --> 01:54:03,640
Leo works for a nation.

2603
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:07,250
A nation.

2604
01:54:07,949 --> 01:54:09,850
He works for a nation?

2605
01:54:11,319 --> 01:54:12,979
- He works for a nation.
- Yes.

2606
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:18,359
Perhaps that nation isn't Dia,
but something else.

2607
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:21,859
A spy?

2608
01:54:23,729 --> 01:54:25,630
- He might be a spy.
- That's right.

2609
01:54:25,630 --> 01:54:27,270
He's close to being
a National Intelligence Service agent.

2610
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:29,600
He's a spy from another nation.

2611
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:32,770
He's either a spy or a Dia national...

2612
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:34,439
who's in a different group.

2613
01:54:34,439 --> 01:54:36,710
- An intelligence service.
- Thus, a spy.

2614
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:38,810
- He might be a spy.
- Yes.

2615
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:41,710
- Is Leo a spy?
- Yes, that is correct.

2616
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:45,020
Then the keywords are...

2617
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,920
- We have five.
- We need to ask more questions.

2618
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,220
We need to ask more questions.

2619
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:53,560
The other team could've figured this out.

2620
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:54,930
Something is missing.

2621
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:58,930
My goodness, hello.

2622
01:54:58,930 --> 01:55:01,630
Steve isn't asking any questions.
Are you the only one who's doing it?

2623
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:03,739
Are you the only one
who's asking questions?

2624
01:55:03,739 --> 01:55:06,539
We're working together,
but I'm taking the lead.

2625
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:08,640
Why are you curious?

2626
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:11,840
- We're doomed.
- Things got too complicated.

2627
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:15,050
In that team, one person
is carrying the ball.

2628
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:16,979
That's why they're trying nonstop.

2629
01:55:17,149 --> 01:55:18,380
He must be angry.

2630
01:55:18,819 --> 01:55:21,420
Let's hurry up and think of the answer.

2631
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,619
Did Leo die alone?

2632
01:55:24,289 --> 01:55:25,460
Yes, that is correct.

2633
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,229
Did his coworker find his body?

2634
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:29,859
It is not important.

2635
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:35,329
Did Leo have a personal vendetta...

2636
01:55:35,329 --> 01:55:38,140
against the country
or the president of Dia?

2637
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:40,439
No, that is incorrect.

2638
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:42,439
It wasn't vengeance.

2639
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,680
It wasn't the assassination motive.

2640
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:48,609
What could be the keywords?

2641
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:50,149
We did everything we could do.

2642
01:55:50,449 --> 01:55:52,220
- What?
- We did everything we could do.

2643
01:55:53,319 --> 01:55:54,789
If Chungju-Man...

2644
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:59,319
gets the correct answer at this rate...

2645
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:03,130
We keep gaining time as we ask questions.

2646
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:05,329
We might place last unless we watch out.

2647
01:56:06,130 --> 01:56:08,529
It isn't the assassination method.
It isn't the assassination motive.

2648
01:56:08,829 --> 01:56:10,399
What could be the keyword?

2649
01:56:12,569 --> 01:56:13,770
It wasn't vengeance.

2650
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:16,109
That means he was a patriotic spy...

2651
01:56:16,409 --> 01:56:19,010
who was trained by his nation.

2652
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:20,750
- That sounds right.
- Right?

2653
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:27,649
What more do we need?

2654
01:56:28,119 --> 01:56:32,159
We felt so lost
because of the last keyword.

2655
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:35,189
Here's the third clue.

2656
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:39,500
Leo doesn't take the subway to work.

2657
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,970
(Leo doesn't take the subway to work.)

2658
01:56:41,699 --> 01:56:42,829
- What?
- What?

2659
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:44,640
Why did we get that information?

2660
01:56:45,869 --> 01:56:48,210
But he doesn't work at the subway station.

2661
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:50,380
Why did he head to the subway station?

2662
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:54,850
Let's ask if he works inside the subway.

2663
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:56,979
What Leo can do...

2664
01:56:56,979 --> 01:56:58,380
- inside the subway...
- But it wasn't the subway restroom.

2665
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:00,020
- It was a company restroom.
- Yes.

2666
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,920
Did he go to the subway...

2667
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,189
to bring something?

2668
01:57:06,619 --> 01:57:08,529
I guess he bought a newspaper
at the subway station.

2669
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,630
- Did he buy a newspaper there?
- Yes.

2670
01:57:11,899 --> 01:57:13,930
- Buying a newspaper is the only answer.
- Yes.

2671
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:19,300
Did Leo buy a newspaper
at the subway station?

2672
01:57:24,609 --> 01:57:26,979
- It is not important.
- For goodness' sake.

2673
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:30,180
Does he work inside the subway?

2674
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:31,420
Shall I ask that?

2675
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,680
We asked so many questions
about the subway.

2676
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,520
Did he die in the subway?
Does he work at the subway station?

2677
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,359
Does he work inside the subway?
We asked so many questions.

2678
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,590
Judging by how we got another clue
about the subway,

2679
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,859
"Subway" is an important keyword.

2680
01:57:42,859 --> 01:57:44,260
What was in there?

2681
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,960
(The subway station is depicted
in the picture.)

2682
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,899
(What's the last remaining clue?)

2683
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:01,649
What?

2684
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:04,880
Storage lockers.

2685
01:58:05,479 --> 01:58:07,050
That's how he gets orders.

2686
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:09,689
You're right.

2687
01:58:10,689 --> 01:58:11,789
Subway station.

2688
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,859
I remembered what I saw in a spy movie.
The image of people doing dealings...

2689
01:58:17,859 --> 01:58:20,329
through storage lockers came to me.

2690
01:58:20,329 --> 01:58:21,329
And I thought...

2691
01:58:22,029 --> 01:58:24,000
There were storage lockers in the picture.

2692
01:58:24,199 --> 01:58:26,399
Orders are the only things he can receive.

2693
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:30,109
If he received an order, it must've been
an order to commit suicide.

2694
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:33,039
He was ordered to commit suicide
at the subway station.

2695
01:58:33,779 --> 01:58:35,750
He got an order through a storage locker.

2696
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:37,319
Hold on. If this is right...

2697
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:41,420
We said, "This is incredible.
Let's hurry up and check."

2698
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:43,920
When I opened the door and went outside...

2699
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,300
Is he trying out his answer?

2700
01:59:02,109 --> 01:59:05,340
For the 1st time,
all 4 members were standing.

2701
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,010
Seeing all of them outside made me think,

2702
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:11,079
"This is bad."

2703
01:59:12,149 --> 01:59:13,319
Right now...

2704
01:59:13,319 --> 01:59:15,420
- Did they share information?
- I don't know.

2705
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:16,949
They're playing rock-paper-scissors.

2706
01:59:16,949 --> 01:59:18,060
We're doomed.

2707
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,890
What's taking him so long?

2708
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:26,829
(Right after the new clue was given)

2709
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:30,399
Leo doesn't take the subway to work.

2710
01:59:31,899 --> 01:59:33,539
- What?
- Why did we get that information?

2711
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:35,039
- What?
- What?

2712
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:39,109
I can smell it.

2713
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:41,050
- That's right.
- I see.

2714
01:59:43,479 --> 01:59:45,479
Storage lockers at the subway.

2715
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:46,720
Storage lockers.

2716
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,050
- An order.
- An order.

2717
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:49,250
- An order.
- Storage lockers.

2718
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:51,390
He receives orders
through storage lockers.

2719
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,130
He was ordered to commit suicide.

2720
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,729
Was Leo ordered to commit suicide?

2721
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:05,270
Yes, that is correct.

2722
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,340
Are the orders given
at the storage lockers at the subway?

2723
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:11,880
(Are the orders given
at the storage lockers at the subway?)

2724
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,039
Yes, that is correct.

2725
02:00:13,479 --> 02:00:14,880
Here is my answer.

2726
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,279
I think...

2727
02:00:18,819 --> 02:00:20,550
- we're in trouble.
- Why?

2728
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,649
If Chungju-Man goes in there...

2729
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:25,859
- and gives the correct answer,
- I'm listening.

2730
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:30,489
the situation will be messed up.

2731
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:32,659
He said he'd check
if the answer was incorrect.

2732
02:00:32,659 --> 02:00:34,199
If it ends up being correct,

2733
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:36,229
one of us will place last.

2734
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:38,369
Despite losing so many points,

2735
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,010
he will eventually gain
something positive from it.

2736
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:42,869
- He shouldn't get the answer.
- He shouldn't get the answer.

2737
02:00:43,909 --> 02:00:45,340
He really shouldn't. Why did he...

2738
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:52,720
The president of Dia was assassinated.

2739
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,050
The culprit is Leo.

2740
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:58,289
Although Leo lives in Dia,
he's a spy from another nation.

2741
02:00:58,819 --> 02:01:02,189
He receives an order every morning
via storage lockers at the subway.

2742
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,300
On the day of the president's funeral...

2743
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,800
which became a temporary holiday,

2744
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:09,000
Dia is in a national emergency.

2745
02:01:09,329 --> 02:01:11,699
Because of this, a summit was canceled...

2746
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:13,270
and the economy fell into crisis.

2747
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,869
That day, Leo read an article...

2748
02:01:14,869 --> 02:01:18,210
in which he was pointed out
as the man who assassinated the president.

2749
02:01:18,439 --> 02:01:22,279
A man in his 30s, composite sketch...
All the clues pointed to him.

2750
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:26,720
That day as always, Leo went
to the storage lockers for orders.

2751
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,390
He was ordered to commit suicide.

2752
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:36,260
In the end, Leo committed suicide alone
in the restroom.

2753
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:39,100
(In the end, Leo committed suicide alone
in the restroom.)

2754
02:01:40,529 --> 02:01:42,800
- If it's correct, what should we do?
- What's taking him so long?

2755
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:45,970
Think about what to do
in case the answer is correct.

2756
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:47,909
What should we do?

2757
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:49,640
We need to be precise.

2758
02:01:50,439 --> 02:01:52,140
- Why didn't we think of this?
- Seriously.

2759
02:01:52,539 --> 02:01:53,939
There's... There's no solution.

2760
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,890
Chungju-Man, your answer is correct.

2761
02:02:01,649 --> 02:02:03,590
Since two extra keywords were included,

2762
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:06,260
four minutes have been deducted
from your time.

2763
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:10,430
(Keyword 4, keyword 5)

2764
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:12,560
(Disclosure, order)

2765
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,229
(Extra keywords: Fake employment,
storage locker, temporary holiday)

2766
02:02:14,699 --> 02:02:18,069
Chungju-Man, you'll be isolated
until this round ends.

2767
02:02:18,069 --> 02:02:19,270
(The first answerer, Chungju-Man)

2768
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:21,239
He went into that room.

2769
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:23,170
He got the correct answer.

2770
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:25,609
- Really?
- Yes.

2771
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,010
What are we going to do?

2772
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:28,979
He got the correct answer.

2773
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:30,850
What are we going to do?
Hurry up and think.

2774
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:32,520
What should we do? Rock-paper-scissors?

2775
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,050
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2776
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:35,890
Only three people can answer correctly.

2777
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,090
The one who doesn't go in...

2778
02:02:38,359 --> 02:02:40,689
will take the fall.

2779
02:02:40,859 --> 02:02:44,800
Chungju-Man was the tanker of the team.

2780
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,260
Thus, he wasn't supposed to go in there...

2781
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:49,670
and get the correct answer.
That wasn't the original plan.

2782
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:54,609
It was satisfying.

2783
02:02:58,609 --> 02:03:01,079
You live alone.
This is an individual event.

2784
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:03,409
If you're worried about someone,

2785
02:03:03,949 --> 02:03:05,149
it isn't a survival show.

2786
02:03:05,279 --> 02:03:07,050
Things have become complicated.

2787
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:09,819
I told you. Let's be fair
and play rock-paper-scissors.

2788
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:12,020
- Play or lose.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2789
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:13,819
Thank you for your hard work.

2790
02:03:15,289 --> 02:03:18,300
(Steve Yea enters the voting room.)

2791
02:03:18,659 --> 02:03:20,300
Everything is a mess.

2792
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:22,369
- Things have become complicated.
- Totally.

2793
02:03:23,529 --> 02:03:26,739
It was a bad idea
to make someone the first place.

2794
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:30,670
It can't be helped.

2795
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:35,250
Things have become complicated.

2796
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:36,579
Steve Yea, your answer is correct.

2797
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:38,220
(The second answerer, Steve Yea)

2798
02:03:40,989 --> 02:03:41,989
All right.

2799
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:45,619
The two of us...

2800
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:53,659
If you place first,
you can give me the Immunity Pass.

2801
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:55,369
- Right.
- You can go.

2802
02:03:55,729 --> 02:03:58,000
- Let's give each other the Immunity Pass.
- Right.

2803
02:03:59,239 --> 02:04:01,840
(Kim Kyung Ran enters
the voting room first.)

2804
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:08,010
But again, I could place last.

2805
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,949
Come to think of it, I could place last.

2806
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:13,750
The one who places last
can't receive the Immunity Pass.

2807
02:04:14,319 --> 02:04:16,319
I suddenly had a mental breakdown.

2808
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:18,359
Then I did the calculations.

2809
02:04:18,359 --> 02:04:21,789
I was the only one
who hadn't said the answer once.

2810
02:04:22,529 --> 02:04:23,789
So it was plus 40 minutes.

2811
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:29,199
- Then...
- I should've gone in.

2812
02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:31,970
- Don't you place last then?
- That's what I'm saying.

2813
02:04:31,970 --> 02:04:33,239
Why didn't you go in?

2814
02:04:33,569 --> 02:04:35,909
- Seriously.
- Kyung Ran, let me go.

2815
02:04:35,909 --> 02:04:37,579
I think I'll place last.

2816
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:39,979
After the crisis was announced,
the acting president...

2817
02:04:39,979 --> 02:04:43,350
Kyung Ran, let me go.
I think I'll place last.

2818
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:45,279
Kyung Ran.

2819
02:04:46,649 --> 02:04:47,689
Kyung Ran.

2820
02:04:49,649 --> 02:04:51,659
- Did you guys discuss it?
- How did this happen?

2821
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:52,989
Seriously. Why did I do that?

2822
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:54,529
You should've gone in.

2823
02:04:54,689 --> 02:04:55,930
Kyung Ran.

2824
02:04:56,229 --> 02:04:58,630
Why didn't I go in?

2825
02:04:58,859 --> 02:05:00,100
- Kyung Ran.
- How...

2826
02:05:01,399 --> 02:05:02,600
- Kyung Ran.
- What?

2827
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,800
I...

2828
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:16,449
There was an article about
the acting president's briefing.

2829
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:17,949
Kyung Ran.

2830
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:20,619
Why didn't I go in?

2831
02:05:20,619 --> 02:05:21,619
Seriously.

2832
02:05:22,119 --> 02:05:24,659
Kim Kyung Ran, your answer is correct.

2833
02:05:24,659 --> 02:05:25,859
(The last answerer, Kim Kyung Ran)

2834
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:32,229
In a pitiful and urgent voice,

2835
02:05:33,329 --> 02:05:36,670
she said, "Kyung Ran, come on out."

2836
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:39,939
I was very flustered.

2837
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:42,739
I wanted to place first...

2838
02:05:42,739 --> 02:05:46,010
and have a chance at victory.

2839
02:05:47,979 --> 02:05:49,079
Is it over?

2840
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:50,180
Yes.

2841
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:51,750
- Let's go.
- You can't give me the Immunity Pass...

2842
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:53,350
if I place last.

2843
02:05:56,289 --> 02:06:00,489
(Lee Gina couldn't give an answer.)

2844
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:04,659
Hold on. What will happen to Gina?

2845
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:07,800
There's a high possibility
she'll place last.

2846
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,369
Gosh, I'm going to place last.

2847
02:06:11,369 --> 02:06:12,899
Why did I do that?

2848
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:16,270
What am I going to do?

2849
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:17,569
- There's no way out.
- Seriously.

2850
02:06:17,569 --> 02:06:18,739
- You...
- They discarded you.

2851
02:06:18,739 --> 02:06:21,750
I was surprised to see their eyes go crazy
when it was time to answer.

2852
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:23,050
- Seriously.
- I know.

2853
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:25,449
As she entered, she told me
that she'd give me the Immunity Pass.

2854
02:06:25,449 --> 02:06:27,579
- I was like...
- No. That's nonsense.

2855
02:06:27,579 --> 02:06:28,789
- When if she doesn't place first?
- Seriously.

2856
02:06:28,789 --> 02:06:30,789
You can't get the Immunity Pass
if you place last.

2857
02:06:30,789 --> 02:06:32,020
- Seriously.
- That's what I'm saying.

2858
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:34,529
- They fooled you.
- What am I going to do?

2859
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,760
Why did I do that?

2860
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,859
How will she give you the Immunity Pass...

2861
02:06:37,859 --> 02:06:39,659
- if she can't place first?
- Not even rock-paper-scissors?

2862
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:40,699
They didn't play rock-paper-scissors.

2863
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:42,000
Why did I do that?

2864
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,630
The two of them didn't play
rock-paper-scissors.

2865
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:44,640
No, they didn't.

2866
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:46,869
- Kyung Ran lied to her.
- Why did I do that?

2867
02:06:46,869 --> 02:06:48,569
What am I going to do?

2868
02:06:48,569 --> 02:06:50,439
There's only one thing you can do.

2869
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:53,180
- You'll have a Deathmatch no matter what.
- True.

2870
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:55,810
You have to choose two of your teammates.

2871
02:06:55,810 --> 02:06:57,250
That's right. They backstabbed you.

2872
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:59,079
- Afterward...
- I really don't want to do it.

2873
02:06:59,079 --> 02:07:01,119
Let's say you survive the Deathmatch.

2874
02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:03,449
Can you team up with them again?
You can't do that.

2875
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:04,460
Of course not.

2876
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:06,359
So here's an idea.

2877
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:08,159
- Do you want to team up with us?
- Do you want to team up with us?

2878
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:09,260
Of course.

2879
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:11,159
- This is important.
- To be honest,

2880
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:13,960
I trusted Kyung Ran.

2881
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:14,970
Okay.

2882
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:20,140
But in retrospect,
she pulled the rug from under my feet.

2883
02:07:20,369 --> 02:07:22,210
- I...
- You did all the work for nothing.

2884
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:23,840
- You asked questions too.
- I got there first.

2885
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,010
Why did I do that?

2886
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:26,079
- Seriously.
- Why did you do that?

2887
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:27,779
It was politics. You're the spy.

2888
02:07:27,779 --> 02:07:29,210
You need to survive.

2889
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:32,420
From the four-player alliance...

2890
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:34,119
- Seriously.
- You got tossed aside.

2891
02:07:34,119 --> 02:07:35,750
I was an idiot.

2892
02:07:35,850 --> 02:07:39,819
In any case, 20 minutes
weren't added to their time.

2893
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:41,659
I was the only one
who got the double amount.

2894
02:07:41,659 --> 02:07:43,890
You know, I feel so bad right now.

2895
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:45,529
When I was in the voting room,

2896
02:07:45,529 --> 02:07:47,699
Gina kept going, "Kyung Ran, come on out."

2897
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:49,699
- Really?
- Why did she want you to come out?

2898
02:07:50,899 --> 02:07:53,439
She was worried that she'd place last.

2899
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:57,670
The only option you had
was to give the incorrect answer.

2900
02:07:58,310 --> 02:07:59,909
(Sighing)

2901
02:07:59,909 --> 02:08:01,250
I hadn’t thought of that method.

2902
02:08:01,579 --> 02:08:03,779
Regardless of that,

2903
02:08:03,779 --> 02:08:06,449
you should've taken your time
for the strategy to work.

2904
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,550
- The two of you...
- Seriously.

2905
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:10,619
should've stood behind the three...

2906
02:08:10,619 --> 02:08:12,289
- and watched how things played out.
- You should've taken your time.

2907
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:15,060
- That would've been better.
- It didn't even occur to me.

2908
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:18,800
"You should've entered later.
You should've answered incorrectly."

2909
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,800
I simply did my best,

2910
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,340
but I suddenly became a traitor.
It was something I never wanted.

2911
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:28,640
It was suffocating and uncomfortable.

2912
02:08:29,210 --> 02:08:32,539
Steve, you could've entered later then.

2913
02:08:32,539 --> 02:08:33,539
Right.

2914
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:35,050
I had a chance of placing last.

2915
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,050
What about us?

2916
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,220
That was why I suggested playing
rock-paper-scissors.

2917
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:40,850
- You know...
- I'll be honest with you.

2918
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:42,850
I said this to Chungju-Man
as soon as I entered.

2919
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:45,760
I came up with a huge portion
of the answer...

2920
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:47,989
from the assassination to the espionage.

2921
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:50,430
But I didn't demand an advantage
regarding those matters.

2922
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:51,960
I asked for a fair match
of rock-paper-scissors.

2923
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:53,960
I was ready to get eliminated if I lost.

2924
02:08:54,199 --> 02:08:56,869
So it's wrong for you to ask me
why I played rock-paper-scissors...

2925
02:08:56,869 --> 02:08:58,500
and entered first.

2926
02:08:58,699 --> 02:09:00,140
She voiced her dissatisfaction...

2927
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:01,409
about me entering first
after playing rock-paper-scissors.

2928
02:09:01,409 --> 02:09:03,670
Although I had contributed the most,

2929
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:05,680
I didn't ask for any advantages.

2930
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:08,250
We had played rock-paper-scissors fairly,

2931
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:11,050
so it made no sense for her to complain.

2932
02:09:11,050 --> 02:09:12,850
It upset me very much.

2933
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,890
To be honest, I didn't know
that you'd play rock-paper-scissors.

2934
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:17,989
- We played rock-paper-scissors.
- I didn't know that.

2935
02:09:17,989 --> 02:09:20,090
When we talked about it first,

2936
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:22,489
- I said, "Gina, you can place first."
- Yes.

2937
02:09:22,489 --> 02:09:23,560
But...

2938
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:26,430
in any case, you entered.

2939
02:09:27,699 --> 02:09:30,670
I thought Gina would enter.

2940
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:32,939
But Steve entered and said
that they played rock-paper-scissors.

2941
02:09:32,939 --> 02:09:34,909
I thought Gina would enter last,
but Kyung Ran entered.

2942
02:09:34,909 --> 02:09:37,369
So I judged them correctly.

2943
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:41,979
I don't think I can team up...

2944
02:09:41,979 --> 02:09:43,779
with anyone in this group.

2945
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:47,220
Because the two of them did that, I...

2946
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:49,520
Seriously, I...

2947
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:54,989
Why did I do that?

2948
02:09:57,229 --> 02:09:58,760
Why did I do that?

2949
02:09:59,430 --> 02:10:00,960
For goodness' sake.

2950
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,630
I can't help but laugh
since it's so ridiculous.

2951
02:10:03,630 --> 02:10:05,170
You guys were a team.

2952
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:08,810
To be honest, it felt so futile.

2953
02:10:09,369 --> 02:10:10,640
I also felt betrayed.

2954
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:12,939
I didn't know what I was doing.

2955
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:15,810
It was like that.

2956
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:19,220
Mystery Time is over.

2957
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:21,850
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2958
02:10:23,789 --> 02:10:26,319
- Then...
- What have I done?

2959
02:10:29,829 --> 02:10:32,329
You never know.
Chungju-Man might have asked...

2960
02:10:32,829 --> 02:10:35,000
- a lot of questions...
- Yes.

2961
02:10:35,029 --> 02:10:37,000
- and gotten incorrect answers.
- Right.

2962
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:00,520
Then I was asked questions like...

2963
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,529
- if he held any grudges.
- Remove it.

2964
02:11:02,529 --> 02:11:03,760
In just 15 minutes.

2965
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,829
Gina.

2966
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:06,829
Gosh, it was guaranteed.

2967
02:11:06,829 --> 02:11:08,470
- I'm...
- It's only a ten second difference.

2968
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:10,329
- First...
- You're right.

2969
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:12,399
Why didn't you play rock-paper-scissors?

2970
02:11:13,569 --> 02:11:16,239
- You two...
- While we were talking,

2971
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:17,939
we were telling each other
to go ahead first.

2972
02:11:17,939 --> 02:11:19,939
Then she told me to enter first,

2973
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:23,550
and if I won, I would give her the pass.

2974
02:11:23,550 --> 02:11:25,180
Because we had the same score anyway.

2975
02:11:25,649 --> 02:11:27,020
Is that what you agreed on?

2976
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:35,760
When I was told
only one keyword was missing...

2977
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:38,960
In the end...

2978
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:40,399
I could've done better.

2979
02:11:42,199 --> 02:11:44,229
All games are over.

2980
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,670
The players who didn't get the answer
in Round 2...

2981
02:11:47,939 --> 02:11:49,670
will receive 20 extra minutes.

2982
02:11:50,039 --> 02:11:51,039
That's a lot.

2983
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:53,710
Here is the whole story of Round 2.

2984
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:57,750
Leo is a spy who works for Clover.

2985
02:11:57,949 --> 02:12:01,520
He got a job undercover
at an ordinary company in Dia Country...

2986
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,250
to fulfill his assignment.

2987
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:07,720
Every morning, he checks his mission
in the subway station locker.

2988
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:11,560
One day, Leo receives a mission...

2989
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:13,359
to assassinate
the president of Dia Country.

2990
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:15,329
On the D-day,

2991
02:12:15,329 --> 02:12:18,539
Leo completes the mission
with other spies.

2992
02:12:19,539 --> 02:12:21,470
Due to the state-level emergency,

2993
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:24,470
Dia Country designates
a temporary holiday.

2994
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:27,680
The next day,
Leo heads to the subway station...

2995
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:30,210
to check the mission as always.

2996
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:32,920
The mission tells him to commit suicide...

2997
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,789
before his identity gets caught.

2998
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:38,720
Leo then goes to the restroom
and commits suicide as the mission says.

2999
02:12:41,090 --> 02:12:43,260
Here is the result of the Money Challenge.

3000
02:12:44,229 --> 02:12:45,229
Please.

3001
02:12:45,229 --> 02:12:47,659
The player who placed last
in the Money Challenge today was...

3002
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:55,970
(Xitsuh)

3003
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:59,640
Xitsuh.

3004
02:13:11,289 --> 02:13:13,920
I will announce the names...

3005
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,659
of the players according
to the amount of time.

3006
02:13:16,930 --> 02:13:18,960
Seventh, Xitsuh.

3007
02:13:19,859 --> 02:13:21,869
Sixth, Lee Gina.

3008
02:13:22,829 --> 02:13:24,800
Fifth, Chungju-Man.

3009
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:27,439
Fourth, Steve Yea.

3010
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:29,970
Third, Kim Min A.

3011
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:32,880
Second, Kim Kyung Ran.

3012
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:38,250
First, Acau.

3013
02:13:38,649 --> 02:13:40,649
Gosh, it's all mixed up.

3014
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:44,489
(Mystery Time Mansion Final Results)

3015
02:13:44,489 --> 02:13:46,159
(1st, Acau, 2 hours and 32 minutes)

3016
02:13:50,859 --> 02:13:53,899
(After Acau got it correct in Round 1,)

3017
02:13:55,729 --> 02:14:00,239
(Xitsuh used the tanking strategy
to buy time.)

3018
02:14:00,899 --> 02:14:03,609
(He submitted the answer
32 minutes after Acau.)

3019
02:14:03,609 --> 02:14:06,939
(He got 20 minutes extra
because he failed to answer Round 2.)

3020
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:08,449
My play was wrong.

3021
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:12,420
I didn't even think about
how to avoid coming in last.

3022
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:16,050
I only focused on answering Round 2.

3023
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:19,090
I didn't think about what I should've done
if I didn't answer it.

3024
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:27,159
Oh, my. I survived.

3025
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:29,270
I was suddenly in a good mood.

3026
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:32,439
It felt like I shouldn't be laughing.

3027
02:14:32,439 --> 02:14:33,500
"Keep calm."

3028
02:14:34,439 --> 02:14:35,539
I kept telling myself.

3029
02:14:36,170 --> 02:14:39,140
The player who placed first
in the Money Challenge was Acau.

3030
02:14:39,979 --> 02:14:43,479
Acau the winner shall enter
the voting room immediately...

3031
02:14:43,649 --> 02:14:45,380
and take 20,000 dollars
from his private funds...

3032
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:47,649
and the key to Pandora's Box.

3033
02:14:48,649 --> 02:14:53,020
Also, choose a player to be exempted
from elimination...

3034
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:57,460
except for Xitsuh, who came in last.

3035
02:14:59,699 --> 02:15:02,000
You must've asked so many questions.

3036
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:04,399
I thought it was guaranteed to be me.

3037
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:06,300
In Round 2...

3038
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,010
- We kept splitting it.
- That's what I mean.

3039
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:10,270
You should've asked more.

3040
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:11,579
We split it.

3041
02:15:11,579 --> 02:15:13,010
- So...
- We split it.

3042
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:14,479
- You didn't think it was you.
- Seriously,

3043
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:17,050
I thought it had to be me.

3044
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:20,050
How much did you sacrifice yourself?

3045
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:22,319
I never saw that coming.

3046
02:15:22,649 --> 02:15:23,890
I didn't see that coming at all.

3047
02:15:24,649 --> 02:15:26,689
Obviously, I thought...

3048
02:15:26,689 --> 02:15:28,829
I expected it to be me.

3049
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:30,260
I'll be right back.

3050
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:33,000
I wanted to check Pandora's Box.

3051
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:37,029
How many questions do you have to ask
to beat me?

3052
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,340
Can't she read the room?

3053
02:15:41,609 --> 02:15:43,340
She kept going,
"I thought I would come last,"

3054
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:45,680
when Xitsuh was right next to her.

3055
02:15:46,210 --> 02:15:47,939
Some people are dumb.

3056
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,979
She can't hide her emotions.

3057
02:15:52,319 --> 02:15:54,180
All games are over.

3058
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:58,520
Here is the result of the Money Challenge.

3059
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:01,420
The player who placed first
in the Money Challenge today was...

3060
02:16:08,729 --> 02:16:10,569
Heo Seong Beom.

3061
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:21,340
I had a good hunch in this game.

3062
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:23,310
If there were many possibilities,

3063
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:27,819
I was attracted
to the highest possibility.

3064
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:30,850
And it was right.

3065
02:16:31,489 --> 02:16:34,590
Do you want to try this answer?

3066
02:16:34,889 --> 02:16:35,889
Okay.

3067
02:16:35,889 --> 02:16:38,760
Then I'll send MJ Kim for number two.

3068
02:16:39,059 --> 02:16:40,930
- Okay.
- I'll go for number three to play safe.

3069
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:44,729
(Heo Seong Beom, MJ Kim,
and Jang Dong Min...)

3070
02:16:44,729 --> 02:16:47,870
(went for the answer in order.)

3071
02:16:47,870 --> 02:16:48,909
That's correct.

3072
02:16:48,909 --> 02:16:53,180
(After 3 people got the answer,
Round 2 ended.)

3073
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:56,950
The player who placed last
in the Money Challenge today was...

3074
02:17:07,559 --> 02:17:08,659
(Joo Eon Kyu)

3075
02:17:08,659 --> 02:17:12,100
Joo Eon Kyu.

3076
02:17:23,709 --> 02:17:26,139
Here is my answer.

3077
02:17:26,510 --> 02:17:28,850
"Leo who resides in Dia Country..."

3078
02:17:28,850 --> 02:17:31,379
"works as a spy..."

3079
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:33,879
"with a man who's suspected
to be in his 30s."

3080
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:38,790
"That day, Leo committed suicide
in the restroom."

3081
02:17:41,159 --> 02:17:42,229
That is incorrect.

3082
02:17:42,229 --> 02:17:43,760
(His story was incorrect.)

3083
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:46,629
Joo Eon Kyu, five minutes will be added
to your time.

3084
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,629
I'll try the answer.

3085
02:17:48,969 --> 02:17:50,670
"He's working as a spy..."

3086
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:53,540
"to cancel the summit that's taking place
in Dia Country in a week."

3087
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:58,040
"Because he failed the mission..."

3088
02:17:58,739 --> 02:17:59,840
That is incorrect.

3089
02:18:00,379 --> 02:18:02,680
Hong Jin Ho, five minutes will be added
to your time.

3090
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:03,680
Okay.

3091
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:06,120
(Hong Jin Ho goes over the story.)

3092
02:18:06,420 --> 02:18:08,719
Did he go to work every day...

3093
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:12,059
to hide his spy identity?

3094
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:15,360
Was Leo's goal canceling the summit?

3095
02:18:15,659 --> 02:18:18,360
Was Leo scared when he died?

3096
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:22,770
I have everything.

3097
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:25,440
I thought it was correct.

3098
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:29,870
I should've thought
about the missing link.

3099
02:18:30,110 --> 02:18:33,540
I made the stupid choice...

3100
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:36,780
of going over everything from the start.

3101
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:38,450
(Mystery Time Paradise Final Result)

3102
02:18:38,450 --> 02:18:39,979
(1st, Heo Seong Beom, 1 hour 48 minutes)

3103
02:18:39,979 --> 02:18:41,750
(2nd, Jang Dong Min, 1 hour 49 minutes)

3104
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:45,520
Heo Seong Beom the winner shall enter
the voting room...

3105
02:18:46,459 --> 02:18:48,319
and take 20,000 dollars
from his private funds...

3106
02:18:48,319 --> 02:18:50,629
and the key to Pandora's Box.

3107
02:18:52,159 --> 02:18:53,930
I knew when Pandora's Box opened,

3108
02:18:53,930 --> 02:18:57,700
it'd benefit the remaining players.

3109
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,639
One rule of the Day of the Raid said,
"If Pandora's Box opened,"

3110
02:19:00,639 --> 02:19:03,069
"a favorable benefit would be given
to the remaining players during the raid."

3111
02:19:03,069 --> 02:19:04,770
Opening it is the best option.

3112
02:19:05,079 --> 02:19:08,280
If I win and receive Pandora's Box
as a reward,

3113
02:19:08,510 --> 02:19:10,680
then I am bound to open it.

3114
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:12,479
You can't help but open it.

3115
02:19:12,479 --> 02:19:13,750
But if I were to say something...

3116
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:15,319
Pandora's Box must contain a benefit.

3117
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:20,620
Also, choose a player to be exempted
from elimination...

3118
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:26,229
except for Joo Eon Kyu, who came in last.

3119
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:28,399
Me. Pick me.

3120
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:29,930
- See you later.
- Pick me.

3121
02:19:30,270 --> 02:19:32,469
- Bye.
- We share the room. Pick me.

3122
02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:40,879
The winner of the Money Challenge,
Heo Seong Beom.

3123
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:42,049
Yes.

3124
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:45,379
The winner of the Money Challenge, Acau.

3125
02:19:45,379 --> 02:19:47,250
When all voting ends,

3126
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:49,389
you may enter the voting room alone
anytime you want...

3127
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:52,020
To open Pandora's Box.

3128
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:58,090
Select one player to be exempted
from elimination...

3129
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:00,059
along with you.

3130
02:20:01,829 --> 02:20:04,899
Ever since we formed the triple alliance,

3131
02:20:05,299 --> 02:20:08,270
we agreed to give it
to the person in 2nd if you won.

3132
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:09,510
That's for the best.

3133
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:14,209
So if any of us comes in first,
let's consider it a competition,

3134
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:17,510
and give the Immunity Pass
to the person in second place.

3135
02:20:17,909 --> 02:20:20,479
- There's nothing for third place.
- Okay.

3136
02:20:21,149 --> 02:20:23,590
I'll give it to Dong Min.

3137
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:26,520
(He chooses Jang Dong Min as he promised.)

3138
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:28,629
- Okay.
- Now, select one player...

3139
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:31,459
to be exempted from elimination
along with you.

3140
02:20:33,459 --> 02:20:36,530
I'll use the Immunity Pass on Kim Min A.

3141
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:37,899
(He chooses Kim Min A from his alliance.)

3142
02:20:37,899 --> 02:20:40,739
Min A deserved it because...

3143
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:44,940
she put on a satisfactory play.

3144
02:20:44,940 --> 02:20:47,909
Actually, I've been thinking
now that this happened,

3145
02:20:47,909 --> 02:20:50,709
I'll be at ease if Xitsuh places last.

3146
02:20:51,450 --> 02:20:54,120
Because that way, I'm guaranteed
to receive the Immunity Pass.

3147
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,149
"There will be times when I will benefit
from other's misfortunes."

3148
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:57,950
Still, it was nice to survive.

3149
02:21:05,659 --> 02:21:06,760
If you're going to keep it...

3150
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:07,799
(The Mansion's Money Challenge
result arrives.)

3151
02:21:07,799 --> 02:21:10,069
- The result...
- The members will be determined now.

3152
02:21:12,870 --> 02:21:14,739
- Now...
- What happened to Xitsuh?

3153
02:21:15,469 --> 02:21:16,610
Xitsuh?

3154
02:21:17,309 --> 02:21:18,409
Yes!

3155
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:22,450
- Yes!
- My goodness.

3156
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:25,110
Is Xitsuh coming here? That's awesome.

3157
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:26,979
I love it.

3158
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:29,219
Great.

3159
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:31,959
We need someone like Xitsuh.

3160
02:21:32,489 --> 02:21:35,930
Although I've never met him before,

3161
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:38,329
when I saw him on TV,
he was straightforward like a bulldozer.

3162
02:21:38,329 --> 02:21:39,530
I was so excited.

3163
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:42,799
Xitsuh could be the offense.

3164
02:21:43,569 --> 02:21:45,399
I want Xitsuh to come.

3165
02:21:46,639 --> 02:21:47,940
I wish Xitsuh would come.

3166
02:21:49,309 --> 02:21:53,680
Jin Ho said he got along with Xitsuh.

3167
02:21:53,909 --> 02:21:56,010
Since Xitsuh is experienced,

3168
02:21:56,250 --> 02:22:01,180
it'll be advantageous for us
to raid together with him.

3169
02:22:01,479 --> 02:22:05,520
So I thought it'd be nice to have Xitsuh.

3170
02:22:08,559 --> 02:22:12,200
Xitsuh who placed last
in the Money Challenge...

3171
02:22:12,559 --> 02:22:14,459
automatically becomes
an elimination candidate...

3172
02:22:14,459 --> 02:22:15,899
and will face a Deathmatch.

3173
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:19,239
Xitsuh shall enter
the voting room immediately...

3174
02:22:19,399 --> 02:22:21,909
and choose two candidates
for the Deathmatch...

3175
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:25,809
excluding Acau and Kim Min A.

3176
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:37,049
I tried not to think about
who was better at the game.

3177
02:22:37,049 --> 02:22:40,290
Honestly, it doesn't matter who I face.

3178
02:22:42,389 --> 02:22:43,930
Who do you think Xitsuh will pick?

3179
02:22:44,590 --> 02:22:46,829
We never talked about it because...

3180
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:48,500
I expected her to be eliminated.

3181
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:49,930
It was obviously me.

3182
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,139
- It was me without a doubt.
- So we never talked about it.

3183
02:22:54,469 --> 02:22:56,809
- Without a doubt?
- It was me without a doubt.

3184
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:58,709
An extra 20 minutes is too much.

3185
02:22:58,709 --> 02:23:01,680
I think Xitsuh will just choose
whoever he wants.

3186
02:23:01,909 --> 02:23:04,950
He already announced me yesterday.

3187
02:23:05,350 --> 02:23:06,520
- Xitsuh...
- Me too.

3188
02:23:07,250 --> 02:23:08,850
- That he will choose you?
- Yes.

3189
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:11,690
Me and Chungju-Man.

3190
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:13,719
I was 2nd, and she was 3rd.

3191
02:23:13,889 --> 02:23:15,459
Was I? Anyway,

3192
02:23:15,989 --> 02:23:17,659
I think it'll be the two of us.

3193
02:23:19,629 --> 02:23:21,200
When we had a drink the night before,

3194
02:23:21,459 --> 02:23:23,200
we asked him who he'd choose.

3195
02:23:23,299 --> 02:23:26,270
Honestly, I'd choose Lim Hyun Seo,
Chungju-Man,

3196
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:28,100
or Kim Kyung Ran.

3197
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,569
Hyun Seo is 1st, then 2nd and 3rd.

3198
02:23:31,309 --> 02:23:33,510
Xitsuh would pick me.

3199
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:36,750
Here is the result.

3200
02:23:37,579 --> 02:23:41,180
The first player Xitsuh picked
for the Deathmatch was...

3201
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:46,459
- What?
- What?

3202
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:53,729
Steve Yea.

3203
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:58,030
- What?
- I thought it was already discussed.

3204
02:23:58,030 --> 02:23:59,370
When we talked about it downstairs...

3205
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:01,440
- That's not what we talked about.
- That's totally...

3206
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:03,409
It was a surprise...

3207
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:04,940
because...

3208
02:24:05,639 --> 02:24:06,909
I'll talk to Xitsuh...

3209
02:24:07,079 --> 02:24:09,780
so one of us can be on your side,
no matter what.

3210
02:24:10,049 --> 02:24:12,850
If you win first in Round 2,

3211
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:14,649
let me place third.

3212
02:24:14,649 --> 02:24:17,590
If anyone chooses me for the Deathmatch,
I can suppress it with voting.

3213
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:19,559
- With voting?
- Yes.

3214
02:24:19,559 --> 02:24:21,459
If one of us gets picked,

3215
02:24:21,459 --> 02:24:24,389
- will you vote for us?
- How...

3216
02:24:24,489 --> 02:24:26,399
I'll do that. I'll support you.

3217
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:27,559
How many? Two or three?

3218
02:24:28,399 --> 02:24:30,430
- As many as you need.
- Okay.

3219
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:32,000
I'll let them know.

3220
02:24:32,739 --> 02:24:34,540
What's going on?
Did you make a secret promise?

3221
02:24:35,069 --> 02:24:36,809
- What?
- Were you talking about the Deathmatch?

3222
02:24:36,969 --> 02:24:38,709
- Were you...
- We talked about the Deathmatch.

3223
02:24:39,409 --> 02:24:41,239
I'll be honest. I got a safety net.

3224
02:24:44,149 --> 02:24:45,420
I'm going to survive.

3225
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:51,250
Why Steve?

3226
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:55,530
Although it was shallow,
he still felt like an ally?

3227
02:24:56,659 --> 02:24:57,829
What's going on?

3228
02:24:58,190 --> 02:25:00,799
That was unexpected, but yes.

3229
02:25:00,899 --> 02:25:02,870
Steve got on my nerves so much.

3230
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:06,440
He was bragging about
how he'd win all the games.

3231
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:09,209
To avoid the Deathmatch,
he betrayed the team.

3232
02:25:09,370 --> 02:25:11,040
He made a deal with them...

3233
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,940
and offered to pay them
if they saved his butt.

3234
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:15,040
Then he was selected.

3235
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:18,309
I saw how surprised he was,

3236
02:25:18,649 --> 02:25:20,180
and it served him right.

3237
02:25:21,149 --> 02:25:24,750
The second player Xitsuh picked
for the Deathmatch was...

3238
02:25:31,559 --> 02:25:34,430
Kim Kyung Ran.

3239
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:49,680
You will now start voting...

3240
02:25:49,979 --> 02:25:52,649
between Steve Yea and Kim Kyung Ran.

3241
02:25:53,819 --> 02:25:56,350
All players must vote...

3242
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:58,250
for one player...

3243
02:25:58,389 --> 02:25:59,860
to participate in the Deathmatch.

3244
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:02,889
The voting will end in an hour.

3245
02:26:05,129 --> 02:26:07,899
- I just don't get it.
- I know.

3246
02:26:07,899 --> 02:26:09,129
What was he thinking?

3247
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:11,899
Why did he choose you?

3248
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:15,299
"Why did he pick me?"

3249
02:26:15,299 --> 02:26:17,309
It was a question mark.

3250
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:19,280
If Xitsuh chose me...

3251
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:22,209
because he thought I was easy
to deal with,

3252
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:24,809
there must be a misunderstanding.

3253
02:26:24,809 --> 02:26:26,149
It can only be one or the other
why he chose me.

3254
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:29,020
Xitsuh either wants to try
something with me...

3255
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:34,719
or he might have chosen me
who'd win in votes.

3256
02:26:35,629 --> 02:26:37,629
To let Kyung Ran go.

3257
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:40,760
- If you win...
- If he chooses me,

3258
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:43,569
- Kyung Ran is guaranteed to come.
- True.

3259
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:45,069
That only makes sense.

3260
02:26:45,069 --> 02:26:46,239
- Right?
- Yes.

3261
02:26:46,899 --> 02:26:48,799
I can't believe him.

3262
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:53,180
That stimulated me so much.

3263
02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:03,319
- Well, I'll do it.
- What's happening?

3264
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:06,159
My goodness.

3265
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:12,430
It's better for me to get eliminated.

3266
02:27:12,430 --> 02:27:13,700
Gosh, I felt...

3267
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:15,870
I felt so bad earlier.

3268
02:27:16,569 --> 02:27:19,770
- Because you were shouting desperately.
- Earlier...

3269
02:27:20,299 --> 02:27:22,709
- I felt so bad.
- Sorry.

3270
02:27:23,969 --> 02:27:25,680
I could tell...

3271
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:29,479
that she felt so bad
from the look in her eyes and face.

3272
02:27:29,979 --> 02:27:31,850
She really didn't see that coming.

3273
02:27:32,549 --> 02:27:34,379
"I should've made concessions."

3274
02:27:34,379 --> 02:27:37,620
"Why did I let you make concessions?"

3275
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:39,489
I could read all that in her face.

3276
02:27:40,059 --> 02:27:42,389
I could tell how sincere she was
from the look in her eyes.

3277
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:45,389
I realized she never meant it.

3278
02:27:45,389 --> 02:27:46,760
She didn't intend it.

3279
02:27:47,399 --> 02:27:49,069
My anger was gone when I saw her eyes.

3280
02:27:49,729 --> 02:27:51,969
I was like, "Okay."

3281
02:27:51,969 --> 02:27:54,639
I couldn't waste any second.

3282
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:56,770
(Kim Min A calls Acau.)

3283
02:27:56,770 --> 02:27:58,110
But...

3284
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:02,309
Are you going to vote for Kyung Ran?

3285
02:28:02,309 --> 02:28:04,610
- Yes, I should.
- But I promised...

3286
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:07,020
not to vote for her.

3287
02:28:07,719 --> 02:28:09,989
(This morning)

3288
02:28:09,989 --> 02:28:12,149
I've thought about it.

3289
02:28:12,989 --> 02:28:15,190
If we get selected,
let's not select each other.

3290
02:28:15,930 --> 02:28:18,829
Aside from that, there will be a vote.

3291
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,100
Let's not vote for each other.

3292
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:22,229
That's what I mean.

3293
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:24,370
It occurred to me at that moment.

3294
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:25,899
"I made a promise."

3295
02:28:26,370 --> 02:28:27,569
"What should I do?"

3296
02:28:27,569 --> 02:28:31,469
If you decide not to vote for her...

3297
02:28:31,469 --> 02:28:33,479
because you were on that team,

3298
02:28:33,610 --> 02:28:34,780
it'd make sense.

3299
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:36,409
That's only the right thing to do.

3300
02:28:37,149 --> 02:28:38,610
But not in a situation
where we have to get rid of her.

3301
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:43,850
In the end, if there's a spy,

3302
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:45,690
- you have to get rid of it.
- Yes.

3303
02:28:46,059 --> 02:28:47,819
Based on the conversation...

3304
02:28:47,819 --> 02:28:50,159
Min A and I had,

3305
02:28:50,159 --> 02:28:52,299
she would vote for Kyung Ran.

3306
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:55,329
- What's happening?
- I have no idea.

3307
02:28:55,629 --> 02:28:58,329
- Didn't you talk to Acau and Xitsuh?
- I already talked to Acau.

3308
02:28:58,329 --> 02:29:01,600
- Did you talk to Xitsuh too?
- I did.

3309
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,469
But we didn't promise we wouldn't choose
each other for the Deathmatch.

3310
02:29:04,469 --> 02:29:08,040
- But honestly, it wasn't necessary.
- It makes no sense.

3311
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:09,909
- It's more like a basic rule.
- That's what I mean.

3312
02:29:09,909 --> 02:29:12,879
Because this is my first time,

3313
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:14,750
I'm...

3314
02:29:15,579 --> 02:29:16,719
This makes no sense.

3315
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,250
Go talk to him.

3316
02:29:23,389 --> 02:29:25,059
- What's going on?
- Come in.

3317
02:29:25,129 --> 02:29:28,329
Honestly, when I was downstairs,

3318
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:30,829
I said I'd pick Chungju-Man.

3319
02:29:31,129 --> 02:29:32,270
This happened out of the blue.

3320
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,110
Since I'm responsible for this,

3321
02:29:36,110 --> 02:29:38,069
I'll purchase extra votes
and use them on you.

3322
02:29:38,170 --> 02:29:39,680
- Me too.
- I'll vote for her.

3323
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,479
I'll purchase extra votes
to use them on you.

3324
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:45,180
Did Chungju-Man say
he'd vote for Kyung Ran for sure?

3325
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,079
- For the Deathmatch.
- I think so.

3326
02:29:47,079 --> 02:29:49,590
We're communicating the most.

3327
02:29:50,389 --> 02:29:52,790
I think Acau, Min A,

3328
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:55,889
and Chungju-Man will vote for Kyung Ran.

3329
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:58,059
- They might spend a lot of money.
- You...

3330
02:29:58,059 --> 02:29:59,229
You need to...

3331
02:29:59,399 --> 02:30:01,659
- spend your money too.
- Those two might spend a lot.

3332
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,530
How many votes do we need
to keep you safe?

3333
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:10,139
We can't buy ten votes on Kyung Ran.

3334
02:30:10,139 --> 02:30:12,780
- We don't know how much she made.
- That's the thing.

3335
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:14,440
- That's the problem.
- That's the biggest problem.

3336
02:30:16,579 --> 02:30:18,649
She might spend everything
she earned on this.

3337
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:23,450
We didn't know how much Kyung Ran had.

3338
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:25,250
I'm expecting 100,000 dollars roughly.

3339
02:30:25,649 --> 02:30:27,889
Your annual salary last year...

3340
02:30:27,889 --> 02:30:29,530
was 210,000 dollars.

3341
02:30:30,059 --> 02:30:33,629
Your private funds based on your
annual salary is 100,000 dollars.

3342
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Steve, your annual salary last year...

3343
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:39,840
was 1.3 million dollars.

3344
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:43,969
Your private funds based on
your annual salary is 200,000 dollars.

3345
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:47,340
My budget is the highest.

3346
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:49,479
I'm in a favorable position.

3347
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,809
(2023 Annual Salary)

3348
02:30:51,809 --> 02:30:53,549
(Steve Yea, 1.3 million dollars,
Acau, 800,000 dollars)

3349
02:30:53,549 --> 02:30:55,350
(Players' Private Funds)

3350
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:57,090
(Steve Yea, 200,000 dollars,
Acau, 170,000 dollars)

3351
02:30:57,319 --> 02:30:59,590
- You must survive.
- Right.

3352
02:30:59,590 --> 02:31:01,920
- Because we'll team up tomorrow.
- Yes.

3353
02:31:02,659 --> 02:31:03,760
Right?

3354
02:31:04,829 --> 02:31:06,000
I got it.

3355
02:31:16,139 --> 02:31:17,510
Honestly, first place...

3356
02:31:18,010 --> 02:31:20,739
- Can we talk for a second?
- Oh, yes.

3357
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:22,180
- Can I?
- Sure.

3358
02:31:23,350 --> 02:31:26,950
I know the decision is up to you.

3359
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,049
We made a promise.

3360
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:33,219
Because my team chose Steve,

3361
02:31:33,459 --> 02:31:36,090
it's only right for us...

3362
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:38,229
to purchase various votes.

3363
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:42,260
I knew the game was set.

3364
02:31:43,229 --> 02:31:47,600
(The conversation soon ended.)

3365
02:31:56,450 --> 02:31:57,950
It only felt right for me to go.

3366
02:31:58,450 --> 02:31:59,750
Since then I was...

3367
02:32:02,819 --> 02:32:03,920
I will have to go for it.

3368
02:32:08,819 --> 02:32:09,989
If I transfer it to you,

3369
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:14,700
give it back to me when I'm back.

3370
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:16,899
If we get to meet again.

3371
02:32:18,770 --> 02:32:20,700
Kyung Ran gave up.

3372
02:32:20,899 --> 02:32:23,639
She decided to transfer
all her money to me.

3373
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:26,040
Are you going to transfer it
before you leave?

3374
02:32:26,579 --> 02:32:27,639
Yes.

3375
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:30,479
If I lose in the Deathmatch,

3376
02:32:30,950 --> 02:32:32,850
it'll be zero.

3377
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:36,920
Then I might as well give it to Gina
who had a hard time.

3378
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,760
You must last long.

3379
02:32:41,319 --> 02:32:43,290
Transfer it to me.
I'll give you back every penny.

3380
02:32:46,229 --> 02:32:48,200
Then I don't have to use my money.

3381
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:50,670
What do you mean?

3382
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:52,370
Right now,

3383
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,600
you say you'll transfer it,

3384
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:57,440
but you could buy more votes.

3385
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:59,809
I have to buy a few as well for defense.

3386
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:02,950
If you transfer your budget,
I'll give you back 20,000 dollars...

3387
02:33:03,579 --> 02:33:05,579
on top of your budget.

3388
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:07,319
If you come back.

3389
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,250
Both transfer it to me.

3390
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:10,319
This is possible.

3391
02:33:10,450 --> 02:33:12,350
Because I was planning to spend
my money too.

3392
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:14,389
It includes the money I get to save.

3393
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:16,059
Are you saying
you're not going to spend it?

3394
02:33:16,329 --> 02:33:18,790
I don't have to spend any if she doesn't.

3395
02:33:19,159 --> 02:33:21,229
I might lose if other people spend it.

3396
02:33:21,729 --> 02:33:24,430
But that's a big variable.

3397
02:33:24,969 --> 02:33:26,940
Don't you think that's way too cruel?

3398
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:28,440
What do you mean?

3399
02:33:28,569 --> 02:33:30,569
- What's so cruel about it?
- If I don't spend it...

3400
02:33:37,409 --> 02:33:38,450
It was ridiculous.

3401
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:41,850
If she transferred her money to him,
he'd pay her back with interest.

3402
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:43,350
But they're Deathmatch competitors.

3403
02:33:44,549 --> 02:33:46,520
It was beyond ridiculous.

3404
02:33:47,719 --> 02:33:49,219
The look in his eyes.

3405
02:33:50,590 --> 02:33:51,690
Should I say...

3406
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,229
he's cunning?

3407
02:33:56,930 --> 02:33:59,370
He keeps looking for his chances
and feels people out.

3408
02:33:59,739 --> 02:34:03,239
He always looks at people like this.

3409
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:04,510
Like this.

3410
02:34:07,409 --> 02:34:09,239
Time really flies.

3411
02:34:09,239 --> 02:34:10,750
- One hour feels like...
- There's only ten minutes left?

3412
02:34:17,620 --> 02:34:19,520
(Kim Kyung Ran votes for Steve Yea
with 1 vote.)

3413
02:34:19,860 --> 02:34:23,360
(Lee Gina votes for Steve Yea
with 1 vote.)

3414
02:34:23,559 --> 02:34:25,059
I'll buy extra votes.

3415
02:34:25,489 --> 02:34:29,700
(Acau purchases 1 extra vote.)

3416
02:34:29,799 --> 02:34:32,100
(Acau votes for Kim Kyung Ran
with 2 votes.)

3417
02:34:32,430 --> 02:34:34,639
I'll buy extra votes.

3418
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:36,110
I'll buy four.

3419
02:34:36,409 --> 02:34:38,069
I calculated it...

3420
02:34:38,909 --> 02:34:40,979
and came up with a number...

3421
02:34:40,979 --> 02:34:42,780
that would lead me to victory.

3422
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:44,979
I'm guaranteed to win.

3423
02:34:44,979 --> 02:34:46,850
(Steve Yea votes for Kim Kyung Ran
with 5 votes.)

3424
02:34:47,979 --> 02:34:49,389
The voting is over.

3425
02:34:49,989 --> 02:34:51,620
Please gather in the main hall.

3426
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:58,989
Among Kim Kyung Ran and Steve Yea
who were selected by Xitsuh,

3427
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,159
the player to join the Deathmatch is...

3428
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,370
What?

3429
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:12,469
Steve Yea.

3430
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:16,549
I was stabbed in the back.

3431
02:35:16,649 --> 02:35:17,750
Big time.

3432
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:23,889
(Who's the traitor?)

3433
02:35:23,889 --> 02:35:28,319
(Who's the traitor?)

3434
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:33,530
Do I vote for the one to send away?

3435
02:35:33,799 --> 02:35:34,930
That's correct.

3436
02:35:35,299 --> 02:35:38,069
(Steve Yea)

3437
02:35:40,739 --> 02:35:42,239
(Steve Yea)

3438
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:45,770
There's no such thing as 100 percent.

3439
02:35:48,510 --> 02:35:49,879
He was too naive.

3440
02:35:51,450 --> 02:35:54,920
(50 minutes ago)

3441
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:57,420
- What's going on?
- I was...

3442
02:35:59,719 --> 02:36:01,020
There's no alternative.

3443
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:03,860
- Are you...
- There's no way I can beat Steve.

3444
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:06,129
You can't think like that.

3445
02:36:08,229 --> 02:36:10,799
You have to instigate people
to eliminate the strong.

3446
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:14,569
I believe the strong must be eliminated
in survival shows...

3447
02:36:14,569 --> 02:36:15,569
when you have the chance.

3448
02:36:15,569 --> 02:36:18,010
I mean, he's good.

3449
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:21,209
We won't have a chance
unless we eliminate him in the beginning.

3450
02:36:21,209 --> 02:36:23,010
I think Steve is a strong player.

3451
02:36:23,149 --> 02:36:25,350
I always say we must eliminate the strong.

3452
02:36:25,649 --> 02:36:26,920
Because he's my competitor.

3453
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:29,750
Aside from that, he's on their side.

3454
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:31,250
- Exactly.
- They're so close.

3455
02:36:31,250 --> 02:36:32,920
I'm aware of that too.

3456
02:36:33,020 --> 02:36:36,020
He'll say we must vote for you.

3457
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:38,590
But if you think about it,
it's only reasonable...

3458
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:40,229
to eliminate the strong.

3459
02:36:40,860 --> 02:36:44,270
Say they'll have to fight Steve later
and face him in the final.

3460
02:36:44,799 --> 02:36:46,670
Persuade them to go with you.

3461
02:36:46,969 --> 02:36:48,270
That's the only way.

3462
02:36:49,469 --> 02:36:53,479
I'd given up.

3463
02:36:54,139 --> 02:36:56,010
Then Chungju-Man's advice...

3464
02:36:56,309 --> 02:36:58,110
woke me up.

3465
02:36:58,709 --> 02:37:01,420
If you make it to the finals,

3466
02:37:01,719 --> 02:37:03,219
then...

3467
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:06,520
You know that Steve is strong.

3468
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:08,620
- Yes.
- He is strong.

3469
02:37:10,459 --> 02:37:14,030
We'll continue to play the game together.

3470
02:37:14,229 --> 02:37:15,760
I thought about who I wanted to play with.

3471
02:37:16,229 --> 02:37:17,729
I'd like to play with Kyung Ran.

3472
02:37:17,969 --> 02:37:20,139
I can't tell what's on Steve's mind.

3473
02:37:20,469 --> 02:37:23,639
And I don't like people
with strong opinions.

3474
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:27,479
The promise I made bothers me.

3475
02:37:27,479 --> 02:37:29,510
Because if I had been picked,

3476
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:31,950
- I would've asked them too.
- Is that what you want to do?

3477
02:37:32,149 --> 02:37:36,389
Then say I paid 20,000 dollars
and that you voted.

3478
02:37:36,389 --> 02:37:38,920
- We earned that money together anyway.
- Yes.

3479
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:40,719
- We can just...
- I see.

3480
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:42,260
Then you get to keep your promise.

3481
02:37:43,229 --> 02:37:45,790
- I'll win Steve's favor,
- Okay.

3482
02:37:45,790 --> 02:37:47,600
so I can make him spend his money.

3483
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:50,670
Promises are meant to be broken here.

3484
02:37:51,069 --> 02:37:53,770
But don't tell him the truth.

3485
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:57,610
- I was thinking about confessing.
- No. Don't.

3486
02:37:57,610 --> 02:37:59,879
If you do, it's no use.

3487
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:04,950
Acau only felt morally responsible
to select Steve.

3488
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:08,319
He didn't feel entitled to save Steve.

3489
02:38:08,379 --> 02:38:11,049
I'm planning to vote for Steve.

3490
02:38:11,649 --> 02:38:13,659
You must survive.

3491
02:38:13,659 --> 02:38:15,590
- We must send Steve.
- Exactly.

3492
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:19,129
I'll use my ticket on you,
so you must survive.

3493
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:23,430
If the situation changes in the future,
you must help me.

3494
02:38:23,430 --> 02:38:26,840
If you're going to support Kyung Ran,
you should buy a vote.

3495
02:38:27,239 --> 02:38:30,110
If you buy one for me,
I'll do my best to make it up to you.

3496
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:33,379
- You must survive.
- Okay.

3497
02:38:33,379 --> 02:38:34,840
I have no money.

3498
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:36,209
I have nothing.

3499
02:38:36,709 --> 02:38:38,780
This is one precious vote.

3500
02:38:39,719 --> 02:38:40,850
I'll buy one.

3501
02:38:40,850 --> 02:38:42,319
I'll buy extra votes.

3502
02:38:42,319 --> 02:38:45,920
I'll buy extra votes.

3503
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,959
(Kim Min A votes for Steve Yea
with 2 votes.)

3504
02:38:48,190 --> 02:38:50,090
Kim Kyung Ran, you must survive.

3505
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:51,690
(Lee Gina votes for Steve Yea
with 2 votes.)

3506
02:38:51,959 --> 02:38:53,329
Well,

3507
02:38:53,659 --> 02:38:56,500
he'll be gone once he ends up
in the Deathmatch.

3508
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:57,899
(Kim Kyung Ran votes for Steve Yea
with 6 votes.)

3509
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,139
(11 votes for Steve Yea,
7 votes for Kim Kyung Ran)

3510
02:39:02,139 --> 02:39:04,569
They knew...

3511
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:10,350
Steve Yea was a tough contender
to play the game with.

3512
02:39:10,549 --> 02:39:15,120
That's why they tried to protect me.

3513
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:19,149
I felt manipulated in a way.

3514
02:39:30,469 --> 02:39:33,739
- It's huge.
- Are we in ruins or what?

3515
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:38,670
This is horrible.

3516
02:39:43,549 --> 02:39:45,579
It's the perfect weather to die.

3517
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:51,950
The elimination candidate Xitsuh chose...

3518
02:39:52,989 --> 02:39:54,959
Steve Yea for his Deathmatch player.

3519
02:39:56,729 --> 02:39:58,059
Today's Deathmatch is...

3520
02:39:59,229 --> 02:40:01,930
a 2-on-2 Deathmatch.

3521
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:05,899
Here are your Deathmatch opponents.

3522
02:40:08,270 --> 02:40:09,600
What?

3523
02:40:10,139 --> 02:40:12,040
This is wrong.

3524
02:40:12,170 --> 02:40:13,680
Let's go. It's cool to be romantic.
