1
00:00:00,964 --> 00:00:02,623
I only take half the money I won.

2
00:00:02,623 --> 00:00:03,893
The money's burning!

3
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,634
- What are we supposed to ask?
- I'll carry the ball.

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:07,334
Kyung Ran, I might place last!

5
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:09,034
- Acau is gone!
- I'm coming for all of them.

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,003
- What's going on?
- Those scumbags.

7
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,034
- Over here!
- We'll get hurt.

8
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,233
There are two. Gosh.

9
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,374
Come out now.

10
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:17,773
- I calculated it wrong.
- I was afraid.

11
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,543
- I crumpled all of them.
- I found it.

12
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:21,314
- I couldn't even say it.
- I admit my defeat.

13
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,014
- You've become an Evil Spirit.
- I pick Gina.

14
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,753
- You've become an elimination candidate.
- Is this a curse?

15
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:26,584
- You keep suspecting me.
- It's every man for himself now.

16
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,154
- I will execute the Evil Spirit.
- You're doomed.

17
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,983
- Oh, Lord.
- It was three Evil Deed cards.

18
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,654
- Once they find out I'm the Archangel...
- It's me you're talking about.

19
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:33,724
- Let's go one at a time.
- I'm done.

20
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:34,963
Let's go.

21
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:58,953
(Jang Dong Min)

22
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:02,423
My biggest threat is myself.

23
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,853
I will no longer make mistakes...

24
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,353
and play perfectly...

25
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:09,924
so that I can aim for the championship.

26
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,234
(Steve Yea)

27
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,804
As I always say,
I have the best chance of winning.

28
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,403
It should be a fun game.

29
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:22,804
Hi there.

30
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:27,784
It's time.

31
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:31,383
(Nervous)

32
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:37,224
(Kim Min A)

33
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,523
I've come all the way here.
I should go to the finals.

34
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:42,323
Dong Min and Steve.

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,763
I'll send them home.

36
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,804
(Xitsuh)

37
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,344
I did everything I could...

38
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:57,213
to get here,

39
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,474
so I was confident.

40
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,484
I'm going to make it to the Final Match.

41
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:04,913
My only goal is winning first place.

42
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:14,023
(Heo Seong Beom)

43
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:16,264
I kept telling myself,
"I need to survive as long as possible."

44
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,563
Now, I'll have to get to the end.

45
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:21,334
I'd like to show people
how I beat my master.

46
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:26,033
I believe in myself to make it possible.

47
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:38,054
(Joo Eon Kyu)

48
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,454
You gave me one last chance,

49
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,084
so I must do my best.

50
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:47,523
Whatever the game may be,
I'll give it my all.

51
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,014
Hello, everyone.

52
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,813
The six players in the Pre-final Stage...

53
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:09,943
of Bloody Game, welcome.

54
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:15,153
The six-person individual match
of today's Pre-final Stage is...

55
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:18,523
Memory Count.

56
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:22,164
Memory Count is
a six-player individual game...

57
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,033
where participants must memorize...

58
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,634
and calculate values displayed...

59
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,033
on a game board of 100 cells
within a time limit to earn points.

60
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:33,943
At the start of the game,
the 100-cell game board displays...

61
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,443
natural numbers and arithmetic operations.

62
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:40,743
Players have ten minutes to memorize
the numbers and their positions.

63
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:44,614
After ten minutes,
all cells are replaced with blank blanks.

64
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:47,023
When it is a player's turn,

65
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,884
they can designate another player...

66
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:50,723
to answer a question
about the game board...

67
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:53,963
by specifying the alphabet and number
of the cell they must recall.

68
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,023
Players cannot designate a person...

69
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:59,364
who had previously designated them
during the same round.

70
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:02,433
The first player of each round...

71
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:05,873
is determined by the player
with the most funds.

72
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:09,873
The designated player must answer
within 30 seconds,

73
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:12,414
recalling either the natural number
or the arithmetic operation...

74
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:14,283
in the chosen cell.

75
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,414
If the designated player answers
correctly, they pass their turn.

76
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:19,984
If the designated player answers
incorrectly, they lose one point.

77
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:23,654
If the answer is incorrect,

78
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,854
the question passes to the player...

79
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:28,024
who designated them.

80
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:31,133
If the questioner answers correctly,
they pass their turn.

81
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,633
If the questioner answers incorrectly,
they lose one point.

82
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:37,534
From Round Six,
each player can use a Double Item...

83
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:40,404
once per game,
which allows them to earn double points.

84
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,104
If a Double Item is used,
a correct answer earns one point.

85
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:45,443
If it's an incorrect answer,
you lose two points.

86
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:48,313
A round ends when all players...

87
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,013
have been designated once.

88
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:54,083
Each cell can only be questioned
up to twice per player.

89
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:57,393
The game concludes
when all 100 cells have been revealed.

90
00:04:57,893 --> 00:05:00,724
At the end of the game, the two players
with the highest total scores...

91
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,193
advance to the Final Match.

92
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:04,393
I listened to the rules of Memory Count,

93
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,893
and I knew it wouldn't be easy.

94
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,333
Even if you do remember 100 numbers
out of nowhere,

95
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,904
I don't think you can recall them
correctly.

96
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:13,404
But to be honest with you,

97
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:17,443
I knew that I'd be better
than most of the players there.

98
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,513
Doing the math quickly...

99
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,013
and memorizing numbers.

100
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,614
I was pretty confident
in memorizing stuff.

101
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,154
So, I thought I might do well
if I played my cards right.

102
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:28,253
The game was revealed,

103
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:30,953
and I thought,
"I'm making it to the finals."

104
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:33,554
It's basically a memorization game.

105
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,393
And I'm pretty good at memorizing things.

106
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:41,664
I was 36 years old
when I won "The Genius."

107
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:44,573
But now I'm 46.

108
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:47,104
"It's been ten years for Dong Min,"

109
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:50,073
"and he wouldn't be as smart as he was."

110
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:53,174
There were a lot of people
who thought that.

111
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:55,544
I'd like to put myself up for the test,

112
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:58,414
and I'll have faith in my own brain.

113
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:01,224
Does that mean...

114
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:04,123
this is...

115
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:10,563
If the designated person...

116
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,063
answers correctly,

117
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:14,904
- I'm not losing any points.
- Right.

118
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:16,563
- You both pass your turns.
- Yes.

119
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:18,474
If that person fails, it comes back to me,

120
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,643
and I have to guess.
If I answer incorrectly, I lose a point.

121
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:22,474
- If we can team up...
- I see.

122
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:24,344
and work together...

123
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,243
We agree to only memorize
the numbers in Line A...

124
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:27,914
and ask each other those cells.

125
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:31,154
I think we'll be able to make it.

126
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:36,383
I've been had by so many schemes,

127
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:38,453
so I instantly thought
that I needed to do something.

128
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:39,693
I thought,

129
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,024
"They're going to use tricks
and come up with plans."

130
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:45,633
The plan I came up with
in five seconds was...

131
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,734
to give up on 25 cells.

132
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:50,503
We'll be on our own when we're designated.

133
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:53,234
But if we give each other the cells
that we memorized...

134
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:55,943
- You get what I mean, right?
- Yes.

135
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,313
We need to give each other the cells
that we know of...

136
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:58,714
to pass our turns.

137
00:06:58,714 --> 00:06:59,774
I see.

138
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:03,443
I'll memorize the numbers
on the top right,

139
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:06,813
so you memorize the numbers
on the bottom left.

140
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,794
Steve suggested a plan,

141
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:11,993
and it sounded pretty good.

142
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,424
According to the rules,

143
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:17,123
if the other person answers correctly,
I pass my turn as well.

144
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:18,794
The worst-case scenario is
that we both answer incorrectly.

145
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,904
So, we decided to divide the board
and memorize the numbers.

146
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:24,503
When we get the chance to designate one,
we promised to pick each other...

147
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,534
and choose those cells only.

148
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,703
For instance, I got the top-right part.

149
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:29,573
Xitsuh got the bottom-left part.

150
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,544
We'd have to memorize them fully...

151
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:32,873
and memorize the other 50...

152
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,914
so we could reduce the numbers
we needed to memorize from 100 to 75.

153
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:38,484
We're memorizing those, but...

154
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:45,823
"They must be talking about asking
each other the cells that they recall."

155
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:48,524
That's what I was thinking,
but I thought it was meaningless.

156
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:49,794
I decided to focus on myself.

157
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:51,433
That's how I play the game, after all.

158
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:54,964
I personally didn't want to talk in secret
when I've come this far.

159
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:57,503
This is too difficult.

160
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:02,573
Memory Count will now begin.

161
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:05,774
Here are the private funds of the players.

162
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,414
(Dong Min: 367,000 dollars,
Seong Beom: 152,000 dollars,)

163
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,753
(Steve: 22,000 dollars,
Eon Kyu: 20,000 dollars,)

164
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:12,253
(Min A: 20,000 dollars, Xitsuh: 0 dollars)

165
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,224
I never got to spend any of them.

166
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:16,154
I'm practically homeless.

167
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:19,594
Jang Dong Min has the most private funds,

168
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:22,294
so he will now pick the first players
of each round.

169
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:26,864
From Xitsuh...

170
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,433
to Eon Kyu. In this order.

171
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,404
Round One, Xitsuh.

172
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,244
Round Two, Heo Seong Beom.

173
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:37,443
Round Three, Jang Dong Min.

174
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,274
Round Four, Steve Yea.

175
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:41,113
Round Five, Kim Min A.

176
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:44,213
Round Six, Joo Eon Kyu.
These are the orders.

177
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,014
Memory Count will now begin.

178
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:48,784
Players,

179
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:51,823
you have 10 minutes to memorize
the numbers in 100 cells.

180
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:54,093
Please reveal the numbers.

181
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:56,563
Gosh.

182
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:58,933
This is so tricky.

183
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:20,624
Seriously.

184
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:22,683
This is too much.

185
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:25,823
It was a 10-by-10 board,

186
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,963
so I divided them into 4 5-by-5 boards.

187
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:31,833
I memorize each little board
by making up stories.

188
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,933
If the number is 52,

189
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,203
I eat a cucumber
since they're pronounced the same.

190
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,804
If it's 92, I eat grilled cucumber.

191
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:40,973
If it's 51, I grease the cucumber
and grill it.

192
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:44,113
I made up a story
related to those numbers...

193
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:45,843
and tried to use chains of memory.

194
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:47,313
"Which part should I memorize first?"

195
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,183
"How should I memorize them?"

196
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,544
"Which is the most effective method?"

197
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,514
I thought I should memorize
the first line,

198
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:54,483
so I tried to memorize all the numbers
in Column A.

199
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,494
There was a zone with numbers
that were easy to memorize at the center.

200
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:01,124
They were 48, 108, 719, 33...

201
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:04,563
They were easy to memorize
from my perspective. So, I did.

202
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:06,664
My goal was to answer the ones
I memorized correctly.

203
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:10,134
The figures were all weird.

204
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:11,703
So, I decided to memorize...

205
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:13,573
as many as I could.

206
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:16,374
You need to be strategic with this stuff.

207
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:20,374
Normally, people would be able...

208
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:22,683
to memorize all the numbers...

209
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:25,083
from Column A to Column E, Line 1 to 10.

210
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:29,024
So, I decided to memorize
the rest of the numbers.

211
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:31,024
To divide them
by East, West, South, and North,

212
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:35,394
I memorized the numbers
on the southeast side first.

213
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:37,634
Then, I moved on to the northeast side.

214
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,494
I memorized the ones on the right first.

215
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,703
Then, I went ahead
with the ones on the edge.

216
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:45,004
The ones that are easy to remember.

217
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:49,004
My strategy was to memorize those.

218
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:52,374
I was to memorize
the 25 numbers on the bottom left.

219
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,713
Steve was to memorize the 25 numbers...

220
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:57,284
on the top right.

221
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:00,183
I usually memorize it
by using a visual memory technique.

222
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:03,453
So, I memorized the whole screen
as if I was saving a picture.

223
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,054
I just memorized them as I usually did.

224
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:10,664
(The players memorize them
by using their own methods.)

225
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,994
This is so tough.

226
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,603
You have five minutes left.

227
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,904
You have one minute left.

228
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,443
It's been ten minutes.

229
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:37,424
Memory Count will now begin.

230
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,823
The 1st player of Round 1, Xitsuh,

231
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:42,424
state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

232
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:45,833
Steve, F2.

233
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:49,404
Steve, say the number that goes in F2.

234
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,833
(It's the top-right area
that Steve promised to memorize.)

235
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:56,103
My answer is 1,235.

236
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,544
F2, 1,235.

237
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,573
Correct.

238
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:03,983
I was certain that we'd win
unless we made mistakes.

239
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:06,313
In my mind, I thought it was already over.

240
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,754
Steve, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

241
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:12,223
Eon Kyu, J1.

242
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:16,323
Eon Kyu, say the number that goes in J1.

243
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:17,664
It's 44.

244
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,433
Eon Kyu is correct.

245
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,833
Eon Kyu, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

246
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,804
Dong Min, J10.

247
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,544
(The question, J10, falls into
the southeast side of the game board.)

248
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,843
It's 186.

249
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,183
That is correct.

250
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,914
You guys have a great memory.

251
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,414
Dong Min, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

252
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:43,054
Min A, F7.

253
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:46,494
Min A, say the number that goes in F7.

254
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:47,494
(It's Cell F7 on the southeast area.)

255
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:51,794
The most important part is
avoiding losing any points.

256
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:55,804
"I know the numbers in this area,
but the other must not."

257
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,304
That was my strategy.

258
00:12:58,103 --> 00:12:59,174
I do not know.

259
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,733
Min A is incorrect.

260
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,144
One point will be deducted.

261
00:13:02,144 --> 00:13:04,943
Dong Min gets the chance to answer.

262
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,274
It's 914.

263
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:10,713
F7 is 914.

264
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,654
He asked me about F7
when I was first picked,

265
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:14,583
but I wasn't even looking at that.

266
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:17,054
I didn't even try to guess it
as I hadn't looked into it.

267
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,924
Min A, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

268
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,424
Seong Beom, D5.

269
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:24,994
It's 79.

270
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:28,863
Seong Beom is incorrect.
One point will be deducted.

271
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:31,733
The chance to answer goes to Min A.

272
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,203
It's 48.

273
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,843
D5...

274
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:36,044
Oh, it was D5?

275
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,613
D5 is 48.

276
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:44,083
I was thinking
that people would overlook...

277
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:46,813
the central area which I had memorized.

278
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:49,054
So, I asked Seong Beom about D5,

279
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,994
and he failed,
so I thought my plan would work.

280
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:56,323
Seong Beom, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

281
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,294
I will choose Xitsuh.

282
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,134
C7.

283
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,774
My answer is 5,025.

284
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:09,044
C7...

285
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,244
is 5,025. That's correct.

286
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,174
Round One has ended.

287
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,144
Show me the board one more time.
This is so hard.

288
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,544
It's so difficult.

289
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,613
Round Two will begin.

290
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:23,254
The 1st player of Round 2, Heo Seong Beom,

291
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,853
state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

292
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:29,024
Eon Kyu, E5.

293
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:31,733
(Trembling)

294
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:35,264
I didn't know that one.

295
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:39,874
We normally use a calculator.

296
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,544
(A former economics YouTuber works
efficiently.)

297
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,044
Who memorizes and calculates things
in their heads?

298
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,514
I do not know.

299
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:52,613
Eon Kyu is incorrect.
One point will be deducted.

300
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:55,424
Seong Beom gets the chance to answer.

301
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:56,983
It's 108.

302
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,254
It is correct.

303
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:01,394
From the cells that people choose,

304
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:04,394
I can figure out
which areas they memorized.

305
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,733
If we're playing
until we disclose all 100 cells,

306
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:10,933
it's going to be a competition
of who knows more of rare cells.

307
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,744
I was going to use the cells
that other people already knew about.

308
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:16,573
That's how I attacked them.

309
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:19,713
Eon Kyu, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

310
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:23,414
Steve, H9.

311
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:28,183
Steve, say the number that goes in H9.

312
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:30,353
I do not know.

313
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,754
Steve is incorrect.
One point will be deducted.

314
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:36,394
Eon Kyu gets the chance to answer.

315
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:37,693
Sixteen.

316
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:39,863
Sixteen is correct.

317
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:43,463
Steve, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

318
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:46,404
Xitsuh, A7.

319
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:49,804
Xitsuh, say the number that goes in A7.

320
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,744
(Xitsuh sighing)

321
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:58,983
I'm doomed.

322
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:02,754
And Xitsuh started hesitating.

323
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,754
I was giggling so hard inside.

324
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,524
I thought, "You're going this far..."

325
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:09,264
"to act like we're not working as a team?"

326
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,733
It's been 30 seconds.
Please say your answer.

327
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,103
Twelve... No.

328
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,073
It's 28.

329
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:26,813
It is incorrect. You have lost one point.

330
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:29,843
Steve gets the chance to answer.

331
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:33,284
I was totally clueless
about the cells that I asked Xitsuh for.

332
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:35,024
Because I abandoned
those 25 cells in the first place.

333
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:36,924
Eight.

334
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:40,524
You are incorrect.
One point will be deducted.

335
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,963
(The two both lost points.)

336
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:47,394
I only had to memorize 25 cells,

337
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,833
but all of a sudden,
I was sure about 19 of them...

338
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,374
and couldn't remember the other six.

339
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:54,274
I was like, "Why can't I recall
the numbers that I just saw?"

340
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,603
I realized how stupid I was.

341
00:16:58,044 --> 00:16:59,473
It happens, you know.

342
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:03,544
You can be confused
when you memorize things.

343
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:06,613
Whatever. This is insane.

344
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:10,153
Xitsuh, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

345
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,393
Dong Min, A7.

346
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,294
It's 52.

347
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,434
Shoot.

348
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,704
A7 is 52.

349
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:28,974
Dong Min, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

350
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:32,073
Min A, F3.

351
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:33,474
I do not know.

352
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:35,744
Dong Min, say the answer.

353
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,214
It's 95.

354
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:39,684
That is correct.

355
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,684
(Xitsuh sighing)

356
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:45,123
(While the players struggle,)

357
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,923
(Dong Min is the only one
who hasn't lost any points.)

358
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,633
I was able to say the correct answers...

359
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,294
about the cells that I had memorized.

360
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:55,534
I felt safe.

361
00:17:55,534 --> 00:18:00,403
Seeing how the other players had
so many incorrect answers,

362
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:04,304
I felt even more secure
and recalled the numbers more easily.

363
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,813
- Min A.
- Seong Beom, D6.

364
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,514
- I do not know.
- Seong Beom is incorrect.

365
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:12,913
One point will be deducted.

366
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,123
Min A gets the chance to answer.

367
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:16,583
It's 719.

368
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,623
That is correct.

369
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,663
You're good.

370
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,734
Round Two has ended.

371
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:29,163
Round Three will follow.

372
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,534
The 1st player of Round 3, Dong Min.

373
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:34,704
Steve, J9.

374
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,704
Nineteen.

375
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:39,744
Steve is incorrect. One point is deducted.

376
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,784
Dong Min, say the answer.

377
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:45,954
My answer is 9,218.

378
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:49,224
That is correct.

379
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:52,754
Steve, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

380
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,893
Xitsuh, E10.

381
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:57,123
Darn it. I can't remember.

382
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:02,863
I thought, "We're done for."

383
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:09,544
(It's a cell in the bottom left.)

384
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:20,714
My answer is 35.

385
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:23,554
Xitsuh is incorrect.

386
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:24,794
One point will be deducted.

387
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,593
Steve, say the number...

388
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:28,593
that goes in E10.

389
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:30,294
It's 95.

390
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:31,794
Steve is incorrect.

391
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,294
One point is deducted.

392
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,264
When one thing goes wrong,
everything goes wrong.

393
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:39,333
When Xitsuh got the second one wrong,

394
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,444
even though I knew I was mistaken,
I even thought,

395
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,444
"Has he betrayed me?"

396
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,843
I even came to think that...

397
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:45,143
because it was so absurd.

398
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,373
I ended up...

399
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:48,514
taking Steve down with me.

400
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:50,444
He trusted me and asked me,

401
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:52,284
and I got them wrong twice in a row,

402
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:54,484
so Steve lost two points.

403
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,123
I was so pathetic.

404
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:58,754
Xitsuh, state the player to attack...

405
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:00,024
and the coordinates.

406
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:03,663
Min A, B8.

407
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:04,833
I do not know.

408
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:06,833
Xitsuh, say the number...

409
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,833
that goes in B8.

410
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,563
It's 87.

411
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,504
That is correct.

412
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:14,534
You know what's funny?

413
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:16,843
Weirdly enough, he failed to answer
only the ones that I asked.

414
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,774
Eon Kyu, E6.

415
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:23,383
I do not know.

416
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:25,613
Eon Kyu loses a point
for saying the incorrect answer.

417
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,853
Min A, say the answer.

418
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:29,353
Thirty-four.

419
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:31,754
That is incorrect.

420
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,224
One point will be deducted.

421
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,494
My plan was to say the correct answers...

422
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:37,663
about the cells that I had memorized.

423
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,694
But I failed to seize those opportunities.

424
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,804
That's where it all went wrong.

425
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:45,734
Seong Beom, I9.

426
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:47,903
Twenty.

427
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:49,444
Seong Beom is incorrect.

428
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:50,774
One point will be deducted.

429
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:53,113
Eon Kyu, say the number that goes in I9.

430
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:55,014
Sixty.

431
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,684
That is correct.

432
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:00,413
I pick Dong Min for F6.

433
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,593
Four...

434
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,994
Four hundred and nineteen.

435
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:11,734
Dong Min is incorrect.

436
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,133
One point will be deducted.

437
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,363
Seong Beom, answer F6.

438
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:17,004
My answer is 409.

439
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:18,704
(F6 is 409.)

440
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,804
F6 is 409.

441
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:24,204
(Dong Min lost his first point.)

442
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,173
There were 100 numbers,

443
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,643
so it was impossible to memorize them all.

444
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,944
Eon Kyu loses a point
for saying the incorrect answer.

445
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,254
Xitsuh is incorrect.

446
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:33,754
Min A is incorrect.

447
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,653
Steve is incorrect.

448
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,454
Seong Beom is incorrect.

449
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:39,323
It's 35.

450
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:40,794
That is correct.

451
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:43,423
Round Five has ended.

452
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:45,593
Round Six will begin.

453
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:47,694
From Round Six,

454
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:50,103
you may use the Double Item.

455
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:53,004
Each player gets only one,

456
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:55,974
and state that you want to use the item...

457
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:57,044
when another player picks you.

458
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:58,774
(You win 1 point for a correct answer
and lose 2 points for a wrong answer.)

459
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:02,083
Steve, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

460
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,583
(Thinking)

461
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:09,883
Xitsuh, B6.

462
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:12,724
Xitsuh, say the number...

463
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:13,794
that goes in B6.

464
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:22,403
It was the third time
that Steve picked me.

465
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,204
I needed to get that one right,

466
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:25,434
and it drove me insane.

467
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,643
My answer is 6,610.

468
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,744
That is correct.

469
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:37,684
The Double Item didn't even cross my mind.

470
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,813
I knew I'd be the worst person ever...

471
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:41,583
if I got that one wrong,

472
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:42,853
so I forgot...

473
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:46,754
that I had a Double Item at that moment.

474
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:50,494
Xitsuh, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

475
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:53,434
Dong Min, A8.

476
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,964
Dong Min, say the number that goes in A8.

477
00:22:56,964 --> 00:22:58,504
(It's in the southwest area,
which Dong Min hasn't memorized.)

478
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:00,974
A8?

479
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:10,113
I will use the Double Item.

480
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:17,383
(Dong Min is the first one
to use the Double Item.)

481
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:20,554
My answer is nine.

482
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,994
That is correct.

483
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:30,563
Dong Min earns a point
for a correct answer.

484
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:32,504
I looked around,

485
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:36,173
and it was clear...

486
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:37,843
that I had the upper hand,

487
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:38,843
so I was proud of it.

488
00:23:38,843 --> 00:23:41,413
I realized that I've still got it.

489
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:44,014
Eon Kyu, E2.

490
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:45,954
It is incorrect.
One point will be deducted.

491
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:47,784
Xitsuh is incorrect.

492
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,224
Seong Beom is incorrect.

493
00:23:49,254 --> 00:23:50,853
Steve is incorrect.

494
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,224
Min A, say the answer.

495
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:54,754
I can't remember any of the numbers.

496
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,964
It was a series of incorrect answers
in the later rounds.

497
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:58,194
(Sighing)

498
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:00,863
It was the toughest game on Bloody Game.

499
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,434
Min A loses a point
for saying the incorrect answer.

500
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,034
The number will not be disclosed.

501
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,204
(The players have run out of cells
they had memorized.)

502
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,603
Look at that mess.

503
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:12,014
Dong Min, say the number that goes in H4.

504
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:14,843
It's 83.

505
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:17,744
That is correct.

506
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:23,724
Xitsuh, G9.

507
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:25,093
Seven.

508
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:26,923
Xitsuh is incorrect.

509
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,323
It's 58.

510
00:24:29,423 --> 00:24:30,524
Correct.

511
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:32,333
How does he memorize them all?

512
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:35,163
I was honestly surprised.

513
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:38,133
Even if I had tried to memorize them
without any tricks,

514
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,333
I wouldn't have been able
to beat Dong Min.

515
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:40,873
My answer is 45.

516
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:42,044
That is correct.

517
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:43,544
(He was the only one
with consecutive correct answers,)

518
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:45,014
(while the other kept saying
incorrect answers.)

519
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,143
October 29.

520
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:48,214
I mean, 1,029.

521
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:51,813
Five thousand, nine hundred,

522
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:56,284
- and forty.
- I3 is correct.

523
00:24:56,853 --> 00:25:00,994
(Dong Min shows
an overwhelming accuracy rate.)

524
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,224
I can't believe it.

525
00:25:03,524 --> 00:25:04,893
Does that make sense to you?
He's like a beast.

526
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,903
Watching Dong Min,
I thought, "That's insane."

527
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:10,863
I couldn't help but think that.

528
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:12,673
We were all saying incorrect answers
in the later rounds,

529
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:16,244
and Dong Min kept succeeding
in answering them correctly...

530
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,044
when he was designated.

531
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:23,313
To be frank, it was hard to believe.

532
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,514
That's how unbelievably...

533
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:27,184
impressive it was.

534
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,684
I had already figured...

535
00:25:30,684 --> 00:25:32,093
that I was way ahead.

536
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:36,163
But the person going to the finals...

537
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:40,393
would affect me,

538
00:25:40,593 --> 00:25:42,434
so I was excited, worried,

539
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,633
and thrilled at the same time.

540
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,173
I will announce the interim score.

541
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:49,103
(The interim scores)

542
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:50,603
(Heo Seong Beom: Minus 14,
Steve Yea: Minus 15)

543
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:54,514
(Seong Beom and Steve are fighting
for 2nd place by a 1-point difference.)

544
00:25:55,413 --> 00:25:57,014
You should go up.

545
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,853
There's not much difference.

546
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:01,184
You should keep going.

547
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:04,184
I should have gone
with the standard tactic.

548
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:07,194
I was in 3rd place
with only 1 point lower than Seong Beom.

549
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,563
I thought,
"It would have turned out better..."

550
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:12,694
"if I had gotten a grip
from the get-go and played."

551
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,304
We might be able to decide
who will be in second.

552
00:26:22,603 --> 00:26:25,214
(Min A goes to Xitsuh.)

553
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,173
Are there cells that you're sure about?

554
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:29,484
I didn't think it'd work out.

555
00:26:29,744 --> 00:26:30,744
I wasn't going to be
in the first two places.

556
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:34,184
But Steve and Xitsuh...

557
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:35,653
were in Team Mansion.

558
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,853
I thought about helping them out.

559
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,653
- Not anything in particular.
- No?

560
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:40,653
But...

561
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:42,994
I thought we might be able to help.

562
00:26:43,794 --> 00:26:45,333
There's only one cell I have.

563
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:46,593
- Which one?
- But I'm not certain.

564
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:48,093
- Still.
- D7.

565
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:49,103
D7?

566
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:51,403
Are there cells that you're sure about?

567
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:55,304
The only one left on the top right.

568
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:57,643
- H5?
- What?

569
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:59,173
- H5?
- Yes, it's 56.

570
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,573
- It's H5.
- He knows H5?

571
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:03,714
And Xitsuh knows D7.

572
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:04,984
D7?

573
00:27:05,653 --> 00:27:07,254
I'll go with H5 and D7.

574
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:08,284
So will I.

575
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:12,323
Tell me if you recall anything as we play.

576
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:13,323
Since I'm right next to you.

577
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:17,464
I've totally forgotten about them.

578
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:19,964
I knew that Xitsuh wasn't that good
at memorizing.

579
00:27:19,964 --> 00:27:23,704
Also, I figured
that Min A and Eon Kyu would be...

580
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:24,734
terrible...

581
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:26,974
at calculating and memorizing.

582
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:30,444
So, I didn't exactly consider them
as my opponents.

583
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,744
One of Steve, Dong Min, and I...

584
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:36,184
was going to go home.

585
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:38,714
I personally believe that it was a game...

586
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:39,853
between us three.

587
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:42,883
(While Dong Min is sure to place 1st,)

588
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:46,893
(who will place 2nd
and advance to the finals?)

589
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,593
Round 19 will begin now.

590
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:52,133
Eon Kyu, state the player to attack...

591
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,294
and the coordinates.

592
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:55,103
Steve.

593
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,363
H5.

594
00:27:57,363 --> 00:28:01,034
Steve, say the number that goes in H5.

595
00:28:01,534 --> 00:28:02,643
It's 56.

596
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:05,373
Steve, H5 is correct.

597
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:11,343
Steve, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

598
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:14,153
Min A.

599
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,923
(Steve chooses Min A.)

600
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,153
D7.

601
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:22,294
(Steve picked D7,
which was Xitsuh's cell.)

602
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:27,633
(After announcing the interim scores)

603
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:29,204
Do you know anything else?

604
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,704
There's 120 in my section.

605
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:39,444
I think it's D7.

606
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:40,913
When the interim scores came out,

607
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:43,284
there was only one cell that I knew
the answer to.

608
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:44,343
So,

609
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:47,083
I figured that it wouldn't be easy
for me to place second.

610
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:50,524
So, I decided to help...

611
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:53,224
Steve if I could.

612
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:54,794
That was my thought.

613
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:57,623
(Xitsuh, Min A, and Eon Kyu decided
to support Steve.)

614
00:28:58,093 --> 00:29:01,034
Min A, say the number that goes in D7.

615
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:02,563
It's 990.

616
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:04,764
One point will be deducted
for saying the wrong answer.

617
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:06,234
Steve, say your answer.

618
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:07,603
It's 120.

619
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:12,173
That is correct.

620
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:16,083
(He managed to save his score
with Xitsuh's answer.)

621
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:18,684
Seong Beom, B3.

622
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,684
(Xitsuh attacks Seong Beom with B3.)

623
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:22,754
I don't know.

624
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:25,123
One point will be deducted
for saying the wrong answer.

625
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,264
(Seong Beom and Steve are
tied in 2nd place.)

626
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:31,063
(Seong Beom: minus 15, Steve: minus 15)

627
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:32,694
Round 20 will begin.

628
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,464
Seong Beom will go first.

629
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:38,103
Steve, B4.

630
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:40,673
Steve, say the number
that goes in the cell.

631
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:42,244
Sixteen.

632
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,643
Steve is incorrect.

633
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:44,704
One point will be deducted.

634
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:46,113
Seong Beom, say your answer.

635
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,544
It's 57.

636
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:49,383
B4 is correct.

637
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:50,484
(B4 is 57.)

638
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:53,184
(Seong Beom is a point ahead.)

639
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:57,724
Steve, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

640
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:01,423
Dong Min, G6.

641
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:02,823
Eight.

642
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:06,663
Dong Min, G6...

643
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:09,603
is correct.

644
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:16,603
Seong Beom, D8.

645
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:17,944
Forty.

646
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:19,913
Seong Beom is incorrect.

647
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:21,073
One point will be deducted.

648
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:22,413
(They're still tied in Round 20.)

649
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:24,784
(Seong Beom: minus 16, Steve: minus 16)

650
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,984
Round 21 will follow.

651
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,984
Xitsuh, state the player to attack
and the coordinates.

652
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:32,494
Seong Beom, D8.

653
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:35,393
Seong Beom,
say the number that goes in D8.

654
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,694
I was fighting Steve...

655
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:42,534
for that one spot left.

656
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:45,274
And it was obvious
that Xitsuh and Steve had teamed up.

657
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:46,833
They asked each other
the cells they knew the answer to...

658
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,643
and attacked me with the cells
that I wouldn't know.

659
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:49,643
I could sense that.

660
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,613
I wanted to cover
for the mistakes that I made,

661
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:53,613
so...

662
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:56,583
I decided to attack Seong Beom more often.

663
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,143
Round 22.

664
00:30:58,143 --> 00:31:00,254
Seong Beom, B3.

665
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:01,383
Round 23.

666
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:04,123
Seong Beom, C3.

667
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,423
Round 24.

668
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:07,123
Seong Beom, E4.

669
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:10,464
That felt like a smack on the head.

670
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:12,994
Round 25.

671
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:15,333
Steve, C3.

672
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:17,663
I was going to recall them at all costs.

673
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:19,034
Round 26.

674
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,204
Seong Beom, D4.

675
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:23,403
I knew I was going to the finals.

676
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:24,873
Round 27.

677
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,113
Steve, D4.

678
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:28,373
I had to win.

679
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:30,383
All I can think of is winning.

680
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:33,214
There are no more cells left
that can be asked,

681
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,254
so Memory Count...

682
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:39,093
will end.

683
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:44,423
That scared me.

684
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,093
Congratulations.

685
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,363
The finalists are...

686
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,103
Jang Dong Min...

687
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:57,143
and...

688
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:05,083
Heo Seong Beom.

689
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:07,313
I think my plan worked.

690
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:09,323
I had saved the rare cells...

691
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:12,423
that only I would know the answers to
until the very end...

692
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:13,454
and used them.

693
00:32:13,754 --> 00:32:15,024
My answer is 131.

694
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:17,964
C5 is correct.

695
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:19,863
It's 213.

696
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,794
Seong Beom is correct.

697
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:23,133
(B7 is 213.)

698
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:24,504
It's 3,052.

699
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:26,474
A5 is correct.

700
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:27,474
(Seong Beom had saved the cells
until the end.)

701
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:28,944
It's 4,710.

702
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:29,974
Incorrect.

703
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,044
It's 58.

704
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,173
Incorrect.

705
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:33,214
It's 29.

706
00:32:33,214 --> 00:32:35,813
Steve is incorrect.
One point will be deducted.

707
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,184
The cells that I clearly remembered
had already been opened.

708
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:41,113
I forgot a lot of them...

709
00:32:41,113 --> 00:32:42,353
by Xitsuh's second wrong answer.

710
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:44,684
I forgot them as I had a mental breakdown,

711
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:46,454
so I couldn't recall any of them.

712
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:48,694
I thought I clearly had the upper hand...

713
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:51,524
in a memorizing game,

714
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:53,633
but I failed to advance to the finals.

715
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:56,804
I never thought
of not making it to the finals.

716
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:58,804
I believe it was a difference in skill.

717
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:00,673
(Dong Min: minus 15, Seong Beom: minus 26)

718
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:03,504
(Dong Min is 1st, and Seong Beom is 2nd.)

719
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,573
The eliminated members
of Bloody Game are...

720
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:08,744
Joo Eon Kyu, Kim Min A,

721
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:10,484
Xitsuh,

722
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:12,784
and Steve Yea.

723
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:16,054
Everyone except for the finalists,

724
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:19,093
Jang Dong Min and Heo Seong Beom,

725
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:22,524
please leave immediately.

726
00:33:23,123 --> 00:33:24,163
Good luck.

727
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,593
- Good luck, Dong Min.
- Well done.

728
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,234
Good work, guys.

729
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:30,133
It's sad
that I couldn't make it to the finals,

730
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,863
but I had so much fun.

731
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,333
Let's get rid of three sharp notes.

732
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:40,214
(With his quick thinking
and sharp decision-making,)

733
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:46,214
(he led the team to victory.)

734
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:52,123
(In the Deathmatch,
his overwhelming skills...)

735
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:55,254
(have made him
a top contender for the championship.)

736
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:58,363
It was a special experience.

737
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:01,863
I got to make new friends,
who were such good people,

738
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,063
so I thoroughly enjoyed it.

739
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:05,264
Good luck.

740
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:06,833
Though I lost, I fought well.

741
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:12,573
(She played a key role
in winning Mystery Time,)

742
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:16,244
(and she didn't hesitate
to sacrifice herself for the team.)

743
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:17,483
Number two.

744
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:21,653
(She proved her skills
in the Deathmatch...)

745
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:23,823
(and made it to the Pre-final Stage.)

746
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:25,554
It felt bittersweet.

747
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:28,624
I badly wanted to go home,

748
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:30,224
but now that it was time for me to go,

749
00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:32,494
I thought, "I want to play more."

750
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:33,963
"Can we have another Deathmatch?"

751
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:37,003
- Good work.
- Great work.

752
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,034
It's a load off my chest.

753
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:43,543
A lot has happened,

754
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:45,003
and I got lucky.

755
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:46,673
That's what I'd say.

756
00:34:46,673 --> 00:34:50,343
(He led the team to a successful raid.)

757
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:51,983
Our choice is three.

758
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:55,854
(A risk-taker with a strong blow)

759
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,753
(I'm willing to take an installment plan.)

760
00:34:58,253 --> 00:34:59,394
That's so cool.

761
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:03,264
(He's cold-hearted
when it comes to money.)

762
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:07,793
(But he's warm-hearted
when it comes to Leo.)

763
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,534
It was indeed...

764
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,664
a long, awful game.

765
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:14,773
I laughed a lot, thanks to you.

766
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:17,343
Great work.

767
00:35:17,673 --> 00:35:18,673
I learned a lot from you.

768
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:21,914
I think this was
the most rugged survival game...

769
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,584
I've ever been a part of.

770
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:28,713
I experienced more defeats than wins.

771
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:32,523
(He was eliminated from the main match...)

772
00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:36,023
(and went to prison.)

773
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:38,494
We did it.

774
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:42,403
(He went through highs and lows...)

775
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:47,434
(at every moment.)

776
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,244
I failed.

777
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:54,144
(He's experienced more failures
than any player.)

778
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:56,084
I wasn't familiar with switching teams...

779
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:58,483
or having my team lose this often.

780
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:00,684
So,

781
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:03,753
I believe this season...

782
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:04,753
will help me grow.

783
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,023
Above all,

784
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:08,823
I had a lot of fun. I enjoyed it.

785
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:10,193
I realized it in Bloody Game...

786
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:12,934
that there were more fun things in life.

787
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:14,894
I realized...

788
00:36:16,403 --> 00:36:17,534
how bored I have been in my life.

789
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:20,304
I realized that only after being put...

790
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:24,173
in a situation
where I could be eliminated.

791
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:26,314
How about you give me the Immunity Pass?

792
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:29,144
Let's not vote for each other
when we're candidates.

793
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:31,113
It awakened my instinct for survival.

794
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:34,284
There are lots of moments...

795
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:36,023
that I regret.

796
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,554
Don't do that.

797
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:38,923
Hold your tears for a moment.

798
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:41,753
But that's also me.

799
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:43,963
- Bye, ma'am.
- Bye.

800
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:45,023
I learned a lot from you.

801
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:48,633
Now, I want to live more passionately.

802
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,133
I got to think more about my future
as I was eliminated.

803
00:36:57,474 --> 00:36:58,503
What a bummer.

804
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:05,014
- Open the door for me.
- Sure.

805
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:14,224
(Acau and Jin Ho advanced
to the finals first.)

806
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:15,764
Only the ones who deserve
to be in the finals.

807
00:37:17,093 --> 00:37:18,564
Only the ones who deserve it.

808
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:20,363
(Dong Min and Seong Beom advanced
from the 6-person individual match.)

809
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,304
Well done.

810
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:24,764
Have you been well?

811
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,104
Congrats on making it.

812
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:27,434
Did you know I made it here?

813
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:28,773
- I didn't.
- No?

814
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:29,804
I just found out.

815
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:33,673
The two players...

816
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:36,814
who have stuck together
from the get-go are both here.

817
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:38,543
After many twists and turns,
that's what happened.

818
00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:41,213
I'm going to make use...

819
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:43,954
of everything I learned from Dong Min...

820
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,454
to beat him. That moment has finally come.

821
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:48,994
I think it's about time
that I showed my fangs.

822
00:37:50,564 --> 00:37:52,963
I saw that Seong Beom had made it
to the finals.

823
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:55,193
I didn't want to be defeated by him,
of all people.

824
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:57,863
Jin Ho.

825
00:37:58,264 --> 00:37:59,273
How do you feel?

826
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:01,633
I don't know.

827
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:05,843
How do you feel
about placing second yet again?

828
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:09,644
I fought so fiercely
on my way to the finals.

829
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,584
I went through every single game.

830
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:15,354
I even participated
in the semi-final match.

831
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:18,423
So starting now, it will boil down
to how well one can stay focused.

832
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:23,023
It's about which one of us
will be more competitive.

833
00:38:23,193 --> 00:38:25,894
I wanted to make it to the Final Match
in the second season, but I couldn't.

834
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,093
But I'm happy to make it
to the Final Match in this season.

835
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:31,903
And I'm going up
against very strong players.

836
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,133
I really want to win today.

837
00:38:40,874 --> 00:38:45,514
The two players who will join
Jang Dong Min and Heo Seong Beom...

838
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:48,684
are Hong Jin Ho and Acau.

839
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:53,354
We will now begin the Final Match
of Bloody Game 3.

840
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:54,454
We'll start right away.

841
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:58,963
In front of you is the safe box
with 100,000 dollars as your prize.

842
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:04,334
Gosh, that's the same safe box?

843
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,534
It's the same safe box.

844
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:10,043
The passcode of the safe box is
a six-digit number.

845
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:13,173
I will now reveal
the first two numbers to everyone.

846
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:18,644
(Passcode)

847
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:20,814
- Two and four.
- Two and four.

848
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:22,923
Two and four.

849
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:28,354
For you to obtain the last four numbers
for the passcode,

850
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:31,064
we will now begin the Final Match
of Bloody Game 3.

851
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:35,233
The Final Match
will consist of three rounds.

852
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:36,564
(Art Auction, Black Village,
Mix and Match)

853
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:38,434
At the beginning of each round,

854
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,204
the content of the mission
will be revealed.

855
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,244
For the winning player of each round,

856
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:46,474
two additional numbers of the passcode
will be revealed.

857
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:51,144
The 1st player to obtain
the complete 6-digit passcode...

858
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:54,113
will win the prize money, 100,000 dollars,

859
00:39:54,514 --> 00:39:57,054
and become the final winner
of Bloody Game 3.

860
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,923
After all three rounds,

861
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:03,994
if three players obtained four numbers
of the passcode equally,

862
00:40:04,423 --> 00:40:07,093
there will be an extra round
for the three players...

863
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:09,034
to decide the final winner.

864
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,064
(Extra Round: Crime Note)

865
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:11,463
Then one of us will be eliminated.

866
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:13,403
Now,

867
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,804
we will now begin
Round One of the Final Match.

868
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,543
The game for Round One
of the Final Match is...

869
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:22,744
Art Auction.

870
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,284
(Art Auction)

871
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:25,954
Auction?

872
00:40:28,113 --> 00:40:30,784
For Art Auction, you must memorize
about famous paintings.

873
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,954
During the auction,
you must answer questions...

874
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:35,093
to win the bidding.

875
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:36,593
Before the game begins,

876
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:39,764
once the paintings are revealed,
you will have 15 minutes...

877
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,764
to memorize
the overall story of the painting,

878
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:43,704
the title, the name of the painter,

879
00:40:44,304 --> 00:40:46,304
and the year of the painting.

880
00:40:46,304 --> 00:40:48,434
(The story of the painting, the title,
the name of the painter, and the year)

881
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:50,374
Before the auction begins,

882
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:52,573
the players will receive
30,000 dollars each.

883
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:56,244
It will be their capital to make bids
for ten rounds of the auction.

884
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,814
There are ten auction items.

885
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:01,284
The total value of the items
is 200,000 dollars.

886
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:04,954
Among them, the painting
with the lowest value is 5,000 dollars.

887
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:06,593
Before the auction begins,

888
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,894
the value and the keyword of the item
will be disclosed.

889
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:13,233
The starting bid for each item
will be set at ten percent of its value.

890
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,963
The player who wishes to bid
will call out the bidding price.

891
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:19,273
A player who wishes to bid...

892
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:22,374
will have to increase the price
by at least 100 dollars.

893
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:27,744
However, once you call out the price,
you can't withdraw it.

894
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:30,943
The player with
the highest bidding price...

895
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:33,284
will get the chance
to answer the question first.

896
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,954
Once the player answers it correctly,
the painting will be auctioned off.

897
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:38,684
The bidding price of the player
will be deducted from his capital.

898
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,693
The value of the auctioned item
will be added to the player's assets.

899
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:44,593
However, if the player answers
the question incorrectly,

900
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:47,994
the bidding price will be deducted
from the player's capital.

901
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:50,204
- My gosh.
- We could lose money then.

902
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:53,934
If the first player answers
the question incorrectly,

903
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:56,304
the player
with the next highest bidding price...

904
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:58,204
will be able to answer the question next.

905
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:02,943
The next players can either answer
the question or withdraw the bid.

906
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:05,184
If the next player decides to answer it,

907
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,414
he will have to bid the amount...

908
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:09,383
the first player called out,

909
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:11,923
not the bidding price he called out.

910
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:14,994
If the player doesn't have
enough capital to bid,

911
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:17,363
he can put down the painting
the player owns as collateral...

912
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:19,093
and participate in the auction.

913
00:42:19,334 --> 00:42:22,564
If there are many players without
sufficient capital for the auction...

914
00:42:22,903 --> 00:42:24,304
and several players...

915
00:42:24,304 --> 00:42:26,204
participated in the bidding
with the paintings of different value...

916
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:27,503
as collateral,

917
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:30,144
the player with the painting
of the highest value...

918
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:32,204
will have the chance to answer it first.

919
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:35,843
To put it down as collateral, you must bid
the full value of the painting.

920
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:38,184
If the bidding price...

921
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:40,314
has become higher
than the value of the collateral,

922
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:42,954
you can switch it with a painting
of higher value to participate...

923
00:42:42,954 --> 00:42:44,153
in the bidding.

924
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:47,354
Moreover, you can also put down
more than one painting as collateral.

925
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:51,093
But you can't put down your painting
and capital together to make a bid.

926
00:42:51,463 --> 00:42:53,233
If the player answers
the question correctly,

927
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,164
he can win the painting.

928
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:57,264
The painting that was used as collateral
can be recovered.

929
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,363
(Collateral, recovered)

930
00:42:58,564 --> 00:43:02,034
However, if the value of the collateral
is higher than the value of the painting,

931
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,943
the remaining balance will be returned.

932
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:06,514
However,
if the player answers it incorrectly,

933
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,673
the collateral will be taken away.

934
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:11,284
When participating in the auction
with collateral,

935
00:43:11,543 --> 00:43:13,314
if the previous player
gets the question wrong,

936
00:43:13,314 --> 00:43:14,854
the next player must participate.

937
00:43:15,113 --> 00:43:16,954
He can't choose to withdraw his bid.

938
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:20,753
The players are allowed not to participate
in the auction up to three rounds.

939
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:22,423
If the player runs out of the capital...

940
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:24,023
or does not have enough paintings
to put down as collateral,

941
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:27,564
he can't particulate in the bidding
until the auction is fully over.

942
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:31,034
Once the auction is over,
the players' capital and the value...

943
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:33,233
of their paintings will be combined
to calculate their assets.

944
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:35,534
And the player with the highest amount
of money will win the game.

945
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:38,304
However, players without any paintings...

946
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:41,914
will be excluded
even if he has the most capital.

947
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:46,153
Art Auction will begin shortly.

948
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:50,554
So if we place a bid and fail
to answer the question correctly...

949
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,523
We'll lose the money we bid.

950
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:53,923
- We'll lose everything, right?
- Then...

951
00:43:54,354 --> 00:43:55,523
So that's the penalty.

952
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:57,963
The key point of this game was
memorization.

953
00:43:58,023 --> 00:43:59,564
The rules were hard to keep up with.

954
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:02,264
But as soon as I heard that
we had to memorize the details,

955
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:03,604
my head went blank.

956
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:04,903
I didn't have any plans.

957
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:06,903
I just knew I could memorize anything.

958
00:44:07,034 --> 00:44:09,334
I was quite confident
in memorizing facts about paintings.

959
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:11,474
The key point of this game...

960
00:44:11,604 --> 00:44:15,244
is not about whether or not
we can memorize all 30 paintings.

961
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:18,814
(Jang Dong Min has a different opinion
from the other 3 players.)

962
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:21,954
Here's the thing about auctions.

963
00:44:23,184 --> 00:44:25,483
Usually, we can only place bids
with the capital we have.

964
00:44:25,483 --> 00:44:27,124
But this time, there's a unique rule.

965
00:44:27,724 --> 00:44:30,664
The fact that
we can put down collateral...

966
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:33,534
was a fascinating factor.

967
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:37,164
I thought that the game was
about our plan on how to proceed...

968
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:39,434
with the auction. That's my opinion.

969
00:44:40,204 --> 00:44:43,543
You can freely memorize
the information about the paintings...

970
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:45,573
on display in 15 minutes.

971
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:47,474
Please proceed to the display room.

972
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:49,014
Let's go.

973
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,584
Let's go inside at the same time.

974
00:44:51,713 --> 00:44:52,854
- Yes.
- Okay.

975
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:55,213
All right. Let's enter.

976
00:44:57,354 --> 00:44:59,084
(Entering the display room)

977
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:00,724
My gosh.

978
00:45:01,624 --> 00:45:02,894
("Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow"
by Mondrian)

979
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:05,764
("The Quiet Pet" by Godward in 1906)

980
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:07,334
("Old Woman Frying Eggs" by Diego,
"The Death of Cleopatra" by Guercino)

981
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:08,863
("Why Are You Angry?" by Gauguin,
"The Fallen Angel" by Cabanel)

982
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:10,403
("Jealousy" by Munch, "Still Life with
Cherries and Peaches" by Cezanne)

983
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:11,934
("The Artist's Garden at Giverny,"
"The Houses of Parliament" by Monet)

984
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:18,204
(They must memorize the information
about 30 pieces within 15 minutes.)

985
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:20,014
I'll start here.

986
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,284
(Jin Ho is the only one
who starts on the right side.)

987
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:27,784
All the paintings were on display.

988
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:29,523
I tried to pick up on some patterns.

989
00:45:29,523 --> 00:45:31,153
For example, as for the production years,

990
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:34,293
I noticed some paintings from the 1960s,
1970s, 1980s, and so on.

991
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:37,963
There were paintings
that were much older than that.

992
00:45:37,994 --> 00:45:40,664
I checked the pattern.
If a lot of them were created in 1980s,

993
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:42,293
I focused on memorizing those paintings.

994
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:44,463
I looked for key points in the paintings.

995
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:47,304
If I saw paintings with angels,
I memorized all the paintings with angels.

996
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:50,104
If I saw women, families, or food,
I memorized them together.

997
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:52,744
I tried to group them
and memorize them together.

998
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:54,814
I wanted to memorize them
as fast as possible.

999
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:56,883
I thought I wouldn't be a weak link...

1000
00:45:57,314 --> 00:45:58,483
in the group with this game.

1001
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:05,023
First of all,
I know nothing about artworks.

1002
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:07,854
I didn't recognize any of the paintings.

1003
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:10,823
So it was harder for me to memorize them.

1004
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:17,633
Luckily, I like art.

1005
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:21,673
As for artists like Renoir, Gauguin, Gogh,

1006
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:24,673
I roughly knew the time periods
they were active.

1007
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:27,113
I was confident because I thought...

1008
00:46:27,113 --> 00:46:30,284
the pressure of memorizing
the artworks was lifted by a few layers.

1009
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:33,613
I tried to narrow down the paintings
with the same theme...

1010
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:36,823
and memorize a specific group
of paintings but accurately.

1011
00:46:36,823 --> 00:46:38,323
When I saw the paintings with angels,

1012
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:40,994
I thought to myself that
we might get a question about them.

1013
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:42,023
So I decided to memorize them.

1014
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:44,124
I thought there might be a question
about paintings with figures.

1015
00:46:44,124 --> 00:46:45,564
With that in mind,

1016
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:47,633
I tried to associate them by groups
and memorized accordingly.

1017
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:49,394
(Acau and Jin Ho used
the same memorization strategy.)

1018
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:53,104
While working in comedy skits,

1019
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:56,003
I have never messed up the scene.
Not even once.

1020
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:58,974
Well, when you have to memorize
a lot of information,

1021
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:03,314
you need to have your own trick.

1022
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:06,753
I have a trick of my own
that's quite useful.

1023
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:10,284
For example, the painting,
"Breakfast after the Bath,"

1024
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:11,854
was done by Degas.

1025
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:16,823
"Do go into the tub. Now."

1026
00:47:17,224 --> 00:47:18,423
"You don't want to skip the bath again."

1027
00:47:18,523 --> 00:47:21,863
Then the mom says,
"I'll give you food after your bath."

1028
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:26,773
Then the title naturally becomes
"Breakfast after the Bath."

1029
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:30,343
Once you memorize the story once,

1030
00:47:30,343 --> 00:47:32,573
you'll never forget it. It's not possible.

1031
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:37,014
So I perfectly memorized all 30 paintings.

1032
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:39,244
You have one minute left.

1033
00:47:41,014 --> 00:47:42,854
("Angel, I Will Follow You,"
by Malczewski in 1901)

1034
00:47:42,854 --> 00:47:44,624
("Cupid Flying over Water" by Bouguereau
in 1900)

1035
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,224
("Jealousy" by Munch in 1913)

1036
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:47,923
("Breakfast after the Bath" by Degas
from 1895 to 1898)

1037
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:49,593
("Still Life with Cherries and Peaches"
by Cezanne from 1885 to 1887)

1038
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:51,164
("The Death of Marat" by David in 1793)

1039
00:47:51,164 --> 00:47:53,863
("The Meal: The Bananas"
by Gauguin in 1891)

1040
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,434
Your time in the display room is over.

1041
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:59,133
Please go back to your spots.

1042
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:01,534
Gosh, I'm doomed.

1043
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:03,903
This is so hard.

1044
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:05,403
I can't seem to memorize anything.

1045
00:48:08,414 --> 00:48:10,113
I'll be able to get two questions right
if we play right away.

1046
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:23,124
We will now begin
Round One of Art Auction.

1047
00:48:23,124 --> 00:48:26,793
The value and keyword of the auction item
for Round One will be disclosed now.

1048
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,764
(Keyword: Wing, Value: 25,000 dollars)

1049
00:48:28,764 --> 00:48:32,233
The keyword
of the first auction item is wing.

1050
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:35,874
And the value of the auction item is
25,000 dollars.

1051
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:39,573
The bidding will start at 2,500 dollars.

1052
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:41,573
If you wish to bid for the item,

1053
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:44,543
raise your hand
and call out your bidding price.

1054
00:48:47,854 --> 00:48:49,354
I'll bid 2,600 dollars.

1055
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:51,854
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 2,600 dollars.

1056
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:53,193
I'll bid 3,100 dollars.

1057
00:48:53,193 --> 00:48:55,224
Hong Jin Ho, you bid 3,100 dollars.

1058
00:48:56,253 --> 00:48:57,494
I'll bid 3,800 dollars.

1059
00:48:57,494 --> 00:48:59,264
Acau, you'll bid 3,800 dollars.

1060
00:48:59,423 --> 00:49:01,434
I'll bid 4,100 dollars.

1061
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:03,863
Jang Dong Min, you bid 4,100 dollars.

1062
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:05,204
I'll bid 5,000 dollars.

1063
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:06,733
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 5,000 dollars.

1064
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,204
I'll bid 5,200 dollars.

1065
00:49:08,304 --> 00:49:09,573
I'll bid 6,000 dollars.

1066
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:11,104
How higher will you raise it?

1067
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:13,213
I'll bid 6,300 dollars.

1068
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:15,644
I'll bid 6,500 dollars.

1069
00:49:16,343 --> 00:49:18,914
Since this was an auction,

1070
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:21,514
I thought not winning a painting
in the beginning...

1071
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:23,014
would make things difficult for me later.

1072
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:27,693
(This is the main strategy Dong Min
has utilized in the games so far.)

1073
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:33,863
(Winning the points in the first round)

1074
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:36,564
I was determined to win the painting...

1075
00:49:37,503 --> 00:49:38,704
in Round One.

1076
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:41,633
I'll bid 10,000 dollars.

1077
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:44,204
Jang Dong Min, you bid 10,000 dollars.

1078
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:46,573
(The bidding price
has gone over 10,000 dollars.)

1079
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:49,014
I'll bid 11,000 dollars.

1080
00:49:50,414 --> 00:49:51,914
I'll bid 12,000 dollars.

1081
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:57,153
I'll bid 12,500 dollars.

1082
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:58,153
Heo Seong Beom,

1083
00:49:58,153 --> 00:49:59,584
- you bid 12,500 dollars.
- Just buy it at the set price then.

1084
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:05,023
We had different approaches
about the game.

1085
00:50:05,224 --> 00:50:09,434
I divided the capital to find the average
amount I could spend for each round.

1086
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:12,363
Then the average amount of money
I could spend per round...

1087
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:14,403
was 8,000 dollars.

1088
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:15,934
I had already calculated everything.

1089
00:50:15,934 --> 00:50:17,273
But the bidding price...

1090
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:20,014
went up a lot higher than I expected.

1091
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,173
It went over 10,000 dollars.

1092
00:50:22,374 --> 00:50:24,644
I thought
the bidding price was way too much.

1093
00:50:24,843 --> 00:50:27,113
When that crossed my mind, at one point,

1094
00:50:27,184 --> 00:50:28,883
I didn't participate in the bidding war.

1095
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:32,554
I'll bid 17,000 dollars.

1096
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:34,653
Jang Dong Min, you bid 17,000 dollars.

1097
00:50:34,954 --> 00:50:36,023
Darn it.

1098
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:39,093
Just buy it at the set price.

1099
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:42,894
Jang Dong Min, you bid 17,000 dollars.

1100
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:45,934
Is there any other player
who would like to bid over 17,000 dollars?

1101
00:50:46,164 --> 00:50:49,604
When it hit 17,000 dollars,
I was quite worried.

1102
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:51,843
I thought, "Gosh, this could go wrong."

1103
00:50:53,443 --> 00:50:54,713
I'll bid 17,500 dollars.

1104
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:56,744
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 17,500 dollars.

1105
00:50:58,914 --> 00:51:01,414
Dong Min seemed determined
to win the painting in the first round.

1106
00:51:01,883 --> 00:51:03,854
(Whenever Dong Min came up
with the strategy,)

1107
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:07,023
(Seong Beom was always by his side.)

1108
00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:13,293
(He knows Dong Min better than anyone.)

1109
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:15,463
I kept raising the price.

1110
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:17,503
I wanted Dong Min
to spend a lot of his capital.

1111
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:18,903
He spent more than half.

1112
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:22,204
I'll bid 18,000 dollars.

1113
00:51:22,273 --> 00:51:23,943
Jang Dong Min, you bid 18,000 dollars.

1114
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:25,144
My gosh.

1115
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:26,573
I'll bid 18,200 dollars.

1116
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:28,543
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 18,200 dollars.

1117
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,244
Gosh. Darn it.

1118
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:33,684
I thought,
"Am I risking too much for this?"

1119
00:51:33,684 --> 00:51:35,213
I did think that his strategy...

1120
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:37,854
could be raising my bidding price.

1121
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:40,724
But since I was this committed
to getting this piece,

1122
00:51:41,323 --> 00:51:42,394
I went for it.

1123
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:43,494
I was determined to win it.

1124
00:51:43,593 --> 00:51:45,023
I'll bid 18,500 dollars.

1125
00:51:46,693 --> 00:51:48,264
Why would he want to buy it
at such a high price?

1126
00:51:49,363 --> 00:51:51,903
Dong Min, you bid 18,500 dollars.

1127
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:54,934
Does anyone want
to bid over 18,500 dollars?

1128
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:58,144
(3,800 dollars, 3,100 dollars,
18,500 dollars, 18,200 dollars)

1129
00:51:58,273 --> 00:52:00,113
The bidding price...

1130
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:03,744
for the 1st auction item
is 18,500 dollars.

1131
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:04,814
That's expensive.

1132
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,713
I didn't think that...

1133
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:10,124
I would buy it at such a high price.

1134
00:52:10,153 --> 00:52:12,383
Regardless of the keyword we got,

1135
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:15,624
I would have participated in the bidding.

1136
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:19,164
I'll reveal the question
for the first auction item.

1137
00:52:24,903 --> 00:52:26,034
That was the only thing I memorized.

1138
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:32,244
Angel. That was one of the paintings
I memorized.

1139
00:52:32,343 --> 00:52:34,713
So I could have gone for it.
But I didn't want to spend that much.

1140
00:52:34,713 --> 00:52:36,814
It was simple for me.

1141
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:40,514
I wanted to buy the paintings
at low prices if I could.

1142
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:43,684
Dong Min will answer the question first.

1143
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:45,653
You must answer it within 30 seconds.

1144
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:52,624
"Cupid Flying over Water" by Bouguereau.

1145
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:55,193
The year is 1900.

1146
00:52:57,434 --> 00:52:59,434
Jang Dong Min. Your answer is correct.

1147
00:53:00,003 --> 00:53:02,503
You successfully won
the first auction item.

1148
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:03,503
(Jang Dong Min wins the 1st auction item.)

1149
00:53:03,943 --> 00:53:06,374
When I was reviewing the paintings,
I covered up the titles...

1150
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:09,043
and guessed them.
I said, "Cupid Walking over Water."

1151
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:10,584
But it was "flying."

1152
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:13,314
Once you go over your mistakes,

1153
00:53:13,514 --> 00:53:15,414
you hardly forget them.

1154
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:19,023
Quizzing myself like that
definitely helped.

1155
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:23,023
Jang Dong Min, please pay
18,500 dollars for the painting.

1156
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:27,494
Jang Dong Min's assets...

1157
00:53:27,863 --> 00:53:30,264
will include 25,000 dollars,

1158
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:32,233
the value of the painting from Round One.

1159
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:35,233
We will now begin
Round Two of Art Auction.

1160
00:53:35,273 --> 00:53:37,573
The second auction item will be revealed.

1161
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:40,273
The keyword of the second auction item
is the meal.

1162
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:44,284
The value of the 2nd auction item is
15,000 dollars.

1163
00:53:44,443 --> 00:53:47,284
The bidding will start at 1,500 dollars.

1164
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:49,854
- I'll bid 1,500 dollars.
- Hong Jin Ho, you bid 1,500 dollars.

1165
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:52,054
I'll bid 1,600 dollars.

1166
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,253
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 1,600 dollars.

1167
00:53:55,124 --> 00:53:56,354
I'll bid 1,700 dollars.

1168
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:57,994
Acau, you bid 1,700 dollars.

1169
00:53:58,363 --> 00:53:59,724
I'll bid 2,300 dollars.

1170
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:01,193
I'll bid 3,500 dollars.

1171
00:54:01,193 --> 00:54:02,764
I'll bid 3,800 dollars.

1172
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:05,034
I'll bid 3,900 dollars.

1173
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:06,974
I'll bid 4,000 dollars.

1174
00:54:06,974 --> 00:54:08,173
I'll bid 6,000 dollars.

1175
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:10,443
I'll bid 6,100 dollars.

1176
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:12,804
I think I used this 100-dollar strategy.

1177
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:15,374
When the 1st and 2nd players get it wrong,

1178
00:54:15,374 --> 00:54:18,213
I might be able to get some hints
from their answers.

1179
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:20,914
I thought this might give me
a good chance...

1180
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:22,753
for me to answer the questions correctly.

1181
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:25,423
I'll bid 7,100 dollars.

1182
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:27,454
Hong Jin Ho, you bid 7,100 dollars.

1183
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:30,394
I'll bid 8,000 dollars.

1184
00:54:30,423 --> 00:54:32,093
Jang Dong Min, you bid 8,000 dollars.

1185
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:34,233
Just like Round One,

1186
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,564
I memorized all the paintings
related to meals.

1187
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:36,934
I memorized everything,

1188
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,334
so I was confident
to answer any questions.

1189
00:54:38,503 --> 00:54:41,204
But when we were bidding,
the price had gone up too high.

1190
00:54:41,204 --> 00:54:42,334
I thought it was too expensive.

1191
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:44,573
Then you can't play
after these two rounds.

1192
00:54:48,343 --> 00:54:50,343
Having that kind of strategy
is quite risky.

1193
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:53,213
Does anyone want
to bid over 8,000 dollars?

1194
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:55,184
(6,100 dollars, 7,100 dollars,
8,000 dollars, 6,000 dollars)

1195
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:59,823
The bidding price for the 2nd auction item
is 8,000 dollars.

1196
00:55:00,193 --> 00:55:02,753
Dong Min will answer the question first.

1197
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:05,664
The question for Round Two
will be disclosed now.

1198
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:11,564
Present the painter
and the title of the painting.

1199
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:13,534
You must answer it within 30 seconds.

1200
00:55:15,704 --> 00:55:16,744
Gauguin.

1201
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,773
"The Meal: The Bananas."

1202
00:55:22,273 --> 00:55:23,943
Jang Dong Min. Your answer is correct.

1203
00:55:23,943 --> 00:55:26,644
You successfully won
the second auction item.

1204
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:30,823
Jang Dong Min, please pay
8,000 dollars for the painting.

1205
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:33,153
Jang Dong Min's assets
will include 15,000 dollars,

1206
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:35,554
the value of the painting from Round Two.

1207
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,064
(Jang Dong Min's current assets)

1208
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:39,494
(Capital: 3,500 dollars,
2 paintings: 40,000 dollars)

1209
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:41,633
We will now begin Round Three.

1210
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:44,804
I'll reveal the auction item
for Round Three.

1211
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:48,133
The keyword of the third auction item
is fruit.

1212
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,204
The value of the 3rd auction item
is 10,000 dollars.

1213
00:55:51,843 --> 00:55:54,314
The bidding will start at 1,000 dollars.

1214
00:55:54,514 --> 00:55:56,613
If you wish to bid for the item,

1215
00:55:56,613 --> 00:55:58,443
raise your hand
and call out your bidding price.

1216
00:55:58,843 --> 00:56:01,753
(Current assets:
30,000 dollars, 30,000 dollars,)

1217
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:05,023
(3,500 dollars and 2 paintings,
30,000 dollars)

1218
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:08,224
- I'll bid 1,500 dollars.
- Heo Seong Beom, you bid 1,500 dollars.

1219
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:09,724
I'll bid 1,600 dollars.

1220
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:12,164
Hong Jin Ho, you bid 1,600 dollars.

1221
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,394
I'll bid 1,700 dollars.

1222
00:56:14,863 --> 00:56:16,133
I'll bid 2,000 dollars.

1223
00:56:16,434 --> 00:56:17,804
I'll bid 2,200 dollars.

1224
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:19,733
Hong Jin Ho, you bid 2,200 dollars.

1225
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:21,434
I'll bid 3,000 dollars.

1226
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:23,374
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 3,000 dollars.

1227
00:56:23,374 --> 00:56:25,474
He's not raising it by 100 dollars.
He's raising it too quickly.

1228
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:28,443
I'll bid 3,500 dollars.

1229
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:29,673
I'll bid 3,600 dollars.

1230
00:56:29,673 --> 00:56:32,084
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 3,600 dollars.

1231
00:56:33,184 --> 00:56:35,383
Seong Beom bid 3,600 dollars.

1232
00:56:36,153 --> 00:56:39,184
Is there anyone
who wishes to bid over 3,600 dollars?

1233
00:56:44,323 --> 00:56:48,564
The bidding price for the 3rd auction item
is 3,600 dollars.

1234
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:51,164
Heo Seong Beom will answer it first.

1235
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:53,403
The question for Round Three
will be disclosed now.

1236
00:56:54,104 --> 00:57:01,213
Name the fruits mentioned in the title
of Cezanne's painting from 1885 to 1887.

1237
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:05,014
(Among these 30 paintings, there are...)

1238
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:06,184
("The Meal: The Bananas" by Gauguin)

1239
00:57:06,184 --> 00:57:07,184
("Grapes, Lemons, Pears, and Apples"
by Gogh)

1240
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:08,414
("A Forest Still Life
with Peach and Grapes" by Rousseau)

1241
00:57:08,414 --> 00:57:09,584
("Still Life with Cherries and Peaches"
by Cezanne)

1242
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:10,653
(There are 4 paintings with fruits.)

1243
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:13,084
(Only 1 of them is by Cezanne.)

1244
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:15,593
("Still Life with Cherries and Peaches"
by Cezanne from 1885 to 1887)

1245
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:18,193
Name the fruits in the painting.

1246
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:20,193
Cherries and peaches.

1247
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:21,463
(Cherries, peaches)

1248
00:57:21,463 --> 00:57:22,564
Your answer is correct.

1249
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,204
You successfully won
the third auction item.

1250
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:27,204
Heo Seong Beom's assets
will include 10,000 dollars,

1251
00:57:27,204 --> 00:57:29,133
the value of the painting.

1252
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:31,443
(Heo Seong Beom's current assets)

1253
00:57:31,443 --> 00:57:34,043
(Capital: 26,400 dollars,
1 painting: 10,000 dollars)

1254
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:36,443
We will now begin Round Four.

1255
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:37,843
I'll reveal the question.

1256
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:39,043
(Keyword: Artwork from the 1800s
Value: 25,000 dollars)

1257
00:57:39,043 --> 00:57:41,253
The keyword
of the fourth auction item is...

1258
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:42,753
artwork from the 1800s.

1259
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:45,124
The value is 25,000 dollars.

1260
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:47,954
The bidding will start at 2,500 dollars.

1261
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:49,153
I'll bid 2,500 dollars.

1262
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:51,124
I'll bid 3,700 dollars.

1263
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:52,394
I'll bid 4,000 dollars.

1264
00:57:52,724 --> 00:57:53,963
I'll bid 4,500 dollars.

1265
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:55,233
I'll bid 4,800 dollars.

1266
00:57:55,793 --> 00:57:56,903
I'll bid 5,500 dollars.

1267
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:58,304
I'll bid 5,600 dollars.

1268
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,304
I'll bid 7,500 dollars.

1269
00:58:00,773 --> 00:58:02,503
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 7,500 dollars.

1270
00:58:03,704 --> 00:58:05,903
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 7,500 dollars.

1271
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:11,084
Does anyone want
to bid over 7,500 dollars?

1272
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:17,153
I'll bid 15,000 dollars.

1273
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:20,923
Jang Dong Min,
will you use a painting as collateral?

1274
00:58:22,093 --> 00:58:23,494
Yes, I will.

1275
00:58:26,164 --> 00:58:27,233
What's going on?

1276
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:28,534
I was quite flustered.

1277
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:30,133
To be honest,

1278
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:33,264
I didn't think
that I'd use collateral much.

1279
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:35,474
This game...

1280
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:39,043
isn't about whether or not you memorized
the details about 30 paintings.

1281
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:41,374
It's about how you use...

1282
00:58:42,014 --> 00:58:44,443
the paintings as collateral.

1283
00:58:44,514 --> 00:58:47,314
In my opinion, that's the biggest issue.

1284
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:49,314
When you make a bid using collateral,

1285
00:58:49,713 --> 00:58:52,454
the value of the painting
becomes the bidding price.

1286
00:58:53,224 --> 00:58:56,653
If you use 8,000 dollars to obtain
a painting with a value of 15,000 dollars,

1287
00:58:57,394 --> 00:58:58,764
and make a bid using collateral,

1288
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:01,793
the result will be
the same as bidding 15,000 dollars...

1289
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,363
although you've only used 8,000 dollars.

1290
00:59:04,104 --> 00:59:05,834
Jang Dong Min's strategy
of bidding with collateral...

1291
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,204
raises the bidding price...

1292
00:59:07,434 --> 00:59:09,834
and keeps other players in check.

1293
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:11,943
It's a strategy that allows him...

1294
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:14,514
to acquire a high-value painting
at low risk.

1295
00:59:15,374 --> 00:59:16,374
I...

1296
00:59:16,943 --> 00:59:18,983
will obtain a painting
I can use as collateral...

1297
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:20,954
from the start no matter what.

1298
00:59:21,314 --> 00:59:23,414
Using collateral is the only way.

1299
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:24,584
My goodness.

1300
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:27,193
My opponent's strategy was impressive.

1301
00:59:27,193 --> 00:59:28,954
He quickly bought a painting
at a high price...

1302
00:59:30,054 --> 00:59:31,894
and used it as collateral...

1303
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:33,934
to keep the others from winning a bid
with a small price.

1304
00:59:34,164 --> 00:59:37,133
Then he bought more paintings
if he could. That was his strategy.

1305
00:59:37,363 --> 00:59:39,863
Whenever we tried to bring a painting
at a low price,

1306
00:59:39,963 --> 00:59:41,233
Dong Min interfered
and hiked up the price.

1307
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:43,534
Even if we win a bid with a high price,

1308
00:59:44,144 --> 00:59:45,144
we won't place first...

1309
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:46,673
because Dong Min has more paintings.

1310
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:49,073
Because of Jang Dong Min's bid
with collateral,

1311
00:59:49,073 --> 00:59:52,414
Hong Jin Ho must bid
15,000 dollars or more.

1312
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:55,983
However,
if he bids 15,000 dollars or more...

1313
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:58,784
and wins a painting with a value
of 25,000 dollars,

1314
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:01,253
his assets will become lower...

1315
01:00:01,253 --> 01:00:03,354
than Jang Dong Min's.

1316
01:00:03,354 --> 01:00:04,793
(Jang Dong Min: 43,500 dollars
Hong Jin Ho: 39,900 dollars)

1317
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,293
When I got attacked with collateral,

1318
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:07,664
it was too late.

1319
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:12,034
It occurred to me
that he got the better of me...

1320
01:00:12,034 --> 01:00:14,773
in terms of strategy.

1321
01:00:14,773 --> 01:00:16,034
It was an impressive strategy...

1322
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:17,843
on Dong Min's part.

1323
01:00:18,604 --> 01:00:20,843
Please name the painting
you'll use as collateral.

1324
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,983
I'll use "The Meal: The Bananas..."

1325
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:26,014
by Gauguin.

1326
01:00:26,784 --> 01:00:30,354
(Flustered by the collateral attack)

1327
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:33,023
I think I'll take a win...

1328
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:35,054
in this round.

1329
01:00:35,753 --> 01:00:37,293
I'll bid 15,100 dollars.

1330
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:40,323
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 15,100 dollars.

1331
01:00:40,834 --> 01:00:42,363
Dong Min didn't seem to have...

1332
01:00:42,363 --> 01:00:44,334
much capital left.

1333
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,664
It looked like he had
2,000 or 3,000 dollars left.

1334
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:47,073
There wasn't much liquidity,

1335
01:00:47,073 --> 01:00:49,233
so risk was inevitable.

1336
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:50,644
Use the 25,000-dollar painting.

1337
01:00:51,204 --> 01:00:52,204
The 25,000-dollar painting.

1338
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:57,584
I'll be in trouble...

1339
01:00:58,383 --> 01:01:01,554
If Seong Beom wins the bid
for this painting...

1340
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:04,423
because I don't have much capital.

1341
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:07,153
If Heo Seong Beom correctly answers
the question for Round Four,

1342
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:09,724
no changes will be made
to Jang Dong Min's assets.

1343
01:01:10,494 --> 01:01:13,463
But Heo Seong Beom will have
11,300 dollars in capital...

1344
01:01:13,894 --> 01:01:15,633
and two paintings.

1345
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,133
Including the paintings,
his assets will be 46,300 dollars.

1346
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:21,034
Then Heo Seong Beom's assets...

1347
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:23,034
will exceed Jang Dong Min's.

1348
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,804
(Jang Dong Min: 43,500 dollars
Heo Seong Beom: 46,300 dollars)

1349
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:28,043
Does anyone want
to bid over 15,100 dollars?

1350
01:01:28,474 --> 01:01:29,474
My goodness.

1351
01:01:29,573 --> 01:01:32,814
I was too focused on winning the bid.

1352
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:34,613
I don't have much capital.

1353
01:01:34,753 --> 01:01:38,323
I can't use the 25,000-dollar painting.

1354
01:01:38,354 --> 01:01:42,023
(Jang Dong Min can't make another bid.)

1355
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:45,124
The winning bid...

1356
01:01:45,124 --> 01:01:48,034
for Round 4 is 15,100 dollars.

1357
01:01:49,494 --> 01:01:51,804
Heo Seong Beom has a priority
for answering the question.

1358
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:52,804
(Heo Seong Beom crushed
Jang Dong Min's winning strategy.)

1359
01:01:53,034 --> 01:01:55,334
I'll reveal the question for Round Four.

1360
01:01:56,434 --> 01:02:00,173
Present the painter
and the title of the painting.

1361
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:01,644
You must answer it within 30 seconds.

1362
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,613
(The auction item for Round 4...)

1363
01:02:04,613 --> 01:02:08,383
(is the painting Jang Dong Min memorized
by creating a story.)

1364
01:02:08,514 --> 01:02:10,584
"I'll give you food after your bath."

1365
01:02:14,253 --> 01:02:16,023
I had answered the previous questions...

1366
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,323
without a problem.

1367
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:18,764
I was in a confident state...

1368
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:19,823
when the painting was presented.

1369
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:21,133
I thought, "I know this painting."

1370
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:26,233
Degas. "Breakfast after a Bath."

1371
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:31,144
Your answer is incorrect.

1372
01:02:31,144 --> 01:02:32,403
(Heo Seong Beom's answer is incorrect.)

1373
01:02:32,704 --> 01:02:35,213
You failed to win the fourth auction item.

1374
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:38,084
(The title of this painting is...)

1375
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:40,383
("Breakfast after the Bath" by Degas.)

1376
01:02:41,454 --> 01:02:44,224
(Heo Seong Beom's answer was,
"Breakfast after a Bath.")

1377
01:02:45,423 --> 01:02:48,693
(A fatal mistake)

1378
01:02:49,954 --> 01:02:51,124
Didn't he lose 15,100 dollars?

1379
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:52,863
He did.

1380
01:02:53,863 --> 01:02:57,034
My goodness. How did Seong Beom make
that kind of a mistake?

1381
01:02:59,804 --> 01:03:02,374
Gosh, I shouldn't laugh. Why am I...

1382
01:03:04,403 --> 01:03:06,003
Seong Beom, I'm sorry.

1383
01:03:06,543 --> 01:03:09,673
I never thought that
he'd make such a mistake. Seriously.

1384
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:11,684
I thought...

1385
01:03:11,684 --> 01:03:14,153
the possibility was this big.

1386
01:03:14,314 --> 01:03:15,914
Why did Heo Seong Beom make
such a mistake?

1387
01:03:16,113 --> 01:03:18,423
Why did Jang Dong Min get another chance?

1388
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:22,394
Jang Dong Min,
you made the next highest bid.

1389
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:25,264
Jang Dong Min, you must participate...

1390
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:26,894
as you used collateral.

1391
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:28,733
It'll be taken away
if you answer incorrectly.

1392
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:30,264
Please give your answer.

1393
01:03:30,664 --> 01:03:31,664
Degas.

1394
01:03:35,173 --> 01:03:38,673
"Breakfast after the Bath."

1395
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,914
Jang Dong Min, your answer is correct.

1396
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:45,814
(Jang Dong Min wins the 4th auction item.)

1397
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:48,184
You successfully won
the fourth auction item.

1398
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:53,523
How did I make that mistake?

1399
01:03:54,054 --> 01:03:55,693
I thought...

1400
01:03:55,693 --> 01:03:58,224
that Round Four was a crucial point,
so I bid a big amount of money.

1401
01:03:58,224 --> 01:04:00,463
I did that because I was confident
in answering the question correctly.

1402
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:03,593
However,
there was a lethal detail of this game.

1403
01:04:03,593 --> 01:04:05,463
I should've paid attention
to the details...

1404
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:07,834
such as postpositions and suffixes.

1405
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:10,843
I messed it up
in the most important moment.

1406
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,644
(Heo Seong Beom loses 15,100 dollars.)

1407
01:04:16,874 --> 01:04:18,314
How will I beat Dong Min?

1408
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:22,753
Jang Dong Min's assets
will include 25,000 dollars,

1409
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:24,854
the value of the painting.

1410
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:27,354
Round Four of Art Auction has ended.

1411
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:29,454
We will now begin Round Five.

1412
01:04:29,693 --> 01:04:32,624
Please reveal the value and keyword
of the auction item.

1413
01:04:33,823 --> 01:04:36,564
The keyword of the fifth auction item
is death.

1414
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:39,034
The value is 5,000 dollars.

1415
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:41,604
The bidding will start at 500 dollars.

1416
01:04:43,304 --> 01:04:46,104
- I'll bid 500 dollars.
- I'll bid 600 dollars.

1417
01:04:46,104 --> 01:04:48,244
- I'll bid 2,000 dollars.
- You bid 2,000 dollars.

1418
01:04:48,244 --> 01:04:49,414
I'll bid 2,100 dollars.

1419
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:51,443
Acau, you bid 2,100 dollars.

1420
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:54,314
I'll bid 2,500 dollars.

1421
01:04:55,954 --> 01:04:59,124
Does anyone want
to bid over 2,500 dollars?

1422
01:04:59,423 --> 01:05:02,093
Bringing the painting
was meaningless for us.

1423
01:05:02,224 --> 01:05:03,624
We just needed to let Dong Min
win the bid...

1424
01:05:03,624 --> 01:05:05,224
and hope for his mistake.
It'll be a different story...

1425
01:05:05,224 --> 01:05:06,624
if he makes a mistake
and gets a painting taken away.

1426
01:05:06,624 --> 01:05:08,664
(Jin Ho needs Dong Min's mistake.)

1427
01:05:08,664 --> 01:05:10,564
Jang Dong Min, you bid 2,500 dollars.

1428
01:05:11,403 --> 01:05:15,573
The bidding price for the 5th auction item
is 2,500 dollars.

1429
01:05:15,573 --> 01:05:18,204
I'll reveal the question for Round Five.

1430
01:05:18,204 --> 01:05:21,613
Present the painter of the painting.

1431
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:22,874
You must answer it within 30 seconds.

1432
01:05:23,874 --> 01:05:25,383
"The Death of Marat."

1433
01:05:26,314 --> 01:05:29,184
Jang Dong Min, your answer is correct.

1434
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:32,084
You successfully won
the fifth auction item.

1435
01:05:32,854 --> 01:05:36,253
Jang Dong Min, please pay
2,500 dollars for the painting.

1436
01:05:36,624 --> 01:05:38,724
Jang Dong Min's assets
will include 5,000 dollars,

1437
01:05:38,724 --> 01:05:40,863
the value of the painting.

1438
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:42,934
The answer is in the painting.

1439
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:48,273
("The Death of Marat" by David)

1440
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,073
Please reveal the value and keyword
of the sixth auction item.

1441
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,644
The keyword is object.

1442
01:05:54,644 --> 01:05:57,584
The value is 20,000 dollars.

1443
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:59,613
The bidding will start at 2,000 dollars.

1444
01:06:00,014 --> 01:06:02,054
- I'll bid 2,000 dollars.
- I'll bid 3,000 dollars.

1445
01:06:02,054 --> 01:06:03,253
I'll bid 5,000 dollars.

1446
01:06:03,883 --> 01:06:06,923
I'll use "The Death of Marat"
as collateral.

1447
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:10,153
(Jang Dong Min uses
a 5,000-dollar painting as collateral.)

1448
01:06:14,293 --> 01:06:15,434
I'll bid 5,100 dollars.

1449
01:06:16,193 --> 01:06:19,164
Does anyone want
to bid over 5,100 dollars?

1450
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,834
Heo Seong Beom, you bid 5,100 dollars.

1451
01:06:22,903 --> 01:06:26,073
The bidding price is 5,100 dollars.

1452
01:06:26,073 --> 01:06:27,914
I'll reveal the question for Round Six.

1453
01:06:28,244 --> 01:06:31,383
In the 1901 painting by Malczewski,

1454
01:06:31,383 --> 01:06:34,253
what is the angel holding
in the right hand?

1455
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:35,954
You must answer it within 30 seconds.

1456
01:06:38,784 --> 01:06:40,724
What should I call it?
My answer is a cane.

1457
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:44,394
Heo Seong Beom, your answer is correct.

1458
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:48,293
You successfully won
the sixth auction item.

1459
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:50,693
Heo Seong Beom's assets
will include 20,000 dollars,

1460
01:06:50,693 --> 01:06:52,534
the value of the painting.

1461
01:06:52,534 --> 01:06:54,334
(Jang Dong Min, Capital: 1,000 dollars,
3 paintings: 55,000 dollars)

1462
01:06:54,334 --> 01:06:55,804
(Heo Seong Beom, Capital: 6,200 dollars,
2 paintings: 30,000 dollars)

1463
01:06:55,903 --> 01:06:57,974
How can I do it? How can I beat Dong Min?

1464
01:06:59,273 --> 01:07:00,843
I thought of it as a chance.

1465
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:02,474
It's the beginning of a small rebellion.

1466
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,684
I was confident
in answering the question correctly,

1467
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:08,483
but the value of the paintings I owned
was so big...

1468
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:09,483
that it was hard to regulate.

1469
01:07:09,684 --> 01:07:11,483
We will now begin Round Seven.

1470
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:15,124
The keyword of the 7th auction item
is a painter's name with 2 syllables.

1471
01:07:15,124 --> 01:07:18,224
The value of the auction item
is 35,000 dollars.

1472
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:21,034
The bidding will start at 3,500 dollars.

1473
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:22,593
I'll bid 3,500 dollars.

1474
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:24,233
I'll bid 10,000 dollars.

1475
01:07:24,804 --> 01:07:25,863
You bid 10,000 dollars.

1476
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,934
Dial it down.

1477
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:29,604
It's time to go big.

1478
01:07:30,204 --> 01:07:31,204
Even if I answer incorrectly...

1479
01:07:32,244 --> 01:07:35,443
Does anyone want
to bid over 10,000 dollars?

1480
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:37,843
I'll bid 25,000 dollars.

1481
01:07:37,843 --> 01:07:39,014
(Jang Dong Min bids 25,000 dollars.)

1482
01:07:39,113 --> 01:07:41,213
I'll use "Breakfast after the Bath..."

1483
01:07:41,284 --> 01:07:42,514
as collateral.

1484
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:45,224
Jang Dong Min used collateral.

1485
01:07:45,383 --> 01:07:48,624
Does anyone want
to bid over 25,000 dollars?

1486
01:07:48,624 --> 01:07:49,624
Did you say 25,000 dollars?

1487
01:07:53,523 --> 01:07:55,793
If I bid 25,000 dollars, I won't be able
to win even if I get the painting.

1488
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,394
Should I enter?

1489
01:07:57,534 --> 01:07:58,934
That's right. You should enter.

1490
01:08:00,003 --> 01:08:03,304
Does anyone want
to bid over 25,000 dollars?

1491
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:06,943
Jang Dong Min, you bid 25,000 dollars.

1492
01:08:06,943 --> 01:08:10,443
The bidding price for the 7th auction item
is 25,000 dollars.

1493
01:08:10,443 --> 01:08:12,213
I'll reveal the question for Round Seven.

1494
01:08:12,383 --> 01:08:16,484
Present the painter
and the title of the painting.

1495
01:08:17,253 --> 01:08:19,184
Gogh. "Grapes,"

1496
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:23,524
"Lemons, Pears, and Apples."

("Grapes, Lemons, Pears, and Apples"
by Gogh)

1498
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:27,293
Jang Dong Min,

1499
01:08:28,593 --> 01:08:29,593
your answer is correct.

1500
01:08:31,003 --> 01:08:33,663

1501
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:36,333

1503
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:45,484
(Capital: 1,000 dollars,
3 paintings: 65,000 dollars)

1504
01:08:47,953 --> 01:08:49,154
Had he gotten it wrong,
it would've been mine.

1505
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:52,054
Dong Min, your atelier is fancy.

1506
01:08:52,453 --> 01:08:54,753
Jang Dong Min's assets
will include 35,000 dollars,

1507
01:08:54,753 --> 01:08:56,654
the value of the painting.

1508
01:08:57,324 --> 01:09:00,123
Round Seven of Art Auction has ended.

1509
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:01,894

The bidding will start at 2,000 dollars.

01:09:12,574 --> 01:09:15,673
(Dong Min doesn't bid.)

1515

I'll bid 2,000 dollars.

1516

01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:33,024
I'll bid 10,000 dollars.

1524
01:09:33,264 --> 01:09:34,564
Acau, you bid 10,000 dollars.

1525
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:37,234
I wanted to take a painting.

1526
01:09:37,764 --> 01:09:39,003
I'll lose it again.

1527
01:09:39,564 --> 01:09:42,604
Does anyone want
to bid over 10,000 dollars?

1528
01:09:43,734 --> 01:09:46,304

for the eighth auction item...

1535
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:03,593
Munch.

1536
01:10:05,364 --> 01:10:07,024
To be honest,
I didn't memorize that painting.

1537
01:10:07,024 --> 01:10:09,564
I didn't know that I'd be the first one.

1538
01:10:09,593 --> 01:10:11,804
Jin Ho was the second one to answer,

1539
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:13,064
so I decided to use a feint.

1540
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:14,404
Will you get it wrong?

1541
01:10:15,873 --> 01:10:16,934
I'm getting confused too.

1542
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:19,904
Your 30 seconds are up.

1543
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:21,043
Please present your answer.

1544
01:10:21,574 --> 01:10:23,444
When you think of Munch,
"The Scream" comes to mind...

1545
01:10:23,444 --> 01:10:25,243
since it's his representative work.

1546
01:10:25,343 --> 01:10:29,014
I know that it was a different painting.

1547
01:10:29,014 --> 01:10:30,684
I also didn't remember the year.

1548
01:10:31,224 --> 01:10:32,953
But I just made up the answer.

1549
01:10:34,024 --> 01:10:35,054
"The Scream."

1550
01:10:36,793 --> 01:10:39,194
Year of 1933.

1551
01:10:40,264 --> 01:10:41,934
Acau, your answer is incorrect.

1552
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:42,934
(Acau fails to win the 8th auction item.)

1553
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:45,934
Hong Jin Ho,
you made the next highest bid.

1554
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:49,274
You can either answer the question
or withdraw.

1555
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:51,144
This is "The Scream."

1556
01:10:51,144 --> 01:10:52,373
("The Scream" by Edvard Munch)

1557
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:54,274
It was one of the paintings
I had memorized.

1558
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,114
So when it was my turn...

1559
01:10:56,114 --> 01:10:57,144
I'll answer the question.

1560
01:10:57,144 --> 01:11:00,543
Hong Jin Ho, please present
the title and the year of the painting.

1561
01:11:00,814 --> 01:11:03,083
The year is 1913.

1562
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:07,554
- "Jealousy."
- Hong Jin Ho, your answer is correct.

1563
01:11:08,753 --> 01:11:12,224
"Jealousy" by Munch, year 1913.

1564
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:15,593
Acau, you'll lose 10,000 dollars
for your incorrect answer.

1565
01:11:16,033 --> 01:11:18,904
Hong Jin Ho, please pay
10,000 dollars for the painting.

1566
01:11:19,434 --> 01:11:21,274
Hong Jin Ho's assets
will include 20,000 dollars,

1567
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:23,304
the value of the painting.

1568
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:25,444
Round Eight of Art Auction has ended.

1569
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:29,043
I'll reveal the value and keyword
of the ninth auction item.

1570
01:11:29,074 --> 01:11:31,114
The keyword of the auction item
is a portrait.

1571
01:11:31,114 --> 01:11:34,184
The value is 25,000 dollars.

1572
01:11:34,314 --> 01:11:36,413
The bidding will start at 2,500 dollars.

1573
01:11:36,783 --> 01:11:37,824
I'll bid 2,500 dollars.

1574
01:11:37,883 --> 01:11:40,024
Hong Jin Ho, you bid 2,500 dollars.

1575
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:41,793
I'll bid 5,000 dollars.

1576
01:11:42,724 --> 01:11:44,993
I'll use "The Death of Marat" by David...

1577
01:11:45,024 --> 01:11:46,364
as collateral.

1578
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:48,963
I'll bid 5,500 dollars.

1579
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,703
- I'll bid 7,000 dollars.
- You bid 7,000 dollars.

1580
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:54,503
I'll bid 10,000 dollars
using a painting as collateral.

1581
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:56,974
It'll be "Still Life with Cherries
and Peaches" by Cezanne.

1582
01:12:00,703 --> 01:12:03,074
I'll take back
"The Death of Marat" by David...

1583
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:08,854
and use "Cupid Flying over Water"
by Bouguereau.

1584
01:12:09,484 --> 01:12:11,883
You bid 25,000 dollars using collateral.

1585
01:12:13,383 --> 01:12:15,394
Let's hope that he'll answer incorrectly
and lose the painting.

1586
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:17,894
Even if we use 25,000 dollars,
we won't win.

1587
01:12:18,993 --> 01:12:21,963
In that situation, there was no use
in placing a high bid.

1588
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:22,963
We couldn't win that way.

1589
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,264
We could only let Dong Min win the bid.

1590
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:26,434
If he answers incorrectly and loses
the collateral, it's a different story.

1591
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,033
That was the best option.

1592
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:29,604
I'll give it a go.

1593
01:12:30,133 --> 01:12:31,203
I'll bid on two paintings.

1594
01:12:31,474 --> 01:12:34,043
"Still Life with Cherries and Peaches"
by Cezanne.

1595
01:12:34,474 --> 01:12:37,343
"Angel, I Will Follow You" by Malczewski.

1596
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,144
That's...

1597
01:12:40,913 --> 01:12:42,453
I don't understand Seong Beom's tactic.

1598
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:44,184
Now, we just need to hope...

1599
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:45,524
for Dong Min's mistake.

1600
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:49,123
Even if he takes that painting,
he won't place first.

1601
01:12:49,524 --> 01:12:52,194
Placing 2nd is meaningless.
You have to place 1st.

1602
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,724
But he kept attempting to win the bid.

1603
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:55,293
I don't know how other people saw it,

1604
01:12:55,293 --> 01:12:56,734
but it was definitely a mistake.

1605
01:12:56,993 --> 01:13:00,003
Heo Seong Beom, you bid
30,000 dollars using collateral.

1606
01:13:00,203 --> 01:13:02,633
Heo Seong Beom has a priority
for answering the question.

1607
01:13:02,873 --> 01:13:04,604
I'll reveal the question for Round Nine.

1608
01:13:05,274 --> 01:13:08,814
Present the title and the year
of the painting.

1609
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:10,974
You must answer it within 30 seconds.

1610
01:13:11,514 --> 01:13:14,484
"By the Seashore." Year 1883.

1611
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:17,114
Heo Seong Beom, your answer is correct.

1612
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:19,554
You successfully won
the ninth auction item.

1613
01:13:19,883 --> 01:13:21,753
Please pay the collateral.

1614
01:13:21,793 --> 01:13:24,253
The difference of 5,000 dollars
will be given.

1615
01:13:24,694 --> 01:13:26,824
Heo Seong Beom's assets
will include 25,000 dollars,

1616
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:28,764
the value of the painting.

1617
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:32,564
I'll reveal the value and keyword
of the tenth auction item.

1618
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,974
The keyword of the tenth auction item
is the number of people.

1619
01:13:34,974 --> 01:13:37,133
The value is 20,000 dollars.

1620
01:13:37,173 --> 01:13:38,703
This is the last round.

1621
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:40,873
I'll use collateral.

1622
01:13:40,873 --> 01:13:42,574
I'll use "By the Seashore" by Renoir.

1623
01:13:43,243 --> 01:13:44,514
Present your answer.

1624
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,083
Eight.

1625
01:13:46,814 --> 01:13:49,484
Heo Seong Beom, your answer is correct.

1626
01:13:49,484 --> 01:13:51,324
You successfully won the auction item.

1627
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:52,524
("The Wedding Party" by Rousseau)

1628
01:13:52,524 --> 01:13:55,554
(Answer: 8)

1629
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:59,423
Round One of the Final Match,
Art Auction has ended.

1630
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:03,234
The players' assets which is
a combination of the capital...

1631
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:05,364
and the value of the paintings
will be announced.

1632
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,574
Jang Dong Min, 66,000 dollars.

1633
01:14:09,234 --> 01:14:12,043
Heo Seong Beom, 36,200 dollars.

1634
01:14:12,474 --> 01:14:14,574
Hong Jin Ho, 40,000 dollars.

1635
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:17,944
Acau, 20,000 dollars.

1636
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:22,383
The winner of Art Auction,
Round One of the Final Match...

1637
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:24,054
is Jang Dong Min.

1638
01:14:25,123 --> 01:14:26,953
There was a moment...

1639
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:28,793
where I could take a fall.

1640
01:14:28,993 --> 01:14:31,123
There was that moment,

1641
01:14:31,123 --> 01:14:32,623
but Seong Beom blocked it.

1642
01:14:32,623 --> 01:14:35,963
Seong Beom placed a higher bid than mine.

1643
01:14:35,963 --> 01:14:37,633
He shouldn't have done that.

1644
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:39,764
It was unimaginable,

1645
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:42,104
but the only option he had...

1646
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:45,404
was waiting for my mistake
after winning the bid.

1647
01:14:45,743 --> 01:14:48,514
But Seong Beom got rid of that chance.

1648
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:50,144
To be honest,

1649
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,543
I knew all the answers.
I had memorized all of them.

1650
01:14:53,043 --> 01:14:54,383
But Dong Min did so well.

1651
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:55,413
He came up with a good strategy.

1652
01:14:55,413 --> 01:14:57,014
I had a strategy of my own.

1653
01:14:57,383 --> 01:14:59,083
But he had already used a good strategy...

1654
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:00,953
before I attempted anything.

1655
01:15:01,253 --> 01:15:02,724
So I couldn't use my strategy.

1656
01:15:03,093 --> 01:15:04,663
That was how Round One went.

1657
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:07,824
"If I stop him, I'll take a point."

1658
01:15:07,824 --> 01:15:09,663
"If I don't stop him,
Dong Min will take a point."

1659
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,864
I focused on keeping Dong Min
from taking...

1660
01:15:11,864 --> 01:15:12,864
first place.

1661
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:15,373
"Breakfast after the Bath."

1662
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:17,304
That was a fatal mistake.

1663
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,703
I thought to myself,
"You fool, how could you get it wrong?"

1664
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,114
Due to that unlucky accident,
Dong Min got a turn.

1665
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:25,984
Dong Min didn't make a mistake.
He answered correctly.

1666
01:15:26,243 --> 01:15:27,913
That was when the game turned hard.

1667
01:15:28,854 --> 01:15:32,253
Two middle numbers of the passcode
will be given to Jang Dong Min.

1668
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:35,024
Please share them.

1669
01:15:35,224 --> 01:15:36,554
Dong Min, will you share them?

1670
01:15:42,133 --> 01:15:43,533
Thank you.

1671
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:47,364
(Jang Dong Min acquires
2 additional numbers of the passcode.)

1672
01:15:47,533 --> 01:15:50,533
Out of six digits of the passcode,

1673
01:15:50,533 --> 01:15:53,043
Jang Dong Min acquired four numbers
faster than anyone.

1674
01:15:53,673 --> 01:15:57,343
If Jang Dong Min places first
in the next round,

1675
01:15:57,814 --> 01:16:00,514
he will acquire all six numbers...

1676
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,413
and become the final winner
of Bloody Game 3.

1677
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:08,354
I took a win and put myself
in an advantageous position.

1678
01:16:08,493 --> 01:16:10,724
But there'll be many counterattacks.

1679
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:12,963
I'm continuing to calm my mind.

1680
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:14,934
Let's go.

1681
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:25,673
This is driving me crazy.

1682
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:31,583
I completely failed in Round One.

1683
01:16:31,684 --> 01:16:34,984
So I thought I should do my best...

1684
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:37,684
to win any game...

1685
01:16:37,684 --> 01:16:38,984
in Round Two.

1686
01:16:39,354 --> 01:16:42,493
I don't know what kind of game
I'll play in Round Two,

1687
01:16:42,493 --> 01:16:44,194
but whatever it is,

1688
01:16:44,194 --> 01:16:46,993
I shouldn't let Dong Min take first place.

1689
01:16:47,364 --> 01:16:48,894
I should stop Dong Min from winning.

1690
01:16:48,894 --> 01:16:51,934
The moment he wins,
the finals will end 2 to 0.

1691
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:54,974
If it looks like Dong Min is going to win
this time,

1692
01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:57,934
someone should stop him even if it means
they should sacrifice themselves.

1693
01:16:58,404 --> 01:17:01,274
I think many people would want to stop me.

1694
01:17:01,543 --> 01:17:04,114
But I'll endure it...

1695
01:17:04,114 --> 01:17:06,243
and have successive wins...

1696
01:17:06,314 --> 01:17:10,014
to become the final winner safely.
That's my goal.

1697
01:17:11,383 --> 01:17:13,423
The game
for Round Two of the Final Match...

1698
01:17:14,354 --> 01:17:15,793
is Black Village.

1699
01:17:16,993 --> 01:17:20,623
Black Village is a game where players
take turns placing tiles...

1700
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:24,333
to build their territory
and score points accordingly.

1701
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:28,033
Players need to use spatial awareness
and strategic thinking...

1702
01:17:28,234 --> 01:17:31,673
to occupy more territory
than their opponents.

1703
01:17:32,644 --> 01:17:35,373
In each round, eight selection tiles...

1704
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:38,283
and eight preview tiles for the next round
are revealed.

1705
01:17:38,944 --> 01:17:41,283
Players will take turns...

1706
01:17:41,514 --> 01:17:43,854
choosing 1 of the 8 selection tiles...

1707
01:17:43,854 --> 01:17:45,324
to place on the game board.

1708
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:49,724
When placing a tile, it must be adjacent
to a tile that was placed already,

1709
01:17:49,953 --> 01:17:53,123
and the shapes of the land and roads
on the tile must connect.

1710
01:17:54,163 --> 01:17:57,293
After placing a tile,
if no one owns the land or road...

1711
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:59,133
on the tile,

1712
01:17:59,264 --> 01:18:03,304
a player can place their token
to make it their territory.

1713
01:18:03,974 --> 01:18:07,404
The bottom of the token
has numbers from 1 to 3 written on it.

1714
01:18:07,543 --> 01:18:10,243
Each player is given
3 tokens with number 1,

1715
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:14,484
two tokens with number two,
and one token with number three.

1716
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:16,684
After all the tiles are placed,

1717
01:18:16,684 --> 01:18:20,083
if the entire land is completely enclosed
by borders...

1718
01:18:20,484 --> 01:18:24,453
or both ends of the road are fully
connected to a starting point or land,

1719
01:18:24,753 --> 01:18:26,993
the area is considered complete,

1720
01:18:27,163 --> 01:18:30,333
and the player retrieves the token
placed on the area.

1721
01:18:31,093 --> 01:18:33,463
If the road is completed,

1722
01:18:33,663 --> 01:18:35,833
the player occupying the area
receives one point per tile in the area.

1723
01:18:36,474 --> 01:18:38,074
If the land is completed,

1724
01:18:38,274 --> 01:18:40,404
the player occupying the area...

1725
01:18:40,873 --> 01:18:44,173
receives two points per tile in the area.

1726
01:18:45,283 --> 01:18:48,984
If two or more players have placed
their tokens in the completed area,

1727
01:18:49,484 --> 01:18:52,684
each player adds up the numbers
written on the bottom of their tokens,

1728
01:18:52,953 --> 01:18:55,793
and only the player with the higher sum
scores points.

1729
01:18:56,293 --> 01:19:00,423
If the sums are equal,
both players score points.

1730
01:19:00,993 --> 01:19:03,163
The game is played
over a total of eight rounds.

1731
01:19:03,564 --> 01:19:05,434
After all the tiles are placed,

1732
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:08,804
the player with the highest score
wins the game.

1733
01:19:09,274 --> 01:19:12,574
We will start Black Village shortly.

1734
01:19:13,243 --> 01:19:15,574
Now, let me give you the information...

1735
01:19:15,574 --> 01:19:18,213
about the tiles used in Black Village.

1736
01:19:18,243 --> 01:19:20,713
Please memorize the shape and number...

1737
01:19:20,713 --> 01:19:22,984
of 18 tiles in 5 minutes.

1738
01:19:23,883 --> 01:19:27,554
I thought it was similar to Cut Line
to some extent.

1739
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,253
You need to predict
your opponent's psychology,

1740
01:19:29,524 --> 01:19:31,524
calculate all possible scenarios,
and then make your move.

1741
01:19:31,524 --> 01:19:33,163
I'm confident, but...

1742
01:19:33,293 --> 01:19:36,394
I'm good at games
that require strategizing...

1743
01:19:36,593 --> 01:19:41,064
and real-time decision-making,
such as deduction games or board games.

1744
01:19:41,163 --> 01:19:43,673
I think this game is perfect for me.

1745
01:19:43,934 --> 01:19:46,404
This game is like a double-edged sword.

1746
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:48,074
When you play the game
to stop someone from winning,

1747
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:51,014
it will greatly affect them,

1748
01:19:51,243 --> 01:19:54,043
but you can't score many points either.

1749
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:58,453
It's a game where the timing your moves
to block other players is crucial.

1750
01:19:58,684 --> 01:20:00,253
- Five minutes have passed.
- Okay.

1751
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:01,654
Please return the paper.

1752
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,423
Actually, the order is important.

1753
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:06,663
It's better to go first.

1754
01:20:06,824 --> 01:20:10,564
So I hoped I could go first.

1755
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:13,833
- I got number 1.
- I got number 2.

1756
01:20:14,104 --> 01:20:15,873
- I got number 3.
- I got number 4.

1757
01:20:17,133 --> 01:20:19,673
The players will take turns
in the order of Acau, Heo Seong Beom,

1758
01:20:19,673 --> 01:20:22,074
Hong Jin Ho, and Jang Dong Min.

1759
01:20:22,213 --> 01:20:25,314
In each round, players will take turns
starting first.

1760
01:20:26,444 --> 01:20:28,383
I will reveal the start tile.

1761
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:31,923
I will reveal the 1st selection tiles
for Round 1...

1762
01:20:31,923 --> 01:20:33,923
and the preview tiles of Round Two.

1763
01:20:34,154 --> 01:20:38,024
(Tiles for Round 1)

1764
01:20:38,324 --> 01:20:40,724
Acau, please go first.

1765
01:20:40,724 --> 01:20:42,333
Acau, please choose a tile.

1766
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,663
I'll go with tile number three.

1767
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,764
Okay. Where would you like to place it?

1768
01:20:46,764 --> 01:20:48,833
I want to connect the land on the bottom.

1769
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,404
Acau, will you place a token?

1770
01:20:50,404 --> 01:20:52,043
Yes, I will.

1771
01:20:52,574 --> 01:20:54,774
- On the land.
- Let me place your token.

1772
01:20:54,944 --> 01:20:57,213
Acau has created land...

1773
01:20:57,213 --> 01:20:59,543
using 2 land tiles and received 4 points.

1774
01:20:59,543 --> 01:21:00,614
I will retrieve the token.

1775
01:21:00,614 --> 01:21:02,054
I scored four points. It feels great.

1776
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:05,154
Next is Heo Seong Beom.

1777
01:21:05,253 --> 01:21:06,883
Please choose a selection tile.

1778
01:21:07,883 --> 01:21:09,123
I'll go with number four.

1779
01:21:09,324 --> 01:21:11,524
Where would you like to place it?

1780
01:21:11,623 --> 01:21:13,194
I want to put it on top of it.

1781
01:21:13,864 --> 01:21:16,033
Seong Beom, will you place a token?

1782
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:17,264
I want to place it on the right tile.

1783
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:19,764
Okay. Let me put it here.

1784
01:21:19,804 --> 01:21:21,873
Hong Jin Ho, please choose a tile.

1785
01:21:22,873 --> 01:21:23,974
Well...

1786
01:21:23,974 --> 01:21:25,274
(Tiles for Round 1)

1787
01:21:25,274 --> 01:21:28,173
I want to put number two here.

1788
01:21:28,373 --> 01:21:29,743
Selection tile number two.

1789
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:31,713
And I want to place a token.

1790
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,154
(Heo Seong Beom, Hong Jin Ho)

1791
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:37,614
Jang Dong Min, please choose a tile.

1792
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:39,154
(Tiles for Round 1)

1793
01:21:39,154 --> 01:21:40,283
I'd like to put the number eight...

1794
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:43,524
at the end.

1795
01:21:44,654 --> 01:21:45,663
Yes.

1796
01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:48,663
(He places the tile near Jin Ho's land.)

1797
01:21:50,394 --> 01:21:51,564
Dong Min...

1798
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:53,533
made land...

1799
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:56,003
and placed his token...

1800
01:21:56,373 --> 01:21:59,804
on the territory I need to take
to create land.

1801
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:01,304
He picked a token fight.

1802
01:22:01,743 --> 01:22:04,673
My strategy in the beginning...

1803
01:22:05,043 --> 01:22:07,343
is to take big land to play comfortably...

1804
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:10,913
because you can score
twice as many points for land.

1805
01:22:10,913 --> 01:22:14,083
That's why I decided to put a tile
next to Jin Ho's land.

1806
01:22:14,283 --> 01:22:16,524
I thought if we created bigger land,

1807
01:22:16,953 --> 01:22:18,694
it'd have a huge impact.

1808
01:22:18,894 --> 01:22:20,663
I wanted to get help...

1809
01:22:20,793 --> 01:22:23,493
from Jin Ho. That was my strategy.

1810
01:22:24,133 --> 01:22:27,104
Next is Acau.

1811
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:28,904
Please choose a tile.

1812
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:31,574
I want to use the tile
with straight lines.

1813
01:22:32,644 --> 01:22:33,974
The bottom right.

1814
01:22:34,343 --> 01:22:37,713
Yes. And I want to place my token
on the road.

1815
01:22:37,944 --> 01:22:40,083
(He goes for a less crowded area.)

1816
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:42,154
This is what I thought
was the most important.

1817
01:22:42,314 --> 01:22:45,014
When there are four players,

1818
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:48,724
it'd be very difficult to share land.

1819
01:22:48,724 --> 01:22:52,163
If you can't complete the land,
you won't receive any points for that.

1820
01:22:52,324 --> 01:22:54,564
So I tried not to make a move
with variables...

1821
01:22:54,564 --> 01:22:58,364
and chose the area
the other players didn't pick.

1822
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:02,003
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

1823
01:23:02,003 --> 01:23:03,604
(Tiles for Round 1)

1824
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:04,804
I'd like to choose the black tile.

1825
01:23:05,574 --> 01:23:07,574
I want to put it above Dong Min's tile.

1826
01:23:09,574 --> 01:23:10,574
(Heo Seong Beom, Jang Dong Min)

1827
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:13,043
(Seong Beom chooses to expand
Dong Min's land.)

1828
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:14,514
My strategy was simple.

1829
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:17,854
It was either to create small land
to score points quickly...

1830
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:20,024
or to disrupt others
from completing large land.

1831
01:23:20,024 --> 01:23:21,923
These two were my main strategies.

1832
01:23:22,224 --> 01:23:25,993
As Seong Beom put a tile with a big
portion of land next to Dong Min's land,

1833
01:23:26,524 --> 01:23:29,864
Dong Min has to use more tiles...

1834
01:23:29,864 --> 01:23:31,234
to complete his land.

1835
01:23:32,163 --> 01:23:34,703
Of course, I'm keeping him in check.

1836
01:23:34,703 --> 01:23:37,304
But I have a big picture in my mind.

1837
01:23:37,503 --> 01:23:39,043
I think it's doable.

1838
01:23:39,843 --> 01:23:41,474
Jin Ho, it's your turn.

1839
01:23:42,474 --> 01:23:44,514
I'd like to put that tile...

1840
01:23:45,383 --> 01:23:48,243
on the left side of this tile.

1841
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,453
And I'm going to put a token
on the road in the middle.

1842
01:23:51,453 --> 01:23:52,923
(Hong Jin Ho)

1843
01:23:53,054 --> 01:23:54,354
Dong Min.

1844
01:23:54,684 --> 01:23:56,524
I want to put it next to the tile
with the three-way intersection.

1845
01:23:56,623 --> 01:23:57,793
- This tile?
- Yes.

1846
01:23:58,564 --> 01:24:01,024
And I'd like to place this token.

1847
01:24:01,293 --> 01:24:05,404
(Jang Dong Min)

1848
01:24:05,564 --> 01:24:07,463
Round One has ended.

1849
01:24:07,864 --> 01:24:11,333
In Round Two, players will take turns in
the order of Heo Seong Beom, Hong Jin Ho,

1850
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,104
Jang Dong Min, and Acau.

1851
01:24:15,074 --> 01:24:17,873
I will reveal the preview tiles
for the next round.

1852
01:24:17,873 --> 01:24:20,083
(Tiles for Round 2)

1853
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:23,114
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

1854
01:24:23,984 --> 01:24:25,224
I'll go with number six.

1855
01:24:25,684 --> 01:24:27,024
I want to put it next to my tile.

1856
01:24:27,024 --> 01:24:28,324
(Heo Seong Beom)

1857
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,154
Seong Beom has connected two land tiles...

1858
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:33,423
and scored four points.

1859
01:24:33,423 --> 01:24:35,734
- It must feel good.
- I will retrieve the token.

1860
01:24:35,734 --> 01:24:38,764
Jin Ho, please choose a tile.

1861
01:24:38,764 --> 01:24:43,104
(Tiles for Round 2)

1862
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:45,304
Please give me the number eight.

1863
01:24:45,304 --> 01:24:46,373
Okay.

1864
01:24:46,503 --> 01:24:48,673
I want to complete my road.

1865
01:24:50,673 --> 01:24:53,543
Then I'm going to place a token
on my land.

1866
01:24:53,984 --> 01:24:56,514
Jin Ho has connected two roads...

1867
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:58,684
and scored two points.

1868
01:24:59,123 --> 01:25:00,623
I will give the token back to you.

1869
01:25:00,883 --> 01:25:02,923
Okay. Thank you.

1870
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:07,593
- In the next round,
- Yes.

1871
01:25:07,793 --> 01:25:09,764
they can block the bottom
of your big land over there.

1872
01:25:10,364 --> 01:25:11,463
Yes. But...

1873
01:25:11,463 --> 01:25:12,864
No. In the next round.

1874
01:25:14,064 --> 01:25:17,533
Currently, the only tile
that can complete Jin Ho's land...

1875
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:20,604
is tile number one in the next round.

1876
01:25:21,474 --> 01:25:24,514
Dong Min who wants to score many points
by combining his land with Jin Ho's...

1877
01:25:24,774 --> 01:25:28,854
needs his help
as Jin Ho will go first in the next round.

1878
01:25:34,224 --> 01:25:35,623
I will give the token back to you.

1879
01:25:36,894 --> 01:25:39,423
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

1880
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,764
(Tiles for Round 2, Jang Dong Min)

1881
01:25:41,764 --> 01:25:42,993
I'll use tile number five...

1882
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:46,663
to block the tile on the top.

1883
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:49,333
(Dong Min is completing the big land
step by step.)

1884
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,373
Acau, please choose a tile.

1885
01:25:53,373 --> 01:25:54,543
(Tiles for Round 2)

1886
01:25:54,543 --> 01:25:55,543
(Acau)

1887
01:25:55,543 --> 01:25:57,243
I'll choose tile number four.

1888
01:25:57,243 --> 01:25:59,543
Where would you like to place it?

1889
01:25:59,883 --> 01:26:02,184
(Acau)

1890
01:26:02,184 --> 01:26:04,054
Yes. I'd like to put it there.

1891
01:26:04,054 --> 01:26:05,984
(Acau)

1892
01:26:06,154 --> 01:26:09,194
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

1893
01:26:10,493 --> 01:26:11,593
Tile number three.

1894
01:26:11,753 --> 01:26:13,894
Where would you like to place it?

1895
01:26:13,894 --> 01:26:15,694
- I'll connect the road. Yes.
- Here?

1896
01:26:16,293 --> 01:26:17,694
I'll place the token on it
and retrieve it.

1897
01:26:17,993 --> 01:26:21,304
Seong Beom has connected 2 road tiles
and received 2 points.

1898
01:26:21,304 --> 01:26:23,033
I'll return the token to you.

1899
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:24,074
(Seong Beom takes the lead.)

1900
01:26:24,074 --> 01:26:27,304
Jin Ho, please choose a tile.

1901
01:26:28,444 --> 01:26:30,673
(Tile number 2 can connect
Jin Ho's land and Dong Min's land.)

1902
01:26:30,673 --> 01:26:33,114
(Jang Dong Min, Hong Jin Ho)

1903
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:38,154
(Tiles for Round 2)

1904
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:40,184
I'm going to put tile number seven...

1905
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,293
on the road on the top.

1906
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:45,224
Yes. Like that.

1907
01:26:45,564 --> 01:26:47,293
Then I'll place a token there.

1908
01:26:47,764 --> 01:26:50,093
Jin Ho has placed a token.

1909
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:53,703
Of course, it's nice to create big land.

1910
01:26:53,703 --> 01:26:55,703
But I can't. Because...

1911
01:26:55,703 --> 01:26:57,604
the other players will try to stop me...

1912
01:26:57,604 --> 01:26:59,003
and it takes many rounds to complete it.

1913
01:26:59,144 --> 01:27:00,673
So I just tried to create land...

1914
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:03,173
with 2 or 3 tiles...

1915
01:27:03,173 --> 01:27:05,043
and receive 2 or 3 points many times.

1916
01:27:05,043 --> 01:27:06,913
That was my strategy.

1917
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:13,224
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

1918
01:27:13,383 --> 01:27:16,154
(Tile number 2 is still left.)

1919
01:27:16,253 --> 01:27:17,694
I'd like to put tile number two...

1920
01:27:17,953 --> 01:27:21,694
in the middle in this direction.

1921
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:22,963
Yes. Please put them together.

1922
01:27:22,963 --> 01:27:25,564
(Dong Min also starts creating
his own territory.)

1923
01:27:26,364 --> 01:27:29,173
I'd like to put the token on the land.

1924
01:27:30,274 --> 01:27:31,673
- On the land.
- Yes.

1925
01:27:31,673 --> 01:27:34,144
(Jang Dong Min, Hong Jin Ho)

1926
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:37,043
(Jin Ho and Dong Min created
their own territories.)

1927
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:40,243
Acau, please place a tile.

1928
01:27:42,913 --> 01:27:45,184
Acau has placed a tile.

1929
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:48,283
Round Two has ended.

1930
01:27:48,654 --> 01:27:51,694
In Round Three, players will take turns in
the order of Hong Jin Ho, Jang Dong Min,

1931
01:27:51,894 --> 01:27:54,463
Acau, and Heo Seong Beom.

1932
01:27:55,264 --> 01:27:57,934
I will reveal the preview tiles
for the next round.

1933
01:27:57,934 --> 01:27:59,304
(Tiles for Round 3)

1934
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,203
Jin Ho will go first.

1935
01:28:01,203 --> 01:28:02,873
Please choose a tile.

1936
01:28:03,104 --> 01:28:05,234
(Previous round)

1937
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:10,574
(Dong Min told him
to choose tile number 1.)

1938
01:28:11,014 --> 01:28:15,184
(Will he complete the big land
with Dong Min?)

1939
01:28:15,953 --> 01:28:17,783
Jin Ho will go first.

1940
01:28:17,783 --> 01:28:19,324
Please choose a tile.

1941
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:22,293
- Tile number 2.
- Tile number 2.

1942
01:28:22,453 --> 01:28:25,024
(Jin Ho refuses Dong Min's suggestion.)

1943
01:28:25,194 --> 01:28:27,923
I want to put it next to the road here.

1944
01:28:28,593 --> 01:28:29,894
Will you place a token?

1945
01:28:29,993 --> 01:28:31,364
I'd like to put it on the land.

1946
01:28:31,993 --> 01:28:33,833
I will put it on the land.

1947
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:34,904
(Hong Jin Ho)

1948
01:28:35,003 --> 01:28:37,404
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

1949
01:28:37,503 --> 01:28:39,304
Tile number four.

1950
01:28:39,304 --> 01:28:40,944
(Jang Dong Min)

1951
01:28:40,944 --> 01:28:42,003
(Tiles for Round 3)

1952
01:28:42,003 --> 01:28:43,743
The blue one.

1953
01:28:43,974 --> 01:28:46,114
Yes. I want to put it below it.

1954
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:49,913
And I'm going to put a token on the road.

1955
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:52,014
The token was placed.

1956
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:53,024
(They start creating
their own territories again.)

1957
01:28:53,024 --> 01:28:55,524
Acau, please choose a tile.

1958
01:28:55,524 --> 01:28:57,394
I'll choose tile number eight.

1959
01:28:57,493 --> 01:28:59,264
You've chosen tile number eight.

1960
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:03,864
I'd like to put it there
and place a token.

1961
01:29:03,864 --> 01:29:07,203
(Acau has been expanding his territory
steadily.)

1962
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:10,133
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

1963
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:14,804
I'd like to put tile number one
next to the blue token.

1964
01:29:17,373 --> 01:29:19,343
(He puts a tile
next to Dong Min's territory.)

1965
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:22,883
Jin Ho, please choose a tile.

1966
01:29:22,883 --> 01:29:25,783
(Hong Jin Ho)

1967
01:29:25,783 --> 01:29:28,654
I want to put tile number three
above my territory.

1968
01:29:28,793 --> 01:29:31,253
(Hong Jin Ho)

1969
01:29:31,293 --> 01:29:33,724
Jin Ho has used two land tiles...

1970
01:29:33,724 --> 01:29:36,264
to connect the land
and received four points.

1971
01:29:36,264 --> 01:29:38,163
I will return the token to you.

1972
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:42,064
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

1973
01:29:42,373 --> 01:29:43,734
I want to put tile number three...

1974
01:29:43,734 --> 01:29:45,003
(Jang Dong Min)

1975
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:46,404
over there.

1976
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:47,644
(Jang Dong Min)

1977
01:29:47,644 --> 01:29:48,673
Yes.

1978
01:29:49,243 --> 01:29:52,014
(He connects both the road and the land
at the same time.)

1979
01:29:52,314 --> 01:29:54,684
Acau, please choose a tile.

1980
01:29:54,713 --> 01:29:55,913
I'd like to put tile number two...

1981
01:29:56,953 --> 01:30:00,354
on the left side of my road over there.

1982
01:30:01,283 --> 01:30:03,293
(Acau)

1983
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:11,234
- Isn't it...
- Sorry?

1984
01:30:11,234 --> 01:30:12,703
a drawing dead?

1985
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:14,503
- The area we made in the beginning?
- Yes.

1986
01:30:14,503 --> 01:30:15,604
It's over.

1987
01:30:15,774 --> 01:30:17,934
We can't build anything there.
There's no structure.

1988
01:30:18,703 --> 01:30:20,304
Because of the tile Acau has placed,

1989
01:30:20,574 --> 01:30:23,474
it's impossible to put any tile here.

1990
01:30:25,043 --> 01:30:26,184
Gosh.

1991
01:30:26,314 --> 01:30:29,383
He really tried to stop me.

1992
01:30:29,753 --> 01:30:33,354
I placed a token
with the number three written on it there,

1993
01:30:33,423 --> 01:30:37,024
and I used as many as two turns.

1994
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:40,564
Despite everything,
it became impossible to complete the land.

1995
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:43,993
That's why it's risky in the beginning.

1996
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,934
I need to get it together.

1997
01:30:46,564 --> 01:30:49,274
Dong Min and I wasted our turns anyway.

1998
01:30:49,404 --> 01:30:51,434
We started the round
at a significant disadvantage.

1999
01:30:51,774 --> 01:30:53,104
Since the beginning,

2000
01:30:53,304 --> 01:30:56,944
I've secretly tried to stop them.

2001
01:30:57,543 --> 01:31:00,343
If I place a road that turns to the side,
he can't create land there.

2002
01:31:00,343 --> 01:31:02,283
Because I understood the rules,

2003
01:31:02,283 --> 01:31:03,783
I pretended
to connect my areas naturally...

2004
01:31:03,783 --> 01:31:05,953
to stop him.

2005
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:09,654
Seong Beom,
where do you want to put a tile?

2006
01:31:09,654 --> 01:31:10,793
(Tiles for Round 3)

2007
01:31:13,663 --> 01:31:15,463
Round Three has ended.

2008
01:31:15,463 --> 01:31:16,533
(Round 3 has ended
when everyone has their own territory.)

2009
01:31:16,593 --> 01:31:19,734
In Round Four, players will take turns in
the order of Jang Dong Min, Acau,

2010
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:22,333
Heo Seong Beom, and Hong Jin Ho.

2011
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:26,373
I will reveal the preview tiles
for the next round.

2012
01:31:26,373 --> 01:31:28,673
(Tiles for Round 4)

2013
01:31:29,043 --> 01:31:31,713
Dong Min, please choose a tile first.

2014
01:31:32,413 --> 01:31:33,614
I'd like to put tile number one...

2015
01:31:34,413 --> 01:31:36,514
at the end.

2016
01:31:36,654 --> 01:31:38,213
- Will you place a token?
- Yes.

2017
01:31:38,314 --> 01:31:41,024
I'll put it on the road.

2018
01:31:41,324 --> 01:31:43,894
As four land tiles are connected,

2019
01:31:43,894 --> 01:31:45,354
you've received eight points.

2020
01:31:45,993 --> 01:31:47,564
I will return the token to you.

2021
01:31:47,894 --> 01:31:49,694
Step by step,

2022
01:31:49,694 --> 01:31:52,064
I received eight points.

2023
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,804
But I was worried.

2024
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:56,873
I tried to predict the future,

2025
01:31:56,934 --> 01:32:00,343
and I could think of many situations...

2026
01:32:00,343 --> 01:32:03,444
where Acau could put me in danger
if I didn't stop him.

2027
01:32:03,913 --> 01:32:05,984
Acau, please choose a tile.

2028
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:08,814
I will choose tile number seven.

2029
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:11,583
(Tiles for Round 4)

2030
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:13,824
(Acau)

2031
01:32:13,824 --> 01:32:16,154
(Acau's expanding his territory.)

2032
01:32:18,793 --> 01:32:20,864
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

2033
01:32:21,993 --> 01:32:24,633
I'm going to place tile number six
and a token.

2034
01:32:28,003 --> 01:32:29,503
I will place the token.

2035
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:33,843
You've connected 2 land tiles
and scored 4 points.

2036
01:32:33,873 --> 01:32:35,274
I will return the token to you.

2037
01:32:35,274 --> 01:32:36,543
(Seong Beom takes the lead again.)

2038
01:32:36,873 --> 01:32:38,873
Jin Ho, please choose a tile.

2039
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:41,144
This is tough.

2040
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:42,913
(Tiles for Round 4)

2041
01:32:42,913 --> 01:32:45,314
I'll choose the three-way intersection.

2042
01:32:45,953 --> 01:32:49,654
I'd like to end the road here...

2043
01:32:50,293 --> 01:32:51,854
and put the token on the left side.

2044
01:32:52,093 --> 01:32:54,024
(Hong Jin Ho)

2045
01:32:54,024 --> 01:32:57,694
You've connected 4 road tiles
and scored 4 points.

2046
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,264
I will return the token to you.

2047
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,734
(Jin Ho is catching up to the leader.)

2048
01:33:00,764 --> 01:33:02,833
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

2049
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,434
(Tiles for Round 4)

2050
01:33:04,434 --> 01:33:05,703
I'm going to put tile number three...

2051
01:33:06,543 --> 01:33:08,243
to end the road over there.

2052
01:33:08,474 --> 01:33:09,814
Will you place a token?

2053
01:33:09,944 --> 01:33:11,774
I'd like to put it on the land.

2054
01:33:12,684 --> 01:33:16,583
You've connected 4 road tiles
and earned 4 points.

2055
01:33:17,554 --> 01:33:18,913
I will return the token to you.

2056
01:33:18,913 --> 01:33:21,383
(The leader has changed again.)

2057
01:33:21,383 --> 01:33:23,993
Acau, please choose a tile.

2058
01:33:24,793 --> 01:33:26,463
I'll take tile number one.

2059
01:33:30,394 --> 01:33:33,734
(Acau is about to complete a continent.)

2060
01:33:37,673 --> 01:33:39,673
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

2061
01:33:39,673 --> 01:33:43,574
(Tiles for Round 4)

2062
01:33:43,774 --> 01:33:46,883
As Acau's land was getting bigger
and his roads were getting longer,

2063
01:33:46,883 --> 01:33:48,684
we had to keep him in check.

2064
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:52,383
But Seong Beom, Jin Ho, and I...

2065
01:33:52,623 --> 01:33:55,953
couldn't find the right timing
to stop him.

2066
01:33:56,024 --> 01:33:58,293
Every time we tried,

2067
01:33:58,493 --> 01:34:00,493
there wasn't a tile that could stop him.

2068
01:34:01,024 --> 01:34:03,163
With the remaining two tiles,
they can stop Acau...

2069
01:34:03,163 --> 01:34:06,663
who will go first in the next round
with the following method.

2070
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:10,304
First, Seong Beom has to put a tile
with a straight road.

2071
01:34:10,574 --> 01:34:13,444
Next, Jin Ho has to put a tile
where the land covers three sides...

2072
01:34:14,104 --> 01:34:16,074
to make Acau use more tiles...

2073
01:34:16,074 --> 01:34:18,843
to complete his land.

2074
01:34:19,243 --> 01:34:21,184
(Tiles for Round 4)

2075
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,753
Should we try to score points?

2076
01:34:23,314 --> 01:34:25,283
Or should we stop him from scoring points?

2077
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:29,854
I only attack those who attack me.

2078
01:34:33,864 --> 01:34:35,423
Gosh. This is...

2079
01:34:38,434 --> 01:34:39,963
I'll choose the land tile on the left.

2080
01:34:45,974 --> 01:34:47,644
(Heo Seong Beom)

2081
01:34:47,644 --> 01:34:50,944
(Seong Beom chooses to expand his land.)

2082
01:34:51,074 --> 01:34:54,043
It's not that I didn't think of
the method. I thought we had to stop him.

2083
01:34:54,184 --> 01:34:55,583
But it didn't really work out...

2084
01:34:56,054 --> 01:34:58,713
because you need to use your turn
to stop him.

2085
01:34:59,154 --> 01:35:01,154
You should either try to score points...

2086
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,093
or stop others from scoring points.

2087
01:35:03,423 --> 01:35:06,123
But it's all meaningless
unless you take first place in the end.

2088
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:09,234
So everyone wants to earn points
instead of trying to stop others.

2089
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:12,663
Jin Ho, how will you place the tile?

2090
01:35:13,104 --> 01:35:14,663
I'll extend my road.

2091
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:18,074
(Jin Ho extends his road
instead of keeping Acau in check.)

2092
01:35:18,804 --> 01:35:22,814
Actually, there were situations
where I could stop Acau.

2093
01:35:23,144 --> 01:35:24,614
But this is how it went.

2094
01:35:24,644 --> 01:35:26,543
It was an individual match where everyone
was competing against everyone.

2095
01:35:27,543 --> 01:35:29,383
All of us were thinking,

2096
01:35:30,054 --> 01:35:32,283
"Somebody will prevent him from scoring."

2097
01:35:32,283 --> 01:35:33,554
"I better focus on scoring for myself."

2098
01:35:34,024 --> 01:35:35,684
This was what we had in mind.

2099
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:38,993
I was watching Acau expand his land,

2100
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:41,093
but the moment I stopped him,

2101
01:35:41,093 --> 01:35:42,324
I wasn't going to score for myself.

2102
01:35:42,324 --> 01:35:43,333
I wasn't going to place first, then.

2103
01:35:44,033 --> 01:35:45,663
So in the end, I focused on mine...

2104
01:35:45,663 --> 01:35:46,663
without stopping him.

2105
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,963
It must've been the same for the others.

2106
01:35:50,274 --> 01:35:52,644
Here are the preview tiles
for the next round.

2107
01:35:53,543 --> 01:35:56,213
Acau, you're up first.
Please choose a tile.

2108
01:35:56,213 --> 01:35:57,213
Number one.

2109
01:35:57,213 --> 01:35:59,014
(Tiles for Round 5)

2110
01:35:59,074 --> 01:36:01,783
(Acau)

2111
01:36:01,984 --> 01:36:04,554
You have connected six land tiles.

2112
01:36:04,554 --> 01:36:06,224
That is 12 points for you.

2113
01:36:06,324 --> 01:36:07,724
That's a big bite.

2114
01:36:07,724 --> 01:36:11,923
(Acau ends up securing a high-point land.)

2115
01:36:14,524 --> 01:36:16,093
Gosh, we couldn't stop that.

2116
01:36:19,963 --> 01:36:23,033
Seong Beom, you're up next.
Please choose a tile.

2117
01:36:27,274 --> 01:36:28,543
I choose number five.

2118
01:36:29,743 --> 01:36:31,114
(Heo Seong Beom)

2119
01:36:31,114 --> 01:36:32,783
(He expands his land...)

2120
01:36:32,783 --> 01:36:34,944
(and creates an additional land.)

2121
01:36:34,944 --> 01:36:38,253
Next is Jin Ho. Please choose a tile.

2122
01:36:41,453 --> 01:36:43,894
I choose number one. Please put it here.

2123
01:36:43,894 --> 01:36:46,364
(Hong Jin Ho)

2124
01:36:46,364 --> 01:36:48,524
(Jin Ho extends his road.)

2125
01:36:49,093 --> 01:36:50,394
Please place it on the castle.

2126
01:36:51,533 --> 01:36:52,533
Castle?

2127
01:36:52,934 --> 01:36:53,934
The land.

2128
01:36:54,633 --> 01:36:56,574
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

2129
01:36:59,574 --> 01:37:00,743
I'll attach it here.

2130
01:37:03,743 --> 01:37:05,774
You have connected three road tiles.

2131
01:37:05,774 --> 01:37:07,243
That's three points for you.

2132
01:37:09,453 --> 01:37:11,453
It's not bad.

2133
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,283
But what keeps bothering me is...

2134
01:37:16,753 --> 01:37:19,293
that Jin Ho or Seong Beom...

2135
01:37:19,894 --> 01:37:23,434
has to keep Acau in check just for once.

2136
01:37:24,234 --> 01:37:25,264
Just for one turn.

2137
01:37:26,234 --> 01:37:28,264
Acau, please choose a tile.

2138
01:37:28,264 --> 01:37:29,304
(Next is Acau,
who's currently in the lead.)

2139
01:37:29,404 --> 01:37:32,104
(To complete the road,)

2140
01:37:32,104 --> 01:37:36,644
(he needs a curved road tile.)

2141
01:37:38,314 --> 01:37:41,843
(Hesitating)

2142
01:37:43,814 --> 01:37:49,224
(He's very careful about choosing a tile.)

2143
01:37:51,194 --> 01:37:52,764
I choose number two.

2144
01:37:52,764 --> 01:37:54,423
(He chooses another tile
instead of the curved road tile.)

2145
01:37:54,423 --> 01:37:55,493
Place it there.

2146
01:37:55,493 --> 01:37:57,934
(He completes the other side
of the road first.)

2147
01:37:59,703 --> 01:38:04,703
I think this is the last chance.

2148
01:38:05,703 --> 01:38:07,604
Seong Beom, please choose a tile.

2149
01:38:08,543 --> 01:38:10,673
I choose number three. Yes, that one.

2150
01:38:12,373 --> 01:38:14,984
(Seong Beom has expanded
his land quite big.)

2151
01:38:15,243 --> 01:38:17,913
Hand me that road tile.

2152
01:38:20,283 --> 01:38:22,123
I'll connect it to my road like this.

2153
01:38:22,923 --> 01:38:25,293
(Jin Ho continuously extends his road.)

2154
01:38:25,923 --> 01:38:27,694
Dong Min, please place a tile.

2155
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:33,133
(The remaining tile isn't of help
to securing his points.)

2156
01:38:33,133 --> 01:38:35,333
(Jang Dong Min)

2157
01:38:36,234 --> 01:38:38,203
It really is useless.

2158
01:38:43,014 --> 01:38:46,814
(Heo Seong Beom)

2159
01:38:46,814 --> 01:38:49,753
(He attempts to take advantage
of Seong Beom's land.)

2160
01:38:50,114 --> 01:38:51,184
Oh, well...

2161
01:38:52,684 --> 01:38:54,253
That's right.
You should rather mess with him.

2162
01:38:56,024 --> 01:38:57,694
(Feeling uncomfortable)

2163
01:38:57,923 --> 01:38:59,724
Honestly, I was stunned.

2164
01:39:01,493 --> 01:39:03,564
Round Five is over.

2165
01:39:04,533 --> 01:39:09,974
The order for Round Six is Heo Seong Beom,
Hong Jin Ho, Jang Dong Min, and Acau.

2166
01:39:11,274 --> 01:39:13,944
Here are the preview tiles
for the next round.

2167
01:39:14,343 --> 01:39:16,314
(Tiles for Round 6)

2168
01:39:16,314 --> 01:39:17,314
(Seong Beom is the 1st to go in Round 6.)

2169
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:19,514
Seong Beom, you're up first.

2170
01:39:19,514 --> 01:39:20,883
Please choose a tile.

2171
01:39:21,543 --> 01:39:23,654
Well, this is amusing.

2172
01:39:28,354 --> 01:39:30,894
Acau needs to be stopped, by the way.

2173
01:39:33,524 --> 01:39:37,093
There was only one tile...

2174
01:39:37,093 --> 01:39:39,934
that could stop Acau from scoring
seven points by completing a road.

2175
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:43,274
If anyone placed the straight road card...

2176
01:39:44,033 --> 01:39:47,673
next to the curved road card,

2177
01:39:47,944 --> 01:39:49,843
he'd need to place
a three-way intersection road card there.

2178
01:39:49,843 --> 01:39:53,343
Since a three-way intersection road card
was often used,

2179
01:39:53,583 --> 01:39:54,944
Acau wasn't going to be able to use it.

2180
01:39:58,314 --> 01:40:00,484
(Which tile will Seong Beom choose?)

2181
01:40:01,324 --> 01:40:02,324
I choose number eight.

2182
01:40:02,324 --> 01:40:08,123
(Unlike Dong Min's wish,
he chooses another tile.)

2183
01:40:09,434 --> 01:40:10,493
(Jang Dong Min, Heo Seong Beom)

2184
01:40:10,493 --> 01:40:13,904
(Seong Beom rather keeps
Dong Min in check.)

2185
01:40:14,064 --> 01:40:15,133
That's a wise move.

2186
01:40:15,804 --> 01:40:16,904
Let's score together, Dong Min.

2187
01:40:18,074 --> 01:40:19,574
If I stopped Acau,

2188
01:40:19,843 --> 01:40:21,404
Dong Min was going to score...

2189
01:40:21,404 --> 01:40:22,543
and put an end to the game.

2190
01:40:22,944 --> 01:40:25,343
I'm okay with anyone taking the win
except for Dong Min.

2191
01:40:25,343 --> 01:40:27,014
So, I can't help but mind him the most.

2192
01:40:27,713 --> 01:40:29,283
Jin Ho, please choose a tile.

2193
01:40:29,283 --> 01:40:30,484
(Jin Ho is up next.)

2194
01:40:31,014 --> 01:40:32,014
Give me number three.

2195
01:40:34,324 --> 01:40:35,324
I'll place it like this.

2196
01:40:35,423 --> 01:40:37,923
I kept focusing on scoring for myself.

2197
01:40:38,894 --> 01:40:42,024
Next up is Dong Min. Please choose a tile.

2198
01:40:45,934 --> 01:40:46,934
No, the one below that.

2199
01:40:47,734 --> 01:40:48,734
Yes.

2200
01:40:51,533 --> 01:40:53,373
(Dong Min also chooses one for himself.)

2201
01:40:53,373 --> 01:40:56,144
Next up is Acau. Please choose a tile.

2202
01:40:56,743 --> 01:40:57,873
I choose number three.

2203
01:40:59,043 --> 01:41:02,383
(He makes a defensive move
so that he can't be stopped.)

2204
01:41:03,184 --> 01:41:04,453
I thought...

2205
01:41:05,614 --> 01:41:07,923
it was getting tricky.

2206
01:41:09,283 --> 01:41:11,354
But the game wasn't over yet.

2207
01:41:12,963 --> 01:41:15,824
(Seong Beom is up next.)

2208
01:41:17,033 --> 01:41:19,633
(He places a token on a new land again.)

2209
01:41:20,633 --> 01:41:22,033
Place this one there.

2210
01:41:24,074 --> 01:41:25,274
(Jin Ho also adds a token on a new road.)

2211
01:41:25,274 --> 01:41:27,804
(Hong Jin Ho)

2212
01:41:28,873 --> 01:41:29,944
I choose number one.

2213
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:35,413
(Jang Dong Min)

2214
01:41:35,413 --> 01:41:38,054
(He uses one tile to expand
both the land and road.)

2215
01:41:38,753 --> 01:41:40,524
There's nowhere to place this.

2216
01:41:42,224 --> 01:41:44,423
(He places the last tile
against Dong Min's favor.)

2217
01:41:45,154 --> 01:41:50,864
Round 6 is over. The order for Round 7
is Hong Jin Ho, Jang Dong Min,

2218
01:41:50,864 --> 01:41:53,304
Acau, and Heo Seong Beom.

2219
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:56,833
Here are the preview tiles
for the next round.

2220
01:41:56,833 --> 01:41:58,373
(The tiles for the last Round 8
are revealed.)

2221
01:41:58,373 --> 01:42:03,014
(Tiles for Round 8)

2222
01:42:03,014 --> 01:42:07,514
The tiles for the last round
were all in Acau's favor.

2223
01:42:08,484 --> 01:42:12,014
Whatever tile he'd choose,
he was going to score.

2224
01:42:15,324 --> 01:42:17,953
It was getting tough to win.

2225
01:42:19,224 --> 01:42:21,793
I kept counting the tiles.

2226
01:42:22,093 --> 01:42:24,394
I knew those tiles were left.

2227
01:42:26,364 --> 01:42:28,804
Considering the tiles placed already,

2228
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:30,673
I assumed how many of which tiles...

2229
01:42:30,804 --> 01:42:33,703
were left to be revealed.

2230
01:42:34,144 --> 01:42:36,274
Then,
I figured one of each tile was left...

2231
01:42:36,373 --> 01:42:39,843
and that those tiles would come out later.

2232
01:42:39,913 --> 01:42:42,114
(During his turn in Round 5)

2233
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:45,253
(Instead of a curved road tile
that was to be revealed more later,)

2234
01:42:45,913 --> 01:42:47,423
(he chose another tile first.)

2235
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,184
I'll place it here.

2236
01:42:49,184 --> 01:42:50,953
(He chose another tile first.)

2237
01:42:51,423 --> 01:42:53,293
So when the tiles for the last round
were revealed,

2238
01:42:53,463 --> 01:42:55,694
I wasn't surprised.

2239
01:42:58,064 --> 01:42:59,364
The tiles are too favorable for him.

2240
01:43:02,734 --> 01:43:04,934
Jin Ho, you're up first.

2241
01:43:04,934 --> 01:43:06,173
Please choose a tile.

2242
01:43:06,173 --> 01:43:09,944
(Tiles for Round 7)

2243
01:43:10,043 --> 01:43:11,043
I choose number one.

2244
01:43:11,814 --> 01:43:16,614
I'll complete the land here with it.

2245
01:43:16,953 --> 01:43:18,854
(Hong Jin Ho)

2246
01:43:19,253 --> 01:43:22,024
You have connected 6 road tiles.
That's 6 points for you.

2247
01:43:22,354 --> 01:43:24,593
You have connected 2 land tiles.
That's 4 points for you.

2248
01:43:24,593 --> 01:43:26,253
It's ten points in total.

2249
01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:28,024
Gosh, that's big.

2250
01:43:28,894 --> 01:43:30,133
(Amazed)

2251
01:43:30,694 --> 01:43:31,694
How smart.

2252
01:43:32,033 --> 01:43:34,604
At that time, I was rather relieved...

2253
01:43:34,604 --> 01:43:37,304
because everyone was having...

2254
01:43:37,734 --> 01:43:39,474
the strong need to stop me...

2255
01:43:39,474 --> 01:43:40,974
as I was in the lead of the game.

2256
01:43:41,243 --> 01:43:43,673
I thought someone else
needed to be in the lead...

2257
01:43:44,014 --> 01:43:45,274
for them to focus less on me.

2258
01:43:46,074 --> 01:43:48,184
So, I was rather...

2259
01:43:48,184 --> 01:43:49,583
relieved at that time.

2260
01:43:50,713 --> 01:43:53,354
Next up is Dong Min. Please choose a tile.

2261
01:43:54,123 --> 01:43:55,154
The curved road tile.

2262
01:43:56,293 --> 01:43:58,993
(Acau needs it as well.)

2263
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:02,123
(Hesitating)

2264
01:44:02,123 --> 01:44:03,133
(Jang Dong Min)

2265
01:44:03,133 --> 01:44:05,993
(He uses it to extend his road.)

2266
01:44:06,364 --> 01:44:09,404
Next up is Acau. Please choose a tile.

2267
01:44:09,604 --> 01:44:11,173
I choose number four.

2268
01:44:11,574 --> 01:44:13,304
(Acau)

2269
01:44:13,304 --> 01:44:15,503
(He completes his land
and scores 4 points.)

2270
01:44:15,503 --> 01:44:17,343
You have connected two land tiles.

2271
01:44:17,343 --> 01:44:19,014
That's four points for you.

2272
01:44:19,014 --> 01:44:20,043
(He shares the lead with Jin Ho.)

2273
01:44:20,043 --> 01:44:22,514
Seong Beom, you're up next.
Please choose a tile.

2274
01:44:25,154 --> 01:44:26,253
Well...

2275
01:44:28,324 --> 01:44:29,894
I think it's better to help someone.

2276
01:44:31,423 --> 01:44:33,694
I didn't think it was bad
for Acau to score points.

2277
01:44:34,394 --> 01:44:36,734
(Heo Seong Beom, Acau)

2278
01:44:37,764 --> 01:44:41,463
Well, it's such a shame.

2279
01:44:42,463 --> 01:44:45,033
But his action...

2280
01:44:45,033 --> 01:44:46,474
didn't offend me at all.

2281
01:44:47,043 --> 01:44:50,274
I'd already taken one win,

2282
01:44:50,413 --> 01:44:51,814
and Seong Beom couldn't afford to lose...

2283
01:44:51,814 --> 01:44:54,843
all his chances
to be the final winner himself.

2284
01:44:55,144 --> 01:44:57,783
So of course, I respected his play.

2285
01:44:58,354 --> 01:45:00,524
It was the right decision to make.

2286
01:45:01,953 --> 01:45:03,953
I choose number two, the curved road tile.

2287
01:45:03,953 --> 01:45:04,953
(Next up is Jin Ho,
who is also in the lead.)

2288
01:45:05,324 --> 01:45:06,993
Connect it above that tile.

2289
01:45:06,993 --> 01:45:09,093
(Hong Jin Ho)

2290
01:45:09,364 --> 01:45:12,093
Dong Min, you're up next.
Please choose a tile.

2291
01:45:12,734 --> 01:45:14,604
Acau, please choose a tile.

2292
01:45:15,163 --> 01:45:17,503
(Dong Min is aggressively
after those in the lead.)

2293
01:45:17,503 --> 01:45:19,873
(Jang Dong Min)

2294
01:45:19,873 --> 01:45:22,144
(Acau attempts to be alone in the lead.)

2295
01:45:25,873 --> 01:45:27,343
Acau is good.

2296
01:45:27,343 --> 01:45:28,343
(Acau)

2297
01:45:28,413 --> 01:45:30,354
Round Seven is over.

2298
01:45:30,814 --> 01:45:31,984
The order for Round Eight is...

2299
01:45:32,484 --> 01:45:37,123
Jang Dong Min, Acau,
Heo Seong Beom, and Hong Jin Ho.

2300
01:45:38,524 --> 01:45:40,793
Dong Min, you're up first.
Please choose a tile.

2301
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,194
(Dong Min is the 1st to go in Round 8.)

2302
01:45:42,224 --> 01:45:44,663
Now, you only have two tiles...

2303
01:45:44,663 --> 01:45:45,663
to place each.

2304
01:45:47,434 --> 01:45:48,934
Depending on
whether Dong Min uses the two tiles...

2305
01:45:48,934 --> 01:45:50,804
to score for himself...

2306
01:45:51,173 --> 01:45:53,604
or to stop another player from scoring,

2307
01:45:53,904 --> 01:45:56,274
the winner of this game may be determined.

2308
01:45:57,444 --> 01:45:59,343
(Hesitating)

2309
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:07,524
(If he gives up on scoring for himself,
he can choose whom to win.)

2310
01:46:09,354 --> 01:46:15,463
(The two players in the lead
are tensed up as well.)

2311
01:46:15,694 --> 01:46:18,293
I needed to choose...

2312
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:20,264
between scoring for myself...

2313
01:46:20,904 --> 01:46:22,264
or stopping another player from scoring.

2314
01:46:23,774 --> 01:46:26,503
I thought a wise move was...

2315
01:46:27,543 --> 01:46:30,314
to score for myself in any case.

2316
01:46:32,543 --> 01:46:34,043
I choose number seven.

2317
01:46:34,043 --> 01:46:35,543
(He chooses a tile
after a long consideration.)

2318
01:46:36,953 --> 01:46:38,484
(Instead of stopping another player,
he scores for himself.)

2319
01:46:38,484 --> 01:46:40,253
You have connected six road tiles.

2320
01:46:40,253 --> 01:46:41,583
That's six points for you.

2321
01:46:42,453 --> 01:46:45,024
There were chances that Acau...

2322
01:46:45,354 --> 01:46:48,394
would make a mistake
or place a tile randomly.

2323
01:46:48,423 --> 01:46:51,864
So until the very end, I focused...

2324
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:54,234
on my own play with dedication.

2325
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,434
Acau, you're up next.
Please choose a tile.

2326
01:46:57,434 --> 01:46:58,474
Number two.

2327
01:46:58,474 --> 01:47:02,804
(Acau doesn't make a mistake.)

2328
01:47:05,574 --> 01:47:07,883
(He finally completes the road
worth 7 points.)

2329
01:47:07,883 --> 01:47:09,743
You've connected seven road tiles.

2330
01:47:09,743 --> 01:47:11,253
That's seven points for you.

2331
01:47:11,253 --> 01:47:12,354
(He finally completes the road
worth 7 points.)

2332
01:47:12,354 --> 01:47:14,123
I was sure I'd win this game.

2333
01:47:14,554 --> 01:47:16,953
But in case someone...

2334
01:47:16,953 --> 01:47:19,224
helped another player win,

2335
01:47:19,623 --> 01:47:22,364
I told myself
not to put my guard off until the end...

2336
01:47:22,364 --> 01:47:23,934
and kept a poker face.

2337
01:47:25,793 --> 01:47:27,663
Seong Beom, you're up next.
Please choose a tile.

2338
01:47:27,663 --> 01:47:28,703
(Next up is Heo Seong Beom,
who is currently placed last.)

2339
01:47:28,703 --> 01:47:29,804
I choose number three.

2340
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:36,743
There's no way.

2341
01:47:38,673 --> 01:47:40,883
I'll place it
in between Dong Min's tokens.

2342
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:43,114
(Jang Dong Min)

2343
01:47:43,484 --> 01:47:44,854
I choose number six.

2344
01:47:44,854 --> 01:47:45,854
(Next up is Hong Jin Ho,
who is currently placed 3rd.)

2345
01:47:46,184 --> 01:47:47,783
I'll complete my land.

2346
01:47:47,783 --> 01:47:49,224
(Without giving up, he scores points.)

2347
01:47:49,224 --> 01:47:51,354
And I'll place another token there.

2348
01:47:51,824 --> 01:47:53,724
You've connected two land tiles.

2349
01:47:53,724 --> 01:47:55,593
That's four points for you.

2350
01:47:56,734 --> 01:47:58,694
Dong Min, please choose a tile.

2351
01:47:59,093 --> 01:48:00,203
I choose number one.

2352
01:48:01,533 --> 01:48:02,533
(Jang Dong Min)

2353
01:48:02,533 --> 01:48:04,333
(He scores 6 points.)

2354
01:48:04,333 --> 01:48:06,203
You've connected three land tiles.

2355
01:48:06,203 --> 01:48:07,404
That's six points for you.

2356
01:48:07,404 --> 01:48:08,474
(He now shares the lead with Acau.)

2357
01:48:08,474 --> 01:48:11,144
Acau, please choose a tile.

2358
01:48:12,074 --> 01:48:13,913
(Acau)

2359
01:48:13,913 --> 01:48:15,713
(He scores 4 points with the last tile.)

2360
01:48:15,713 --> 01:48:18,453
You've connected 2 land tiles.
That's 4 points for you.

2361
01:48:18,453 --> 01:48:19,684
Let me give you your token back.

2362
01:48:20,123 --> 01:48:22,083
Seong Beom, you're up next.
Please choose a tile.

2363
01:48:22,453 --> 01:48:23,453
I choose the one on the right.

2364
01:48:25,154 --> 01:48:27,024
I'll place it next to the token up there.

2365
01:48:27,024 --> 01:48:29,724
(Seong Beom completes Dong Min's road.)

2366
01:48:29,934 --> 01:48:32,093
(Bewildered)

2367
01:48:32,463 --> 01:48:33,633
But that connects my road, then.

2368
01:48:34,764 --> 01:48:36,633
You won't be able
to catch up with him even so.

2369
01:48:37,203 --> 01:48:38,833
The moment I was far from placing first,

2370
01:48:38,974 --> 01:48:40,304
I tried to make it neck-and-neck...

2371
01:48:40,304 --> 01:48:42,144
for the other players.

2372
01:48:42,503 --> 01:48:43,574
I was like, "Is he out of his mind?"

2373
01:48:44,814 --> 01:48:46,883
I could've lost because of it.

2374
01:48:46,913 --> 01:48:50,213
It became so close
with a one-point difference.

2375
01:48:50,213 --> 01:48:52,184
It was such ridiculous behavior.

2376
01:48:53,014 --> 01:48:55,253
Dong Min, your road is complete
with three tiles.

2377
01:48:55,253 --> 01:48:56,654
That's three points for you.

2378
01:48:56,793 --> 01:49:00,724
Jin Ho, you're up next.
Please place a tile.

2379
01:49:00,724 --> 01:49:02,123
If you hand it to me, I'll do it myself.

2380
01:49:02,123 --> 01:49:03,894
(Jin Ho is the last to go.)

2381
01:49:06,293 --> 01:49:07,663
The game is over.

2382
01:49:09,104 --> 01:49:11,033
Let me announce the final result.

2383
01:49:12,533 --> 01:49:15,203
Heo Seong Beom, ten points.

2384
01:49:16,203 --> 01:49:18,944
Hong Jin Ho, 24 points.

2385
01:49:19,814 --> 01:49:22,213
Jang Dong Min, 30 points.

2386
01:49:23,283 --> 01:49:25,984
Acau, 31 points.

2387
01:49:26,554 --> 01:49:28,484
The winner of Round Two
for the Final Match...

2388
01:49:28,854 --> 01:49:29,854
is Acau.

2389
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:34,423
(Acau is the winner of Round 2
for the Final Match.)

2390
01:49:34,623 --> 01:49:37,864
A gaming YouTuber is different indeed.

2391
01:49:38,033 --> 01:49:40,434
I actually thought...

2392
01:49:40,434 --> 01:49:42,904
I chased him closely...

2393
01:49:43,264 --> 01:49:44,574
by scoring points little by little,

2394
01:49:46,173 --> 01:49:47,304
so I felt a little bad about the result.

2395
01:49:48,043 --> 01:49:51,444
I could tell
that they were concentrating...

2396
01:49:51,444 --> 01:49:52,614
to perform their skills.

2397
01:49:53,043 --> 01:49:55,184
I might be in danger...

2398
01:49:56,644 --> 01:49:58,383
if I don't put an end
during the next round...

2399
01:49:58,854 --> 01:50:00,953
because I'm physically...

2400
01:50:01,554 --> 01:50:03,354
exhausted right now.

2401
01:50:05,293 --> 01:50:06,453
It was so close.

2402
01:50:07,694 --> 01:50:11,633
Against the legendary figures
in survival shows,

2403
01:50:11,633 --> 01:50:13,404
I placed first...

2404
01:50:14,003 --> 01:50:15,963
in the individual match.

2405
01:50:16,503 --> 01:50:19,304
I felt unexplainably elated.

2406
01:50:19,833 --> 01:50:22,043
I wanted to show what I could do...

2407
01:50:22,173 --> 01:50:24,743
and prove that
I wouldn't always take aid from others.

2408
01:50:25,114 --> 01:50:27,913
I managed to do it through this chance.

2409
01:50:28,444 --> 01:50:30,984
Acau, you will be given
the two middle numbers...

2410
01:50:30,984 --> 01:50:32,854
of the passcode.

2411
01:50:33,524 --> 01:50:34,923
Please go and take the numbers...

2412
01:50:34,923 --> 01:50:36,354
from the butler immediately.

2413
01:50:38,694 --> 01:50:39,724
Do I take a look at it now?

2414
01:50:40,824 --> 01:50:44,764
(Acau checks the two middle numbers.)

2415
01:50:47,203 --> 01:50:48,203
I believe...

2416
01:50:49,234 --> 01:50:51,304
I'll be able to take the final win...

2417
01:50:51,774 --> 01:50:53,974
if I'm lucky with the last game.

2418
01:51:14,623 --> 01:51:15,663
Seong Beom.

2419
01:51:16,663 --> 01:51:18,764
Either one of us should win this time...

2420
01:51:18,764 --> 01:51:19,764
so that it turns into a nightmare.

2421
01:51:19,764 --> 01:51:20,764
Let's do that.

2422
01:51:21,533 --> 01:51:23,033
Let's take it to the end.

2423
01:51:23,974 --> 01:51:25,234
Jin Ho, good luck.

2424
01:51:25,673 --> 01:51:26,774
Let's do this.

2425
01:51:29,774 --> 01:51:32,213
All the players...

2426
01:51:32,213 --> 01:51:34,043
have become sharp and serious.

2427
01:51:34,043 --> 01:51:36,783
Why? Acau and I took a win each,

2428
01:51:36,883 --> 01:51:40,684
but if Jin Ho and Seong Beom
fail to win this time,

2429
01:51:40,753 --> 01:51:44,253
their chances will be completely gone.

2430
01:51:44,253 --> 01:51:46,793
All four players
might give all their might...

2431
01:51:46,793 --> 01:51:48,394
for this round.

2432
01:51:55,703 --> 01:51:57,673
For Round Three of the Final Match,
you will play...

2433
01:52:03,203 --> 01:52:05,574
Mix and Match.

2434
01:52:06,274 --> 01:52:09,283
In this game, you have to combine
the yellow lines...

2435
01:52:09,413 --> 01:52:12,283
that are revealed at different seconds...

2436
01:52:12,283 --> 01:52:15,123
and add the assumed given numbers
correctly.

2437
01:52:16,383 --> 01:52:18,093
The game has a total of five rounds.

2438
01:52:18,554 --> 01:52:22,224
In each round,
you'll be given yellow lines...

2439
01:52:22,493 --> 01:52:24,963
drawn at different locations...

2440
01:52:24,963 --> 01:52:26,734
once every 3 seconds
for a total of 6 times.

2441
01:52:27,934 --> 01:52:30,533
Each given number has two digits at most.

2442
01:52:31,104 --> 01:52:34,944
The yellow lines shown
for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th times...

2443
01:52:34,944 --> 01:52:36,474
make up one same number,

2444
01:52:37,043 --> 01:52:40,944
and the yellow lines shown
for the 2nd, 4th, and 6th times...

2445
01:52:40,944 --> 01:52:42,484
make up another same number.

2446
01:52:43,713 --> 01:52:45,953
The players must look
at the yellow lines...

2447
01:52:45,953 --> 01:52:47,684
that are shown in a row...

2448
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:50,554
and assume the given numbers...

2449
01:52:50,554 --> 01:52:51,623
by overlapping the lines
shown for the even and odd times.

2450
01:52:52,423 --> 01:52:54,694
If any player is done
coming up with both the numbers,

2451
01:52:54,894 --> 01:52:56,024
he must shout for a chance...

2452
01:52:56,264 --> 01:52:58,064
and say the sum of the two numbers.

2453
01:52:58,734 --> 01:53:00,804
If it's correct, he will gain a point.

2454
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:03,333
If it's incorrect, he won't be allowed...

2455
01:53:03,604 --> 01:53:05,934
to make a guess for ten seconds.

2456
01:53:06,873 --> 01:53:08,203
After all five rounds,

2457
01:53:08,343 --> 01:53:11,373
whoever has the highest score
will be the winner.

2458
01:53:14,343 --> 01:53:17,014
I thought I had a high chance
because I was good with numbers.

2459
01:53:17,014 --> 01:53:20,623
Seong Beom had been very strong
in terms of numbers,

2460
01:53:20,623 --> 01:53:23,324
so I expected he'd do well on this...

2461
01:53:23,324 --> 01:53:24,894
and that it could be a little tricky
for Dong Min.

2462
01:53:28,364 --> 01:53:30,123
I had no choice
but to win this game no matter what.

2463
01:53:30,123 --> 01:53:32,293
I needed to take the finals
to an extended game.

2464
01:53:32,293 --> 01:53:34,404
Analog numbers are said
to be seven-digit numbers.

2465
01:53:34,404 --> 01:53:38,033
In the given questions,
the digits would be split in half.

2466
01:53:38,033 --> 01:53:39,934
Even so, it'd mean one complete digit...

2467
01:53:39,934 --> 01:53:41,644
if a half was colored.

2468
01:53:41,644 --> 01:53:44,574
If the left side was colored,
it might be one.

2469
01:53:44,574 --> 01:53:46,913
If the right side was colored,
it might be 4 or 8.

2470
01:53:46,913 --> 01:53:48,583
I had such cases in mind...

2471
01:53:48,583 --> 01:53:52,413
and focused on checking
which digits were colored.

2472
01:53:52,413 --> 01:53:54,623
I was determined
to win this game for sure.

2473
01:53:56,524 --> 01:53:59,024
Let me reveal the question for Round One.

2474
01:53:59,194 --> 01:54:00,194
Okay.

2475
01:54:23,543 --> 01:54:30,824
(Round 1)

2476
01:55:06,024 --> 01:55:07,024
I'll answer.

2477
01:55:08,394 --> 01:55:09,593
Go ahead.

2478
01:55:16,203 --> 01:55:17,434
It's 119.

2479
01:55:21,243 --> 01:55:22,543
Jang Dong Min,

2480
01:55:24,673 --> 01:55:25,873
you are correct.

2481
01:55:25,873 --> 01:55:27,213
You have earned one point.

2482
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:33,283
Is this right? There's this much
difference in our skills?

2483
01:55:36,224 --> 01:55:37,894
When I read the others' faces,

2484
01:55:37,894 --> 01:55:41,024
It seemed like they were trying to
make numbers...

2485
01:55:41,024 --> 01:55:44,093
based on the combination of
the colored lines.

2486
01:55:44,364 --> 01:55:46,663
But I did the opposite.

2487
01:55:46,663 --> 01:55:49,234
I thought
I should think of this in reverse.

2488
01:55:49,404 --> 01:55:50,734
The lines that didn't light up.

2489
01:55:51,533 --> 01:55:54,003
I thought I should go with...

2490
01:55:54,003 --> 01:55:57,274
the combination of lines that were empty
to form numbers.

2491
01:55:57,444 --> 01:55:59,944
If there are no lines here and here,
it would be a two.

2492
01:56:00,274 --> 01:56:02,413
If there are no lines here and here,
it would be a five.

2493
01:56:03,043 --> 01:56:07,383
If only this line is here
and the rest is empty, it's a one.

2494
01:56:07,953 --> 01:56:11,394
And if everything lights up
except the middle, it's a zero.

2495
01:56:11,923 --> 01:56:15,993
I could picture all of these combinations.

2496
01:56:16,024 --> 01:56:18,564
So from 0 to 9,

2497
01:56:18,564 --> 01:56:21,333
I made a quick call
on which number it was...

2498
01:56:21,333 --> 01:56:23,104
when certain lines were missing.

2499
01:56:32,514 --> 01:56:35,184
I will reveal the questions
for the next round.

2500
01:56:36,243 --> 01:56:44,194
(Round 2)

2501
01:57:04,213 --> 01:57:06,543
I had to say the sum of the two numbers,

2502
01:57:06,673 --> 01:57:08,984
but they showed each number 1 by 1.

2503
01:57:08,984 --> 01:57:11,913
So, whenever they showed a number,
I counted with my left hand...

2504
01:57:12,014 --> 01:57:14,783
and my right hand, one after the other.

2505
01:57:22,593 --> 01:57:27,093
(Seong Beom also uses his hands
to memorize, just like Dong Min.)

2506
01:57:34,043 --> 01:57:35,043
I'll answer.

2507
01:57:36,243 --> 01:57:38,074
Heo Seong Beom, go ahead.

2508
01:57:48,423 --> 01:57:49,753
I'll go with 97.

2509
01:57:53,623 --> 01:57:54,963
Heo Seong Beom,

2510
01:57:56,093 --> 01:57:57,123
you are incorrect.

2511
01:57:57,123 --> 01:57:59,793
You cannot answer for ten seconds.

2512
01:58:02,364 --> 01:58:03,404
I'll answer.

2513
01:58:04,033 --> 01:58:05,904
Jang Dong Min, go ahead.

2514
01:58:08,304 --> 01:58:09,404
It's 79.

2515
01:58:13,213 --> 01:58:14,413
Jang Dong Min,

2516
01:58:15,713 --> 01:58:16,743
you are incorrect.

2517
01:58:16,743 --> 01:58:18,583
You cannot answer for ten seconds.

2518
01:58:18,753 --> 01:58:19,753
I'll answer.

2519
01:58:20,114 --> 01:58:21,654
Acau, go ahead.

2520
01:58:21,654 --> 01:58:22,654
It's 56.

2521
01:58:24,194 --> 01:58:26,154
Acau, you are incorrect.

2522
01:58:26,154 --> 01:58:28,293
You cannot answer for ten seconds.

2523
01:58:30,163 --> 01:58:31,163
I'll answer.

2524
01:58:31,793 --> 01:58:33,033
Go ahead.

2525
01:58:38,373 --> 01:58:39,503
It's 71.

2526
01:58:41,974 --> 01:58:43,203
Jang Dong Min,

2527
01:58:44,514 --> 01:58:47,014
you are correct.
You have earned one point.

2528
01:58:48,343 --> 01:58:49,383
No way.

2529
01:58:52,383 --> 01:58:56,184
When I got it wrong,
I was sure it was either 8 or 0.

2530
01:58:56,354 --> 01:58:58,194
So, unless someone else got it right
within ten seconds,

2531
01:58:58,194 --> 01:59:01,123
I was sure I could get the answer
after my ten seconds were over.

2532
01:59:08,963 --> 01:59:10,033
What's up with that guy?

2533
01:59:10,264 --> 01:59:11,673
Even before I have time to think,

2534
01:59:11,673 --> 01:59:14,304
he keeps saying, "I'll answer."

2535
01:59:14,304 --> 01:59:16,673
It kept shaking me up mentally.

2536
01:59:16,673 --> 01:59:17,814
It made me rush.

2537
01:59:17,814 --> 01:59:20,843
But I couldn't let Dong Min get
everything right.

2538
01:59:21,213 --> 01:59:23,984
The leader of the enemy is on a rampage.

2539
01:59:24,213 --> 01:59:25,684
Seeing Dong Min charging ahead,

2540
01:59:25,684 --> 01:59:28,324
I started to lose my cool.

2541
01:59:28,583 --> 01:59:30,524
I thought I had seen the correct numbers,

2542
01:59:30,524 --> 01:59:32,093
but that wasn't the right answer.

2543
01:59:32,093 --> 01:59:35,324
Still, I couldn't let him
really keep charging ahead.

2544
01:59:35,423 --> 01:59:36,663
I thought this was my last chance.

2545
01:59:36,663 --> 01:59:39,694
(If Jang Dong Min answers correctly
in Round 3, the game is over.)

2546
01:59:43,203 --> 01:59:46,304
I will reveal the questions
for the next round.

2547
01:59:46,474 --> 01:59:47,644
Let's get this right.

2548
02:00:03,993 --> 02:00:05,123
Gosh, what is this?

2549
02:00:12,694 --> 02:00:19,404
(Round 3)

2550
02:01:14,564 --> 02:01:15,623
I'll answer.

2551
02:01:16,724 --> 02:01:18,963
Jang Dong Min, please go ahead.

2552
02:01:24,503 --> 02:01:25,533
It's 99.

2553
02:01:41,484 --> 02:01:42,654
Jang Dong Min,

2554
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:45,154
you are correct.

2555
02:01:46,354 --> 02:01:47,894
This is insane.

2556
02:01:51,434 --> 02:01:56,333
(Jang Dong Min earns 3 points on his own.)

2557
02:02:10,043 --> 02:02:13,854
Out of 5 questions total,
Jang Dong Min answered 3 correctly.

2558
02:02:13,854 --> 02:02:16,123
Mix and Match is now over.

2559
02:02:23,224 --> 02:02:24,894
We were robbed with our eyes wide open.

2560
02:02:27,864 --> 02:02:28,934
My gosh.

2561
02:02:30,633 --> 02:02:32,633
Gosh, that was insane. This was...

2562
02:02:33,774 --> 02:02:36,104
Round Three was almost baffling.

2563
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:39,673
It ended with
Dong Min winning by a landslide.

2564
02:02:39,974 --> 02:02:43,083
I think I just acknowledged defeat...

2565
02:02:43,484 --> 02:02:45,484
because he dominated the game so well.

2566
02:02:45,814 --> 02:02:47,783
It's right that he wins this.

2567
02:02:48,484 --> 02:02:49,724
He should win, then.

2568
02:02:50,423 --> 02:02:53,093
- Hey, indeed. Great job, Dong Min.
- My goodness.

2569
02:02:53,554 --> 02:02:54,564
Thanks.

2570
02:02:54,724 --> 02:02:56,623
That was insane just now.

2571
02:02:57,764 --> 02:02:58,864
My goodness.

2572
02:03:00,864 --> 02:03:02,934
All games are now over.

2573
02:03:05,173 --> 02:03:07,003
Gosh, everyone worked so hard.

2574
02:03:19,283 --> 02:03:21,783
In 1st place
for Round 3 of the Final Match,

2575
02:03:22,984 --> 02:03:24,824
it's Jang Dong Min.

2576
02:03:28,224 --> 02:03:30,793
Dong Min has been doing well
this whole time,

2577
02:03:30,793 --> 02:03:33,663
and he won easily. I think
I could admit defeat because of it.

2578
02:03:34,434 --> 02:03:36,404
If I can't win,

2579
02:03:36,564 --> 02:03:38,274
I hoped Dong Min would win instead.

2580
02:03:38,274 --> 02:03:39,934
Of course I'm sad that I didn't win,

2581
02:03:39,934 --> 02:03:41,304
but since Dong Min won,

2582
02:03:41,304 --> 02:03:45,173
I think the game ended in a way
that feels good.

2583
02:03:45,173 --> 02:03:46,574
I admit he did really well this time.

2584
02:03:46,574 --> 02:03:49,014
He showed us his charisma as the winner.

2585
02:03:49,383 --> 02:03:51,114
He did well. I admit it.

2586
02:03:51,783 --> 02:03:56,154
Jang Dong Min, the final two digits
of the passcode will be revealed.

2587
02:03:56,154 --> 02:03:57,854
(Passcode)

2588
02:03:58,024 --> 02:04:00,923
Receive the passcode from the butler
right away...

2589
02:04:01,224 --> 02:04:04,434
and take your prize money
of 100,000 dollars from the safe.

2590
02:04:10,734 --> 02:04:13,633
I saw a lot of people say that...

2591
02:04:13,633 --> 02:04:15,373
I couldn't do much because I was old now.

2592
02:04:16,304 --> 02:04:17,304
Seriously,

2593
02:04:19,873 --> 02:04:20,944
to me,

2594
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:23,583
age was just a number.

2595
02:04:30,154 --> 02:04:35,993
(Passcode)

2596
02:04:55,213 --> 02:04:57,043
Jang Dong Min!

2597
02:04:57,043 --> 02:05:01,724
(Bloody Game 3's final winner,
Jang Dong Min)

2598
02:05:04,024 --> 02:05:05,654
Bring it on, you punks!

2599
02:05:09,593 --> 02:05:11,194
Great job, everyone!

2600
02:05:12,394 --> 02:05:14,633
- Gosh, great work, guys.
- Great job.

2601
02:05:15,463 --> 02:05:17,533
- Hey, good work.
- Hey.

2602
02:05:18,873 --> 02:05:20,074
Congratulations, Dong Min.

2603
02:05:20,074 --> 02:05:21,404
Gosh, you did great.

2604
02:05:21,543 --> 02:05:23,304
I totally admit defeat.

2605
02:05:23,774 --> 02:05:25,913
Without any luck or tricks,

2606
02:05:25,913 --> 02:05:28,283
we all played our best.

2607
02:05:28,314 --> 02:05:29,883
Am I sad that I didn't win?

2608
02:05:31,283 --> 02:05:32,713
Sure, I am.

2609
02:05:32,753 --> 02:05:36,354
But I'm sure I'll remember this time
as when I worked harder than ever...

2610
02:05:36,354 --> 02:05:38,724
and used myself as fuel for the fire
to make things brighter.

2611
02:05:38,724 --> 02:05:42,993
(With brains and passion,)

2612
02:05:43,024 --> 02:05:48,934
(he led strategies with enthusiasm.)

2613
02:05:48,963 --> 02:05:54,133
(In the center of an alliance,
Seong Beom was always there.)

2614
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:56,604
I still remember the Ghost Casino so much.

2615
02:05:56,604 --> 02:05:58,144
Everyone was in bad conditions.

2616
02:05:58,274 --> 02:06:00,644
We didn't sleep well
and were sweating bullets.

2617
02:06:00,644 --> 02:06:03,014
We were in the scorching sun
and were in terrible condition.

2618
02:06:03,014 --> 02:06:05,184
In the middle of all that,
we were trying to make some money...

2619
02:06:05,184 --> 02:06:08,253
by going into that smelly
and dingy Ghost Casino and playing games.

2620
02:06:08,453 --> 02:06:10,623
At first, the game didn't go our way.

2621
02:06:10,623 --> 02:06:12,024
There, we got it.

2622
02:06:12,024 --> 02:06:14,293
The radius of the Earth is 6,400km.

2623
02:06:14,293 --> 02:06:16,894
But succeeding as if we hit the jackpot...

2624
02:06:17,024 --> 02:06:18,033
Correct.

2625
02:06:20,293 --> 02:06:22,533
We were cheering
and jumping around together.

2626
02:06:24,934 --> 02:06:27,944
We overcame the harsh loss
of losing Paradise,

2627
02:06:28,003 --> 02:06:31,243
and we won several games in a row.

2628
02:06:31,274 --> 02:06:33,814
I think that's what I remember a lot.

2629
02:06:34,014 --> 02:06:35,043
Dong Min.

2630
02:06:35,213 --> 02:06:38,484
In ten years,
I will return as a sharp spear...

2631
02:06:38,484 --> 02:06:40,984
that can beat you.

2632
02:06:40,984 --> 02:06:42,054
Please wait for me.

2633
02:06:44,894 --> 02:06:46,024
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2634
02:06:46,154 --> 02:06:47,354
I had so much fun this time.

2635
02:06:48,824 --> 02:06:50,764
In a way, in Bloody Game,

2636
02:06:50,764 --> 02:06:53,793
I was able to make precious memories...

2637
02:06:53,793 --> 02:06:55,934
that I never had before.

2638
02:06:55,934 --> 02:06:57,703
I'm so grateful for that.

2639
02:06:57,734 --> 02:07:00,873
Actually, the hardest moment
while coming to the Finals was...

2640
02:07:00,873 --> 02:07:02,104
the Remaining.

2641
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:04,074
Can the environment get
any worse than this?

2642
02:07:04,304 --> 02:07:05,843
There's a puddle of water nearby,

2643
02:07:06,144 --> 02:07:07,444
there are bugs,

2644
02:07:07,843 --> 02:07:09,383
and there's so much dust.

2645
02:07:09,383 --> 02:07:12,014
And it hadn't been long
since I joined this team,

2646
02:07:12,154 --> 02:07:15,324
so I moved around a lot
thinking that I shouldn't sit still.

2647
02:07:15,324 --> 02:07:17,753
So, it was hard on me physically too.

2648
02:07:17,753 --> 02:07:20,194
(As soon as he went from
the Mansion to Paradise...)

2649
02:07:20,324 --> 02:07:23,864
The players who are after the symbol
of Paradise are starting a raid.

2650
02:07:24,194 --> 02:07:27,564
(They faced a raid.)

2651
02:07:27,593 --> 02:07:32,833
(In a day, he went from Mansion
to Paradise, and again to Remaining.)

2652
02:07:32,934 --> 02:07:35,673
(Since he joined the team late,)

2653
02:07:35,703 --> 02:07:43,083
(he had to work hard to assimilate
to the team.)

2654
02:07:45,883 --> 02:07:49,354
But I came to the finals,

2655
02:07:49,383 --> 02:07:51,194
and I won a game.

2656
02:07:51,194 --> 02:07:52,623
And in the eight-person individual match,

2657
02:07:52,623 --> 02:07:55,463
I went up against
the legends of survival games...

2658
02:07:55,463 --> 02:07:57,194
and won the game. That itself...

2659
02:07:58,364 --> 02:08:01,663
is such a grateful experience,
and I feel great about it.

2660
02:08:01,734 --> 02:08:04,364
The whole time I played the game,
things were hard but I had so much fun.

2661
02:08:04,503 --> 02:08:08,203
So, if there's another survival game
like this in the future,

2662
02:08:08,304 --> 02:08:10,003
I want to participate again...

2663
02:08:10,003 --> 02:08:13,074
and go for a good result then.

2664
02:08:13,614 --> 02:08:15,114
- Gosh, seriously.
- Great work.

2665
02:08:15,144 --> 02:08:16,314
You're good, indeed.

2666
02:08:16,883 --> 02:08:18,354
We made the best memories.

2667
02:08:18,484 --> 02:08:21,324
I feel relieved but also sad.

2668
02:08:21,324 --> 02:08:23,453
Honestly, and personally,

2669
02:08:23,484 --> 02:08:24,993
during this Bloody Game,

2670
02:08:24,993 --> 02:08:27,593
I went through more emotional struggles
than usual.

2671
02:08:27,793 --> 02:08:29,463
I came in last place from the beginning...

2672
02:08:29,463 --> 02:08:31,493
and was dragged
to the Deathmatch right away.

2673
02:08:32,493 --> 02:08:33,593
I became a spy.

2674
02:08:33,894 --> 02:08:35,133
Gosh, darn it.

2675
02:08:35,133 --> 02:08:36,703
And as I went on from there,

2676
02:08:36,703 --> 02:08:39,333
it became something like
Team Dong Min versus Team Hong Jin Ho.

2677
02:08:39,633 --> 02:08:41,033
But our team fell apart.

2678
02:08:42,104 --> 02:08:44,373
I think the situation was too complicated.

2679
02:08:44,444 --> 02:08:46,543
I was very disappointed
with my performance,

2680
02:08:46,543 --> 02:08:49,083
and I personally didn't get to show
what I could do.

2681
02:08:49,083 --> 02:08:51,383
So, I am a little sad about that,

2682
02:08:51,383 --> 02:08:52,583
but I totally admit defeat.

2683
02:08:52,713 --> 02:08:54,923
More than I thought, Dong Min was...

2684
02:08:54,923 --> 02:08:59,224
even better than my expectations.
I really saw that.

2685
02:08:59,453 --> 02:09:03,093
And I thought, "This is what
a survival winner is all about."

2686
02:09:03,093 --> 02:09:06,293
I think he really showed people that,
so I thought he was very cool.

2687
02:09:06,593 --> 02:09:09,203
One shocking thing was
when I was betrayed by Yurisa.

2688
02:09:09,503 --> 02:09:10,904
She was crying so much,

2689
02:09:11,234 --> 02:09:13,234
and she had snot running down her face.

2690
02:09:13,234 --> 02:09:15,003
So, I thought she was so sincere.

2691
02:09:15,003 --> 02:09:16,274
I thought,
"She must be having a really hard time,"

2692
02:09:16,274 --> 02:09:17,543
and suggested she join us.

2693
02:09:17,743 --> 02:09:21,213
But those tears were a lie,
and it was a betrayal.

2694
02:09:21,283 --> 02:09:23,644
I think that stayed with me
and was a huge shock.

2695
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:28,354
What I felt as I was a pro gamer
for over ten years is...

2696
02:09:28,854 --> 02:09:32,394
that you can't be satisfied
with every outcome of every game.

2697
02:09:32,724 --> 02:09:34,423
There are seasons where I'm ruined.

2698
02:09:34,423 --> 02:09:36,293
And there are seasons where I do well.

2699
02:09:36,463 --> 02:09:38,694
I do feel sad about a lot of things,
but I'm still satisfied.

2700
02:09:38,694 --> 02:09:40,764
Dong Min did a great job and won,

2701
02:09:40,894 --> 02:09:43,163
so I should congratulate him this time.

2702
02:09:43,304 --> 02:09:46,833
That's what I got from
the fun experience of Bloody Game 3.

2703
02:09:47,774 --> 02:09:49,843
Gosh, you all worked so hard, everyone.

2704
02:09:51,673 --> 02:09:54,583
It was ten years ago
when I first appeared...

2705
02:09:54,583 --> 02:09:55,814
on a survival game like this.

2706
02:09:56,343 --> 02:10:00,154
Even now, after ten years,

2707
02:10:00,213 --> 02:10:02,253
I won again.

2708
02:10:02,253 --> 02:10:05,224
That really feels great.

2709
02:10:05,324 --> 02:10:07,753
I think I proved that I was alive,

2710
02:10:07,753 --> 02:10:09,163
so I'm very happy.

2711
02:10:09,364 --> 02:10:12,963
But I don't think that I won
because I'm smarter...

2712
02:10:12,963 --> 02:10:15,934
or more skilled than the other players.

2713
02:10:16,104 --> 02:10:21,904
The competitive drive to understand,
dig deep into, and conquer...

2714
02:10:21,904 --> 02:10:22,974
these survival games.

2715
02:10:23,404 --> 02:10:25,274
That will. I think...

2716
02:10:25,274 --> 02:10:28,243
that's what I had more of
compared to the other players.

2717
02:10:28,614 --> 02:10:31,654
(Even before the first game
started in earnest,)

2718
02:10:31,654 --> 02:10:34,953
(he predicted several number of cases...)

2719
02:10:34,953 --> 02:10:37,654
(and solved questions
at a surprising speed.)

2720
02:10:37,654 --> 02:10:43,593
(Also, he burned money and sacks
without settling.)

2721
02:10:43,593 --> 02:10:47,434
(Jang Dong Min showed off
a different start compared to others.)

2722
02:10:47,463 --> 02:10:55,404
(He came up with strategies that caught
everyone off guard for every game.)

2723
02:10:55,644 --> 02:11:00,974
(He constantly looked for the big picture
to control the flow of the game.)

2724
02:11:00,974 --> 02:11:06,453
(From a seed of doubt
to shake up the opposing alliance...)

2725
02:11:06,514 --> 02:11:10,583
(to a spy strategy that maximized
their team members' strengths,)

2726
02:11:10,623 --> 02:11:18,394
(Jang Dong Min played the game with
the mindset of survival, 100 percent.)

2727
02:11:18,663 --> 02:11:19,993
From the perspective of a player,

2728
02:11:19,993 --> 02:11:22,503
there were so many hardships
and difficult situations.

2729
02:11:22,703 --> 02:11:24,133
In terms of difficulty,

2730
02:11:24,234 --> 02:11:27,904
it was harder than my 26 months
of military service.

2731
02:11:28,173 --> 02:11:30,843
In terms of how nerve-racking
and heart-pounding it was,

2732
02:11:31,043 --> 02:11:34,984
it was the most heart-pounding
out of all of the survival shows...

2733
02:11:35,184 --> 02:11:37,184
I've been on before.

2734
02:11:37,213 --> 02:11:40,913
The incident I remember the most...

2735
02:11:41,014 --> 02:11:42,184
was the day of the raid.

2736
02:11:42,184 --> 02:11:45,453
I set up our camp for 3 days and 2 nights,

2737
02:11:46,894 --> 02:11:47,894
but my goodness...

2738
02:11:48,524 --> 02:11:49,623
They used a nuclear weapon.

2739
02:11:50,364 --> 02:11:51,364
Hey!

2740
02:11:51,364 --> 02:11:53,163
Those darned jerks.

2741
02:11:53,434 --> 02:11:54,764
If it hadn't been for that incident,

2742
02:11:54,764 --> 02:11:58,934
I think it might have been hard
for me to win.

2743
02:11:59,003 --> 02:12:00,633
Because of that incident,

2744
02:12:00,904 --> 02:12:04,944
I prepared even more meticulously
for every game.

2745
02:12:05,213 --> 02:12:06,673
You messed with the wrong man.

2746
02:12:06,913 --> 02:12:10,484
And it became a chance
to think about every possibility.

2747
02:12:11,354 --> 02:12:12,854
If I can survive...

2748
02:12:13,114 --> 02:12:15,883
with my skills and win with my skills...

2749
02:12:16,583 --> 02:12:18,423
in the next survival show,

2750
02:12:19,793 --> 02:12:21,123
I'll go wherever it is.

2751
02:12:21,293 --> 02:12:23,024
The next season's players,

2752
02:12:24,024 --> 02:12:26,033
be prepared.
