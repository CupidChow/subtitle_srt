1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,540
Can you pass me the rule book?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,609
To cover it?

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,040
- Yes, let's cover here too.
- Good idea.

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,980
- It won't fit in.
- It won't go in.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,449
Or...

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,050
how about this?

7
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,220
Or push this inside.

8
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,260
Let's cover the bottom technically.

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,519
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,129
That's way too simple and ignorant.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,429
Seriously, that's way too intuitive.

12
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,699
That's one-dimensional.

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,600
Let's first place the long one here.

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,739
Hide it.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,340
Where did he go?

16
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,310
- Where did he go again?
- Did he go to the restroom?

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,780
Maybe.

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,579
This is...

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,649
Why is the door open so wide?

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,750
- Is it open?
- What?

21
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,789
- Why is it open wide?
- You're right.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,820
- It wasn't open before.
- I think he went out.

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,090
- What?
- He left.

24
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,560
Acau.

25
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,070
Acau. Are you in here?

26
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,140
- Acau isn't here.
- I know.

27
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,900
You need to come out.

28
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,209
What on earth is going on?

29
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,750
Where did he go?

30
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,319
Where did he go?

31
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,599
Gosh, seriously.

32
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:32,260
Gosh.

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,200
- The basement is open.
- You're right.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,469
He left...

35
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,569
This is insane.

36
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,640
(15 minutes ago)

37
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:40,969
What is this?

38
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,540
(Players of Paradise sneaked
into the Mansion.)

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,609
Is this the door?

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,510
I heard the noise outside.

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,790
What?

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,959
Don't look at him.

43
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,359
Don't look at him.

44
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,930
Who are you?

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,959
- Let's talk.
- What?

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,900
- Do you want to talk?
- Sure.

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,669
- Wait. What's your name?
- Acau.

48
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,400
- The YouTuber.
- I see.

49
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,909
- Today...
- You know me, right?

50
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:15,909
Yes.

51
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,039
Didn't we agree to meet today?

52
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,379
We agreed to meet?

53
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:23,280
(Acau is the winner
of the Money Challenge in the Mansion.)

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,050
You can open the Pandora's Box.

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,389
(He opened the Pandora's Box
in the Mansion.)

56
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,729
(Rules of Pandora's Box)

57
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,469
(Elimination Exemption Card,
Survival Ground Change)

58
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,729
"When you open the Pandora's Box,"

59
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,069
"choose to keep or change
the survival ground and stamp it."

60
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,169
"You must choose
before leaving the voting room."

61
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,569
"Put your choice back in the box..."

62
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,840
"and lock the box with Pandora's Key."

63
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,379
(Kidnapping)

64
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,150
(If Team Mansion decides to change
the survival ground,)

65
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,379
(only he will be kidnapped.)

66
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,650
(If Team Mansion decides to keep
the survival ground,)

67
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,919
(1 person except him will be kidnapped.)

68
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,979
Good.

69
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,849
Bad?

70
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,759
The survival ground change might
benefit me big time.

71
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,289
Or I might stay.

72
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,530
I thought it'd be a bad idea
to change the survival ground.

73
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,699
If I decided to change it,

74
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:13,400
I might end up in the wild.

75
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,900
I have to win.

76
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,610
But...

77
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,939
I can never refuse this dopamine.

78
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,009
Is it dopamine or victory?

79
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,909
Shoot, this is darn hard.

80
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,689
I'm very influential in the Mansion.

81
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,819
Should I keep playing safe?

82
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,830
Or choose the fun?

83
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,800
Gosh.

84
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,569
(Survival Ground Change)

85
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,439
I chose to change the survival ground.

86
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,900
Instead of playing safe,

87
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,340
I wanted to enjoy the thrill
of the survival.

88
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,810
So I chose to change it.

89
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,939
After choosing to change
the survival ground,

90
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,250
there was no additional information.

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,349
It was hard to expect the details.

92
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,979
It almost drove me crazy.

93
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,719
I didn't know where I should be...

94
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,120
or when they were coming.

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
A guilty conscience needs no accuser.

96
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,990
I kept visiting the basement...

97
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,730
like 20 times.

98
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,899
Are people upstairs suspecting visitors?

99
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,240
- Can other casts come down here?
- Yes.

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,569
- Then let's move.
- Let's talk somewhere else.

101
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,569
Okay. Shush.

102
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,870
- Let's go over there.
- Come on.

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,350
(Team Paradise starts moving with Acau.)

104
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,250
We're doomed. Wait.

105
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,189
Hey, Acau's gone.

106
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,459
- Hurry up and go down.
- Acau's gone.

107
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,829
- What?
- Acau's gone.

108
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,860
Acau's gone.

109
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,329
- Shoot.
- Head to the basement.

110
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,560
It's all open.

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,329
I knew it.

112
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,870
- Acau's gone.
- Guard the front.

113
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,970
Okay.

114
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,339
Acau.

115
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,310
Gosh, he backstabbed us.

116
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,639
He backstabbed us.

117
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,050
- He backstabbed us.
- I knew it.

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,850
Gosh.

119
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,560
We're doomed.

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,889
What's going to happen?

121
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,129
(Remaining)

122
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,430
"Set off to Paradise now."

123
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:28,730
Let's go.

124
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,470
We must recapture it.
Let's recapture it in the shortest time.

125
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:32,699
Let's kill them all.

126
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,839
I can't wait to take a shower in Paradise.

127
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,339
I can't be here again.

128
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,550
Bye.

129
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,980
Let's never come back here.

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,790
I won't.

131
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,819
I'll never come back.

132
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,759
Never.

133
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,290
We must retrieve it no matter what.

134
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,399
I'll seize Paradise at all costs,
even if I have to smash everything.

135
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,269
We're the ones to win anyway.

136
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,470
We have sledgehammers and pipes.
We can never lose.

137
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,110
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

138
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm never coming back here.

139
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,610
We'll succeed in raiding today.

140
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,279
We're heading to Paradise.

141
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:21,110
(2 days ago)

142
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,879
The Deathmatch results will be announced.

143

(The loser of the Deathmatch,
Kim Young Kwang)

144
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,050
You must leave.

145
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,060
(The deepest place...)

146
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,259
(below the Paradise)

147
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,189

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,170
Do I go up?

150
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,899
Do I stay here instead of going home?

151
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,209
Yes?

152
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,180
(The door is locked.)

153
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,350
What's going on? This is bad.

154
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,190
I didn't see this coming.

155
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,529
What's happening?

156
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,000
I thought I was going home.

157
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,669
But I was sent to the Underground Prison.
I didn't expect that.

158
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,769
Am I staying here until I go home?

159
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,139
But if I'm locked up,

160
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,309
maybe I have a chance to survive.

161
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,980
Gosh.

162
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,690
(Basic Rules

163
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,360
Continue surviving in here?

164
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,690
Alone?

165
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,360
Without anything?

166
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,559
Whatever. I'm going to sleep.

167
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,399
There's no blanket.

168
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:33,509
(Next day)

(Flinching)

Hey.

171
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,250
- Where are you going?
- Hello.

172
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,250
Where are you going?

173
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,309
What?

174
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,179
Is this...

175
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,149
Hey.

176
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,529
Why is he still here?

177
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,870
The familiar wooden box.

178
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,799
It's the supply box in Bloody Game.

179
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,909
He had that.

180
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Gosh.

181
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,639
Let's empty the Underground Prison first.

182
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,309
Yes.

183
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,580
(Before the raid)

184
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,480
- This is our map.
- Yes.

185
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,779
There's an Underground Prison.

186
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,389
Let's go to the Underground Prison...

187
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,049
and release the prisoners first?

188
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,620
Yes, I was thinking about that.

189
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,429
We were told about
the Underground Prison in Paradise.

190
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,029
It's war.

191
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,000
We should bring POWs...

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,559
and use them as mercenaries.

193
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,570
It sounded plausible and cool.

194
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,639
Down here.

195
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,029
(Do not approach.)

196
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,759
(Entering the Underground Prison)

197
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,000
(Do not approach.)

198
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,320
Check this out.

199
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,960
When we went in there, we saw two rooms.

200
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,500
There was one empty room in between.

201
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,519
(Groaning)

202
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,830
We could only save one.

203
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,129
We had to combine two numbers
to get the combination.

204
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,100
(They received a passcode before leaving.)

205
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
When we arrived in the Underground Prison,

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,269
we had the other half.

207
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,940
(The first passcode from the Remaining)

208
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,019
Do we multiply?

209
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,159
Or add?

210
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,399
(The lock needs a four-digit number.)

211
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,710
It was...

212
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,009
a star on top of the moon.

213
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,340
The hint was next to the moon...

214
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,809
and next to the star.

215
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,820
They looked like some kind of a shape.

216
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,620
We decided to combine those shapes.

217
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,350
They weren't just about number of strokes
or meaning.

218
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,590
- I'm looking at it.
- This is how it goes.

219
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,330
Open it.

220
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,830
Eight, nine, five, six.

221
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,059
- Good job.
- That was quick.

222
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,629
When we folded paper in half
and attached it,

223
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,100
we got four-digit numbers.

224
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,110
I was able to open the lock.

225
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,070
Hye Seon is clever.

226
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,480
As soon as she saw it,

227
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,740
she solved it in five seconds.

228
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,750
We were lucky to have Hye Seon.

229
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,450
Hi, Young Kwang.

230
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,490
Hyun Seo, what happened?

231
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,250
What happened?

232
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,389
We can only save one.

233
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,029
We can only save one.

234
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,600
- I'm sorry.
- What?

235
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,429
Three out of four people...

236
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,139
want to save Xitsuh.

237
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,070
Three out of four want to save Xitsuh.

238
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,179
That's what we're doing.

239
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,950
Give me that.

240
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,360
Xitsuh is experienced.

241
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,029
Almost everyone agreed to save Xitsuh.

242
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,370
Let's go raid them now.

243
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,700
- Raid?
- We're going to raid them now?

244
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,110
- Hurry.
- Okay.

245
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,279
I felt dejected. I was let down and upset.

246
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,679
It was in vain.

247
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,879
Let's go.

248
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,750
He doesn't need to cover his face.

249
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,620
Let's just go.

250
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,750
Young Kwang.

251
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,690
- You must survive. Don't mind me.
- I'm sorry.

252
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,629
(The player who is not saved
becomes eliminated immediately...)

253
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,000
(and is kicked out of Bloody Game
for good.)

254
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,570
When Xitsuh left,

255
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,000
I was so jealous.

256
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,970
- Do we smash the symbol?
- Yes.

257
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,139
We're going to smash the symbol.

258
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,840
- Yes, smash the symbol.
- Okay.

259
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,580
- Is this the Paradise?
- Yes.

260
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,690
Shoot, this really is a Paradise.

261
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,620
It looks darn nice.

262
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,220
This place is so nice.

263
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,470
We have to make them flustered...

264
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,429
and smash everything.

265
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,039
Over there.

266
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,840
Our target's in that room.

267
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,210
Do you see the shining object
in the middle?

268
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,809
The symbol's in the room above.

269
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,110
I don't see anyone.

270
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,419
They're probably on defense.

271
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,900
Come here.

272
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,460
After rescuing Xitsuh,

273
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,190
we went toward the glass wall
on the second floor...

274
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,660
as we planned in advance.

275
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,099
Here it is.

276
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,299
This.

277
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,109
(They reached the entrance
to the glass wall.)

278
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,950
What?

279
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,180
- It won't open?
- No.

280
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,079
- Then smash it.
- No.

281
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,990
Someone's here.

282
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,789
Who's that?

283
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,599
Who's that? Watch who it is.

284
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,140
Just in case.

285
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,180
Welcome to Bloody Paradise.

286
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,210
- You've reached Paradise.
- Gosh.

287
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,079
(Paradise players return
after kidnapping Acau.)

288
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,450
We're Team Paradise.

289
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,849
It's Team Paradise.

290
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,089
Hide.

291
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,059
What?

292
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,259
It's Team Paradise in the car?

293
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,930
- Yes.
- What? What were they doing there?

294
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,329
- They're players of Paradise.
- So?

295
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,470
- We're here.
- I'm so happy.

296
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,500
Where were they?

297
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,839
That means it was empty.

298
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,140
It's Jin Ho.

299
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,579
- It's Jin Ho.
- Where were they?

300
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,309
Jin Ho just got out of the car.

301
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,410
Drag him.

302
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,250
(Hong Jin Ho the spy returns.)

303
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,220
All of a sudden, Team Paradise arrived...

304
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,589
on the first floor out of nowhere.

305
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,660
We didn't expect that at all.

306
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,960
It was a shame.

307
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,730
If we'd known they weren't home,

308
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,430
we should've taken the main entrance
and searched the house.

309
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,569
They should've been on their toes inside.

310
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,730
Those pricks.

311
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,369
Isn't this better for us though?

312
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,500
They might not see this coming
when we begin.

313
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,640
They don't seem to know.

314
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,839
They can't be like that
on the Day of the Raid.

315
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,440
This is it.

316
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,809
Gosh.

317
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,180
MJ.

318
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,549
Look at them. They have no idea.

319
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:40,650
They don't care at all.

320
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,250
Where were they?

321
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,890
They were all noisy and laughing
when they arrived.

322
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,130
We had a hard time in the Remaining.

323
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:53,029
I couldn't wait to send them
to the Remaining.

324
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,529
Good job today, everyone.

325
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,170
- Let's celebrate.
- Yes.

326
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:02,170
Let's grab food...

327
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,710
- and go upstairs.
- Yes.

328
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,480
- Let's party tonight.
- Let's eat.

329
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,880
We can make ramyeon.

330
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,180
- Grab a box.
- How are we going to carry this?

331
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,720
Can you hold this box?

332
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,750
There's an announcement.

333
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,349
Please gather at the Main Hall.

334
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,259
- Gosh.
- It's not over?

335
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,460
Maybe it's Money Challenge?
We didn't have one today.

336
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,890
- No way.
- No way. Look at the time.

337
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,559
If the Money Challenge suddenly begins,
it'll be hilarious.

338
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,470
The game of the day will begin.

339
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,700
Shoot. Are you kidding me?

340
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,269
Are you crazy?

341
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:36,170
It's past midnight.

342
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,509
It felt like the game was over.

343
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:42,849
I was like, "Let's have dinner."

344
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,720
Then there was the game announcement.

345
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,849
I got upset.

346
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,549
"What? A game again?"

347
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,349
"What are we playing at this hour?"

348
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,890
The players will begin the raid
after the Paradise symbol.

349
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,960
- What?
- What?

350
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,789
If you fail to protect the symbol,

351
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,599
the owner of the Paradise will change
tonight.

352
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,130
- We have to defend.
- Tonight, all the rules are gone.

353
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,029
Any force is allowed.

354
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,869
I'd neglected it.

355
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,309
- It's begun.
- Right.

356
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,269
There are a total
of three Paradise symbols.

357
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,539
During 90 minutes of raid,

358
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,339
by any means necessary,

359
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,380
protect the Paradise symbols.

360
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,079
However, you cannot move the symbol.

361
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,849
- Okay.
- Now...

362
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:23,349
Five,

363
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,420
- four, three,
- Hey, stay here.

364
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,059
- two, one.
- Follow me.

365
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,730
Follow me. Hurry.

366
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,160
The raid will now begin.

367
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,329
(Lights go off in Paradise.)

368
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,769
(They must protect 3 symbols
for 90 minutes.)

369
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,180
- Go up.
- Seriously.

370
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,839
- Go up.
- Go up.

371
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,250
Go up.

372
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,680
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

373
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,170
- Yes.
- Stay here.

374
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,539
Gosh.

375
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,670
Go up.

376
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,339
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

377
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,339
Where do we go?

378
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,950
Open the door.

379
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,920
Where do we go?

380
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,759
We prepared this for three days.

381
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,500
My heart was pounding so fast.

382
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,160
- No, come here.
- What?

383
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,700
- Hurry.
- Come in.

384
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,569
- Hurry.
- Hey, Yurisa.

385
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,369
Head upstairs.

386
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:46,670
- Go upstairs.
- Hurry.

387
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,710
- No, come here.
- Yes?

388
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,880
- Yes?
- Hold this.

389
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,710
- So they can never open it.
- Okay.

390
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,279
No, hold here.

391
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,079
Don't let them press it.

392
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,349
- This will shake. Hold onto it tightly.
- Okay.

393
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,119
I didn't know what to do.

394
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,990
Raid? When I just arrived here?

395
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,589
When I don't know anything?

396
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,660
Hurry up.

397
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,160
- Yes.
- Hurry.

398
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,930
- Hurry up and block it.
- Sorry.

399
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,660
Block it.

400
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,200
- We can't block it.
- What?

401
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,000
- We have to move the bed.
- The bed.

402
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,970
Hurry. Push the bed.

403
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,170
Push it.

404
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,839
Gosh.

405
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,349
That one.

406
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,549
The other way.

407
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,019
Here.

408
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,890
Bring the suitcases.

409
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,019
(Blocking with the bed and suitcases)

410
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,289
Turn the lights off.

411
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,230
We have to enter.

412
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,799
- Let's get in.
- Get in.

413
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,099
(Moving to the lounge)

414
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,970
- Did you find it?
- Here.

415
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,309
(Blocking the entrance)

416
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,839
Do I take yours?

417
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,509
- Aren't you over there? Should I go?
- I'll go over there.

418
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,690
My duty was to guard...

419
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,559
the first door they'll go through.

420
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,460
I secured that door first,

421
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,599
so I can let them in.

422
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,299
I couldn't wait to go up and get ready.

423
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,269
I'm ready.

424
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,109
The folding door is ready.

425
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,980
This is the Main Hall.

426
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,789
There's the symbol.

427
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:19,890
I see.

428
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:25,059
(Xitsuh came out to the corridor.)

429
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,269
There's the symbol.

430
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,509
I see.

431
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,220
I don't think this is the symbol.

432
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,950
Is this right?

433
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,119
- It is.
- Isn't this the symbol?

434
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,950
Look.

435
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,359
No. This is acrylic.

436
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,500
When I was at the Mansion,

437
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,630
I felt the texture
and weight of the knife.

438
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,339
(The knife was also at the Mansion.)

439
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,599
But the knife that I touched here...

440
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,269
was very different. Even the texture.

441
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,039
It felt like a fragile glass.

442
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,339
The knife is the symbol.

443
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,279
The knife is the symbol!

444
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,009
Break it!

445
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,789
But it shattered with a crash.

446
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,160
It means I ruined 1 of the 3 symbols.

447
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,559
This is why
it's important to be experienced.

448
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,329
Breaking at least one symbol is...

449
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:33,529
what it takes to say
you've truly played Bloody Game.

450
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,269
(Xitsuh broke the first symbol.)

451
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,500
(The Pandora's Box
that Heo Seong Beom opened)

452
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,970
(Elimination Exemption Card)

453
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,109
(Once the Pandora's Box opens,
the players of Remaining will get...)

454
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,750
(something beneficial for the raid.)

455
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,549
(Switching of Paradise symbol)

456
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,119
Please remember that
you will pay the price for all decisions.

457
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,890
- So the symbol is the knife.
- Yes.

458
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,789
Pretend not to know anything.

459
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,099
Pyramid is difficult.

460
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,029
Knife is rather easy.

461
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,329
We know that.

462
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,099
They didn't guard it.

463
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,470
They might not know it's the symbol.

464
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,609
My goodness.

465
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,410
What kind of situation is this
as soon as I arrive?

466
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,079
I didn't even have time
to go to the bathroom.

467
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,809
There's one here.

468
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,019
- Another one is in the main door.
- Okay.

469
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,049
I see.

470
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:32,460
- We can't get caught.
- Yes.

471
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,589
Let's block that side, first.

472
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,099
Isn't 90 minutes too long?

473
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,630
(Joo Eon Kyu breaks the second symbol.)

474
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,430
Nobody was guarding the knife
at the swimming pool.

475
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,940
So I walked towards it and broke it.

476
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,640
I felt elated.

477
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,640
- Where's the last one?
- Yes?

478
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,180
I should ask Jin Ho.

479
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,009
(The last symbol is at the Sky Garden.)

480
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,250
They're coming!

481
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,819
Team Mansion is coming!

482
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,690
My goodness. They brought weapons. Wait!

483
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,190
Who is it?

484
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,829
- What's going on?
- Jin Ho, block him!

485
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:48,000
What is it? Bring it here.

486
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,569
He brought a sledgehammer.

487
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,069
They brought everything
including the hammer.

488
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:54,470
- You'll get hurt.
- For goodness' sake. What are you doing?

489
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,470
For goodness' sake. What are you doing?

490
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,410
- Darn it.
- You'll get hurt.

491
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,910
Darn it. What's going on?

492
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,410
Shoot.

493
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,680
Darn it. What's going on?

494
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,150
Shoot.

495
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,450
Let's go.

496
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,049
Let's go.

497
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,500
Where's the symbol?

498
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,500
Darn it. Are they crazy?

499
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:21,900
For goodness' sake.

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,599
They broke with a hammer.

501
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,839
Of course, I break it with a hammer.
What else should I do?

502
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,569
This is cheating!

503
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,809
- Why? This isn't cheating.
- Yes?

504
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,210
It's Eon Kyu.

505
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,779
They brought a hammer and a steel pipe.

506
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,849
I never predicted this would happen.

507
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,549
For goodness' sake. They're insane.

508
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,750
Darn it. Are they crazy?

509
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,950
How did they break in? This is impossible.

510
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,660
We're doomed.

511
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,690
Block them!

512
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,660
Jin Ho, step out
if you don't want to get hurt.

513
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,500
Come here and help me!

514
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,069
Wait!

515
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,740
Let's talk this out.

516
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
We can talk it out.

517
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,509
Stop them.

518
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,980
No, darn it.

519
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,680
Where is it?

520
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,220
- This one.
- You found one.

521
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:18,349
- This isn't the one.
- It is.

522
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,319
What are you doing? Block them.

523
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,730
I don't think that's the symbol.

524
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
What?

525
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,329
Darn it.

526
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,430
This is it.

527
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,640
The texture is different.

528
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,609
Hey, you all...

529
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,539
Did you hear what the symbol is?

530
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,210
- Did you know about the symbol?
- No.

531
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,950
Seriously. This is the symbol.

532
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,650
- Jin Ho.
- This is the symbol.

533
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,720
It's a knife.

534
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,619
Is it? There's a knife here.

535
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:01,400
It isn't here.

536
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,039
(Team Remaining entered the Sky Garden.)

537
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,839
I don't think that's the symbol.

538
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,250
Darn it. This doesn't make sense.

539
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,980
(Frantically moving)

540
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,549
This doesn't make sense.

541
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,420
Darn it. Are they crazy?

542
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:24,150
We blocked the lounge but I was in there.

543
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,359
I couldn't go out.

544
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,819
(In the meantime,)

545
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:32,630
(Joo Eon Kyu found the last symbol.)

546
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,829
Block them!

547
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,029
(Jang Dong Min's hollow cry)

548
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,500
Darn it.

549
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:51,950
Three symbols
of the Paradise are all broken.

550
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,519
Please gather at the Main Hall.

551
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,250
- I think we can ask what we need.
- It's okay.

552
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,890
Darn it.

553
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,690
- It was the knife all this while?
- Yes.

554
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,660
That's not the symbol.

555
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,730
This is the symbol.

556
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,029
- It's over.
- What is it?

557
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,869
- We broke all the knives.
- This is the symbol.

558
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,339
- What?
- It was the knife.

559
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,569
Yes, the knife is the symbol.

560
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,140
It was the knife.

561
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,410
We installed everything with hard work.

562
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,480
- Come out. It's over.
- Let's go.

563
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,619
It's over.

564
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,019
The knife is the symbol.

565
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,650
The knife is the symbol.

566
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:46,140
(Sighing)

567
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:26,609
It's good to see you.

568
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,579
- Yes, good to see you.
- Thanks for your efforts.

569
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Yes.

570
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,599
The reason for the failure is...

571
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,500
Darn it.

572
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,539
This makes no sense. For goodness' sake.

573
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,710
We were so sure...

574
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,819
about the symbol.

575
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,590
Darn it!

576
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,059
That's horrendous. Darn it.

577
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,500
For goodness' sake.

578
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,079
Shoot.

579
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,090
Our team lost.

580
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,829
Why didn't we think further?

581
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,400
Yes, we had the knives too.

582
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,010
The knives were always there.

583
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,349
After entering this Bloody Game,

584
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:15,989
during the three days in Paradise,

585
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,690
I had only one goal,
that was to build a perfect defense...

586
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,429
and prevent invasion.

587
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,599
That's the only thought I had
while guarding.

588
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,300
Most importantly,

589
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,969
we need to block them
from opening this door.

590
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,699
We need to install this here.

591
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,440
- More... Yes.
- I should tie this.

592
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,440
(The final line of defense
built tirelessly day and night)

593
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,840
Pull it, please.

594
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,309
Slowly.

595
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,880
The guilt I feel toward my teammates...

596
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,650
who trusted me
and believed in my strategy.

597
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,619
In a way, when my teammates were
tired and struggling,

598
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,059
but I kept asking them to do
a bit more, to help out a bit longer,

599
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:56,030
and urging them to block this together.

600
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,500
I coaxed them with both
encouragement and persuasion.

601
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,230
Ror the entire three days,

602
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,230
I used every means possible...

603
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,840
and poured everything into that one task.

604
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,969
But this wasn't it?

605
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:13,440
It wasn't?

606
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,909
So that we can...

607
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,019
Later, it might turn out that
we were supposed to protect this.

608
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,289
No, this is too exposed.

609
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,519
- Here and there.
- Here and the swimming pool.

610
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,619
- But it's considered indoors.
- Yes.

611
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,690
(They didn't doubt the knives at all.)

612
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,530
Why did we leave...

613
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,559
the knives alone?

614
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:40,139
I believe this is my fault.

615
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,739
The 2 nights and 3 days I poured in...

616
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,010
Was what 23 seconds?

617
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:49,280
It fell apart so easily
within a short time.

618
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,349
If only I had...

619
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,820
been outside in the Garden,

620
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,519
I would have assessed the situation...

621
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,119
and thought of a way to protect
everything else somehow.

622
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,329
I ended up trapped...

623
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,260
in the very trap I set.

624
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,559
I was in a well-made prison...

625
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,869
I created.

626
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,199
It's so meaningless.

627
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,420
We know the process.

628
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,550
Others were sleeping, exploring,

629
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,690
or eating.

630
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,420
But he kept working on
shutting down the lounge.

631
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,329
I know the time, effort, and idea...

632
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:38,059
that he poured into that.

633
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,860
I couldn't dare to comfort him.

634
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,559
I felt strange.

635
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,400
I worked with Dong Min in many TV shows.

636
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,440
It has been about ten years.

637
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,340
This version of him...

638
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,170
is a rare sight.

639
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,210
Usually,
I joke around and talk informally to him.

640
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,780
But at that time, I was careful...

641
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:59,650
and stayed quiet afraid of conflict.

642
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,019
If I tell him that I was a spy,

643
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,190
he'll curse at me.

644
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,019
Hey, spy!

645
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,460
Spy, come here.

646
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:15,460
I hit it with a hammer five times.

647
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,500
It broke when I hit it twice.

648
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,440
I thought that wasn't the symbol,
but just in case, I broke everything.

649
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,639
You were so comfortable here.

650
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,809
Here? No, it's the same.

651
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,949
(Pani Bottle returns too.)

652
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,590
- What?
- What's going on?

653
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,190
- Pani is here.
- What's going on?

654
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,630
- My goodness.
- What happened?

655
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,030
The players of Remaining
succeeded in the raid.

656
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,840
They're now the new owner of Paradise.

657
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,670
Break it.

658
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:04,150
I didn't do it!

659
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,150
(The symbol of Paradise is broken.)

660
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,559
Here are the new rules.

661
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,090
Players of Paradise who failed the raid...

662
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,059
will vote...

663
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,730
one elimination candidate.

664
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,440
The player chosen
as the elimination candidate...

665
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,170
will go to Underground Prison.

666
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,340
Other players will leave
Bloody Paradise...

667
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,110
and survive at Remaining.

668
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,079
Heo Seong Beom and Acau who won...

669
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,179
the Elimination Exemption Card
by opening the Pandora's Box,

670
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,849
will be exempted as candidates...

671
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,420
from this vote.

672
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,519
What?

673
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,219
What's going on?

674
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,389
You may vote now.

675
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,559
All players of Paradise,

676
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:57,099
excluding Heo Seong Beom and Acau,

677
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,239
should choose one person
to send to Underground Prison.

678
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,710
Voting will be over after one hour.

679
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,719
Players of Remaining
who succeeded in the raid today...

680
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,480
can choose either Pani Bottle,
who was the sacrificial player...

681
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:18,150
or Xitsuh,

682
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,519
who was saved from the prison.

683
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,530
What'll happen to the other one?

684
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,099
The player who fails to get chosen...

685
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:30,000
will be an elimination candidate...

686
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:33,039
and won't get to participate
in the team match from tomorrow.

687
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:36,239
He will go on a Deathmatch
with the other elimination candidate...

688
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,409
from the team that loses the match.

689
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,610
I thought this game was awful.

690
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,179
This is too cruel.

691
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,719
You'll be given time to discuss freely.

692
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,860
After the discussion, one player...

693
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,630
should enter the voting room
to choose one to save.

694
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,639
(Time for the two teams to choose)

695
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,849
We need to choose too. Let's go.

696
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,119
(Team Paradise leaves.)

697
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,829
- Choose one player each.
- One from our team.

698
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,090
- It'll be either one.
- Which team are you on?

699
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,860
I think I belong here.

700
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,929
For goodness' sake.

701
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,969
I feel so bad.

702
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,739
- That team?
- What?

703
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:46,880
Yes, that team.

704
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,579
This outfit is crappy material,
and it's so hot.

705
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,719
But if it weren't for you...

706
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,820
Anyway, please be easy on me.

707
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,219
- Good work.
- You know what I mean, right?

708
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:05,489
(Pani Bottle leaves the room.)

709
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,929
Let's just focus
on what we need to do right now.

710
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,570
We need to save one of the two.

711
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,699
Should we start by kneeling?

712
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:12,070
We have Xitsuh and Pani.

713
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,099
- Are we the only ones who are voting?
- Yes.

714
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,440
- Or...
- It's a total of seven.

715
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,070
We still need to have a discussion,

716
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,469
so can Xitsuh get out?

717
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,980
Oh, the one in question?

718
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:22,849
Do you want me to kneel before I leave?

719
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,250
They want the ones in question
out of the room.

720
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:34,460
I was a member of Bloody Paradise,

721
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,530
so I don't have the right to judge anyone.

722
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:39,659
I think the ones who played with them...

723
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,900
should voice their opinions and decide.

724
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:43,369
Whether it's Hyun Seo,

725
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,599
Hye Seon, Eon Kyu, or Steve.

726
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,840
This is tough.

727
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,769
Personally, Pani went...

728
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,809
as a sacrificial player instead of me,

729
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:54,679
so I'm thankful for him...

730
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,280
and want him to survive.

731
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,809
I've never actually met Xitsuh before.

732
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,650
I've gotten close with Xitsuh,

733
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,179
so I want him to survive.

734
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,349
Pani helped me with the Deathmatch, so...

735
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:08,559
Pani practically mapped out
the whole strategy,

736
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,590
and we only executed it.

737
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,829
That doesn't really matter.

738
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,670
We should also think
about whether they'll be of help...

739
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,300
- To our team?
- Yes.

740
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,900
We need to consider that as well.

741
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,369
It's complicated.

742
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,570
I agree with you.

743
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:28,010
It's not up to me, anyway.

744
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:30,150
I'll be the sacrificial player
if we go today.

745
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,250
(Pani Bottle volunteered
as the sacrificial player.)

746
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,780
No. We need you.

747
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,780
I don't want to force anyone to go.

748
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,949
I'll go if I can.

749
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,159
- Break it!
- Break it?

750
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,190
(Xitsuh helped them with the raid.)

751
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,489
Help me!

752
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,199
Between Xitsuh who broke me out...

753
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,329
and Pani who was locked up in a prison,
they wanted me to choose.

754
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,800
Our discussion didn't need to be
that long there...

755
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,670
because we were all thinking
the same thing.

756
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,110
The selection has ended.

757
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,480
The Remaining players
who have succeeded in the raid,

758
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,179
please gather at the Main Hall.

759
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,130
The player selected to be saved
by the Remaining players...

760
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:32,710
is Pani Bottle.

761
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,010
(Pani Bottle)

762
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:42,519
I felt bad for Xitsuh,

763
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,889
but to be rational,

764
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,159
we weren't...

765
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,989
exactly close.

766
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,400
Sensitively and rationally,
I don't really feel guilty...

767
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,030
about choosing Pani.

768
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,730
Saving one who once lost...

769
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,670
due to his incompetence...

770
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,239
or saving one
who participated in the Deathmatch,

771
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:04,610
sacrificed himself
as the sacrificial player,

772
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,079
and helped us in the process.

773
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,780
Anyone would agree that it was fair...

774
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,050
to save Pani, morally speaking.

775
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,579
I was worried about Xitsuh,

776
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,789
but everything's about timing.

777
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,219
I guess it wasn't the right time.

778
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,059
Xitsuh, who wasn't saved,

779
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,960
please leave the room...

780
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
and head to the Underground Prison.

781
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,199
Get some rest, Xitsuh. See you tomorrow.

782
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,969
- Good work today.
- Sorry.

783
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,039
Can I bring some chips with me?

784
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,940
Get some rest.

785
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,849
A jobless guy worked so hard...

786
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,179
to get a job,
but it turned out to be a mistake.

787
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:45,510
"Sorry. That was a wrong message."

788
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,449
That's what it felt like.

789
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:48,750
I had a group...

790
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,920
and thought I belonged there,

791
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:53,219
but it was taken away from me.

792
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,320
An expendable mercenary.

793
00:45:56,429 --> 00:46:00,730
I wasn't even a mercenary.
An expendable hammer carrier.

794
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,969
Another reset?

795
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,340
This sucks.

796
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,820
- Let's sit.
- Okay.

797
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:24,619
Okay.

798
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,139
So, we need to pick...

799
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,840
one of us to send to prison.

800
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,610
The one who goes...

801
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,079
becomes an elimination candidate...

802
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,849
and has to go to the Deathmatch, right?

803
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,519
I'm fine with going to the prison.

804
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:03,630
My biggest fault was
that I didn't notice...

805
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,199
the knife was the symbol.

806
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,070
I know there's a risk,

807
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,230
but I'll...

808
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,739
survive the Deathmatch.

809
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,269
(Dong Min volunteers to go to the prison.)

810
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,210
The fear of going to the Deathmatch...

811
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,719
and becoming an elimination candidate.

812
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,349
No one who's in a survival show...

813
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:33,460
will ever go, "I love that!"

814
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,489
We do our best in Money Challenges...

815
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,960
to avoid feeling that fear.

816
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,630
Of course, I'm afraid.

817
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,500
However, I'm confident.

818
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,670
I'm not 99 percent confident.

819
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,340
My confidence is 100 percent.

820
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,679
That was my thought, so I volunteered...

821
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:56,949
to go to the Underground Prison.

822
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,920
Even if any one of us...

823
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,190
goes to prison,

824
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,789
they're playing with us.

825
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,019
We're all playing together.

826
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,090
We're going to be one team.

827
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:13,500
We need to trust our team and believe...

828
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,659
that we'll win, no matter what.

829
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,639
The price of defeat is too immense.

830
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,650
It doesn't matter.

831
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:37,320
I'm only getting changed
and getting some rest.

832
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,769
(Si Yoon, MJ Kim, Yurisa,
and Jang Dong Min)

833
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,710
We'll save you,
even if it means spending our money.

834
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,480
Voting is over.

835
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,250
All Paradise players,

836
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,590
please gather at the Main Hall
on the second floor.

837
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:19,559
The player going
to the Underground Prison is...

838
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,170
Yurisa.

839
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,309
Her actions in the last few days...

840
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:38,579
have made her untrustworthy.

841
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,849
Yurisa has been playing individually.

842
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,690
She must have had her plans,

843
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,159
but they weren't that effective.

844
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,860
And was there a bond...

845
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,929
between me and her?

846
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:53,460
Not really.

847
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,059
- Take it.
- Yes.

848
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,300
- I got it.
- Good.

849
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,329
(When they were fortifying the building)

850
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,400
Do you want me to pass it over?

851
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,969
Yes, behind this.

852
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:12,210
(She wasn't interested in fortifying it.)

853
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,820
Wait. Hye Seon?

854
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:19,989
- Where are you going?
- Hi, Yurisa.

855
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,320
Stay still, Yurisa.

856
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,530
Hello.

857
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,000
- There's nothing here, right?
- Nothing.

858
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:32,230
Does that mean you're the spy?

859
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,469
- Yes.
- What was your role, then?

860
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,809
I wasn't able to find
the SMS Box for two days.

861
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:40,010
- I couldn't play my part.
- He did nothing!

862
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,980
- He just made himself comfortable here!
- I thought...

863
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,909
- you were...
- We weren't able to communicate,

864
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,349
- so I thought we were doomed.
- Okay.

865
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:48,380
We were fortifying the building recently,

866
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,519
and I was only sleeping
because I didn't want to help.

867
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,460
You weren't doing anything
to suspect you to be the spy.

868
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,760
I literally did nothing.
I just went to sleep.

869
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:00,599
But you've been leading the team...

870
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,599
- Yes.
- on the first two days.

871
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,829
Now, you want to refresh in prison?

872
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,699
We'll be playing in teams tomorrow.

873
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,139
I don't know what games they will be,

874
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:14,980
but I believe it's fair that we keep you.

875
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:19,079
No matter how we vote,

876
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,679
I dare predict that all the players
who were in Bloody Paradise...

877
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,989
to vote for Yurisa.

878
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:27,519
I realized my mistake too late.

879
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,059
If my team loses, I'll have to go
against one of my teammates...

880
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,630
in the Deathmatch.

881
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,699
I judged that
I shouldn't stick to my opinion.

882
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:40,340
I realized that winning as a team was
the only solution.

883
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,670
(Yurisa)

884
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,010
(Yurisa)

885
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,110
(Yurisa)

886
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:49,510
(Yurisa)

887
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,960
(Yurisa)

888
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,760
To be perfectly honest,
the moment I saw them...

889
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,030
fortifying the third floor for days,

890
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:08,460
I knew that they'd eliminate me
even when they lost,

891
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,070
with their poor judgment
and low intelligence.

892
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,840
(Yurisa voted for herself.)

893
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,409
Actually, I thought,

894
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,110
"You're sending me to prison..."

895
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,349
"after not listening to me?"

896
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:28,179
But I didn't really want to be with them.

897
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:30,989
I'll have to go to a place
and spend days with them there.

898
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:33,190
If I had to go there...

899
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,019
and be treated like a fool,

900
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,260
I might as well stay in prison.

901
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,559
(Safety First)

902
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:54,780
Hello, Xitsuh.

903
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,849
I'm here.

904
00:52:57,849 --> 00:52:59,849
Are we cellmates now?

905
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,820
Yes, the cellmates in Season Two.

906
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,659
Darn it. It sucks.

907
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,170
Don't cry, Xitsuh.

908
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,889
I'm exhilarated.

909
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:44,960
Only those who have experienced it
can know the feeling.

910
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,800
Think about it. For three days,

911
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,599
it felt like I was turning
into a dumpling.

912
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,000
It was hot, humid, and full of bugs.

913
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,570
I was in the worst environment possible,

914
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,699
then I took a shower when I came back.

915
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,409
You know the sound
that middle-aged men make in a sauna?

916
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,840
That groan.

917
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,349
I made that sound automatically.

918
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:06,619
Environments really matter to a human.

919
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,190
I can't believe I was lying
in the Remaining Living Space.

920
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:13,590
It feels so pleasant,
even after such a short time.

921
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:16,789
I think it was the right move
to go there on the first day.

922
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,789
Acting like I had a shoulder injury
helped me.

923
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,630
- A cripple?
- Yes.

924
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,130
I was voted because of that.

925
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:25,329
At first, I thought you had played
an incredibly violent game.

926
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:28,440
Hye Seon and I were there,
and they said that two players would come.

927
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,110
I was surprised by that,

928
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,869
and one of them had a plaster cast
on his arm,

929
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:34,909
and the other one, Young Kwang,

930
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,809
- had a bloodshot eye!
- Right.

931
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:39,079
I thought, "Did they have
a physical fight over there?"

932
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:40,480
I was worried for nothing.

933
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,949
We didn't look healthy.

934
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,719
Eat up, come upstairs,
and check your rooms.

935
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:46,489
If you want to rest or go to sleep,
go ahead.

936
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,289
It was such a long day.

937
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,460
How is a day so long?

938
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,860
- Right?
- Yes.

939
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,369
Anyway, good work today.

940
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:04,409
- You too. Good night.
- Good night.

941
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,530
(Snoring)

942
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:33,670
(Tossing)

943
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,139
What?

944
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:46,349
I'm so enraged.

945
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,750
What even is this?

946
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,989
It's here!

947
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,889
Darn it.

948
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,429
- Hey!
- You'll hurt yourself!

949
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,389
- No. Let go.
- Come over here, guys!

950
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,500
(7 hours ago at the Bloody Mansion)

951
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:04,800
- Hurry up and come down.
- Acau is gone!

952
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,969
- What? Acau is gone!
- He's not here.

953
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:11,070
(The Mansion players realized
that Acau has gone missing.)

954
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,269
He betrayed us.

955
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,579
- He betrayed us.
- I knew this would happen.

956
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,579
This is so annoying.

957
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,519
That jerk.

958
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,949
Shoot.

959
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,590
It's physically impossible
to guard all of them.

960
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,889
- Yes, that's true.
- Right?

961
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,489
- This is...
- Let's lock it.

962
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,590
Lock it.

963
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,030
- Put that here.
- This one?

964
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,190
Yes.

965
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,230
How... What are we doing?

966
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,099
Great idea!

967
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,670
- We'll stick it under.
- Yes, stick it there.

968
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,000
(Preparing for a raid, just in case)

969
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,239
Put them up.

970
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,369
(Preparing for a raid, just in case)

971
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,340
This wasn't here before.

972
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,909
They're likely to come
through the basement.

973
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:49,340
- They won't be able to open it.
- Right.

974
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,480
I should have brought some drinks.

975
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:52,610
Here.

976
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:53,619
(Blocking the way from the basement
to the first floor)

977
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:55,949
That's the most invulnerable door, right?

978
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,119
- Yes, they won't be able to open it.
- They could never open that.

979
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,320
- They can't.
- They can't.

980
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,360
They can't open this.

981
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,019
Take out all the batteries.

982
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:06,429
- Good.
- We only need to lock this door, then.

983
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:21,639
(Failing)

984
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,019
- That one too.
- Darn it.

985
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,719
This door is open.

986
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,320
- It opens.
- It opens?

987
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,719
We can't do anything because of the wires.

988
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:32,889
Darn it.

989
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,690
(Sliding)

990
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:36,090
Oh, my!

991
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,630
- What is it?
- Nothing.

992
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:40,159
- What's going on?
- We can't close this one.

993
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:42,630
- We can't close this one.
- There are wires.

994
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,730
- It's dangerous, so come down.
- Okay.

995
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,199
- Let me give it a try.
- It's down there.

996
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,340
Sorry.

997
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,440
- Good.
- Did I get it?

998
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,349
- You just unplugged it.
- Okay.

999
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:04,550
(Grabbing tightly)

1000
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,389
(Blocking the 2nd floor with beds as well)

1001
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:09,920
- This is so heavy.
- It's too heavy.

1002
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:13,130
(Rumbling)

1003
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,630
- What's that sound?
- I could have gotten hurt.

1004
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,760
- We're blocking the door.
- Did he get out? Okay.

1005
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,699
I thought,
"They'll never break through this."

1006
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,739
"We've perfectly sealed this off."

1007
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:22,170
"Whenever they choose to come,"

1008
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,769
"we're completely prepared for it."

1009
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:26,710
We had built an impregnable fortress.

1010
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,880
Even an army wouldn't be able
to come through.

1011
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,050
It was so solid. I'm actually proud of it.

1012
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,980
Other than the basement...

1013
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,349
There's no other way in.

1014
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:35,449
(The Bloody Mansion is sealed.)

1015
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,650
Did you hear the thuds?

1016
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,920
- Yes, I'm starting to hear them.
- Yes.

1017
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,730
(Silent)

1018
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,199
See you on the other side.

1019
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,230
Yes.

1020
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:53,199
If they come through the basement,
I should come down and help.

1021
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,400
Gosh.

1022
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,300
All we can do is wait now.

1023
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,440
Yes,
we should hide here for the time being.

1024
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,409
Why is it so quiet, though?

1025
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,480
- They must be up to something.
- I'm scared.

1026
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:05,980
I'm exhausted.

1027
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:09,019
Why don't I hear anything?

1028
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:22,199
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1029
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,909
(Sighing)

1030
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:35,110
What's happening?

1031
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,619
Tomorrow, there will be a team match
of Money Challenge...

1032
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,820
with players
from the outdoor survival ground.

1033
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:44,920
A team match.

1034
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,159
Before the team match,

1035
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:51,789
the Mansion players may loot
another survival ground outside.

1036
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,659
The players will invade
an outdoor survival ground...

1037
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,469
and must take three keys...

1038
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,300
within the time limit of 90 minutes.

1039
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,400
Keys?

1040
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:03,269
Here are the benefits of your team...

1041
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:04,510
for taking the keys.

1042
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,309
Number one, prison key.

1043
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,809
If you take the prison key,

1044
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:12,380
you can save a player from prison...

1045
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,480
and recruit the player to your team.

1046
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,489
But you can only succeed
if you steal the key...

1047
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,250
and open the gate to the cell
within the time limit.

1048
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:22,860
Number two, private funds key.

1049
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:25,429
If you take the private funds key,

1050
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:28,300
you can steal private funds
of the outsiders.

1051
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,300
But you're only allowed to take
funds in units of 1,000 dollars...

1052
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,769
within the specified time.

1053
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,469
Number three, Hidden Rule key.

1054
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:39,139
If you take the Hidden Rule key,

1055
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:42,079
the Hidden Rule that will help you survive
in the future is revealed.

1056
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:44,150
You are given 90 minutes for looting.

1057
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,150
By any means necessary,

1058
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,480
secure all three keys.

1059
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,889
This place is so...

1060
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:55,389
You sounded a siren the day before
to warn us about invaders,

1061
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,590
so we did our best to guard the Mansion...

1062
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:59,159
in such a short amount of time.

1063
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,699
Then, you wanted us to invade them.

1064
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,630
I thought, "It's finally beginning."

1065
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,829
I don't have enough money,

1066
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,769
so I have no means to protect myself
when I become an elimination candidate.

1067
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:10,909
I was determined to steal
all the private funds.

1068
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:12,039
I was so excited.

1069
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,239
Please enter the voting room...

1070
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:15,340
and get the map
of the outdoor survival ground.

1071
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,610
I'll go and get it.

1072
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,719
(The map and rules are
in the voting room.)

1073
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,719
Read this first.

1074
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:24,289
Do we only need one person, or...

1075
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,650
Do we all have to go?

1076
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,059
- They must be guarding their place too.
- The siren will sound...

1077
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,619
"Twenty minutes..."

1078
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:32,429
"after we step on the central staircase,
the alarm will sound for one second."

1079
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,429
"Forty minutes later,
the alarm will sound for five seconds."

1080
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,929
"Sixty minutes later, the alarm will sound
until the end of the time limit."

1081
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,000
And then...

1082
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,570
And they had this. Memorize "111428."

1083
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:43,969
(A key symbol and a number)

1084
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:48,179
It's huge.

1085
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,610
Shoot.

1086
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,780
It's the Paradise.

1087
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,719
- What is this?
- It's enormous.

1088
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,949
- It is.
- Gosh.

1089
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:57,849
They were staying at such a nice place.

1090
01:01:57,849 --> 01:01:59,949
- So, the third floor,
- What...

1091
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,389
- the 2.5th floor, the 2nd floor,
- Right.

1092
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,860
the first floor,
and the Underground Prison.

1093
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,760
- They're in the Underground Prison.
- It's so luxurious!

1094
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:08,599
They were staying
at such a luxurious place!

1095
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:12,170
I looked at the map,
and I got mad all of a sudden.

1096
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:16,599
"There have been people staying
at such a nice place this whole time?"

1097
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:17,869
I was slightly angry.

1098
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,610
I didn't know
they were in such a nice place.

1099
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,539
We were in a tiny house, compared to them.

1100
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:22,780
I envied them.

1101
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,710
I thought we were staying
at the best place.

1102
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,349
There were people
enjoying their time there.

1103
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:31,650
We enter through this,
and these things are on the first floor.

1104
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:33,719
- Yes.
- The safe box for private funds...

1105
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:35,360
is on the second floor.

1106
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:37,590
- We need to go here for private funds.
- We pass...

1107
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,559
the voting room, and...

1108
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:41,429
- Yes. Behind the voting room...
- it's there.

1109
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:42,599
No, we have to go into it.

1110
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,929
We need to enter the voting room.

1111
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,099
- Right.
- Here's...

1112
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,170
the pantry,

1113
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:50,940
and the prison key is there.

1114
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,039
Third floor.

1115
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,010
The Hidden Rule key is
on the third-floor lounge.

1116
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,780
(The 3rd-floor lounge, Hidden Rule key)

1117
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,519
I think it's 111428.

1118
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:01,949
The code to all the safe boxes.

1119
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:03,280
They're stored in safe boxes, right?

1120
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,389
We must be able to open them
with this passcode.

1121
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,659
But realistically speaking,

1122
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,420
is there a chance
we can take all three keys?

1123
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,460
The alarm will sound...

1124
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,730
at 20, 40, and 60 minutes as a rule,

1125
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:16,059
so that means that they don't know...

1126
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,730
we're coming, right?

1127
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,869
- Probably not.
- No.

1128
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:20,269
We should go to the center...

1129
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:22,500
- instead.
- Yes, let's go there.

1130
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,139
Then,

1131
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,440
I'll go through the middle
acting like a crew member...

1132
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,539
and steal everything here.

1133
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,139
You'd go alone?

1134
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,710
I need to be alone
to act like a crew member.

1135
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:31,880
That's true.

1136
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,210
- Do you have a hat?
- No.

1137
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,320
I have one. Do you want it?

1138
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,349
I don't think it'll fit.

1139
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,690
- Well, you could...
- I'll find a way.

1140
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,889
Maybe I could bring...

1141
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:40,789
- a battery or something.
- Oh, right.

1142
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:42,219
There was a Door of Secrets,

1143
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,329
and there were several paths.

1144
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:46,989
But there's no guarantee
that the door is unlocked.

1145
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,929
I decided to go with the frontal attack.

1146
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:50,530
Penetrating through the middle.

1147
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:53,199
- I'll come up with a strategy, then.
- Okay.

1148
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:56,369
What do you think
their most valuable asset is?

1149
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:57,570
- I think it's the Hidden Rule key.
- The funds.

1150
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,070
- It's the Hidden Rule.
- Hidden Rule?

1151
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,139
Hidden Rule.

1152
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,639
I will...

1153
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:03,780
Just a second.

1154
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,750
We just need to bring the Hidden Rule key.

1155
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,750
- Right. That's all.
- Right.

1156
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,960
So, that doesn't matter.

1157
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,889
We'll go through the voting room
and get the private funds.

1158
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:17,230
As much money as possible.

1159
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,989
But look. Do you think
you can carry all the money?

1160
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,030
- We should bring a bundle or something.
- Or bags.

1161
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,599
We don't need to be too greedy, though.

1162
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,840
We won't be able to carry that much money.

1163
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:30,239
I think we can surely secure
the prison key.

1164
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,239
But getting the private funds is
a bit of a problem.

1165
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,010
I was desperate...

1166
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:37,110
because I had spent all my funds...

1167
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,750
to avoid going to the Deathmatch...

1168
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,519
and avoid being eliminated.

1169
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,420
(Kyung Ran's current private funds)

1170
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,219
(0 dollars)

1171
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,230
And we had the opportunity
to secure more funds.

1172
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:54,230
This was completely different
from earning 20,000 dollars...

1173
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,300
by winning games.

1174
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,269
We could go straight to their funds.

1175
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,769
- But...
- We find the Hidden Rule key...

1176
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:01,199
It might be better to get
the Hidden Rule key first...

1177
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:03,000
- So... Yes, it's important,
- because it's important.

1178
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,039
- so bring that key first.
- When you come down.

1179
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,369
- I'll just leave, then.
- Yes.

1180
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,510
I'll leave with the Hidden Rule key.

1181
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,480
- And then, help us.
- Then,

1182
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,380
- I'll go to the private funds key.
- We'll take the money...

1183
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,110
- and hide.
- Look.

1184
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:15,179
Do you think you can carry
all the private funds?

1185
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:16,719
We'll have to get as much as we can.

1186
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:18,619
It's not the best-case scenario,

1187
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:20,389
but only bringing the Hidden Rule key is
already a success.

1188
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:22,519
Getting the private funds is being
a bit greedy,

1189
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,619
- But...
- but we're giving it a go.

1190
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,460
I don't mind abandoning the private funds.

1191
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,130
- You don't?
- But who knows?

1192
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,860
The funds might be crucial...

1193
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,429
in future team matches.

1194
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:33,329
We're so short on money.

1195
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,139
I think we might be doomed...

1196
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,070
going for all three of them.

1197
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:44,409
(They don't share the same interests.)

1198
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:47,280
Then, the prison key?

1199
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,119
Do you think the prison key comes...

1200
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:50,889
before the private funds key?

1201
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,719
- This is our priority.
- We can go...

1202
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:54,289
for all three of them...

1203
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:56,789
and leave them if we can't succeed.

1204
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:58,559
We could just bring the keys we got
at that point.

1205
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:00,260
As soon as I saw it,
I was aiming at the Hidden Rule key.

1206
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,699
I thought we could leave the rest...

1207
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,469
because it might take too long.

1208
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,440
If it does take too long,
we have a higher chance of getting caught,

1209
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,039
and I was so afraid of that.

1210
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,010
Because we all know
that they're bundles of money.

1211
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,880
- The Underground Prison...
- Let me get some fresh air...

1212
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,510
- and a glass of water.
- Sure.

1213
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:18,849
Then,
I get the Hidden Rule key to you first...

1214
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,079
since the next game is a team match.

1215
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,420
- To the person downstairs?
- Yes.

1216
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,280
- I'll hand it over at the entrance.
- I'll wait for you there.

1217
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,019
But it has to be just one.
We hand it over.

1218
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:26,719
Then, we go upstairs...

1219
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:29,260
Wait. I'll get the Hidden Rule key
and prison key.

1220
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:31,960
I'm fine...

1221
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,760
- with getting only the Hidden Rule key.
- Right.

1222
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,500
- That's a job well done.
- The Hidden Rule is the most crucial.

1223
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,070
Honestly, the funds aren't...

1224
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,500
I'll tell you why the funds are important.

1225
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,099
- Yes, I know that they're important.
- We know that.

1226
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,469
We can buy a ballot for 20,000 dollars.

1227
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:46,170
- We all know that.
- Right.

1228
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,679
- Yes.
- Anyway, that's our priority.

1229
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,239
You don't have much money,
so it must matter.

1230
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,280
I'm worried about being betrayed.

1231
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,610
There will definitely be a conflict,
even if we bring the money.

1232
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,849
We'll definitely have a conflict.

1233
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,820
- That's not going to help our teamwork.
- That's true.

1234
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,690
The money doesn't help
our teamwork at all.

1235
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:59,019
Although we like the money...

1236
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:00,349
- and we want to have it,
- I don't care, though.

1237
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,760
but we'll never be able
to distribute them.

1238
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,960
We can never trust them.

1239
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,929
Get the Hidden Rule key
and deliver it to us.

1240
01:07:05,929 --> 01:07:07,460
- Yes. Then, I'll go to the safe box.
- Then,

1241
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,860
- we'll go to the Underground Prison.
- Okay.

1242
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,800
With Kyung Ran or anyone.
Tell them that you'll get the funds...

1243
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,269
and failed to do so.

1244
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:15,869
It's so frustrating.

1245
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,179
- I...
- Who wants an energy drink?

1246
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,539
I'll have one.

1247
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:24,780
So, what do you want me to do?

1248
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,980
Everyone agrees...

1249
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,250
that getting the Hidden Rule key is
our top priority.

1250
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,619
But our operation begins
after we get that key...

1251
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:35,489
- and come downstairs?
- Yes.

1252
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:38,690
They chose the Hidden Rule key
as the top priority...

1253
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:41,230
while I was gone.

1254
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,599
But...

1255
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:47,000
while we were
outnumbered and short on money,

1256
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,809
we weren't looking in the same direction.

1257
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,239
Putting all our opinions together...

1258
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,039
wasn't...

1259
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:58,449
as easy.

1260
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:01,050
Mansion players,

1261
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,650
move to the outdoor survival ground
immediately.

1262
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,150
- We're in no rush.
- It's hot.

1263
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,619
- Good luck.
- Yes. Good luck.

1264
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:09,260
I feel like...

1265
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,030
I hope none of them are early risers.

1266
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:13,190
I know!

1267
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:18,100
(Paradise)

1268
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:28,310
What is this heavenly place?

1269
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,840
It's gigantic.

1270
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,779
This makes me so mad.

1271
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:32,850
This is insane.

1272
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:34,479
- Let's head to the prison first.
- The prison.

1273
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:36,520
The Underground Prison is in the front,
right?

1274
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:37,789
It's that way.

1275
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:38,989
Here?

1276
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,460
Is it blocked by this?

1277
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,960
It is. You're right.

1278
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,189
- It's the one.
- There are stairs down here.

1279
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,489
- Are there stairs?
- We can break it open.

1280
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,399
- I don't think it'll break.
- I think we can go in...

1281
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,960
- if we push it aside.
- Will it break?

1282
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:53,229
- Should we do it together?
- Yes, let's pull it.

1283
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,369
In 1, 2, 3.

1284
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,970
Did you get it?

1285
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,140
- The sound is too loud!
- In 1, 2, 3.

1286
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,310
Watch your hand. Go up.

1287
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,840
In 1, 2, 3.

1288
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:03,340
The sound isn't so loud.

1289
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,850
- Can't you go in yet?
- I can squeeze in now.

1290
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,420
Can you go?

1291
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,750
Let's try opening it wider.

1292
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:12,550
Careful.

1293
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:14,020
You got hurt yesterday too.

1294
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,359
(Kyung Ran enters the prison.)

1295
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,250
(Knocking)

1296
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,579
What?

1297
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,520
Hello.

1298
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:46,520
I can't see anything.

1299
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:49,819
Hello.

1300
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,359
Are you here to give me ice?

1301
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:54,960
Yes.

1302
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,229
You'll give me ice?

1303
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,369
Can you speak?

1304
01:09:58,369 --> 01:09:59,630
Give us a moment.

1305
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,539
Wait here.

1306
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:05,840
(Knocking)

1307
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,310
(Xitsuh doesn't respond.)

1308
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,609
Xitsuh.

1309
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,380
Xitsuh, wake up.

1310
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:16,819
Xitsuh!

1311
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,020
Xitsuh!

1312
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,750
- What?
- Wake up.

1313
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:22,119
You have a guest.

1314
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,520
Hi.

1315
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:25,359
Sorry?

1316
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,960
I'm Kyung Ran.

1317
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,829
It's Kyung Ran.

1318
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,130
- It's Kyung Ran.
- Kyung Ran!

1319
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,399
What are you doing here?

1320
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,039
- I went to the Deathmatch,
- Okay.

1321
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:43,210
and I was eliminated.

1322
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,550
- Okay.
- But it was 2 on 2.

1323
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:47,250
It was 2 on 2, and you were eliminated?

1324
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:49,720
- Steve and I were a team,
- Okay.

1325
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,989
- and as an assistant player...
- Yes.

1326
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:54,359
Where's Steve?

1327
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:56,119
He joined a new team.

1328
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,460
A new team?

1329
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,300
How did you end up here, Yurisa?

1330
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,859
- How did I end up here?
- Yes.

1331
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,199
My team sent me here.

1332
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:05,930
Why did they send you here?

1333
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,500
Why? We were told to send one player.

1334
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,069
I see. Just a minute.

1335
01:11:09,069 --> 01:11:10,300
Can you get me
a toothpaste and a toothbrush?

1336
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,539
All right.

1337
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,649
They're Yurisa and Xitsuh.

1338
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,350
- We need to save Xitsuh, then.
- Yes.

1339
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,020
Careful.

1340
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,119
- I'm out.
- Good?

1341
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,619
They're Yurisa and Xitsuh.

1342
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:27,760
Let's save Xitsuh.

1343
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,590
- Xitsuh said he lost.
- Okay.

1344
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:30,920
It's good, then.

1345
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,229
Let's hurry before they wake up.

1346
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:34,800
- I'll go, so wait here.
- Go on.

1347
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,729
- We'll wait here. Okay. Hurry.
- All of you, stay here.

1348
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:38,130
- My bag.
- Go on.

1349
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,630
The Hidden Rule key first.

1350
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,069
(The Paradise players are still asleep.)

1351
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,239
- You'll walk in with confidence?
- Yes, I'm a crew member now.

1352
01:11:49,909 --> 01:11:51,250
- I'll be back.
- Stay calm.

1353
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,609
- Good luck.
- Okay.

1354
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:57,819
(Chungju-Man enters by himself
as planned.)

1355
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,789
- Now, we need to think.
- Who were there?

1356
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:03,460
Yurisa and Xitsuh.

1357
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,760
I say Xitsuh because we need men.

1358
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,390
We must rescue Xitsuh.

1359
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,760
- He's our asset.
- Yes.

1360
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,270
It would be good
to have Yurisa on our team...

1361
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,640
in a sense.

1362
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:18,340
But I doubt that she can do well
in group activities.

1363
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,770
- I agree with you.
- Think hard about that.

1364
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,039
She certainly has strengths, though.

1365
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,239
I just thought,

1366
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,810
"We need to save Xitsuh."

1367
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,550
But about Yurisa,

1368
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:30,079
I wasn't sure
if she was a friend or a foe.

1369
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,489
I believed she was unpredictable,

1370
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:34,689
so I was against saving her.

1371
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:37,689
We were certain about bringing Xitsuh.

1372
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:41,399
But we hadn't met Yurisa before,

1373
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,000
so we didn't know
what type of person she'd be.

1374
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:48,739
(Chungju-Man approaches
the building of the Paradise.)

1375
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:04,149
(Their number-one objective:
Hidden Rule key in the 3rd-floor lounge)

1376
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:11,560
(3rd floor is
where the Paradise players stay.)

1377
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:26,069
(The siren went off out of the blue.)

1378
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:30,279
What? Why is it ringing already?

1379
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,479
Why did it already go off?

1380
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,949
Why now?

1381
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:38,250
There's no way it's been 20 minutes.

1382
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,319
I thought, "We're doomed."

1383
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:41,560
It went off as soon as I stepped on it,

1384
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,260
so I knew something was wrong.

1385
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,560
Was it like a minute
after Chungju-Man went?

1386
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,859
The intruder alert went off so loudly...

1387
01:13:49,899 --> 01:13:52,829
that even we could hear it.

1388
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,100
We were like, "I thought the siren
was supposed to go off after 20 minutes."

1389
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,140
"Was there an error?"

1390
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,640
I also realized
that things had gone wrong.

1391
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,140
It had gone absolutely wrong.

1392
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:03,840
An outsider has broken into the house.

1393
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:06,149
Protect the keys...

1394
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:08,880
inside the 3 safe boxes
within the 90-minute time limit.

1395
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,920
What?

1396
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,590
What's going on now?

1397
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:30,100
(The siren wakes up the Paradise players.)

1398
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,170
There are a few terrible sound effects...

1399
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:35,340
on Bloody Game 3.

1400
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,609
The hissing sound and...

1401
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,479
It's like
Master's and Ph.D. researchers...

1402
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:41,619
studied for a year what sound effects...

1403
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:43,220
would make people...

1404
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,649
feel unpleasant.

1405
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:47,890
"An outsider has broken into the house."

1406
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:50,260
"Protect the safe boxes." I heard that.

1407
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,689
I was so surprised
that I instantly got out of my bed.

1408
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:55,229
The people
who were in the Bloody Paradise...

1409
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,529
had gone to the Remaining Living Space.

1410
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:59,569
So, I thought,
"They came back to steal from the pantry."

1411
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,300
"I understand. They might want it."

1412
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:17,449
They said
an intruder broke into the house.

1413
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,560
I think they said
we had to secure some kind of key.

1414
01:15:23,289 --> 01:15:24,789
There's nothing to take from here.

1415
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:27,189
"An intruder has broken into the house."

1416
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,300
Where could they enter from?

1417
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,699
Come on.

1418
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:41,239
(Inspecting the safe box in the pantry)

1419
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,010
Even if they come in here...

1420
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,180
What?

1421
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:47,050
Let's turn this around,

1422
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,619
so even if they come in here,
they can't try to open it.

1423
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:51,350
Turn it around?

1424
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,550
- They might not...
- "What?"

1425
01:15:53,989 --> 01:15:55,819
"Where did it go?"
Is that what you expect them to do?

1426
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:58,329
- Well...
- They'll turn it the moment they see it.

1427
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:01,060
Well, if we turn it around,
it will buy us some time...

1428
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:02,899
when they try to crack it open.

1429
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:10,270
(Joo Eon Kyu comes outside.)

1430
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,010
Do you see anyone from there, Eon Kyu?

1431
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,079
Everyone got up after hearing the warning.
This is hilarious.

1432
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,449
What's going on?

1433
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,060
Someone came out.

1434
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,390
Someone came out. He's watching.

1435
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:32,989
Squat down.

1436
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,760
- Let's go to the back for now.
- What's he doing?

1437
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,470
I saw a guy trying to spot
if there was anyone from afar.

1438
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,600
But why did the siren go off now?

1439
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,239
You know what? Given what's happened,

1440
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:48,579
I'm 100 percent sure he got caught.

1441
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,680
He'd totally get caught, 100 percent.

1442
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,810
Think about what happened to us yesterday.

1443
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,149
How could you not come out
after hearing the siren?

1444
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:03,489
(The siren went off when Team Remaining
was robbing the Mansion.)

1445
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:08,329
- We have to do something.
- Right, we have to do something.

1446
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,430
- What should we take?
- But it just went off.

1447
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,630
No, listen. It just went off.

1448
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:14,199
They must be the most cautious right now.

1449
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,699
- Right. If we go in now...
- It just went off.

1450
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,239
But what could we do
even if we were to go in?

1451
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:20,039
- Let's stay put for a bit...
- We'll get caught no matter what.

1452
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:21,710
- Yes. Let's wait for a bit.
- because we have 90 minutes.

1453
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,479
If something were to go south,

1454
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:24,510
we must at least take the key...

1455
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,649
- to the cell.
- Yes.

1456
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,050
We have to turn right once we enter.

1457
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:28,420
So there's hope.

1458
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,579
I'll go alone and take a peek.

1459
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:45,899
(Joo Eon Kyu heads to the stone wall.)

1460
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:49,000
Darn it.

1461
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:51,970
- If...
- One of them is coming this way.

1462
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,239
One of them is coming this way.

1463
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:55,510
- He's coming around from the back.
- He's coming from the back.

1464
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,810
Darn it.

1465
01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:01,579
We're doomed.

1466
01:18:01,779 --> 01:18:03,319
- Did he see you?
- No, he didn't.

1467
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,149
He was just heading that way.

1468
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:08,020
It's not just a couple of people
who are up right now.

1469
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,789
My gosh,
Chungju-Man must have gotten caught.

1470
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:13,159
- I'm 100 percent sure he got caught.
- We can't even enter now.

1471
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,159
No one is in here, right?

1472
01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:22,770
(The players are searching every nook
and corner of the Bloody Paradise.)

1473
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,090
They were just idiots.

1474
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:41,590
(Chuckling)

1475
01:18:43,289 --> 01:18:47,460
(Even when the siren went off...)

1476
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,760
Things were already in motion.

1477
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,430
Should I turn around
and come up with a different plan?

1478
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:55,699
That didn't make sense.

1479
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,739
More people would wake up
once more time went by.

1480
01:18:58,739 --> 01:18:59,939
I made a judgment call that...

1481
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:01,909
getting there as quickly as possible
would be my best option.

1482
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:02,979
So I went up right away.

1483
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:06,109
I marched to the beat of your own drum
to the third floor.

1484
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,479
Gosh, what is it this time?

1485
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,859
(Chatting)

1486
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,140
Wait, the warning wasn't for us, right?

1487
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,149
Actually, when I went up,
I ran into Steve.

1488
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,449
I don't know why he was up.

1489
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:42,649
I mean, I don't even know
what he was doing there.

1490
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,590
I tried to avoid him.
That's when things got tough for a bit.

1491
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,710
They said
an intruder broke into the house.

1492
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,739
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

1493
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:35,800
(Hong Jin Ho and Steve Yea
go down to the 2nd floor.)

1494
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:53,819
This isn't going to work.

1495
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:11,199
(Joo Eon Kyu goes downstairs
without suspecting anything.)

1496
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:14,810
Gosh, that startled me.

1497
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:19,050
(Pani Bottle and Choi Hye Seon
go back to sleep.)

1498
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,949
Well, it was weird.

1499
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:23,420
I didn't understand what they said.
They said something about 90 minutes.

1500
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,949
It wasn't a game. I was sleeping too.

1501
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:26,149
So I went back to sleep.

1502
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:28,090
I thought the siren...

1503
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:30,789
was an alarm to wake us up.

1504
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:32,829
So I ignored it and kept sleeping.

1505
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:48,840
(Lim Hyun Seo is still on the 3rd floor.)

1506
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:04,920
(Stopping)

1507
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:12,399
(Lim Hyun Seo walks
toward Chungju-Man's direction.)

1508
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,550
(Glancing)

1509
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,050
(Thinking)

1510
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:58,350
(He enters the 3rd-floor lounge.)

1511
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:16,399
(The passcode is incorrect.)

1512
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:20,329
(Tossing and turning)

1513
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,479
(The key to the Hidden Rule is
in the safe box.)

1514
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:35,550
(Hidden Rule)

1515
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:40,420
(Obtaining the key to the Hidden Rule)

1516
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:04,779
I mean, the siren should keep ringing
if it was going to ring at all.

1517
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:07,210
- It should've rung a little longer.
- Hey, you.

1518
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,310
(The players are gathered
on the 2nd floor.)

1519
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:10,479
What did it say?

1520
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,050
Do you see anyone from there, Eon Kyu?

1521
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,220
I was so scared.

1522
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,529
But I couldn't get nervous
while walking past them.

1523
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:20,829
I went down through the middle staircase.

1524
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,630
So no one would have seen that coming.

1525
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,930
Everyone got up, though. This is so funny.

1526
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,789
- Maybe it was a false alarm.
- What?

1527
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:50,789
- What is it?
- I thought that was Chungju-Man.

1528
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,430
- What?
- I thought that was Chungju-Man.

1529
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,689
He would have covered up his face
before coming here.

1530
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,399
So if anyone were to come...

1531
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:03,640
(Chungju-Man gets out
of the Bloody Paradise safely.)

1532
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:43,210
I mean, this is great.
We have nothing to worry about.

1533
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,380
Something has gone wrong.

1534
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:51,779
- Right. So we should...
- Wait.

1535
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,850
What? He's back.

1536
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:58,260
Darn it.

1537
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,689
(Tossing)

1538
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,760
How did he pull this off?

1539
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,159
- What's this?
- Is this the key to the prison?

1540
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:06,770
- It's for the Hidden Rule.
- The Hidden Rule.

1541
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:08,939
- The Hidden Rule.
- Did they think you're with the staff?

1542
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,539
- Gosh, seriously?
- They thought you were with the staff?

1543
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:11,800
No, I almost fooled them.

1544
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,539
- No. I mean, I almost got caught.
- You almost got caught?

1545
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:15,880
- Why?
- Steve was there.

1546
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,380
To be honest, I didn't think...

1547
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,880
I would be able to make it out
without getting caught.

1548
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,109
I wasn't sure if I could do it either.

1549
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,479
To be honest, I didn't know.

1550
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:23,220
But here's the thing.

1551
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,119
Every neighborhood has at least one guy
who resembles Chungju-Man.

1552
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:27,390
So I couldn't be certain...

1553
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:30,020
because there could have been someone
in the neighborhood who resembled...

1554
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,430
Chungju-Man. And he just
happened to be strolling around.

1555
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:34,859
A lot of them woke up, right?

1556
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:36,899
- A good number of people got up.
- Right?

1557
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:38,199
There are some people
at the main entrance.

1558
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:40,399
You know what?
You did a great job with our first task.

1559
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:42,000
- You were amazing.
- Yes.

1560
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,439
- We can...
- We've done enough with this.

1561
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:44,569
- You know what? Right now...
- Let's just stick with this.

1562
01:26:44,569 --> 01:26:47,010
- No. But...
- We have a lot of time anyway.

1563
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:48,340
But they didn't recognize you
when you walked past them?

1564
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,979
First of all, they don't even know...

1565
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:52,750
- we took this from their house.
- Let's keep this safe. They don't know.

1566
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:53,949
So let's keep it hidden.

1567
01:26:53,949 --> 01:26:55,010
But we could get caught.

1568
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,619
- They might go and check.
- Right.

1569
01:26:56,779 --> 01:26:59,350
- They're only guarding the entrance now.
- Do they know where the safe box is?

1570
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,420
Yes. They put liquor and everything there.

1571
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,760
But we can't stall too much time...

1572
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,119
because they started to stand guard
around the house.

1573
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:06,260
What are you doing?

1574
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,899
Darn it. It's Hyun Seo.

1575
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:16,770
(Lim Hyun Seo spots the players
from the Mansion.)

1576
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,270
Come here. Let's go.

1577
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:23,840
No, you might get hurt.

1578
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:25,079
Darn it.

1579
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,850
Put the key in your bra or underwear.

1580
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:32,390
(Bloody Game 3)

1581
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:40,789
(Epilogue)

1582
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,939
There was an area
that seemed suspicious from Day One.

1583
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:53,869
A plastic sheet or something
was covering it up,

1584
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:56,409
so we couldn't see through
what was inside.

1585
01:27:56,409 --> 01:28:00,449
(Safety First)

1586
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:05,689
I saw a lock on the door.

1587
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:07,420
The lock was pretty sturdy.

1588
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:09,859
I thought about it for a split second.

1589
01:28:09,859 --> 01:28:12,729
"If there's a lock,
it means people can't go in and out."

1590
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,029
I thought about it.

1591
01:28:19,329 --> 01:28:22,340
As it so happens, I was wearing a hairpin.

1592
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:26,140
So I opened the lock.

1593
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,920
I used the hairpin to open the lock
and went in.

1594
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:53,970
When I went down,

1595
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:56,270
I saw abandoned rooms.

1596
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:59,069
The second floor was full
of abandoned rooms. I was surprised.

1597
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:00,270
I was really shocked.

1598
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,210
The rooms overwhelmed me.

1599
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,479
Then two of the rooms...

1600
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,310
had metal bars.

1601
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,880
I thought I should go and check them out,
so I did.

1602
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,220
Then I saw a man.

1603
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,949
At first, I couldn't see well
because it was so dark.

1604
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:16,659
I thought it was Pani Bottle
who got eliminated.

1605
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:18,560
He had a similar hairstyle.

1606
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,359
It was dark inside, and he was lying down.

1607
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,859
Pani.

1608
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,159
Pani.

1609
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:26,729
What?

1610
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:28,369
Yes.

1611
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,500
But it wasn't Pani.

1612
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:32,609
I didn't recognize his face.

1613
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:34,409
- Who are you?
- What?

1614
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:35,439
Who are you?

1615
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,880
Who are you?

1616
01:29:37,409 --> 01:29:38,479
- Me?
- Yes.

1617
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:42,079
My name is Yurisa.

1618
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:43,279
- Yurisa?
- Yes.

1619
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:44,350
I see.

1620
01:29:44,449 --> 01:29:47,850
- I'm Kim Young Kwang.
- Yes.

1621
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:49,789
Nice to meet you.
Should I get you anything?

1622
01:29:49,789 --> 01:29:51,119
- No.
- Okay.

1623
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,430
- By the way,
- Yes.

1624
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:54,529
- the other cell is empty, right?
- Yes.

1625
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,329
- Someone will come here, right?
- Someone will?

1626
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:59,500
I came here after getting eliminated.

1627
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,670
After the Deathmatch.

1628
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,670
What?
Who was your opponent in the Deathmatch?

1629
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,869
Was it a girl?

1630
01:30:04,869 --> 01:30:06,310
What was his name?

1631
01:30:06,369 --> 01:30:07,770
Wasn't it a guy at first?

1632
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,439
A man came?

1633
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:11,479
- Did you do the Deathmatch with that guy?
- Yes.

1634
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:13,850
I don't know his name.

1635
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,409
Was he a Hong?

1636
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,250
Right. Wasn't that him?

1637
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,319
- Hong Jin Ho?
- No?

1638
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,659
I didn't give her a straight answer
on purpose.

1639
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:25,460
I thought she might have come
to spy on our team.

1640
01:30:25,789 --> 01:30:27,560
To figure out who was on our team.

1641
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:29,130
I acted as if I didn't know Hong Jin Ho...

1642
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,859
and didn't give her a clear answer.

1643
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:32,529
I don't know.

1644
01:30:32,529 --> 01:30:34,729
- I'm bad with names.
- How did he look?

1645
01:30:35,569 --> 01:30:37,300
Was he a bit chubby and round?

1646
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,010
- Was he?
- Did he have a likable face?

1647
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,479
I have a hard time
recognizing people's faces.

1648
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:46,449
Then let me bring you a towel
and some cold water.

1649
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:50,149
People are sleeping.
I'll see if I can bring them for you.

1650
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:51,350
- See you later.
- Okay.

1651
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,189
I feel kind of bad now that I think of it.

1652
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:02,090
Yurisa's intention with me was genuine.

1653
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,029
She approached me to help me.

1654
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:06,300
Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

1655
