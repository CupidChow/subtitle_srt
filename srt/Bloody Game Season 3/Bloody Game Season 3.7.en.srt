00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,069
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,250
He's here. It's over.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,179
What happened? Come on in.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,880
What happened?

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,419
- He's here.
- What?

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,420
- Is he here?
- Yes.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,059
Okay.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,219
He looks happy.

9
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,129
What is it?

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,730
- What happened?
- What happened?

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,500
- Zero wins.
- Zero wins?

12
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,199
- Did you win?
- We won.

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,870
- What? Did we win?
- We won.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
Hey, but Paradise used up
both their 100 and 0 cards.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,039
Yes!

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,280
No one used their double chance, right?

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,450
- No, they used their double.
- They did?

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,479
- That's crazy. They used all their items.
- We won.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,130
This is why I play survival games.

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,159
The catharsis.

21
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,759
It feels like getting to go on leave
from the army...

22
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,929
as a reward for being the best shooter.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,010
This is why I'm here on Bloody Game.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,180
This is a pretty big blow.

25
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,879
How does it make sense that
Mansion brought 6, 7, and 8 blue?

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,620
- I know.
- Those fools.

27
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,420
If it weren't all blue cards,

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,189
they would've had a win too.

29
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,359
I know.

30
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,989
I don't get how they were going to
get a win with all blue cards.

31
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,530
This play doesn't make any sense.

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,099
Mansion and Remaining
could have joined hands.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,799
But we can't talk to each other.

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Before that.

35
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,040
- Before that?
- Still, that's impossible.

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,310
- We couldn't talk after getting cards.
- They couldn't have talked.

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,579
Is that so? Then are they just trolls?

38
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,549
I can't even believe this.

39
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,120
This is really...

40
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,959
There was a chance
that our guess might lose,

41
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,459
so we predicted that.

42
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,560
If only they had just brought
another color card,

43
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,760
Team Remaining couldn't take a point.

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,770
But it ended up that they took a point
just because we lost.

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,569
Did I misread the cards? Hang on.

46
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,969
Why? You can't do that.

47
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,379
That will make everything complicated.
You can't do that.

48
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,419
I was totally having a breakdown
after losing the first game.

49
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,219
Goodness.

50
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,889
I couldn't believe this situation.

51
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,259
I just couldn't believe it.

52
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,629
I really couldn't believe it.

53
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,199
Did I really go through this experience?

54
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,259
Is this right?

55
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,599
My gosh. Really.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,009
I think I felt shaken up a bit.

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,409
It's not easy to be this unlucky.

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,479
It was a round
where we couldn't win with any card.

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,280
The dealer's card makes
such a huge difference.

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,020
That's too much of a variable.

61
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,550
What about the others?

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,990
I'll tell you Paradise's cards.

63
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,389
Red 16, 0, and 100.

64
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,990
- What?
- My goodness.

65
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,159
They used both 0 and 100
and got minus 10 points?

66
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,300
What did they just do?

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,870
They're totally ruined.

68
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,599
They're the ones who should be crying.

69
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,199
- Paradise is ruined.
- They're the same as us.

70
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,240
- It's not the same.
- Hey, let's bring them...

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,909
Let's make it our mission
to drag them down with us.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,009
Anyway, okay.
Paradise used their double chance.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,479
After this round,

74
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,680
these two teams, Paradise and Mansion,

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,449
have already lost their chance to win.

76
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,289
They'll go for a strategy
to at least get second place.

77
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,650
Then,

78
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,719
we can basically decide the losing team.

79
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,289
You're right.

80
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,560
Goodness.

81
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,259
We're in that position now.

82
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,800
Which team should we target?

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,639
- Paradise, definitely.
- We should target Paradise.

84
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,139
Then, Paradise already used
their 0 and 100 cards...

85
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,840
- And their 16.
- and their 16.

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,710
They also used their double chance
but still got ruined.

87
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,349
They have to go for getting two wins
this time.

88
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,949
Paradise is going to go for two wins.

89
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,719
We'll have to go for two wins.

90
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,580
(Paradise Cards)

91
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,590
We have to win a lot
if we're to get seven wins.

92
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,819
Hang on. If we're to get two wins...

93
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,759
(Jang Dong Min's prediction
came true again.)

94
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,430
We have two options.

95
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,829
Will we go for the safe bet?

96
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,199
Or will we challenge ourselves again...

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,470
and take down Paradise for good?

98
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,339
But rather than keeping
the other teams in check,

99
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,069
we could get seven points as we aimed for.

100
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,779
That would set us apart
from the others too.

101
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,310
Betting that we'll only get a small win
doesn't sound that bad either.

102
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,680
One point? All right.
Then, let's go for the one-point strategy.

103
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,250
We will now begin Round Three.

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,129
What are you guys doing?

105
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,329
What? What do you mean by that?

106
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,759
You're making
such weird card combinations.

107
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,069
- You're no joke either.
- What are you talking about?

108
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,740
- We're like...
- We're playing the optimal cards.

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,939
- We just had bad luck.
- We were going, "What is Paradise doing?"

110
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,170
What are you talking about?

111
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,180
- You brought out blue 6, 7, and 8...
- How could you bring a zero...

112
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,939
How could you bring out
the 0 and 100 together?

113
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,480
You have to bring both together.

114
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,649
Oh, why?

115
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,250
Totally losing one game
and then winning another?

116
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,149
There's no reason to explain this.

117
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,490
- Don't talk about it.
- But you were wrong.

118
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,189
It was wrong in conclusion.

119
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,990
If not for the 100,
we would've won that round.

120
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,220
Stop minding us.

121
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,930
We'll do fine on our own.

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,730
- Hi.
- Hello.

123
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,170
- Hey.
- Steve is really upset right now.

124
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,769
I'm upset because of you guys.
Did you see their cards?

125
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:34,839
They don't make any sense.

126
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,339
- Which ones? Did I see their cards?
- Yes.

127
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:37,579
We just played our game.

128
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,110
- With our skills.
- It's not about that.

129
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,209
We played our game with skills.

130
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,709
What nonsense are you saying?
Did you see which cards they played?

131
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,620
We predicted everything.

132
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,720
That they'd play 6, 7, and 8 blue?

133
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,850
How can you predict that?
That makes no sense.

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,060
We will begin Round Three.

135
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,490
Acau will go first as he brought...

136
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,100
the lowest cards.

137
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
(Mansion cards)

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,529
I will reveal an open card.

139
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,370
It's a blue 12.

140
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,569
Actually, in Round Three,
I was going to win...

141
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,040
the points I wanted to win
with some mediocre cards.

142
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,779
Please predict your wins for Round Three.

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,550
Team Paradise, two wins.

144
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,550
Team Mansion, one win.

145
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,149
Team Remaining, one win.

146
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,420
Will Team Remaining use your double item?

147
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,389
We will not use the double item.

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,189
What?

149
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:33,970
I have to kill Acau.

150
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,670
He's not an alligator. He's a snake.

151
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,100
Destroying the other teams' mentality...

152
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,139
was another important point in this game.

153
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,509
We will begin the game.

154
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,579
The first player, Acau,
please place your card.

155
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,180
It's a blue nine.

156
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,389
Next, Steve Yea. It's a blue 13.

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,290
Next, Lee Gina. Please place your card.

158
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,160
It's a yellow nine.

159
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,329
Steve Yea won this turn.

160
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,100
We will proceed with the next turn.

161
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,470
I will reveal an open card.

162
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,540
It's a red 15.

163
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,310
Steve, you won the last turn.

164
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,740
You will place your card first.

165
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,550
The dealer's card was the red 15.

166
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,250
I had a red 11.

167
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,279
Everything else had been played
other than the red 12.

168
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,089
I thought it was highly likely
that our team would win again.

169
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,360
It's a red 11.

170
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
(Mansion cards)

171
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,430
We're so unlucky.

172
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,430
Lee Gina. Please place your card.

173
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,329
It's a red six.

174
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,500
Acau, please place your card.

175
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,470
Steve played two high cards in a row.

176
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,240
What could we do to win?

177
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,550
It's a green 11.

178
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,350
Out of the same color cards
as the dealer's card,

179
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,250
Steve Yea placed the highest number card.

180
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,589
You win this turn.

181
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,689
(Team Paradise wins the second turn.)

182
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,930
I made such a huge mistake
in the second turn.

183
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,139
Even when we have these two blue cards,

184
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,110
there are 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16.

185
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,209
So, we could lose with this.

186
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,050
We have to get at least one win.

187
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,449
It won't be easy to get a win with blue.

188
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,620
We should take the 11 card.

189
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,990
The green 11?

190
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,950
- Yes, the green 11.
- Yes, let's take the green 11.

191
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,190
It's a green 11.

192
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,129
Steve Yea wins this turn.

193
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,399
(The second turn ended with
Team Paradise's win.)

194
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,200
If there were several people
who played the 100,

195
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,500
there's a rule where the player who placed
the same number later wins.

196
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,399
At the time, I was so nervous...

197
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,309
that I was mistaken that this rule
applied to all cards.

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,909
So, for a second, I thought I would win.

199
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,179
(The only card Acau has left, blue 4)

200
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,519
The blue four was a card I took to lose.

201
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,620
Darn it. I ruined it.

202
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,990
I will reveal an open card.

203
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,419
(The final turn in Round 3)

204
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,629
- There's no other choice.
- Steve Yea, please place your card.

205
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,360
It's a green four.

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,059
Lee Gina, it's a green 13.

207
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,730
Acau, it's a blue four.

208
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,870
It's Acau's win.

209
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,409
(Team Remaining wins the third turn.)

210
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,909
Gosh, I got so lucky.

211
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,279
(Just now)

212
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,750
(The third open card)

213
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,580
Out of the same color cards
as the open card,

214
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,090
which was blue, Acau placed
the highest number card of four.

215
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,490
Acau wins this turn.

216
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,289
If I hadn't made a mistake
and played the correct cards,

217
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:48,559
I would've lost this round.

218
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,460
But it was actually fortunate
that I made a mistake.

219
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,059
Luck was on my side this time too.

220
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,440
The open card just had to be a blue
to save him.

221
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,070
- I know.
- Seriously. This makes no sense.

222
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,110
- Probability wise...
- You're a lucky man.

223
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,110
Probability? Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,250
You're lucky.

225
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,080
You had only one blue card left,
and the open card was blue too.

226
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,120
You won a turn with a four.

227
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,019
- They used up all the blue cards,
- That was...

228
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,490
- so there were barely any blue ones.
- That was seriously...

229
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,519
- There weren't many blue cards.
- pure luck.

230
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,389
That was purely lucky.

231
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,889
- Hey, you were just lucky.
- How could it be blue?

232
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,159
You're so lucky.

233
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,659
My gosh!

234
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,070
(Round 3 Result)

235
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,429
(Paradise: Success, Mansion: Failure)

236
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,200
(Remaining: Success)

237
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,470
Is it over already?

238
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,970
Did we win?

239
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,340
I made a mistake, but that was actually...

240
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,940
- "Actually?"
- a lucky move.

241
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,509
- I won with blue four.
- Okay.

242
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,049
- You won with the four? That's crazy!
- I won with the four!

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,250
Their mistake became a lucky move.

244
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,990
Gosh, this makes no sense.

245
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,190
I'm losing my cool. Our luck is doomed.

246
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:56,529
This is a game we can't lose.
How can it go like this?

247
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,460
I seriously don't want to play this game.

248
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,500
We're pretty much done for now.

249
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,740
We're pretty much doomed.

250
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,769
Right.

251
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,309
Before beginning Round Four,

252
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,509
come and hand in
your total win predictions.

253
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:15,779
So, what should we do
for the total win that's worth 30 points?

254
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,120
- Will we go for 7 or 6 wins?
- We have 3 wins so far, right?

255
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,519
- Yes.
- We have three wins now.

256
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,289
I think we can stay with seven wins.

257
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,820
But here's the problem.

258
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,360
We can win with this.
And we can play these two green ones.

259
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,789
This is the issue.

260
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,860
I think this might come up.

261
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,129
Even if it does...

262
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,129
(Steve thinks it's hard to get
4 more wins with the remaining cards.)

263
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,700
- If we get three more...
- So, you want to play it safe...

264
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
and change to six wins, right?

265
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,970
That's right.

266
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,340
All right, then.

267
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,909
We don't have to come in first right now.

268
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,639
I think we should go the safe route
and switch to six wins.

269
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,509
- So, we'll switch?
- That's better.

270
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,850
Rather than going for the 20,000 dollars,

271
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,309
it's more important that
we don't become elimination candidates.

272
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,049
We failed in Round Two,
where we played a big chance...

273
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,789
with the double item.

274
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,889
Then, Team Remaining...

275
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,889
kept taking points with unimaginable luck.

276
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,190
I thought it might be hard to
finish in first place.

277
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,929
We went with a strategy
of not coming in last.

278
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,730
So, we wanted to go with
6 wins and 7 wins at either end.

279
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,730
That was why we switched to six wins.

280
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,200
Look at this.

281
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,799
We have to switch to six wins this time.

282
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,070
We have to do that and play defense.

283
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,809
If Paradise switches to six wins,

284
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,679
and if they actually win 6,
they'll get 30 points.

285
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,809
That's right.

286
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,879
- You get what I mean, right?
- Oh, I get it.

287
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,179
- We need to play defense.
- So, we'll either win...

288
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,320
fifty or thirty points, right?

289
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,490
- I think this makes sense.
- I think so too.

290
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,649
We need to play defense.

291
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,990
We can stay with 7 wins
or switch to 6 wins. It doesn't matter.

292
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,090
We'll switch to six wins,
and so will they.

293
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,830
You get what I mean, right?

294
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,259
And they have no choice but to stay.

295
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,870
That's the only choice they have.

296
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,129
Six sounds good.

297
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,570
Gosh, how do we solve this?

298
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,279
First of all, we have to get a win,
no matter what.

299
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,019
The way to get three wins...

300
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,820
I don't think
we can reveal this card first.

301
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,419
- Right.
- Yes.

302
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,120
That could be right.

303
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,889
Let's think this through slowly.

304
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,129
We will now make final win predictions.

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,870
All teams,
please place your cards at the same time.

306
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,539
Reveal your cards.

307
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,139
Team Paradise, six wins.

308
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,309
Team Remaining, six wins.

309
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,809
Team Mansion...

310
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,690
Team Mansion stayed with six, right?

311
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,259
- Mansion? Four.
- Yes.

312
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,330
- What?
- What?

313
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,460
Team Mansion,
your prediction is four wins.

314
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,830
How did you come up with four?

315
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,399
That means they'll only take 1 win
out of 9 matches.

316
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,000
- But you can't just get it...
- Is that their final answer?

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,240
because you want it.

318
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,610
- Exactly.
- You need to go with the same color.

319
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,809
Gosh.

320
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,240
What?

321
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,580
We predicted Team Paradise to go with six,

322
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,549
just like us.
But Team Mansion chose four wins.

323
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,820
Team Mansion chose four wins?

324
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:07,789
Four wins?

325
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,419
Gosh.

326
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,360
Four wins?

327
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,389
- How many wins in this round...
- They're insane.

328
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,100
They threw all of us into confusion.

329
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,169
Four wins?

330
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes. It makes no sense.

331
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,210
I believe that they chose...

332
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,980
the best possible option
with the cards they had.

333
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,110
I reckoned there would be...

334
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,580
a keen strategy within that decision.

335
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,720
I'll need to...

336
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,919
think harder and analyze their mindset.

337
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,360
Which cards should we choose?

338
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,960
The problem is getting four wins.

339
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,629
Just pick three cards for me.

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,730
Give me the bad ones,
and I'll make do with them.

341
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,230
Let's take these and aim at one win.

342
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,799
These three? Then, I'll see
how it goes with the rest.

343
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,769
The team's win was more important,

344
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,879
so I thought it was better
for them to take...

345
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,250
the good ones...

346
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,350
and leave me with the rest.

347
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,919
I told them I'd make do.

348
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,519
This is the only way
to avoid getting negative points.

349
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,190
- To earn ten points, at least.
- Yes, I agree.

350
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,320
There's no doubt about that.

351
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,190
- It's better to take one win.
- Yes.

352
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,659
The strategy to take one win...

353
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,830
- I don't think these are too bad.
- Right.

354
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,200
If there's a red card on the table,

355
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,240
we can definitely take one win.

356
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,000
But we'll be doomed
if there are two red cards.

357
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,269
How about these?

358
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,009
We have too many yellow cards.

359
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,480
We can take the yellow ten card.

360
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,379
Losing with this card is
the best-case scenario.

361
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,350
We just have to choose one.

362
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,879
I don't think we can come up
with a good strategy right now.

363
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,950
The players participating in Round Four,

364
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,590
please enter with your cards
for this round.

365
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,590
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

366
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,830
I'll be back.

367
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,870
- We'll give you energy.
- Good luck.

368
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,169
Good luck.

369
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,039
We're fine with whatever result.

370
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,080
Sure.

371
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,210
- I'll see you soon.
- It's fine.

372
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,679
- Okay.
- Good luck.

373
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,620
- Good luck out there.
- Good luck!

374
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,580
- Bye, Dong Min.
- You've got this.

375
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,149
Let's get our revenge.

376
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,710
Hi, everyone.

377
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,250
It's nice to see you all.

378
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,649
Oh, dear.

379
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,419
- How did we end up here?
- This is like a center for the elderly.

380
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,830
What is this?

381
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,460
How did this happen?

382
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,500
It's nice to see such familiar faces.

383
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,829
I really am glad to see you all.

384
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm so nervous that I want to pee.

385
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,440
You didn't stop by the bathroom?

386
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,640
I didn't.

387
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,279
Is it because you're nervous
or because you're facing me?

388
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,420
Come on.

389
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,720
I'll have to...

390
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,650
crush that guy today.

391
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,059
I thought, "He's intimidated by me."

392
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,789
"This should be fun."

393
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:39,099
I was suddenly glad,

394
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,230
and my heart started racing.

395
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,829
I'd love to beat Dong Min in this game.

396
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,170
Jin Ho.

397
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:49,839
You should pack your things today.

398
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,009
Round Four will begin.

399
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,279
Kyung Ran has brought the lowest number,

400
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,849
so she will go first.

401
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,289
I will reveal an open card.

402
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,720
(The first open card)

403
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,460
It's a blue five.

404
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,829
Blue five?

405
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,730
You will now predict
the number of wins in Round Four.

406
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,900
- Please turn them over.
- In 1, 2, 3.

407
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,200
Team Paradise predicts two wins.

408
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,000
Team Mansion predicts zero wins.

409
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,440
Team Remaining predicts one win.

410
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,579
I chose 0 wins, Dong Min 1 win,

411
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,079
and Jin Ho 2 wins.

412
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,509
It'd be perfect...

413
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,950
if all three of us got what we wanted.

414
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,619
That's an even distribution.

415
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,019
But we can't let that happen.

416
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,690
We had already made too many mistakes.

417
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,430
So, I needed to make them fail,

418
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,029
while I succeeded.

419
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,059
The game will begin.

420
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,099
The first player, Kyung Ran,
please submit your card.

421
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,009
Yellow four card.

422
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,680
Dong Min, submit your card.

423
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,079
We wanted one win.

424
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,319
Red five card.

425
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,720
Jin Ho, submit your card.

426
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,630
His vision must be blurry now.

427
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,670
I should give Kyung Ran a win.

428
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,569
Please do.

429
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,579
Jin Ho tried to trick us.

430
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,640
He provoked her.

431
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,279
"This brat."

432
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,349
I could feel my heart sink.

433
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,119
I thought, "Please don't have
a yellow one card."

434
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Yellow 11 card.

435
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
(Team Paradise submits a yellow 11 card.)

436
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,640
I predicted 2 wins,
so I wanted 1 win as soon as possible.

437
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,470
Among the yellow cards,
submitted by the first player,

438
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,710
Jin Ho has submitted
the highest number, 11,

439
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,640
and he has won this turn.

440
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,539
We will begin the next turn.

441
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,549
I will reveal an open card.

442
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,920
Green two card.

443
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,349
The winner of the previous turn,
Jin Ho, submit your card.

444
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,329
(Team Paradise's cards)

445
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,460
Green ten card.

446
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,930
Kyung Ran, submit your card.

447
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,269
Yellow two.

448
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,539
Dong Min, submit your card.

449
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,470
Red nine.

450
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,109
Among the green cards,
which is the open card,

451
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,880
Jin Ho has submitted
the highest number, ten,

452
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,250
and he has won this turn.

453
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,079
I had already won twice.

454
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,420
It was a good situation for me.

455
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,519
(And his remaining card is a low number.)

456
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,259
Jin Ho had two wins.

457
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,589
Kyung Ran had zero wins,

458
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,460
and I had zero wins.

459
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,859
If I get a win,

460
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,599
or Kyung Ran gets a win,

461
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,869
Team Paradise will be at an advantage.

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,410
The best-case scenario
in the third turn was...

463
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,539
Jin Ho winning the third time.

464
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,750
But Team Paradise is the first player.

465
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,019
Gosh.

466
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,619
We will begin the next turn.

467
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,589
I will reveal an open card.

468
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,690
(The third open card)

469
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,789
It's zero.

470
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,630
Unexpectedly,

471
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,099
the open card on the table was zero.

472
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,769
It was zero,

473
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,140
and yellow was the primary color,
which was mine.

474
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,799
It was just...

475
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,009
bad for me.

476
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,480
The winner of the previous turn, Jin Ho,

477
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,809
submit your card.

478
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,019
Yellow one.

479
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,019
Kyung Ran, submit your card.

480
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
I was hoping she'd lay down a yellow card.

481
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
(Team Mansion submits a 0 card.)

482
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,099
Zero.

483
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't think...

484
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,569
- they'll expect me to bring a zero card.
- Right.

485
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:15,369
(Jin Ho wasn't expecting Kyung Ran
to hold a 0 card.)

486
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,339
(Kyung Ran predicted correctly.)

487
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,779
Dong Min, submit your card.

488
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,880
But we'll be doomed
if there are two red cards.

489
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,250
How about these?

490
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,849
We have too many yellow cards.

491
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,390
We can take the yellow ten card.

492
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,250
Losing with this card is
the best-case scenario.

493
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,930
The pressure and fear...

494
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,359
I just couldn't watch it.

495
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,500
Round Four has ended.

496
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,569
Here he comes. He's here.

497
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,900
- Is he back?
- He's back.

498
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,740
- What? How did it go?
- Good work.

499
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,240
Did you win?

500
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,049
- Did you win?
- Dong Min.

501
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,349
- Share the result with us.
- What happened?

502
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,279
- Finally?
- Was it all right?

503
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,759
We were the only winner.

504
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
That's a relief.

505
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,759
Dong Min, submit your card.

506
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,269
Red 12.

507
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,240
I was doomed. I made a mistake.

508
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,910
The open card is zero,

509
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,309
so among the yellow cards,
submitted by the first player,

510
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,180
Jin Ho has submitted
the highest number, one,

511
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,450
and he has won this turn.

512
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,680
(Jin Ho fails to predict his wins.)

513
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:34,180
I guess I've been too eager
to defeat Dong Min...

514
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,789
since the beginning.

515
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,720
That led to my defeat.

516
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,730
I should have laid
down the yellow one card,

517
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,029
not the yellow 11 card.

518
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,400
I should have gotten one loss
with the yellow one card...

519
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,099
and given Kyung Ran a win...

520
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:51,400
to ruin her plan to get zero wins.

521
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,470
That would have been
the best decision for the team.

522
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,839
I was more focused on Dong Min...

523
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,380
than the team's win.

524
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,440
I foolishly thought,
"I'm going to defeat Dong Min today,"

525
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,079
for a brief moment.

526
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,019
I'm an idiot.
Anyway, that's what happened.

527
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,450
- Why did it have to be zero?
- I just can't beat you.

528
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,660
- This is really tough.
- Why did it have to be zero?

529
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,519
I just can't seem to defeat you.

530
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,529
Seriously. You're superb.

531
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,829
You beat me with number one.
What should people like me do?

532
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,029
Why did it have to be zero?

533
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,170
Oh, gosh. This is ridiculous.

534
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,799
Losing with a one card.

535
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,269
Getting a win with a one card.

536
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,039
That's my gift for you, kid.

537
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,009
I went through a lot to make that happen.

538
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,619
He got three wins,
and his prediction was wrong.

539
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,480
Team Remaining got zero wins,
and his prediction was wrong.

540
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,519
And my prediction came true.

541
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,589
I gave two of them negative points...

542
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,059
and earned points for the team.

543
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,559
(Paradise: 100, Mansion: 80,
Remaining: 150)

544
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,029
I could never beat them...

545
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,900
in "The Genius,"

546
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,970
and I finally beat them in this round.

547
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,670
It boosted the morale of my team too.

548
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,039
It felt...

549
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,440
really good.

550
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:10,609
It was the best possible result...

551
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,079
for our team in Round Four.

552
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,789
(Round 4 Result)

553
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,559
(Success Status)

554
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,660
(Paradise: Failure, Mansion: Success,
Remaining: Failure)

555
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,230
(Scores after Round 4)

556
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,900
(Paradise: 100, Mansion: 80,
Remaining: 150)

557
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,740
- How did it go?
- We lost points.

558
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,039
- We lost points?
- I predicted...

559
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,269
- two wins and one loss.
- Why?

560
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,910
- One win and two losses.
- It was one win and two losses.

561
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,680
No, that was my call at that moment.

562
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,279
But I won three times.

563
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
- What?
- What?

564
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,079
Our prediction was off...

565
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,420
in that round.

566
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,450
So, we couldn't place first.

567
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,160
I realized that one of our teammates
could be eliminated.

568
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,029
The open card was 0,
and Jin Ho put down a 1 card.

569
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,759
But he won because there was
no yellow card.

570
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:03,799
It would have gone wrong
if I had brought a yellow card.

571
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,869
Only bringing the red cards was
the right decision.

572
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,609
- That's amazing.
- How interesting.

573
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:11,710
But we have too many yellow cards left.
This would be hard to calculate.

574
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:17,279
(Remaining cards)

575
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,819
Anyhow, we have to get...

576
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,319
one more win, no matter what.

577
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,150
We have two more rounds left, right?

578
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm more worried about...

579
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,589
- Winning more?
- Yes.

580
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,099
They might not have...

581
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,359
such a variety of cards left.

582
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,430
- And Team Paradise will try to lose now.
- Yes.

583
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,599
- They already have six wins.
- Yes.

584
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,740
- They're going to throw the game.
- Yes.

585
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,240
Then, we can get 2 wins and 1 win...

586
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,680
to make it six wins.

587
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,980
- That's true.
- Then, let's keep winning.

588
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,349
- Sounds good.
- Should we?

589
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,720
You guys have gotten bolder
after playing out there.

590
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,849
But the possibilities are...
That's not it.

591
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,119
- We have a possibility.
- That's all we have left.

592
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,390
And it's all thanks to you.
It's because you won.

593
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,690
I'm so happy that Team Paradise lost...

594
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,589
- ten points.
- I'm so thankful.

595
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,930
Thanks, Steve.

596
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,299
(Groaning)

597
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,160
We should keep Team Mansion in check.

598
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,299
Our focus should be on stopping them
from getting the predicted score.

599
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,569
We need to stop them
from getting 3 wins or 1 win.

600
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,309
Should we go with three losses?

601
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,039
We can't win at this point.

602
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,809
In Rounds 5 and 6, we had to play...

603
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,150
with the remaining cards.

604
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,349
So, it was going to go...

605
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:28,490
as we planned,
given that we didn't make any mistakes.

606
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,289
Our best option is to get two wins...

607
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,059
in the next two rounds.

608
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,029
Do you think it's better
to get two wins...

609
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,660
- or one win?
- In this round?

610
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,599
I was going to get one win
with these cards.

611
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:43,099
We can't get one win in this round.

612
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,470
- We need two wins.
- Yes.

613
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,599
If we only get one win,

614
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,809
we have to get 2 or 3 wins...

615
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:51,910
in Round Six.

616
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,009
But if we get two wins here,

617
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,480
we can get 1 win or 2 wins.

618
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,019
But there will have to be two yellow cards
on the table...

619
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,480
if we want to take these cards.

620
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,589
Yes, that's why it's risky.

621
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,589
It's too risky.
We need to add a green card.

622
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,460
(Team Remaining's cards in Round 5)

623
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,490
Getting two wins with these cards?

624
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,460
- Can we do that?
- Just now,

625
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,700
- Jin Ho got a win with a one.
- Okay.

626
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,970
- Now...
- The point is what the open card is...

627
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,569
and what the first card is.

628
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,009
Seong Beom was very concerned...

629
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:25,039
because we only had
six cards to choose from.

630
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,410
He was like, "Will this work?
Will that work?"

631
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,880
I said, "Don't worry."

632
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,220
"If we have weak cards,
the opponents also have weak cards."

633
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,690
"We're equal.
We win if we have a solid strategy."

634
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:38,250
"So, don't worry, and get out there."

635
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,059
One more thing.

636
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:41,619
Do you want me to use
the double item or not?

637
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,160
- Use it.
- Use it.

638
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
The players participating in Round Five,

639
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,069
please gather at the Main Hall
with your cards for Round Five.

640
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,200
I will reveal an open card.

641
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,109
It's a yellow six.

642
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,539
Predict the number of your wins.

643
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,509
Team Paradise, zero wins.

644
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,349
Team Mansion, one win.

645
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,519
Team Remaining, two wins.

646
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,490
Team Remaining,
will you use the double item?

647
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,319
I will.

648
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:16,130
We'll have to see
how it goes in this round.

649
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,529
And then, we'll...

650
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,259
There was peace among us
as we got good cards.

651
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,970
But I've been beating myself up
for losing in Round Four.

652
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,240
And I was sure...

653
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,170
that I could win the Deathmatch.
I thought, "I'll go to the Deathmatch."

654
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,680
The 1st turn of Round 5.

655
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,109
Team Remaining has won.

656
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,079
The 2nd turn of Round 5.

657
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,849
Team Remaining has won.

658
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,549
The 3rd turn of Round 5.
Team Mansion has won.

659
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,460
Team Paradise predicted 0 wins
and got 0 wins.

660
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,559
Team Mansion predicted 1 win
and got 1 win.

661
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,500
Team Remaining predicted 2 wins
and got 2 wins.

662
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
- He's coming.
- Already?

663
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,069
I lost three times
and predicted correctly.

664
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,210
- Good.
- But there weren't any mistakes.

665
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,109
All the other teams
also predicted correctly.

666
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,380
- They did?
- Yes.

667
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,079
It was as I expected,

668
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,609
so I earned 60 points.

669
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,480
(Team Remaining increased
the difference with 210 points.)

670
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,950
- Yes!
- Come here.

671
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,220
Team Remaining was already the winner.

672
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:20,859
We were meant to win,
no matter what the possibilities were.

673
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,059
I had a huge dopamine rush.

674
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,960
I thought, "We'll be able to win
even with such bad cards."

675
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,670
After a long deliberation,

676
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,700
I predicted 1 win and got 1 win.

677
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,000
Great. That's what I'm talking about.

678
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,109
- We're catching up.
- Team Paradise has 110 points,

679
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,509
we have 100 points,

680
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,079
and Team Remaining has 210 points.

681
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,279
Team Remaining is going to be
the first player,

682
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,480
and we'll have to follow...

683
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,589
the cards that they play.

684
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
We'll be the first player.

685
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,190
But we can't choose a card...

686
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,119
because a yellow 8
and a yellow 10 are the same.

687
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,259
We can win...

688
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,160
only if the open card is
a yellow 13 or 14.

689
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,799
If that happens twice, we get two wins.

690
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,599
- Or...
- If it happens once, we get one win.

691
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,240
That will make it a total of six wins.

692
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:09,210
We can only get 2 wins
because of the 0 card.

693
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,039
- If...
- That's our maximum.

694
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,779
If we get zero wins,

695
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,109
we get 40 points.

696
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,180
- Right.
- If we get two wins,

697
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,019
we get 50 points and 30 more points.

698
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,750
We lose if we get zero wins, anyway.

699
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,789
Two wins!

700
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,329
Let's go with two wins.

701
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,099
- It depends on who has what.
- Let's get two wins.

702
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,160
We don't have that many cards left, then.

703
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,039
We can't let Team Mansion get one win.

704
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,970
- We either lose all of them...
- Maintain our wins...

705
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,410
Yes, we either lose all of them...

706
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,210
- Or two wins.
- or win twice.

707
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,710
Then, 1 win and 2 losses?

708
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,940
(Pani Bottle is the last player.)

709
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,210
Gosh.

710
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,150
Where's my calming pill?

711
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,180
Seriously.

712
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,049
I was in a situation
where I had to do something.

713
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,119
I almost threw up.

714
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,319
So,

715
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,359
- We...
- if it's a green card,

716
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,259
you put down the biggest number.

717
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,230
You can put down whatever you want...

718
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,299
according to the color
with the rest of them.

719
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,769
Since we have 2 out of 4 cards.

720
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:12,240
It'll be easy to get a win
with a green card.

721
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,200
If Team Remaining...

722
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,009
doesn't play a red card, we surely win.

723
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,980
- We're certainly at an advantage.
- Yes, we're in a good place.

724
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,880
In the movie "Tazza,"

725
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,519
the protagonist says, "It's chilling.
A dagger flies and pierces my heart."

726
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,619
I was starting to feel that in real life.

727
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,950
I felt a chill,

728
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,819
and my mind went blank out of the blue.

729
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,690
I was having a mental breakdown,

730
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,259
so Steve wrote a cheat sheet for me...

731
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,259
so that I wouldn't make any mistakes.

732
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
(Writing the cheat sheet)

733
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,470
Dong Min is always first.
Then, you're next.

734
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,099
Say the open card is green.

735
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:48,140
Then, you play 15.

736
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,670
- I follow them if it's red?
- Yes, then you don't have a choice.

737
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,809
Team Remaining won't put down a zero
from the start.

738
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:55,809
- Right.
- They're going to save it...

739
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,910
to win the game at the end.

740
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,880
They were explaining the strategies,

741
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,720
but I didn't understand a word they said.

742
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,950
My mistake might lead
to the team's defeat,

743
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,519
so my heart started racing,
and my mind went blank.

744
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,329
I only relied on the cheat sheet.

745
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,430
The players participating in Round Six,

746
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:15,869
please gather at the Main Hall
with your cards for this round.

747
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,339
We will begin Round Six.

748
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,309
(The winner will be determined
in Round 6.)

749
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:35,119
Dong Min has the lowest number,

750
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,789
- so he will go first.
- Yes.

751
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,190
(Dong Min is the 1st player in Round 6.)

752
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,089
Your open card in this turn is...

753
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,920
red four.

754
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,059
Predict the number of your wins.

755
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,130
Team Paradise predicts one win.

756
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,230
Team Mansion predicts two wins.

757
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,369
Team Remaining predicts one win.

758
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,539
Dong Min, submit your card.

759
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,849
Team Remaining won't put down...

760
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:05,849
- a zero from the start.
- Right.

761
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,949
It's zero.

762
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,489
What?

763
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,530
Pani Bottle, submit your card.

764
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,710
I looked at the sheet,
and it said things...

765
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,309
about what to lay down when it was red.

766
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,739
But none of it was
about when they put down a zero.

767
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,710
I had all the information
about what to put down...

768
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,210
according to Team Remaining's color.

769
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,719
But it didn't say anything
about when they put down a zero.

770
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,119
From then on,

771
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,420
I had a total breakdown.

772
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,760
My hands trembled,

773
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,630
and it was just...

774
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,000
(There's no strategy against a 0.)

775
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,510
Pani Bottle, please take your card back.

776
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,679
You must submit a red card,
which is the color of the open card.

777
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,849
I got nervous.

778
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,030
I was already clueless,
and I even showed my hand.

779
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,800
I was done for.

780
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,369
But there was only one card
that I could put down.

781
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,599
And I made a mistake,
so I was incredibly stupid.

782
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,300
Min A, submit your card.

783
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,510
(Min A's turn)

784
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,739
(Submitting a red 8 card)

785
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:41,210
You've submitted red eight.

786
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,110
Among the red cards,
which is the open card,

787
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,550
Min A has submitted
the highest number, eight,

788
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,719
and she has won this turn.

789
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,920
It was a red card,
which could bring us a win.

790
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,860
I thought,
"The universe is helping us at last."

791
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,059
The next turn will begin.

792
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:00,130
The open card is green three.

793
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:03,269
Min A, submit your card.

794
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:08,500
In the first turn, Pani Bottle...

795
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,769
mistakenly submitted a green 15.

796
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:12,809
I thought, "Pani has that card?"

797
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,039
I already had that information,

798
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,909
and the next open card was green.

799
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,550
My card was obviously lower than 15.

800
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,449
And I was surely going to lose...

801
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:23,449
with the green six card that I had.

802
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,889
Team Mansion has predicted 2 wins
in Round 6,

803
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,489
so it needed another win.

804
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:32,190
Team Paradise has...

805
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,300
green 5 and green 15.

806
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,199
Team Mansion has green 6 and yellow 13.

807
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,570
Team Remaining has yellow 8 and yellow 10.

808
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:46,309
And the open card is green three.

809
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,079
The only winning possibility
for Team Mansion is...

810
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,820
to submit green six in this turn...

811
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,190
to take a loss.

812
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,260
When yellow 14 is open in the next turn,

813
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,829
they must submit yellow 13 to take a win.

814
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,789
That's the only possibility
for Team Mansion...

815
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,130
to predict the wins correctly.

816
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,869
So, I was torn.

817
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,139
(If Team Mansion succeeds
in predicting the wins,)

818
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,309
(it may be tied with Team Paradise.)

819
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:28,050
The 2nd turn of Round 6 has ended.

820
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,119
I will reveal the last open card.

821
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,789
Shoot.

822
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,320
This is so...

823
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,059
- Hey.
- Hey.

824
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:41,900
- Did you lose?
- Did you lose?

825
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,239
- Why is he trudging?
- Why are you trudging?

826
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,440
He's trudging.

827
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:48,769
What's wrong?

828
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,940
Who's the strongest one here?

829
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,010
Me.

830
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Can you slap me as hard as you can?

831
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,610
- Why?
- Don't do that!

832
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,150
- Why?
- I'm serious. Do it.

833
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,949
- Why are you doing this?
- Seriously.

834
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,519
You brat!

835
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
You won?

836
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,960
So, what's the final score?

837
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,530
All the games have ended.

838
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,000
Please gather at the Main Hall.

839
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,710
I will announce the result.

840
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,309
The losing team
in today's Money Challenge is...

841
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,409
(Mansion)

842
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,809
Team Mansion.

843
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,289
(Pani Bottle made a mistake
and showed his green 15 card.)

844
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,360
(I will reveal an open card.)

845
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,530
(Green 3 was the open card
in the 2nd turn.)

846
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,099
(After a long deliberation...)

847
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,610
You've submitted yellow 13.

848
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:59,110
We can't help it if there's no luck,

849
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,679
no matter how carefully we pick the cards.

850
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,579
The last chance I had was...

851
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,650
if the dealer had the other green card.

852
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,619
I will reveal the last open card.

853
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,389
It's a yellow 14.

854
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,159
You've submitted green five.

855
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:21,059
Pani Bottle had the green card,

856
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,329
and the dealer had a yellow 14.

857
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,340
I couldn't put down a card
that was an obvious loss,

858
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,909
so I took a chance.

859
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,139
Pani Bottle, that jerk.

860
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,940
I bet he dropped it on purpose.

861
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,679
I'm so annoyed.

862
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,349
Dong Min has submitted a ten...

863
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,619
and won this turn.

864
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,519
(Team Remaining takes 1 win,
and the Money Challenge ends.)

865
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,590
All rounds have ended.

866
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,159
(Paradise: 130, Mansion: 90,
Remaining: 230)

867
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,329
The winner of the first team match
in the Money Challenge is...

868
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:51,960
Team Remaining.

869
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,869
All players of Team Remaining...

870
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,070
will be given 20,000 dollars
of private funds...

871
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,440
and Immunity Passes.

872
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,139
According to the rules of the Bloody Game,

873
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,710
the funds will be stored
in the safe boxes.

874
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,079
It was totally...

875
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:13,920
I can't even describe this joy.

876
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,449
Team Paradise came to us...

877
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,820
and said, "You guys are so lucky."

878
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,289
Seeing how they thought that we won
with just luck and no strategies,

879
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,420
I thought, "Are they rookies?"

880
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,829
I was in my element
to have won by an overwhelming difference.

881
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,300
You guys aren't Team Paradise.
You're Team Despair.

882
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,699
Team Mansion, the losing team
of today's Money Challenge,

883
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,940
must pick an elimination candidate...

884
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,679
from your team by voting.

885
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,409
The player who has been voted...

886
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,949
will have a Deathmatch against the players
in the Underground Prison,

887
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,349
and the loser of the match
will be eliminated.

888
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:54,789
It was a crushing, devastating,
and natural defeat.

889
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,190
I hated that we placed last.

890
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,329
I thought, "The higher power deserted us."

891
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:04,130
If we go against strong players
such as Xitsuh and Yurisa,

892
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,139
it won't be easy.

893
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,510
Two players who survive the Deathmatch...

894
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:12,739
will join the team
with the fewest members.

895
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,150
Now, vote for one player...

896
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,949
who will participate in the Deathmatch.

897
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,820
Voting will close in an hour.

898
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,190
- The 4 of us are voting.
- Are the 4 of us voting?

899
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,559
Just us?

900
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,920
It's so cruel.

901
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,730
The four of us are voting.

902
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,929
- Shall we talk for a second?
- Let's do that.

903
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,699
- You guys were quick to send me off.
- Let's go.

904
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,570
- What?
- You guys were quick to send me off.

905
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,639
Still.

906
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,769
- It was because you betrayed us.
- I didn't do that.

907
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,809
You traitor.

908
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:46,539
I can't believe it.

909
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,579
For goodness' sake.

910
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:52,179
One member of that team will become...

911
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,179
- an elimination candidate.
- Yes.

912
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,349
- Three will play, and two will survive.
- It must be a three-person match.

913
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,789
So one member of Team Mansion
will have the Deathmatch...

914
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:06,230
with two members of the Prison
to have one person get eliminated.

915
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,230
I thought, "This match will be tough."

916
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,369
They have experienced
the second season of Bloody Game.

917
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:14,500
This is the second Deathmatch
for an actual elimination.

918
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:16,940
For something like that,
the members are tough.

919
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,170
It won't be easy.

920
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,079
(Deathmatch players: Yurisa, Xitsuh)

921
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,409
I know that I'll only remember defeat.

922
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,449
I must play a game
because I feel victimized.

923
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,650
And I must win it
because I feel victimized.

924
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,219
What can I do to prevent losing?
What do I need to do?

925
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,219
I knew that I had to force my brain awake.

926
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,559
There was a sudoku book
in the Underground Prison,

927
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,960
so I solved the puzzles repeatedly.

928
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,800
I was determined to work my brain.

929
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,230
(Singing)

930
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,739
I'll kill everyone except for myself.

931
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:48,139
One by one,

932
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,139
I'll slit their throats.

933
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,019
This is so stressful.

934
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,719
It was a total defeat.

935
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,860
I have no excuse.

936
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,000
I can't complain
because it was a crushing defeat.

937
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
I should go, right?

938
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,869
I should go.

939
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,340
I keep wondering...

940
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,039
if I missed something at the end.

941
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,110
If I did, I think I should go.

942
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,179
But I don't remember what happened.

943
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,650
If Kyung Ran goes,

944
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,789
we'll be ruined for the upcoming games.

945
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:41,860
I really wanted to stay loyal
to Kyung Ran.

946
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,030
On Bloody Game 3,

947
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,960
I want someone on my side...

948
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,929
I can trust for a long while.

949
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,670
Lee Gina, will you vote?

950
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:12,650
(Kim Min A)

951
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,820
(Lee Gina votes for Kim Min A.)

952
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,030
Min A made a mistake in the last round.

953
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,340
Had she switched the order of the cards,

954
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,570
we would've taken two wins.

955
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,010
No matter how hard I think,
I don't understand why she turned in...

956
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,010
a card of that color.

957
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,739
That was why I voted for Min A.

958
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,949
Kim Min A, will you vote?

959
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,050
Yes.

960
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,829
I think the least competent member
should go.

961
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:56,030
That's the first thought on my mind.

962
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,530
The member who harmed the team.

963
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,139
If I'm the one who made a mistake,

964
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,639
I should go.

965
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,250
(Kim Min A finishes voting.)

966
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,960
Kim Kyung Ran, will you vote?

967
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,989
Yes.

968
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,199
(Kim Kyung Ran finishes voting.)

969
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,869
Go on.

970
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:36,139
(The last voter is Chungju-Man.)

971
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,780
It never occurred to me.

972
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,949
- Hello.
- Chungju-Man, will you vote?

973
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,989
Can I buy an extra vote?

974
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,260
Will you buy an extra vote?

975
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,019
I'll buy all the extra votes.

976
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:01,429
I'm done.

977
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,369
Did you use extra votes?

978
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:04,400
No.

979
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,170
Voting is over.

980
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:10,039
Mansion players,
please gather at the Main Hall.

981
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,809
The result of the vote will be announced.

982
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,449
As per the voting result
of the defeated team, Team Mansion,

983
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,480
the player who will participate
in the Deathmath is...

984
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,190
(Kim Kyung Ran)

985
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,960
Kim Kyung Ran.

986
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,869
I'll buy 2 extra votes
with 40,000 dollars.

987
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:44,409
You purchased 2 extra votes
with 40,000 dollars.

988
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:46,280
Okay. That's right.

989
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:48,079
I wanted to take care of the matter
in a surefire way.

990
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,780
I saw Steve Yea end up in the gutter...

991
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,449
in his attempt to save money.

992
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,679
So I thought that money was meaningless.

993
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:58,190
(Chungju-Man casts 3 votes
for Kim Kyung Ran.)

994
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,860
All right. Thank you.

995
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:07,429
Kyung Ran said repeatedly...

996
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:09,599
that she should go.

997
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,099
So I took up on that offer.

998
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:17,070
(Kim Kyung Ran)

999
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,070
(Kim Min A votes for Kim Kyung Ran.)

1000
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,940
To be honest, I want to survive.

1001
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,909
She said that she'd go,

1002
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,420
and I didn't want to go.

1003
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,820
(Kim Kyung Ran: 5 votes,
Kim Min A: 1 vote)

1004
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,929
Going to the Deathmatch like this...

1005
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,139
Deathmatch players,
please gather at the Main Hall.

1006
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:56,909
Kim Kyung Ran.

1007
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:58,949
Xitsuh.

1008
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,119
Yurisa.

1009
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:05,190
The three players will have...

1010
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,920
a 1-on-1-on-1 Deathmatch.

1011
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,230
Today's Deathmatch will be revealed.

1012
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,860
Today's Deathmatch is...

1013
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,699
Brick Building.

1014
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,400
For Brick Building, you will see
drawings from five directions...

1015
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,500
and use blocks of six colors...

1016
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:25,309
to make an actual model.

1017
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,610
You must use your spatial perception
and agility...

1018
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,480
to make the correct model faster
than other players.

1019
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,019
When the game begins,

1020
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,789
the drawings from five directions...

1021
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:40,219
and the number of blocks that was used
will be revealed.

1022
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,289
Each player must stack the blocks...

1023
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:44,860
and make a model...

1024
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,460
that matches all five drawings.

1025
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,969
The player who is done making the model
will shout, "I got it."

1026
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,239
If it's correct, one point will be added.

1027
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,409
If it's incorrect,
one point will be deducted.

1028
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:00,480
However, there could be
a set of drawings...

1029
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,079
that can't be recreated.

1030
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,309
If the set of drawings can't be recreated.

1031
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,349
the player must shout, "I got it,"
and say, "Impossible."

1032
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,190
If it's correct,

1033
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,789
two points will be added.

1034
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:14,360
If it's incorrect,
two points will be deducted.

1035
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:16,889
There will be a total of five rounds.

1036
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,489
The player with the lowest score...

1037
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,130
will get eliminated.

1038
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,730
Soon, Brick Building will begin.

1039
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,400
To be honest,
I didn't think that I'd lose.

1040
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,539
Firstly, I can beat the sickly Xitsuh.

1041
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,579
As for Kyung Ran...

1042
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:36,409
Had she been formidable,
I would've heard about her achievements...

1043
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:37,510
in the games.

1044
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,510
But I haven't heard anything.

1045
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,420
So I thought, "I'll be able to win."

1046
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,550
Experiencing the Underground Prison
filled me with spite.

1047
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,289
I must win.

1048
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,260
To win this game,

1049
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,659
I'd be willing to sell an organ.

1050
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:54,230
It's all right.
Life is supposed to be lonely.

1051
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,929
Everyone lives alone.

1052
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,400
Even if it's a bit rough...

1053
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,429
I was curious about...

1054
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,940
both Yurisa and Xitsuh.

1055
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,309
It'd be incredible to win.

1056
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:05,440
It'd feel good.

1057
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:07,480
Let's do this.

1058
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:14,320
I will reveal the drawings of blocks
for Round One.

1059
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,590
(A total of 33 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1060
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,530
(Kyung Ran and Yurisa
grab the blocks first.)

1061
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,400
(Back)

1062
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,070
(Aerial)

1063
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:41,909
(Kyung Ran recreates
the aerial drawing first.)

1064
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,949
(Meanwhile,)

1065
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:55,789
(Xitsuh gets started
with the blocks belatedly.)

1066
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,269
(He's much slower.)

1067
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,269
To be honest, I was a bit confused.

1068
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,809
Going back and forth
from the five drawings...

1069
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,210
made things very confusing.

1070
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:13,139
Once I got confused,

1071
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:15,510
my heart began to beat fast.
I was nervous.

1072
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,650
I thought, "Am I too slow?"

1073
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,150
Other members...

1074
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,880
were stacking up the blocks noisily,
but I was going,

1075
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,789
"Which side is left?"

1076
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,889
I thought, "I'm in trouble."

1077
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,699
(She stacked up many blocks.)

1078
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:41,699
(Kim Kyung Ran, Xitsuh, Yurisa)

1079
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:46,840
(There's a big difference in the speed.)

1080
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,010
(Yurisa has stacked
the highest number of blocks.)

1081
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:55,050
(One blue block doesn't match.)

1082
00:51:55,050 --> 00:52:02,460
(Right)

1083
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,469
(Right)

1084
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:17,269
(Right)

1085
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,110
(I see!)

1086
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:38,929
(Yurisa begins to check.)

1087
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,369
I got it.

1088
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,869
I'd like everyone except for Yurisa...

1089
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:49,670
to turn around and close their eyes.

1090
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,480
We will check Yurisa's answer.

1091
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,550
I was confident. I couldn't be wrong.

1092
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,449
(Front-side drawing, Yurisa's blocks)

1093
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:01,150
(Left-side drawing, Yurisa's blocks)

1094
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,880
(Right-side drawing, Yurisa's blocks)

1095
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,719
(Back-side drawing, Yurisa's blocks)

1096
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,389
(Aerial-side drawing, Yurisa's blocks)

1097
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,960
Yurisa, you obtained a point
for your correct answer.

1098
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,960
It's simple. It's easier than I thought.

1099
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,360
I just stacked the blocks as I saw them.

1100
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,800
I could stack them easily.

1101
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,769
I completed the model using
whatever blocks fell into my hands.

1102
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,570
From the front...

1103
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,969
What I had was correct...

1104
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,940
from the aerial, right, and left sides.

1105
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,079
But the front-side drawing
showed different blocks.

1106
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,550
From the aerial side,
only the yellow block was visible.

1107
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,619
So I put whatever blocks underneath.

1108
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:40,460
But from the front side,
the colors mattered.

1109
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,760
So I got the blocks
in blue, orange, and yellow order...

1110
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,159
and shouted, "I got it."

1111
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,369
I was in such a hurry...

1112
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:53,570
that my heart beat fast.

1113
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:57,539
I thought, "Let's do my absolute best."

1114
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,880
I was devastated.

1115
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,650
Round One was over,
but I couldn't get the hang of the game.

1116
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,880
Yurisa completed it quickly.

1117
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,849
It meant that there was a high chance
of Round Two going the same way.

1118
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,750
I became defiant...

1119
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,550
and thought, "I'm good at strategizing."

1120
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,320
"Let's strategize in the next round
even if it leads to a loss."

1121
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:17,860
I will reveal the drawings of blocks
for Round Two.

1122
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,329
(A total of 30 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1123
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,840
(The players grab the blocks right away.)

1124
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,710
(Meanwhile, Yurisa starts stacking
2 layers of blocks at once.)

1125
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,389
(On the other hand, Kyung Ran starts
with the top layer once again.)

1126
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:49,320
(Kyung Ran and Yurisa maintain
their strategy for Round 1.)

1127
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,170
(Xitsuh is unable to stack any blocks.)

1128
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,289
I got it.

1129
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,190
Impossible.

1130
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:25,260
I'd like everyone except for Xitsuh
to turn around and close their eyes.

1131
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,300
We will check Xitsuh's answer.

1132
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,500
Xitsuh. Your answer was correct.
You obtained two points.

1133
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,000
So I was right.

1134
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:41,139
There was a one-layer block
on the far left of the left-side drawing.

1135
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:44,349
Then the layer of block on the far right
of the right-side drawing...

1136
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:47,150
should match the layer of block
in the left-side drawing.

1137
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,019
But the number of layers didn't match.

1138
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,449
There should be the same number of layers.

1139
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,960
But how come
there are two different layers?

1140
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,829
I kept trying to make sense of this,
but it wasn't possible.

1141
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,659
So I went for it.

1142
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,400
(That puts Kyung Ran on the bottom.)

1143
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:07,170
He figured that out?

1144
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,210
The 2 points he got from Round 2
did scare me a bit.

1145
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,949
(Now, only 3 rounds remain.)

1146
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,610
I will reveal the drawings of blocks
for Round Three.

1147
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:26,320
(A total of 26 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1148
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,929
All of a sudden, this became fun.

1149
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:36,260
My strategy worked,
so I felt like I could pull this off.

1150
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,829
I could easily spot the blocks
so quickly then.

1151
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,440
So I started to stack them up.

1152
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,309
Before I realized it,

1153
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:45,909
I only had to review my blocks
before I called it.

1154
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,179
I got it.

1155
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,150
We will check Xitsuh's answer.

1156
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,349
(Checking Xitsuh's blocks)

1157
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,190
(A total of 26 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1158
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:02,920
(Front-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1159
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,730
(Left-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1160
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,460
(Right-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1161
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,329
(Back-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1162
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:09,829
(Aerial drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1163
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:11,170
Xitsuh.

1164
00:57:11,269 --> 00:57:13,400
You obtained a point
for your correct answer.

1165
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,869
Please put the blocks back.

1166
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,039
He motivated me.

1167
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,340
"Look at this guy."

1168
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,510
"It seems sickly Xitsuh is back.
Did he take some medicine? "

1169
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:30,550
I will reveal the drawings of blocks
for Round Four.

1170
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:35,619
(A total of 24 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1171
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:55,880
(Kyung Ran gave up on the strategy
to start with the top layer.)

1172
00:57:56,309 --> 00:58:00,650
(Xitsuh is feeling confident.)

1173
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:07,920
I decided to stack the column first
as it was the most important.

1174
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,190
I'll stack it up as the foundation.

1175
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,760
My plan was to focus
on analyzing one drawing.

1176
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,300
Once I started to stack up
2 or 3 layers of blocks,

1177
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,929
some blocks were covered completely.
So not all of them mattered.

1178
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:19,300
But I had to be mindful of the colors
for some layers.

1179
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,539
In those circumstances,
my plan was to stack up the blocks first.

1180
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,980
After making a big framework,
I moved on to the next drawing.

1181
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,340
Then I decided to fix the colors then.

1182
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,349
I got it.

1183
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,789
I'd like everyone except for Xitsuh
to turn around and close their eyes.

1184
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:40,889
We will check Xitsuh's answer.

1185
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,760
(A total of 24 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1186
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,460
(Front-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1187
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,159
(Left-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1188
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,929
(Right-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1189
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,670
(Back-side drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1190
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,099
(Aerial drawing, Xitsuh's blocks)

1191
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:53,769
Xitsuh.

1192
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,400
You obtained a point
for your correct answer.

1193
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,250
I was overwhelmed.

1194
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:06,349
"I finally broke out of a shell."

1195
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,619
Afterward,

1196
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:10,920
I thought I should
confidently square my shoulders.

1197
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,690
I won't be eliminated.

1198
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,090
Fine.

1199
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,289
I won't be on the bottom.

1200
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,730
Anything could happen in a Deathmatch.

1201
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,159
So I didn't want to give up.

1202
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:28,099
I was ready to do my best
for the final round.

1203
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:34,239
I was in prison,
so I wasn't feeling my best.

1204
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:37,110
But there was a possibility
of getting eliminated.

1205
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:41,880
At that moment, I thought that
I shouldn't end up on the bottom.

1206
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,389
I will reveal the drawings of blocks
for Round Five.

1207
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:47,820
(The final round)

1208
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,329
(A total of 28 blocks:
Front, aerial, back, left, right)

1209
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:08,079
(Xitsuh and Yurisa are stacking up
the same blocks.)

1210
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:28,699
Just like the other rounds,
I stacked up the blocks quickly.

1211
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:30,159
I thought if I hurried,
I could end the game...

1212
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:31,699
with a score of 5 to 1 to 0.

1213
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:41,340
I got it.

1214
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,610
I'd like everyone...

1215
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,409
except for Xitsuh
to turn around and close their eyes.

1216
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,550
We will check Xitsuh's answer.

1217
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,250
(If he gets it right,
Kyung Ran will be eliminated.)

1218
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,360
(Checking Xitsuh's blocks)

1219
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,460
Xitsuh.

1220
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,659
Your answer is incorrect.
I will deduct a point from your score.

1221
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,460
There was no way I was wrong.

1222
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,730
I checked again.

1223
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,670
I checked it from the top and the bottom.

1224
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,900
My blocks matched all the drawings.

1225
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,099
Why is this wrong? Everything checks out.

1226
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,940
Why is this wrong?
It matches all the drawings.

1227
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,239
I checked again and again,
but I couldn't find where I messed up.

1228
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,719
I kept wondering, "Wait. Perhaps..."

1229
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:26,920
I kept holding onto a faint hope.

1230
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,960
Going home after losing Deathmatch?

1231
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,099
I hated the idea of that.

1232
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,440
I can't get eliminated today.

1233
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:49,409
(Kyung Ran and Yurisa have
almost identical layers of blocks.)

1234
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,579
I got it.

1235
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,050
I'd like everyone...

1236
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,480
except for Kyung Ran
to turn around and close their eyes.

1237
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:56,679
We will check Kyung Ran's answer.

1238
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,989
I thought, "Darn it.
Oh, no. She can't get it right."

1239
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:00,389
"What do I do?"

1240
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,559
Kyung Ran.

1241
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,630
Your answer is incorrect.

1242
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,230
(Kyung Ran gets it wrong.)

1243
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,329
I got it. Impossible.

1244
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,099
I'd like everyone...

1245
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:16,699
except for Yurisa
to turn around and close their eyes.

1246
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:21,110
We will check Yurisa's answer.

1247
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,480
(Checking Yurisa's answer)

1248
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,579
"Right. I missed something."

1249
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:27,320
There was one more condition.
The number of blocks had to match too.

1250
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,380
(A total of 28 blocks)

1251
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:30,380
"Impossible."

1252
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:35,260
In the last round,
I was trying to make this work.

1253
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:36,590
There had to be 28 blocks.

1254
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,489
I kept counting, but I only had 27 blocks.

1255
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:40,500
I checked every side of the blocks.

1256
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,730
But my colors were right.

1257
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,500
I just assumed that I missed a block
because I was rushing to count them.

1258
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,230
So I just went for it knowing that.

1259
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,269
But I didn't have the guts
to make a judgment call.

1260
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,710
I'm still sad about it.
I should have said, "Impossible."

1261
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:52,769
Yurisa.

1262
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,179
Your answer was correct.
You obtained two points.

1263
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,980
Congratulations.

1264
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,150
- Good work.
- Good work.

1265
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,050
My gosh, that wasn't possible.
It was missing one.

1266
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,820
- Right. Like this.
- Yes.

1267
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,090
(The eliminated player of the Deathmatch,
Kim Kyung Ran)

1268
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,690
The game has ended.

1269
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,889
(The Deathmatch is over.)

1270
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:11,130
It wasn't possible.

1271
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,630
To be honest,

1272
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,559
if I ended up going home...

1273
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,469
after this Deathmatch as the loser,

1274
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,500
I wouldn't be able to join
another competition show again.

1275
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,369
It would've traumatized me.

1276
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:27,210
I saw myself
as a mere strategist in a team.

1277
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,079
I wondered if I wasn't strong enough
to compete individually.

1278
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,880
So I was feeling quite small.

1279
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,650
But if I can continue this momentum,

1280
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:39,989
nothing on this show can scare me.

1281
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,219
I've gone through all the ups and downs
in this season already.

1282
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,489
I decided to aim higher.

1283
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:51,369
We will announce
the result of the Deathmatch.

1284
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,139
The eliminated player
of Bloody Game 3 is...

1285
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:58,340
Kim Kyung Ran.

1286
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,719
Kyung Ran.

1287
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:13,849
Please leave Bloody Game immediately.

1288
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:18,159
Eliminated players cannot return
to Bloody Game again.

1289
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,199
Okay.

1290
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,800
Good luck.

1291
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,730
- Good job.
- I'm leaving.

1292
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,429
(The eliminated player, Kim Kyung Ran)

1293
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:28,500
- Good job.
- Good work.

1294
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,869
Good job.

1295
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:33,239
Good work.

1296
01:04:33,409 --> 01:04:35,809
We met for the first time.
But you asked for ice and toothpaste.

1297
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:37,809
I was quite surprised by your request.

1298
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,719
Good work.

1299
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:44,349
Thanks to you, I'm leaving
without any money left. How neat.

1300
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:45,389
- Bye.
- You had no money?

1301
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:47,289
- Good luck. Bye.
- Okay.

1302
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:49,320
Bye.

1303
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,090
(Sighing)

1304
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,269
My gosh.

1305
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,769
Thinking back,
there are so many things I regret.

1306
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,480
Actually, I'm not
an intellectually outstanding player.

1307
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,949
I just wanted to do my absolute best
at the moment.

1308
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,119
I dove into this world of Bloody Game.

1309
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,489
While trying to overcome the hardships
and the situation I was in,

1310
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:21,219
I wanted to break through.

1311
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:23,420
I wanted to turn the table around.

1312
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,429
Things weren't going my way,
but that was part of the game.

1313
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:28,429
This game was an unfair one.

1314
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:31,530
Well, getting eliminated was my fate.

1315
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:34,699
I think this is the outcome of my skills.

1316
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,940
My gosh. I only got to stay here
for a few hours.

1317
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:39,809
Oh, my.

1318
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,519
All the games for today have ended.

1319
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,519
Yurisa. Xitsuh.

1320
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:57,019
You will stay with Team Mansion...

1321
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,090
as they are the smallest group.

1322
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,530
- You're back.
- Yes, I'm back.

1323
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:07,199
- Xitsuh made it back.
- The second team match...

1324
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:08,570
will take place tomorrow.

1325
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,570
Team Mansion, go back
to your survival ground.

1326
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1327
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:17,510
Let's go.

1328
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,610
Let's do our best.

1329
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,679
- Let's go.
- I'll wash up.

1330
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,849
Did you get to stay here?

1331
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,550
No, I didn't get a chance.

1332
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,250
- Not even for a night?
- No.

1333
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,760
I broke the swords with them
on the Day of the Raid.

1334
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,090
Then they abandoned me afterward.

1335
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,630
He actually brought energy to our team.

1336
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,230
Besides, Xitsuh is an enthusiastic player.

1337
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,829
And he loves playing games.

1338
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,230
Kyung Ran is gone.

1339
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,440
You think we've been taking it easy?

1340
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,940
- You didn't have a fan?
- Do you want to go back down again?

1341
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:48,840
(The players return
to the Mansion together.)

1342
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,239
I'll come and get you for the team match.

1343
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,809
Do you want to go to prison
and have a meeting there?

1344
01:06:57,949 --> 01:06:59,550
All right. Rest up.

1345
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,690
- Good job.
- Good job.

1346
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,090
Get some rest.

1347
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,289
- Good night.
- Rest up.

1348
