00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,059
My lips are dry.

3
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,460
- Yes. I feel nervous.
- You feel thirsty, right?

(Acau: A gaming streamer,
the winner of "Accomplice 2")

9
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,549
I saw a lot of people sitting around me.

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,490
I thought to myself,
"Kyung Ran will be on the show?"

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,789
I thought that the staff invited
people from the big league.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,960
Kyung Ran. She made me feel a bit dizzy.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,390
I know her history...

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,159
because I watched "The Genius"
so many times.

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,700
She can be very political
and use it to her advantage.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,200
She's good at recruiting people
to her side.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,370
She will have an influence over the others
as she had done this before.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,909
I think she will be leading the group.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,709
I'll follow her a bit and ditch her
when the time is right.

20
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,579
I was like,
"So she's the famous Dualistic Queen?"

21

A friend of mine was explaining
what happened on "The Genius."

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,079
She was the Angelic Kyung Ran at first.

23
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,950
Then she became Kyung Ran of Hatred.

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,790
Afterward, she became the Dualistic Queen.

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,849
How could she be three things?

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,519
How could she form this Holy Trinity?

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,689

28
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,689

32
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,500
So he came.

33
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,099

Hello.

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,709
It's been a while.

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,109
We filmed one of TV shows together
a long time ago.

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,780
One of my allies fell for his tactic...

40
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,680
and betrayed me.

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,319
That's how I got eliminated.

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,790
He's the one who got me eliminated.

43
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,219
I thought, "Shouldn't I battle him out?"

44
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,530
There must be a sense of competitiveness
I still held onto deep down.

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,260
Xitsuh.

46
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,269
I think he holds grudges.

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,099
How did you two meet?

48
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,870
We met on a competition show.

49
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,000
We went head-to-head.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,139
- I lost.
- Gosh, you can't say that.

51
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,280
I realized that he held grudges.

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,509
He didn't have to say that
to other people.

53
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,349
Since he and I are on the show together
again,

54
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,050
I should wait and kill him off.

55
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,819
Well, I did have to get my guard up
around him.

56
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,050
What about the rest of you?
Have you been on competition shows?

57
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:33,389
- Well, my life itself is a competition.
- I see.

58
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,189

70

Seriously?

71
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,960
One of the players will become...

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,490
an elimination candidate
in an hour through your vote.

73
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,969
Now, converse with one another amply
to understand each other.

74
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,770
And vote for one player whom you deem...

75
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,069
unnecessary for your survival here.

76

The player chosen by the vote...

77
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,310
will go to the Deathmatch.

78
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,650
The player will pick another player
to compete against at the Deathmatch.

79

The player who loses the Deathmatch...

80
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,090
will have to leave Bloody Game.

81
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,590
The voting for an elimination candidate
will begin now.

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,330
Please remember that
you will pay the price for all decisions.

83
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,400

85

My gosh.

86
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,050
To be honest, it was so cruel.

87
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,349
We had just met, but we have to pick
an elimination candidate.

88
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,949
But if there was a player
I couldn't mix well with...

89
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,090
or a player I didn't feel comfortable
around for some reason,

90
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,930
a part of me wanted to get rid of them.

91
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
It's only right
to eliminate strong players.

92
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,529
If winning first place is the goal,

93
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,870
getting rid of them
would increase my chances.

94
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,610
Either Xitsuh or Hyun Seo should go...

95
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,569
since they're strong players.

96
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,839
Actually, I was contemplating
whom I should pick.

97
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,579
Hyun Seo looked like
he would be good at games.

98
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,019
Xitsuh was in the last season too.

99
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,180
He's been on this kind of competition show
many times before.

100
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,319
So people might want
to get rid of them first.

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,720
(Players identified as threats:
Xitsuh, Lim Hyun Seo)

102
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,560
It's fine as long as it's not me.

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,500
By default, if I don't speak up,

104
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,930
others wouldn't have chances
to turn on me.

105
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,970
So I didn't see any reason
to actively lead the group.

106
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,339
So it looks like...

107
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,970
there are 9 or 10 of us here.

108
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,610
- Is it 10?
- There are 9 of us.

109
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,779
This is a small group.

110
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,980
- It is.
- Yes.

111
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,379
Trying to figure out their intention,

112
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,420
there's no way they would keep
the same format as the first season.

113
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,480
- Right? Yes.
- I agree.

114
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,019
There's just no way.

115
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,589
I think there has to be another intention.

116
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,889
There must be a hidden intention
other than eliminating one of us.

117
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,259
Maybe, whoever gets eliminated
might join the other group.

118
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,290
And vice versa.

119
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,459
- Or the elimination might be real.
- That could be it.

120
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,660
- We can never predict that.
- It's impossible to know.

121
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,629
Yes.
One of us could get eliminated for real.

122
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:26,899
I thought this was the worst.

123
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,629
Everyone is the most careful
in the beginning.

124
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,740
No one's going to be aggressive and say,

125
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,839
"Let's pick this player."

126
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,410
Whoever starts that will be a target.

127
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,139
So it was obvious
no one was going to speak up.

128
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,779
I thought to myself that
there had to be a different intention.

129
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,050
I thought there had to be a trick.
That crossed my mind.

130
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,879
It's a big if.

131
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,019
If the score is tied...

132
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,949
- If the results are tied...
- If it's tied.

133
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,649
So if we all vote for ourselves,

134
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,620
all of us might be able to survive.
That could be one scenario.

135
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,089
There could be other players outside.

136
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,759
There could be another team.

137
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,160
I thought this could be a test.

138
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,699
To see how well we would work as a team.

139
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,029
Maybe, they gave us a chance
not to eliminate anyone.

140
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,970
I thought we had to try it out.

141
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,540
Because if it works, it would be amazing.

142
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,639
Since I spoke up and led the conversation,

143
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,410
I thought I should tell them...

144
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,879
I would take the risk.

145
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,009
I think picking ourselves
might be a good option.

146
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,519
But if it doesn't work,

147
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,089
I don't care if I get eliminated.

148
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,759
With that risk, I would like to try it.

149
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,459
"Why would he say that?"

150
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,060
If the vote was tied,

151
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,029
but one of us still had to be eliminated,
he told them to pick him then.

152
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,529
That's what he said.

153
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,800
"Why would he say that?"

154
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,069
"What's his hidden agenda?"

155
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,110
One of us was going
to be eliminated anyway.

156
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,740
So we're all going to vote for ourselves
for this one episode?

157
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,910
What's the point?

158
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,480
To be honest, there's a huge risk
in voting for ourselves.

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,949
I'm sure
one of us will vote for someone else.

160
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,019
Trusting each other naively
and voting for ourselves...

161
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,889
To be honest,

162
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,759
I didn't understand his point.

163
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,430
I thought, "Why would he say that?"

164
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,329
Then I thought, "Wait. That's not
a bad idea. That's pretty good."

165
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,100
I was grateful.

166
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,209
He said,
"If it fails, you can vote for me."

167
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:15,610
So I felt at ease.

168
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,910
We can try it at least once.
It won't negatively affect you guys.

169
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,980
- We can at least try.
- I see.

170
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm on board.

171
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,879
- Okay.
- Then let's vote for ourselves.

172
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,949
- Right?
- So we should all write down our names.

173
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,949
- I'm curious about the system.
- Sure.

174
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,189
I'll go and vote for myself.

175
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,819
- Let's go around and do it.
- Let's...

176
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,930
- go around and vote for ourselves.
- Let's go with that plan.

177
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,769
I was certain that there would be a trick
with this game.

178
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,069
But I couldn't figure out
how it was inserted into the game.

179
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,939
Like the last season,
would there be a small number of people...

180
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,339
living in poor condition?

181
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,910
Or would there be a group of people...

182
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,180
managing us or watching us?

183
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,149
They could be betting on our decisions.

184
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,819
Hello.

185
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,019
- Will you vote?
- Yes.

186
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,019
(Xitsuh votes for himself.)

187
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,490
(The second voter, Kim Young Kwang)

188
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,730
When Xitsuh said that, I thought,

189
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,800
"Hey, he and I had the same idea."

190
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,470
(Kim Young Kwang votes for himself.)

191
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,740
(The players take turns to vote.)

192
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,180
(They all voted for themselves.)

193
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,410
(Number of votes)

194
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,250
(Xitsuh, Kim Min A, Acau,
Kim Kyung Ran, Lee Gina, Kim Young Kwang)

195
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,289
Gosh, is this right?

196
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,029
If I end up in the Deathmatch,

197
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,659
I'll win no matter what.

198
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:45,700
Fine.

199
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,429
(The seventh voter is Steve Yea.)

200
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,039
(Sighing)

201
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,710
I was certain that one of us
was going to betray the group...

202
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,279
and vote for someone else, not themselves.

203
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,580
So I had a lot on mind
regarding how to vote.

204
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,419
(Steve Yea, Acau,
Lee Gina, Lim Hyun Seo, Chungju-Man)

205
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,820
(Another player has the same dilemma.)

206
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,889
He thought there was a trick to this.

207
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,159
But what trick could there be?

208
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,059
"They'll make us take another vote."
That's what I thought.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,639
(Contemplating)

210
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,379
I thought about it long and hard
in my head.

211
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,210
It wouldn't go as planned anyway.

212
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,350
That's not going to happen.

213
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,080
I thought a lot about what to do.

214
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,389
Voting is over.

215
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,830
Please gather at the Main Hall.

216
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,799
- There it is.
- My gosh.

217
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,870
The results will be announced.

218
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,000
Here are the results.

219
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,440
All the players received a vote.

220
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,710
There will be another vote.

221
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,049
- Gosh.
- Okay.

222
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,980
(Chungju-Man, Lim Hyun Seo, and Steve Yea
voted for themselves.)

223
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,549
It would be a lie if I wasn't hoping...

224
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,519
there would be something new like that.

225
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,320
I thought trying it wouldn't hurt.

226
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,960
We could try it out without risks.

227
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,259
Even if someone were to betray us,

228
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,629
that person wouldn't pick me.

229
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:24,799
The probability was 1 out of 9.

230
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,259
The probability of that not being me
was much higher.

231
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,870
"They wouldn't pick me."

232
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,600
That's what I had in mind
just like everyone else.

233
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,399
If anyone picked me to be eliminated,
that person would be a fool.

234
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,740
Why would anyone pick a weak player?

235
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,379
At first, I thought that
at least one of us would betray the group.

236
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,149
But it looked like they were all
going to vote for themselves.

237
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,750
So I voted for myself too.

238
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,919
If another vote must be held after this,

239
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,159
as per rules, one of the players
will be eliminated today.

240
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:57,029
I'm doomed. There was no trick to that?

241
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,230
I was certain there would be a trick.

242
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,929
I felt like a pathetic fool
for putting on this silly show.

243
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,970
I mean, without the trick,
I basically dug my own hole halfway.

244
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,940
Two things crossed my mind at that moment.

245
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,240
"This is nonsense." "I'm doomed."

246
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,940
These two things crossed my mind
at the same time.

247
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,279
So I thought...

248
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,379
one of us was going to be eliminated.

249
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,750
(The voting begins.)

250
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,860
(The countdown begins again.)

251
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,990
- I don't want to think about this.
- What should we do?

252
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,399
We have to think about what we should do.

253
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,460
What do we do?

254
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,470
So we have to vote for someone again?

255
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,440
All of us have to vote in an hour.

256
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,110
(Glancing)

257
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,549
I'll go and vote.

258
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,419
I thought going in to vote right away...

259
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,659
was the best survival tactic I had.

260
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,519
I thought I shouldn't hesitate.

261
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,629
There could definitely be external players
given the system.

262
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,730
Some people might try to save me.

263
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,360
Or some might not want to eliminate me
because they find me suspicious.

264
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,529
I thought, "Let's gamble."

265
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,169
"I'll brace myself."
That was how I would play it.

266
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,500
No one could be
as threatening as a lunatic...

267
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,169
who had given up on everything.

268
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,379
Seriously. This is way too harsh.

269
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,779
I'm done.

270
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,080
Let's go with the same order.

271
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,149
I'll go next.

272
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:29,990
Hyun Seo went after me.

273
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,419
He's like a machine.

274
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,120
He's someone who's clear
when it comes to gains and losses.

275
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,460
(The second voter is Lim Hyun Seo.)

276
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:39,860
I voted for Xitsuh.

277
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,669
He told everyone to vote for him
if his plan didn't work.

278
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:43,929
(Xitsuh)

279
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,500
He told us to vote for him.

280
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,799
I do what I'm told.

281
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,210
(The third voter is Chungju-Man.)

282
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,809
(Xitsuh)

283
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:56,250
I voted for Xitsuh.

284
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,149
This is a competition in the end.

285
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,480
We have to eliminate strong players.

286
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,450
Well, I had a reason to vote for him too.

287
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,120
(Chungju-Man votes for Xitsuh.)

288
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,519
(In no time, Xitsuh gets 2 votes.)

289
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,960
Who's next?

290
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,830
I was bracing myself.

291
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,559
I only thought about whom I was going
to pick for the Deathmatch.

292
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,470
- Who voted so far?
- Yes.

293
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,639
The three of us.

294
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,840
- Hyun Seo,
- Hyun Seo.

295
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,309
- Xitsuh, and Chungju-Man.
- I see. They already voted.

296
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,879
(Glancing)

297
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:29,750
(There's only silence in the mansion.)

298
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,419
Gosh, what do I do?

299
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,320
What do I do?

300
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,590
I don't know what to do.

301
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,529
People stopped talking.

302
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:45,899
And no one went to vote.

303
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,399
I think people were contemplating...

304
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,200
about voting for Xitsuh.

305
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,970
To be honest,
I only had one thought in mind.

306
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,210
"How can I play politics here,"

307
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,309
"so I don't become
an elimination candidate?"

308
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,509
This is so hard. Seriously.

309
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,120
It's about what you said earlier, Xitsuh.

310
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,889
Does it still stand? No, right?

311
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,019
You said we could vote for you
if it didn't work.

312
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,659
It doesn't matter to me.

313
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,629
But there will be a Deathmatch after this.

314
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,629
- Anyway...
- Even if I get the most votes,

315
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,299
- I'll have to pick someone.
- Right.

316
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,129
- So you can vote freely.
- I see.

317
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,230
Is that so?

318
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,610
All of a sudden,
he didn't say we should vote for him.

319
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,179
Seeing how he didn't say
we could vote for him afterward...

320
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:34,009
To be honest, I didn't want to see him go.

321
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,950
That was really tough for me.

322
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,179
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

323
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,289
It's so hard.

324
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,659
Telling them to vote for me
after all was said and done...

325
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,690
was unnecessary in my opinion.

326
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,700
I have a lot on my mind, right?

327
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,399
- Thinking about several possibilities...
- Right.

328
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,169
I have way too many thoughts in my head.

329
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,370
Right. I agree.

330
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,509
- I would picture what would happen.
- Yes.

331
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,110
- I would picture other scenarios too.
- Yes.

332
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,580
I hated seeing other people...

333
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,480
unable to make a decision
and pondering about it for a long time.

334
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,009
When other people were contemplating,

335
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,820
I usually took the role
of leading the group to a decision.

336
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,250
Shall I go then?

337
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,419
I'll make it quick.

338
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,659
I really don't know what to do.
This is crazy.

339
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,870
Let's go.
We're stalling way too much time.

340
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,779
It was tough because no matter how hard
I thought about it, there wasn't a way.

341
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,120
Xitsuh is like a veteran player
on shows like this.

342
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,850
So I didn't want him to get eliminated.

343
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,690
"If I'm wrong, you can eliminate me."

344
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,629
He clearly said that.

345
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,769
I thought there was a high chance
that they would pick Xitsuh.

346
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,340
But...

347
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,669
that would be a bummer.

348
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,980
I did think I should vote for him...

349
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,549
since he volunteered to be eliminated.

350
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,830
Voting is over.

351
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,830
Please gather at the Main Hall.

352
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,029
- There it is.
- The results will be announced.

353
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,740
Here are the results.

354
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,070
If winning first place is the goal,

355
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,309
it's only right
to eliminate strong players.

356
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,909
I didn't want to see Xitsuh
get eliminated.

357
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,649
I'll be honest. I'm doomed.

358
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,210
I dug my own grave.

359
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,620
The first elimination candidate
of Bloody Game is...

360
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,259
Kim Young Kwang.

361
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,859
(The elimination candidate is
Kim Young Kwang.)

362
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,539
Anyway, we would pick one player.

363
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,809
There was something Kyung Ran said.

364
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,680
She indirectly hinted that
we should vote for Young Kwang.

365
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,589
That crossed my mind
when I was about to vote.

366
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,450
(30 minutes ago)

367
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,059
Shall I go then?

368
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,259
I'll make it quick.

369
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,490
I really don't know what to do.
This is crazy.

370
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,630
(Young Kwang went to vote.)

371
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,339
But I'm concerned that Young Kwang
might not fully be aware of the rules.

372
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,980
After this, there will be a Deathmatch.

373
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,579
I'm not sure if he gets that concept.

374
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,750
Right.

375
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,349
With this direction, we might be able...

376
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,089
to get rid of Young Kwang, not Xitsuh.

377
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,789
I thought that...

378
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,559
Xitsuh would be more helpful to me
than Young Kwang...

379
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
during games.

380
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,990
I think I'll vote for Young Kwang.

381
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,660
I agreed with what Kyung Ran said.

382
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,130
I played politics there.

383
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,099
Ms. Beauty dropped some hints.

384
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,539
"Gosh, I don't think
he understood the rules."

385
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:22,539
She said something like that.

386
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,609
"Shouldn't we vote for him?"

387
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,579
She nudged people. It was like
she was poking them to vote for him.

388
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,910
As for Young Kwang,

389
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,750
I thought he wouldn't pick a girl.

390
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,420
Even if it meant that he would go home,

391
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,019
he would go head-to-head against a guy...

392
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,859
and get eliminated.

393
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,690
I thought among the two candidates,

394
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,890
there was a higher chance that...

395
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,029
Young Kwang wouldn't pick me
as his opponent in the Deathmatch.

396
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,200
That's when the air in the room changed.

397
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,529
I thought, "Let's not provoke them."

398
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,630
If I play it wrong,

399
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,140
I might come across as rude
or pretending to be kind.

400
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,109
I thought it was risky.

401
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,410
(Xitsuh: 3 votes,
Kim Young Kwang: 4 votes)

402
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:04,250
The first elimination candidate,
Kim Young Kwang,

403
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,250
can pick a player
who will join him in the Deathmatch.

404
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:13,119
On Bloody Game, Deathmatches
determine who gets eliminated.

405
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,660
The first Deathmatch...

406
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,900
requires instantaneous judgment skills
and psychological warfare.

407
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,930
The first elimination candidate,
Kim Young Kwang.

408
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,839
Please enter the voting room immediately.

409
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,640
I'll be back.

410
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,220
When someone else's name showed up,
I was shocked at first.

411
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,519
Then at the same time,

412
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,519
I was relieved that it wasn't me.
It would be a lie if I didn't feel that.

413
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,359
Pick one player who will join you
in the Deathmatch.

414
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,400
This is difficult.

415
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,170
We don't know what game it will be.

416
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,970
We all have different skills
we're good at.

417
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,470
I still want Xitsuh to go.

418
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,380
He's smart and works hard,

419
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,579
but it's not like
he has supernatural powers.

420
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,720
I don't think Young Kwang...

421
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,990
would go on a 1-on-1 with me.

422
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,519
"I'll go against a man."

423
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,819
I thought he would have that mindset.

424
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,319
I thought it was a crisis back then.

425
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,130
I thought it would be Acau or me...

426
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,900
because I seem like a weak one
from my qualifications.

427
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,670
I thought about how I would feel.

428
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,339
I wanted to pick someone who I'd feel
less guilty to eliminate.

429
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,109
The decision was made.

430
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,880
The player voted for the Deathmatch
with Kim Young Kwang is...

431
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,980
Goodness.

432
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:49,990
Lim Hyun Seo.

433
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,589
(Deathmatch player, Lim Hyun Seo)

434
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,789
Okay.

435
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,460
I seem like the weakest.

436
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,430
It looks like I can't use both my arms...

437
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,130
and I'm not fully able.

438
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,140
I think that's why he chose me.

439
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,500
My arms are fine.

440
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,240
I tried to look like a sick person.

441
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,480
"Don't bully a sick and weak person."

442
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,650
That's what I wanted to go for.

443
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
But I was selected for the Deathmatch.

444
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,920
What can I do when I look weak?

445
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,390
That's how I look.

446
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,619
What can I do about my looks?

447
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,420
That's an unexpected decision.

448
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,329
I did think Hyun Seo would get selected.

449
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,759
Young Kwang had the least conversation
with him.

450
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,299
He'd feel less sorry.

451
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,069
He seemed like someone who gets attached.

452
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,099
After telling others...

453
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,769
I will eliminate Young Kwang,

454
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,940
I tried to be friendly with Young Kwang.

455
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,710
I think I'll choose him.

456
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,920
(After Young Kwang returned)

457
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,579
I'll go since I look weak.

458
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,789
It would be nice if we had something
like that after the show ends.

459
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,460
We can gather.

460
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,160
Right.

461
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:05,230
I thought he would select Hyun Seo...

462
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,200
who he didn't bond or talk much with.

463
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,069
Honestly, Hyun Seo stayed the most still.

464
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,069
From the start of the game until the end,

465
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,599
he just went along.

466
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,670
"It wasn't me. How nice."

467
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,509
That's what I felt.

468
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,940
I thought
that would have acted negatively.

469
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,079
Goodness.

470
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,450
Instant decision and mind games.

471
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,789
My job is to play mind games.

472
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,789
I would have a higher chance to win.

473
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,730
Deathmatch.

474
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,170
I don't know who would lose,

475
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,200
- but let's do our best.
- Let's do that.

476
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,640
What is this place?

477
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,440
This is scary.

478
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,220
It'll be a 2-on-2 Deathmatch today.

479
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,349
Two-on-two?

480
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,759
Hold on. Two versus two?

481
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,589
What does that mean?

482
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,660
Your opponents in the Deathmatch
will be presented now.

483
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,730
What?

484
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,329
What is this?

485
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,700
Who are they?

486
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,210
There are other people.

487
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,490
There were two people waiting.

488
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,490
I was flustered. "What is this?"

489
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,059
I didn't imagine anything like this.

490
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,759
When I saw the two people standing there,

491
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:46,400
I noticed a familiar face.

492
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,859
There are more people going through
the same thing.

493
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,339
I will reveal
the rules of today's Deathmatch.

494
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:59,109
This is a 2-on-2 Deathmatch.

495
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,609
One person in the team that loses...

496
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,019
from the 2-on-2 Deathmatch will become
the first eliminated player.

497
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,779
The first elimination candidate
from Bloody Paradise...

498
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,049
is Hong Jin Ho, who came in last
in the first come, first served game.

499
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,660
(Hong Jin Ho, the last
in the first come, first served game)

500
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,559
The first elimination candidate
from Bloody Mansion...

501
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,599
is the person who got the most votes
in the elimination vote,

502
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,599
Kim Young Kwang.

503
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,769
(The candidate with the most votes
in the elimination vote, Kim Young Kwang)

504
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,500
Hong Jin Ho, the elimination candidate
from Bloody Paradise,

505
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,109
selected Choi Hye Seon as the assistant
in the Deathmatch.

506
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,710
She's the assistant?

507
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,380
It wasn't a match
between the team members.

508
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:39,880
The elimination candidates
of each team were going to go on a match.

509
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,690
Kim Young Kwang selected...

510
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,359
Lim Hyun Seo as the assistant
in the Deathmatch.

511
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,890
I felt so reassured.

512
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,099
Hyun Seo would be better than me
in using the brains.

513
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,230
I was reassured.

514
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,529
If I knew that,

515
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,769
I would have brought someone who is good
as my assistant.

516
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,240
The butler said,

517
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,710
"Select two players who you will be
on the Deathmatch with."

518
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,049
In Bloody Game,
Deathmatch decides who will be eliminated.

519
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,150
Kim Young Kwang,
the first elimination candidate,

520
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,450
Hong Jin Ho,
the player in the lowest rank.

521
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,789
You may choose one person
you will be on the Deathmatch with.

522
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,720
You may choose two players you will be
on the Deathmatch with.

523
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,859
Please make a selection.

524
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,000
Keep in mind that all decisions
come with a price.

525
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,930
So it turned out that the two...

526
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,829
weren't people
who would compete against me.

527
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,230
I was to choose two people
who will play in the Deathmatch with me.

528
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,799
I hadn't predicted that.

529
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,170
Even if I lost in that match,

530
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,309
I wasn't going to be eliminated.

531
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,839
"I survived."

532
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,009
"I can go home." That's what I thought.

533
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,480
The fact that I wasn't going
to be eliminated...

534
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,779
was a great thing.

535
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,490
I was happy, but I couldn't show that...

536
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,490
since Young Kwang was there.

537
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:56,329
We will begin the Deathmatch.

538
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,029
Hong Jin Ho, Choi Hye Seon,

539
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,000
Kim Young Kwang, and Lim Hyun Seo.

540
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,000
These 4 players will be
on the 2-on-2 Deathmatch.

541
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,710
I will reveal today's Deathmatch.

542
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,210
Today's Deathmatch...

543
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,079
is Switch Poker.

544
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,349
Switch Poker is a game where you have to
use your quick judgment and mind games...

545
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,250
to work together with the player
on your team...

546
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,789
to create a combination of cards with
a higher number than the opposing team.

547
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,690
There will be a total of seven rounds.

548
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,089
The first players nominated
for elimination from each team...

549
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,759
will be the main players,

550
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,470
and the ones nominated by the main players
to enter the Deathmatch...

551
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,230
will be the assistant players.

552
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,539
(Assistant players:
Choi Hye Seon, Lim Hyun Seo)

553
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,500
The starting team of the first round...

554
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,839
will be chosen randomly.

555
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,809
In the following rounds,
the teams will take turns to start.

556
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,809
Before the game starts,
each player will be given 20 chips.

557
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,480
Before each round starts,
each player will bet one chip.

558
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,720
In each round, each player will be
randomly dealt two cards...

559
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,660
from a set of cards...

560
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,559
numbered from 1 to 15...

561
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,130
and 1 of the remaining 7 cards...

562
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,960
is opened and revealed to the players.

563
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,769
Each player may take
1 of 4 actions on his or her turn.

564
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,069
First, turn over one of the cards
in the deck...

565
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,640
and change it to an open card.

566
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,250
Second, exchange one card
with a player on the same team.

567
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,950
Third, take one card from the deck...

568
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,490
and discard 1 of the 3 cards in your hand.

569
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,789
At this time, the discarded card must be
placed down so everyone can see it.

570
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,329
Fourth, do nothing.

571
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,529
After all players have had their turn,

572
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,730
each player in turn...

573
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,369
may make an additional bet or give up.

574
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:47,900
Players who participated in the betting...

575
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,869
will open both cards in their hand.

576
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,980
At this time, the player
with the lowest sum of numbers...

577
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,180
will get the open card
placed in the center...

578
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,720
and add up the total numbers
of the three cards.

579
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,190
The player with the highest sum
of the numbers on his or her cards...

580
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,859
is the winner of that round
and takes all the bet chips.

581
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,829
After seven rounds,

582
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:12,400
the player with the most chips
among the main players wins.

583
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,859
If a player runs out of chips...

584
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,029
before the end of Round Seven,

585
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,740
the team that player belongs to loses.

586
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,309
Switch Poker...

587
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:29,009
is a simplified poker game...

588
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,180
with fewer number of cases.

589
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,579
I was determined to win.

590
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,150
I would have to survive no matter what.

591
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,319
Putting the difficulty aside,

592
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,359
the moment I heard Switch Poker,

593
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,960
I shouted, "Great."

594
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,359
And I got the impression...

595
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,799
that they weren't good at such games.

596
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,299
So I thought it was an easy game.

597
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,039
You will have ten minutes
to plan your strategy.

598
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,269
To become the 1st among the 4,

599
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,809
we need the sum to be at least 20.

600
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,339
I think it would be okay
if the sum is above 20.

601
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,380
Luck plays a big part
for the cards we get.

602
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,480
That's right.

603
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,049
If I have only 1 card higher than 10,

604
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,420
Only 1 card higher than 10.

605
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,990
and you also have that.

606
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,690
- Then you could give that to me.
- Right.

607
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,119
- Since I'm the main player.
- That's right.

608
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,819
- You just need to survive.
- Right.

609
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,059
Switch Poker is a game where the player...

610
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,599
with the cards in his hand that
have the highest sum of numbers...

611
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,029
takes all the betting chips.

612
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,299
After the game ends,
the winner is determined...

613
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,369
by the number of chips the player has,

614
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,400
and the number of chips
of the assistant player ...

615
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,509
does not affect the winner.

616
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Therefore,
the assistant players must give...

617
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,980
high-numbered cards to the main players,

618
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:39,220
and the main players
must take as many chips as possible...

619
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,750
from the opposing team...

620
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,819
as well as the assistant players...

621
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,619
before the end of each round.

622
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,059
However, if a player runs out of chips
before the end of Round Seven,

623
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,890
that team automatically loses,

624
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,430
so players should be mindful
of the number of chips remaining...

625
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,859
as they play.

626
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,630
When it's your turn,

627
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,970
and I need a high-number card,

628
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,170
I'll place my right hand...

629
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,039
on the table like this,

630
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,740
- that means I need a higher number card.
- I got it.

631
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,680
- At least 8.
- At least 8.

632
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,309
You should give me at least eight.

633
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,849
The game itself isn't a difficult one.

634
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,920
So we could use sign language...

635
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,089
and place my hand on the table...

636
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,819
when I'm in a situation...

637
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,789
in which I need a high-number card.

638
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,630
Then Hye Seon could give me a card
if she has a card higher than eight.

639
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,559
I think we'd have a better chance...

640
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,529
if we have this.

641
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,029
Let's return together and eat chocolates.

642
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,009
What is counted as a high number?

643
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,440
When you randomly pick a card...

644
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,740
and it's higher than eight,
that's a high number

645
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,779
We have cards numbered 1 to 15.

646
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,250
We get eight cards.

647
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,950
Then the chances of someone getting 15...

648
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,549
is higher than we think.

649
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,950
There is one card covered,

650
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,519
and we have eight cards.

651
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,420
The chances of someone
being in possession of 15...

652
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,130
is higher than the card being in the deck.

653
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,460
That's right.

654
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,799
If you calculate the chances,
if you have 15...

655
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,099
and I also have 12,

656
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,369
the opponent can't win.

657
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,200
Unless they have 13 and 14.

658
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,069
If they have 13 and 14, it's a tie.

659
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:09,039
If you have 15 and I give you 12,

660
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,769
you can go all in.

661
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,210
There's no chance that you will lose.

662
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,609
I think it's a game about what we'll do...

663
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,980
when we have 13, 14, and 15.

664
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,490
In the end,

665
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,089
we need a signal in which
we can tell each other...

666
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,859
- what cards we have.
- That's right.

667
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,289
If we want to play a perfect game.

668
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,690
If we have 13, 14, or 15,

669
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,890
I'll give you this sign.

670
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,599
If you have one of them,
step on my foot as well.

671
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,700
If we both step on each other,

672
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,200
we'll definitely win.
We'll win in almost all cases.

673
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,069
Then we shouldn't do that
for 13, 14, and 15.

674
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,170
- We should start from 12.
- Yes?

675
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,380
For 14, 15...

676
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,279
Twice?

677
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,880
Twice.

678
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,119
Okay.

679
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,279
- Okay.
- Okay.

680
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,789
We were going to step on the other's foot
once if we had 12 or 13,

681
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,920
and if we had 14 or 15,
we were going to step twice.

682
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,029
We made a protocol in which
we can tell each other...

683
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,329
what cards we have.

684
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,859
That was so that we could control
how we bet.

685
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:08,430
We will begin Round One of Switch Poker.

686
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,329
I will distribute 20 chips each.

687
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,339
Okay.

688
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:15,740
(20 betting chips are distributed.)

689
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,819
I can't lose in this game
since my pride is at stake.

690
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,849
I only start fights that I can win.

691
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,490
We will decide the first player.

692
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,119
Here.

693
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,960
Hye Seon will start.

694
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:40,029
Hyun Seo will go next.

695
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,730
Round One begins.

696
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,299
Please bet one chip each.

697
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,440
I'll distribute the cards.

698
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,619
I had 8 and 4.

699
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,720
They weren't good cards,

700
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,390
so I was a bit concerned.

701
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,190
(Earlier, during their strategy planning)

702
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,130
That means I need a high-number card.

703
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,230
You need a high-number card.

704
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,670
(Stepping)

705
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,140
We were going to step on the other's foot
once if we had 12 or 13.

706
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,509
(Lim Hyun Seo's cards)

707
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,519
I will open one card.

708
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,720
The open card is 15.

709
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,019
Do you wish to switch cards, Hye Seon?

710
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,519
I will open a new card.

711
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,119
I will open one card.

712
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,019
The open card is 12.

713
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,759
- Jin Ho.
- I'll take one card from the deck.

714
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,529
I have 11, 10, and 6.

715
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,240
If I discarded 6, that made 21.

716
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,099
If I had 21,

717
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,640
that was doable.

718
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,980
- Hyun Seo.
- I will exchange with Young Kwang.

719
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,309
We were going to exchange cards...

720
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,750
when I had a high number.

721
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,180
- Young Kwang.
- I'll take one from the deck.

722
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,250
(He gets one card from the deck.)

723
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,389
(Stepping)

724
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,289
If we had 14 or 15,
we were going to step twice.

725
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,530
Young Kwang put down nine.

726
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,730
Please start betting from Hye Seon.

727
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,300
She bet one chip.

728
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,099
- Jin Ho.
- I'll bet too.

729
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,670
In the first round,

730
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,539
we were careful,
trying to read each other.

731
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,610
Hyun Seo.

732
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,639
I'll bet.

733
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,650
You bet a total of four chips.

734
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,309
Hyun Seo bet his chips too.

735
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,550
Young Kwang.

736
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:42,250
Young Kwang bet a total of six chips.

737
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,219
Young Kwang placed a high bet.

738
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,530
I had very good cards in the first round.

739
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,260
I had 13 and 14.

740
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,900
Will you continue betting, Hye Seon?

741
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,230
For betting more chips,

742
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,530
if I have my hand like this,

743
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,469
add one more chip.

744
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:02,539
But if I don't do anything,

745
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:03,869
- you can just call it.
- Just call.

746
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,210
Okay.

747
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:07,440
Should I go with it?

748
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,250
I'll fold.

749
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,079
Hye Seon gave up her bet.

750
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,150
I'll fold.

751
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,820
Jin Ho gave up his bet.

752
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,860
Will you put an additional bet?

753
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,190
You can round up.

754
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,090
- Open.
- The betting ended.

755
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,289
The players who participated
in the bet can open their cards.

756
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,659
The numbers on Young Kwang's cards
have a sum of 27...

757
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,170
and therefore he wins Round One.

758
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,030
(The accumulated chips after Round 3,
Hong Jin Ho: 18, Choi Hye Seon: 18)

759
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,239
(Kim Young Kwang: 30, Lim Hyun Seo: 14)

760
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,440
Let's play safe.

761
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,170
Play safe.

762
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,079
When you look at the structure
of the game,

763
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,610
if you have the upper hand...

764
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,550
and the following rounds
go on without much trouble,

765
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,289
the chances of winning would go up.

766
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,219
Round Two begins.

767
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:52,690
I will distribute the cards.

768
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,030
(Kim Young Kwang's cards)

769
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,730
(Stepping)

770
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,070
(Hong Jin Ho's cards)

771
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,340
I will open one card.

772
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,409
The open card is one.

773
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,539
Hyun Seo.

774
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,380
I will do nothing.

775
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,780
Young Kwang.

776
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,849
I'll take one card.

777
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,849
Young Kwang took one card from the deck.

778
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:25,320
He put down three.

779
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:28,159
- Hye Seon.
- I'll take one card from the deck.

780
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,360
Hye Seon took one card from the deck.

781
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,199
She put down four.

782
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:37,030
- Jin Ho.
- Yes. I'll take one card from the deck.

783
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:40,539
Jin Ho took one card from the deck.

784
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,510
I took a card and it was 13.

785
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,980
He put down eight.

786
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,780
I had 24,
and that had low chances of losing.

787
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,110
Please start betting from Hyun Seo.

788
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,650
I don't have many chips.

789
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,590
You can continue that.

790
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Hyun Seo bet one chip.

791
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,820
He bet two chips in total.

792
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,090
You can just call it or raise it.

793
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,030
I'll call...

794
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,039
- and raise it.
- You're rich.

795
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,099
(Kim Young Kwang raised 5 chips.)

796
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,139
What was that?

797
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,880
That was an aggressive bet.

798
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,349
Will you bet, Hye Seon?

799
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,780
I'll fold.

800
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,750
Will you bet, Jin Ho?

801
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:31,019
The game only had seven rounds.

802
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:33,489
So it's very important to earn points
in the first rounds.

803
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,230
I was very confused then.

804
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,969
So when it was my turn to bet,

805
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,570
I was in a situation
where I could continue.

806
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,269
But the game would end if I lost then.

807
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,969
(The sum of Hong Jin Ho's cards is 24.)

808
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:54,210
What number does he have
that he's making such a move?

809
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,750
(Stepping)

810
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,860
If you have 15 and 12, it's safe to say
that you have in the upper hand.

811
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,130
I thought the game was over.

812
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,230
My total was 24.

813
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,860
They were very good cards...

814
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,360
so I should have gone with confidence.

815
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,929
They were the best cards...

816
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,440
that I had to bet on.

817
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,110
I'll...

818
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,949
I'll fold.

819
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,760
Hong Jin Ho gave up his bet.

820
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,630
I had some regrets.

821
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,730
I would have won the game
if I won many chips.

822
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,500
Judging by the cards laid on the table,

823
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,900
there was a high chance...

824
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,239
that Young Kwang had very good cards.

825
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,840
He could hide that...

826
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,809
to gain more chips...

827
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,679
or go big...

828
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,909
so that the other opponents would fold.

829
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:05,780
Young Kwang was more of the latter.

830
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,650
He couldn't keep a poker face.

831
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,449
I'll fold as well.

832
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,389
The betting ended.

833
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,289
The winner of Round Two
is Kim Young Kwang.

834
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,130
(The accumulated chips after Round 2,
Hong Jin Ho: 17, Choi Hye Seon: 17)

835
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,699
(Kim Young Kwang: 34, Lim Hyun Seo: 12)

836
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,170
In the second round,
even though my cards were good,

837
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:28,900
it was so obvious
that Young Kwang's cards...

838
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,670
were way better.

839
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,809
So I folded.

840
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,940
It applies to poker and all other games.

841
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,780
You won't be bad at it
because you've never played it.

842
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,980
Your skills and energy are also important.

843
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,449
You need lots of luck too.

844
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:42,550
I think it's a game with many variables.

845
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,690
We lost points two rounds in a row.

846
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,559
So I thought I might lose.

847
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,590
Round Three begins.

848
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,230
I'll distribute the cards.

849
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,940
It's pretty hard.

850
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,780
(Stepping)

851
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,550
Our pace was good until the third round.

852
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,380
(Kim Young Kwang's cards)

853
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,079
The open card is 11.

854
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,019
Do you wish to switch cards, Hye Seon?

855
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,889
Among two cards, one was good enough,

856
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,559
but the other was pretty low.

857
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,159
I was seriously hoping Jin Ho has...

858
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,590
at least a high-number card.

859
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,900
If I put my hand on the table like this,

860
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,639
- that means I need a higher number card.
- I got it.

861
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,440
I'll switch one with my partner.

862
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,280
(Passing the card)

863
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,289
Do you wish to switch cards, Jin Ho?

864
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,949
I'll have one from the deck.

865
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,519
Hong Jin Ho took one from the deck.

866
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,360
Please put down one of your cards now.

867
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,570
He put down 12.

868
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,369
I thought we lost the round.

869
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:08,599
"We may lose."

870
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,739
The cards on the table were 11 and 12.

871
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,539
And I was holding 15.

872
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:17,610
So I guess they were holding 13 or 14.

873
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,349
Please start betting from Hye Seon.

874
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,960
She bet one chip.

875
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,590
I'll add two more.

876
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,190
(Jin Ho bet 3 chips now,
so the total is 4 for them.)

877
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:31,489
I'll hold.

878
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,800
Hyun Seo gave up another bet.

879
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,230
Me too.

880
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,300
Hye Seon, would you like to bet more?

881
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,840
The sign is the same.
If I put my hand like this,

882
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,340
you add one more.

883
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,639
- Okay.
- You got it?

884
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,679
I'll bet seven more chips.

885
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,889
Then, to keep the balance,

886
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,260
I'll add four more.

887
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,230
Actually, it was a rare chance
to take all the chips.

888
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,000
I can safely take all...

889
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,300
only when the situation and flow are
good enough.

890
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,670
I thought it was the very chance
to take her chips as well.

891
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,769
No more for now.

892
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,510
The betting is over now.

893
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,780
Hong Jin Ho wins the third round
as the sum of his cards is 27.

894
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,809
I got it.

895
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,519
(The accumulated chips after Round 3)

896
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,789
(Hong Jin Ho: 32, Choi Hye Seon: 4,
Kim Young Kwang: 33, Lim Hyun Seo: 11)

897
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,530
Round Four begins.

898
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,030
I'll distribute the cards.

899
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,469
(Choi Hye Seon's cards)

900
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:54,480
(Lim Hyun Seo's cards)

901
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,110
(Kim Young Kwang's cards)

902
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,880
(Stepping)

903
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,250
I will open one card.

904
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:07,159
The number is two.

905
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,860
- Hyun Seo?
- I won't do anything.

906
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,429
- Young Kwang?
- I'll switch one of my cards.

907
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,630
(He got a card from the deck.)

908
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,630
He put down three.

909
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,670
- Hye Seon?
- I'll switch one with my partner.

910
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,440
(She passes her card.)

911
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,139
(She received the card
with the same number again.)

912
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,420
Do you wish to switch cards, Jin Ho?

913
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,349
I'll take one card from the deck.

914
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:45,460
He put down nine.

915
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,829
Please start betting from Hyun Seo.

916
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,769
This is pretty hard.

917
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,539
Round Four.

918
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,940
I'll add some.

919
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,349
Hyun Seo bet two more chips,

920
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,320
so he bet three chips in total.

921
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,119
Young Kwang, would you like to bet?

922
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:15,619
First, two chips.

923
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,400
If you go too fast, I can't follow.

924
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,000
Three?

925
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,440
- Three. Okay.
- Yes, please consider my situation.

926
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,639
Hye Seon, would you like to bet more?

927
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,010
I'll fold.

928
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:34,280
Hong Jin Ho, would you like to bet more?

929
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,250
(Hong Jin Ho's cards)

930
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,349
I was holding 13 and 14,
so the total was 27.

931
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,519
That was the highest number.

932
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,989
There was no chance to lose.
It might be a draw at most.

933
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,659
I'll add three more chips.

934
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,929
(Hong Jin Ho bets 8 more chips,
so his total is 9.)

935
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:57,900
Hong Jin Ho bet nine chips in total.

936
00:44:58,099 --> 00:44:59,369
Why is everybody so rich?

937
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,010
I raise the bet...

938
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,010
to put some pressure on Hyun Seo.

939
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,179
He was trying to trick me.

940
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,610
"Young Kwang, please be careful."

941
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,309
"If you go too fast, I can't follow."

942
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,579
It was certain
he had no intention of following.

943
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:15,980
All he would do was fold.

944
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,119
Hyun Seo, would you like to bet more?

945
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,989
If I do, I'll go all in.

946
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,429
I tried to give you a chance.

947
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,690
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

948
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,630
If you say I die, I die.

949
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,400
I'll fold.

950
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,599
Young Kwang, would you like to bet more?

951
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,679
I'll bet three more.

952
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,750
And six more.

953
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,420
(Kim Young Kwang bet 9 more chips,
so he bet 15 chips in total.)

954
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,190
"What's going on?"

955
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:55,760
"What number cards make him
do such a bold move?"

956
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,960
"Was I missing something?"

957
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,469
"Did I get something wrong?"

958
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,469
The problem was...

959
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,909
the open card was two.

960
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:13,309
There was no chance of losing,
but to make things worse,

961
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,579
I have a sum of 27,

962
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:18,250
but he might have 15 and 11.

963
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,650
If his total is 26,

964
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,320
as the other two have already folded,

965
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,719
Young Kwang takes the card.

966
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:26,019
That was the only possibility
I might lose.

967
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:28,360
Other than that, I was sure to win.

968
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,329
The round went well, as I planned.

969
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:33,730
It was exactly what I wanted.

970
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,460
My cards are pretty good,

971
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,699
but I tried to maintain a poker face.

972
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:42,000
"His won't be 26."

973
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,369
"If things go bad,
should I be eliminated today?"

974
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,769
That's the destiny already set.

975
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,780
You don't need to struggle
as there's no way out.

976
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,980
Everyone came here to survive.
No one wants to be eliminated.

977
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,230
I'll...

978
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,090
call.

979
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:06,699
His can be 26?

980
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:09,570
The betting is over.

981
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:13,199
Players, who joined the betting,
please open your cards.

982
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,039
If his total is 26, I'm screwed.

983
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,510
Jin Ho's total is 27.

984
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,440
Young Kwang's total is...

985
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,579
also 27.

986
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,909
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

987
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,119
"What a relief."

988
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,190
"I didn't lose at least."

989
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,159
I thought
Young Kwang was holding pretty good ones,

990
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:34,760
so we might win.

991
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,960
But a player with lower-numbered cards
gets...

992
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,659
the open card numbered two and may win.

993
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,099
I guess Jin Ho was also thinking
of that possibility.

994
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,239
As the two players' number sum is
the same as 27,

995
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,099
the chips players bet are on hold
for the next round.

996
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,869
- Then, we bet on those again.
- That's not bad.

997
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,179
(The accumulated chips for betting
are 34.)

998
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,409
Round Five begins.

999
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,619
- Whoever wins this round will win.
- That's right.

1000
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:01,820
There's no reason to hesitate now.

1001
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,949
Whoever wins this round will win the game.

1002
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,690
This is all about luck.

1003
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,320
(The accumulated chips after Round 4)

1004
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,559
(Hong Jin Ho: 17, Choi Hye Seon: 3,
Kim Young Kwang: 18, Lim Hyun Seo: 8)

1005
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,630
I'll distribute the cards.

1006
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:23,409
I received two cards,
but at that time, I can't be sure...

1007
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:26,139
if I should get a new card from the deck.

1008
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,889
If he got good cards,
then I should receive a sign.

1009
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:41,119
But there wasn't.

1010
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,659
Mine was bad too.

1011
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,260
As soon as we receive cards,
we are all muted.

1012
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,829
There was no motion.

1013
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,329
This is bad.

1014
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,840
The open card is ten.

1015
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,570
Hye Seon?

1016
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,940
I'll have one card from the deck.

1017
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:01,809
She put down two.

1018
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,050
- Jin Ho?
- I'll also have one card from the deck.

1019
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,780
He took one card from the deck.

1020
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,619
Please put down one of your cards.

1021
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,960
I took one from the deck.

1022
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,789
It was pretty good.

1023
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,769
He put down seven.

1024
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,400
Within this rule, I was sure of winning.

1025
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,639
I made almost a perfect combination.

1026
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,940
"I won this round!"

1027
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:33,010
That's what I thought, but...

1028
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,010
Do you wish to switch cards, Hyun Seo?

1029
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,750
Please give me some time to think.

1030
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,590
I was so anxious for one reason.

1031
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:54,159
The card on the board said ten.

1032
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,469
I knew I needed to break that number,
but I failed.

1033
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,199
In the worst case...

1034
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,500
if Young Kwang managed
to turn his number...

1035
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,170
to be higher than 16,

1036
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,940
he was going to draw or win.

1037
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,480
I thought I'd be in big trouble
if he figured that out.

1038
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,719
I thought this game
could be overturned in one go.

1039
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,179
So I assumed there would be something.

1040
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:19,760
I wondered what to do alone
for a long time.

1041
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,230
I'm going to exchange cards.

1042
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:33,030
We had a high number open.

1043
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,800
So I meant for him
to take small numbers at least.

1044
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,840
I thought I'd never get to win
with my combined number.

1045
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,110
So I was after taking the open card.

1046
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,809
Do you wish to switch cards, Young Kwang?

1047
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,510
I choose not to do anything.

1048
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,320
- You have chosen not to do anything.
- Right.

1049
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,119
Please start betting from Hye Seon.

1050
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,519
I'll fold.

1051
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,019
You have given up on betting.

1052
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:57,989
Jin Ho, will you make a bet?

1053
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,099
At that time, there weren't any chances
to turn the tables.

1054
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,840
If I were to lose this round,
I was most likely to lose the game.

1055
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:13,239
So I thought Young Kwang would
likely reckon what I had,

1056
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:15,340
make Hyun Seo give up,

1057
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,250
and claim the number ten himself...

1058
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,610
to raise his number.

1059
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,579
I assumed he was aware of it for sure.

1060
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:25,150
The best situation for me was
to have all three do the betting.

1061
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,989
Jin Ho, you have betted one chip.

1062
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,199
I betted only one chip on purpose...

1063
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,030
so that the other two wouldn't notice
this situation.

1064
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,969
Hyun Seo, will you make a bet?

1065
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,239
(Touching)

1066
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:56,449
Call.

1067
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,320
You have betted one chip.

1068
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,420
Young Kwang, will you make a bet?

1069
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,130
Call.

1070
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,099
You have betted one chip too.

1071
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:08,630
It's getting fun.

1072
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,170
The betting is over.

1073
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,599
The players who betted,
please open your cards.

1074
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,940
Mine is 26.

1075
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,010
(Hong Jin Ho, 26)

1076
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,920
(Lim Hyun Seo, 13)

1077
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,760
(Kim Young Kwang, 17)

1078
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:37,460
Jin Ho, you have won the 5th round
with a total number of 26.

1079
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,059
- The betting was too little.
- Right.

1080
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:55,610
- It was too small this time.
- I know.

1081
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,480
Hyun Seo betted just one in return.

1082
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,619
Young Kwang did the same.

1083
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,219
Then, I figured they weren't aware.

1084
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,659
I thought I was going to win this round.

1085
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,789
Did you bet low on purpose just now?

1086
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,230
It didn't work no matter what I did.

1087
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:14,730
I had horrible cards.

1088
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,829
My cards were horrible anyway,
so I gave him one of mine...

1089
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:20,000
for him to raise his number
at least by a bit.

1090
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,670
But even with that move,

1091
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,239
it wasn't going to go anywhere.

1092
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:24,269
(The accumulated chips after Round 5)

1093
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:25,769
(Hong Jin Ho: 53, Choi Hye Seon: 3,
Kim Young Kwang: 17, Lim Hyun Seo: 7)

1094
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,579
Round Six begins.

1095
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,809
I was going to win even if I folded.

1096
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:33,420
That was truly thrilling.

1097
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:36,050
Jin Ho, you have won the sixth round...

1098
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,650
with a total number of 25.

1099
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,289
How arrogant.

1100
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:45,559
Hye Seon,
you have won the seventh round...

1101
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:47,000
with a total number of 23.

1102
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,730
I won at least once.

1103
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,369
The game is over.

1104
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,769
The main player, Jin Ho's chips are 58,

1105
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:58,809
and the other main player,
Young Kwang's chips are 12.

1106
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,539
Thus, Jin Ho is the winner.

1107
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,539
- Good game.
- Good game.

1108
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,949
- He's professional indeed.
- Don't mention it.

1109
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,050
Switch Poker was...

1110
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,750
one of my favorite games
which I was strong at.

1111
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,920
And I managed to win safely.

1112
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,760
I was relieved.

1113
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,889
Above all, participating
in a lot of survival shows,

1114
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:19,630
I'd hardly gotten eliminated
on the first day.

1115
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,300
I hadn't experienced it until this time.

1116
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,869
But despite this scary experience,

1117
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,829
I fortunately was over the hump.

1118
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,400
I sighed with relief at that moment.

1119
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,010
Players shouldn't beat up people.

1120
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,510
Let me announce the result
of the 2-on-2 Deathmatch.

1121
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,949
The first eliminated player is...

1122
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:40,119
the elimination candidate,
Kim Young Kwang.

1123
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,389
Young Kwang, please go outside
and leave this place immediately.

1124
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,150
How cruel.

1125
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,059
I'm sorry I couldn't do better.

1126
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,690
No, you did really well.

1127
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:52,159
- Good work.
- Good work.

1128
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,400
- Take care.
- Bye.

1129
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,769
I feel a little bad...

1130
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:05,309
because I wanted to play team games.

1131
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,579
Still,

1132
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,179
I didn't make any cowardly moves.

1133
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,480
I played fair and square...

1134
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,920
like the manly man I'd been.

1135
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,320
I did the best I could,
so I have no regrets.

1136
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,389
(Bloody Game)

1137
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:29,030
(The first eliminated player
is Kim Young Kwang.)

1138
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,900
The 2-on-2 Deathmatch is now over.

1139
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,840
(The 2-on-2 Deathmatch is over.)

1140
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:40,340
The survivors of the 2-on-2 Deathmatch,

1141
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,309
Hong Jin Ho,

1142
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,309
Choi Hye Seon,

1143
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:48,949
and Lim Hyun Seo,

1144
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,090
you cannot return...

1145
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,219
to the mansion.

1146
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,630
- What?
- Why?

1147
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,630
Gosh.

1148
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,469
It was unpredictable
what was going to happen here.

1149
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,500
I got goosebumps.

1150
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:11,940
I was ready to head back to the mansion,

1151
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,710
take a shower,
and enjoy some potato chips.

1152
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,250
I was all ready for it,

1153
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:19,349
but then, I heard I couldn't return.

1154
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,550
This is a group of dropouts?

1155
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,889
- Can't they just...
- I won.

1156
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,690
Why wouldn't they send us back up?

1157
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:28,519
I just couldn't understand.

1158
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,090
I won, but they wouldn't send me home.

1159
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,530
What...

1160
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,230
The new survival ground
of the Deathmatch survivors...

1161
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,730
is the underground outdoor
survival ground here,

1162
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,139
Remaining.

1163
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,039
From now on,
you will continue to survive...

1164
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:49,239
here at Remaining as a team.

1165
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,380
Go downstairs and move...

1166
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,219
to the underground outdoor survival ground
immediately.

1167
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,849
I hate this. Darn you!

1168
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,659
- How can this be?
- Seriously.

1169
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,559
I couldn't stop myself
from swearing at that time.

1170
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:08,030
I won the game,

1171
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,900
but I couldn't go back home.

1172
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,369
"You need to survive
in the wild Remaining,"

1173
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:16,909
the announcement said.

1174
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,539
Goodness.

1175
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,579
To think I'd be left here...

1176
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,250
As another person,

1177
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:28,880
I thought it was a little weird.

1178
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,219
This place was...

1179
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,730
Even homeless people
wouldn't sleep at a place like this.

1180
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:40,900
Here...

1181
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,170
in the ruins,

1182
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,769
I wonder if I can stay sane.

1183
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,170
The wild? What the heck.

1184
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,710
Goodness.

1185
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,079
It seems I'm stuck in this swamp...

1186
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:59,849
where losers can never escape.

1187
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:02,619
I placed last today, at that.

1188
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:05,949
It drains me even more...

1189
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,320
both physically and mentally.

1190
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,929
I feel a little helpless.

1191
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,000
There's a survival ground in the basement?

1192
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,670
I wonder how poor...

1193
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,070
- its quality will be.
- Gosh.

1194
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:22,199
It must be this way.

1195
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,239
Underground? Doesn't it mean it's worse?

1196
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,909
Lower than that?

1197
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:28,179
No way. It can't be this basement.

1198
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,119
What if ghosts show up?

1199
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,860
Oh, my gosh. The lights are off too.

1200
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,860
Gosh. I can't even think.
I just want to sleep right away.

1201
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,469
We reached a rotten building
which was almost deserted.

1202
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,139
I didn't know where we were going.

1203
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,309
- It's too...
- Goodness, it's...

1204
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:00,639
They want us to go lower?

1205
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,880
I don't think that's right.

1206
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:04,849
(Danger)

1207
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:05,980
(Safety First)

1208
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,880
(Basement 1st Floor)

1209
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,690
I hear strange sounds.

1210
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,829
That must be it.

1211
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:20,230
Do we go down?

1212
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,670
It's darn scary.

1213
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,900
To where the lights are.

1214
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,000
- Gosh.
- "Let there be light."

1215
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:30,940
I don't get what's going on.

1216
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,739
(They arrive at the last basement floor.)

1217
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,880
What is this place?

1218
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,079
Underground water is falling.

1219
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:46,789
- It's too scary.
- Do we go there?

1220
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,360
Gosh.

1221
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:58,500
Life has so many ups and downs after all.

1222
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,739
To think of that moment,

1223
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,469
I get stressed out again.

1224
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,239
I doubt I've ever been
to a place like this.

1225
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,940
- Wait, I think it's there.
- Where?

1226
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,179
Over there.

1227
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:12,380
- What's there?
- There.

1228
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,480
It looks like a memorial service.

1229
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,079
Do you see it?

1230
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,190
- Ghosts might show up for real.
- There.

1231
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,820
- Hyun Seo. There you are.
- Yes.

1232
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,889
Let's try going there.

1233
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:22,590
They're calling us there.

1234
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,760
Don't you hear it?

1235
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,860
Did they have to make it this scary?

1236
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:32,400
(Remaining Living Space)

1237
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,440
They painted eyes...

1238
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,539
- and stuff there. What a fuss.
- I know.

1239
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,579
Watch your steps. There are puddles here.

1240
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,920
- That thing?
- There's something in the middle.

1241
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,420
- You know that box?
- It's annoying.

1242
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,389
- What's that?
- The players from last year...

1243
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:32,059
were so eager for it.

1244
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,099
- What?
- It's a food supply box.

1245
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:45,840
(A basic supply box for outdoor survival)

1246
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:48,739
(Boiled eggs, raw sweet potatoes,
water bottles filled with water,)

1247
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,250
(scratch paper, pencils, railway masks,)

1248
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,980
(Paradise player cards,
and Mansion player cards)

1249
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,219
What?

1250
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,159
See? Darn it.

1251
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,989
It only has water.

1252
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:07,730
Thanks. Where did they get these?

1253
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,230
- I think these are potatoes.
- When I was in the military...

1254
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,699
- Eggs.
- Eggs!

1255
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,940
- There are three water bottles?
- Yes.

1256
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,969
Gosh, they at least have mercy.

1257
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:18,170
Enjoy.

1258
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,280
I was so hungry...

1259
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,309
throughout the Deathmatch.

1260
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,280
They provided something to intake
carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

1261
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,719
And water.

1262
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,650
That came to my mind first.

1263
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,349
I've never experienced this before.
I'm lost for words.

1264
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,119
It was a little annoying,

1265
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,889
but it was better than going home.

1266
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,500
What is this?

1267
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:45,199
Is something inside?

1268
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:48,000
These are player cards.

1269
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,099
- Let's sit down and take a look.
- Okay.

1270
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,440
- Let's sit.
- You shouldn't.

1271
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,840
Gosh, it's wet. There's nowhere to sit.

1272
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,039
What is this?

1273
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,210
It's horrible to live in the wild.

1274
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,880
Here... We better do it here.

1275
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,889
(The whole floor is wet
due to the falling underground water.)

1276
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,489
Hold on. Isn't there anywhere to sit?

1277
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,429
It can't be helped.

1278
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:20,170
- Gosh.
- You have bad knees.

1279
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,440
I think...

1280
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,139
the cards show all the players
in each team.

1281
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:24,869
- Let me see. Let's check together.
- These are...

1282
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,340
- for Team Paradise.
- I see.

1283
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:27,539
There are a lot of people.

1284
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:29,539
Dong Min, me,

1285
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:31,909
Pani Bottle, Yurisa,

1286
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,920
Heo Seong Beom, Choi Hye Seon.

1287
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,179
This is crazy.

1288
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,820
(Jang Dong Min, Hong Jin Ho,
Choi Hye Seon, Pani Bottle,)

1289
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,449
(Heo Seong Beom, Joo Eon Kyu,
MJ Kim, Si Yoon, Yurisa)

1290
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,860
What the? A former martial arts player?

1291
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,860
- I guess she's a good fighter.
- Who?

1292
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,989
She must be good at fighting.

1293
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,860
- She was a martial arts player, and look.
- I should keep a lookout for her.

1294
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,329
- She manages prisoners in jail.
- Really?

1295
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:52,699
Level-one brutal criminals, at that.

1296
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,340
They were all impressive.

1297
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:59,110
Jin Ho most fascinated me, to be honest.

1298
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,610
I was fascinated at Bloody Mansion today,

1299
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:06,050
and it seems a lot of interesting people
are in Bloody Paradise too.

1300
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,690
To know that famous people
have gathered for the show...

1301
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,119
and to be able...

1302
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,719
to play games or have conflicts...

1303
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:17,730
with them,

1304
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:18,789
I'm excited.

1305
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:21,329
These are Mansion player cards.

1306
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:23,059
(Kim Kyung Ran, Kim Young Kwang,
Kim Min A, Chungju-Man, Steve Yea,)

1307
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,969
(Xitsuh, Lim Hyun Seo, Lee Gina, Acau)

1308
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,500
You went to law school.

1309
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,199
I know this guy. No way.

1310
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,739
- Chungju-Man...
- Chungju-Man.

1311
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:33,840
- Kim Kyung Ran is here?
- No way!

1312
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,210
She is.

1313
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:37,380
Kyung Ran is strong.

1314
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,409
- I loved her.
- She is strong.

1315
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,880
Kyung Ran is...

1316
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,920
really strong.

1317
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,659
I remember she was no joke.

1318
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,590
I wonder what kinds of moves
she'll make here again.

1319
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:53,929
What? Steve Yea.

1320
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,329
- He's a poker player.
- I asked him a few questions...

1321
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:57,900
about poker.

1322
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,329
Really? He's good at it.

1323
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,469
(Steve Yea, a poker player)

1324
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,739
- What? Xitsuh?
- He's here again.

1325
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:03,900
Xitsuh came.

1326
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,769
He must have nothing else to do.
He joined again.

1327
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:07,809
(He's glad to know.)

1328
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,480
- I should've been on his team.
- I know.

1329
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,409
We hit it off quite well.

1330
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,550
Xitsuh.

1331
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,420
Xitsuh, this punk.

1332
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:20,690
I didn't expect
to have Xitsuh in the show.

1333
01:05:21,219 --> 01:05:23,920
It would've been so nice
if we were on the same team.

1334
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,559
I felt a little bad.

1335
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,530
Other than him, there was Steve Yea,

1336
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:32,329
a skilled player
from the same poker field.

1337
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:33,869
He was memorable.

1338
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,199
I thought the other team
had quite the amusing players.

1339
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:39,909
Wait.

1340
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:41,639
Something has come.

1341
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,880
The bell sound.

1342
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,079
- What's that?
- This hopeful bell sound.

1343
01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:48,550
It always means
they provide you with something.

1344
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,789
- The bell...
- Where did it ring?

1345
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:53,320
Right, the bell...

1346
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,559
(They may receive a notice
or send up a question.)

1347
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:05,730
Here it is.

1348
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,400
They're conscientious enough...

1349
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:12,340
to provide the least necessities here.

1350
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,110
Here it is. I found it.

1351
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,010
What is this?

1352
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,920
"Remaining?" We're Remaining?

1353
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,719
This place is called Remaining.

1354
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:23,980
(Basic Rules of Remaining)

1355
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,320
Earlier, we saw Bloody Paradise,

1356
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,789
- Bloody Mansion.
- Bloody Mansion, and...

1357
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:27,889
This is Remaining.

1358
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,389
- Remaining?
- Yes.

1359
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:34,659
(Bloody Paradise)

1360
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:38,500
(Bloody Mansion)

1361
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,900
(Remaining)

1362
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,409
(Bloody Game will unfold
in these 3 survival grounds.)

1363
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:48,679
In any case,
we're aware of the secret information...

1364
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:51,110
that the other players aren't.

1365
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,409
It felt a little like privilege,

1366
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,679
which I liked.

1367
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,420
Now that I have more information,

1368
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,849
I get curious about it.

1369
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,889
It makes me a little anxious too.

1370
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:04,389
"Basic Rules of Remaining."

1371
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:07,659
"You are Remaining players
of Bloody Game 3."

1372
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,130
"Survive in Remaining
and wait for a chance..."

1373
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,699
- "to seize Bloody Paradise."
- That's...

1374
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,230
That's where we were.

1375
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,400
"New Remaining players will be chosen
through the same way as the first day."

1376
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,570
- More will come tomorrow.
- We will have more.

1377
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,440
We have this rule again.

1378
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,280
"On the Day of the Raid,
any kind of violence is allowed..."

1379
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,280
"and the rules of Bloody Game
are lifted temporarily."

1380
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:26,980
As for the symbols, one thing stands out.

1381
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,619
- The drawing in the middle?
- There's that triangular pyramid.

1382
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,789
There was a strange sword.

1383
01:07:31,789 --> 01:07:32,920
- There were a lot of swords.
- There were a lot of swords.

1384
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,519
This thing was shaped like a pyramid...

1385
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,320
- Like this.
- with an eye in the middle.

1386
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,829
- It was made of glass.
- There was one on each floor.

1387
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:41,230
It was in the swimming pool
of Paradise too.

1388
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,429
The same glass pyramid.

1389
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:46,099
I figured we were supposed
to break it with that sword.

1390
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:48,139
But the hard sword was
in the main hall, right?

1391
01:07:48,139 --> 01:07:49,369
A real sword.

1392
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,170
"One of the Remaining players
will infiltrate Paradise as a spy."

1393
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,239
Gosh.

1394
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,710
- "A spy player..."
- "A spy player may exchange messages..."

1395
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,409
"with the other Remaining players
through the SMS Box in the pantry."

1396
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,679
We can communicate there.

1397
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:03,250
A spy...

1398
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:05,519
I guess it's plausible.
We can say one of us survived.

1399
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,860
Or a whole new face...

1400
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,289
But it'll be strange if you join them
suddenly in the middle.

1401
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:11,059
- You know?
- It makes more sense that you go.

1402
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,989
If Hyun Seo suddenly joins Team Paradise,

1403
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:15,900
we have to make up a whole story.
They'll notice for sure.

1404
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,600
Rather than Hye Seon
beating me and returning,

1405
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,899
it's more natural for me
to beat her and join them.

1406
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:22,770
I'll be the spy.
I think that will be natural.

1407
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,670
I'll look for what the symbols can be.

1408
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,310
Let's communicate through the SMS Box.

1409
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,939
- And...
- But the door is transparent.

1410
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,010
- Really?
- Yes.

1411
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:33,079
Then, I better move in secret
when there's no one around.

1412
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,949
The food pantry's door is transparent.

1413
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:40,090
And the place itself isn't spacious.

1414
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,460
The shelves are aligned.

1415
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,689
You can easily see what people are doing
if you put your mind to it.

1416
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:48,229
He might get caught once
while putting a letter inside.

1417
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:51,930
If anyone becomes
an elimination candidate,

1418
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,369
they can choose someone
as a Deathmatch candidate.

1419
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:55,770
- There will be voting for it, right?
- Right.

1420
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,670
At that time, you should...

1421
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,140
I should induce them to vote for those...

1422
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,680
- who might be of help to us.
- Right. Someone strong, for example.

1423
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,350
Who do you want? Someone smart or strong?

1424
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,710
The two of you are smart,
so we need someone strong.

1425
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,550
Anyway, is our ultimate goal...

1426
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,319
- to take over Bloody Paradise?
- Yes.

1427
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:13,090
- We'll go in...
- Our ultimate goal is...

1428
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,689
to survive here...

1429
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,720
until the Day of the Raid...

1430
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,460
when we go to Bloody Paradise,
destroy all the symbols,

1431
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,159
and take over Bloody Paradise.

1432
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,670
That will mark the beginning.

1433
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,770
But if we fail
to take over Bloody Paradise,

1434
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,199
we'll be doomed.

1435
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:32,140
The raid.

1436
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:34,810
I want to do it successfully.

1437
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,109
Everyone had this thought
when they saw me.

1438
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:39,810
A nerd who only studies.

1439
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,819
I have the strongest aggressive nature.

1440
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:47,890
Everyone thinks
my shoulder is half-broken.

1441
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,890
But it's actually fine.

1442
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:52,560
I'm stronger than you all. This is a fact.

1443
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:55,729
"You have to sacrifice
one of the remaining players."

1444
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:57,500
"One can't participate in the raid..."

1445
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,569
"and be quarantined
as an elimination candidate."

1446
01:09:59,869 --> 01:10:03,640
(One of the Remaining players
must sacrifice for the raid.)

1447
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,039
One will be decided by a vote.

1448
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:06,939
During the vote...

1449
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:07,979
Three of us are voting?

1450
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:09,880
- We'll have another two here. Okay.
- Okay.

1451
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,310
(A vote decides the sacrificial player
and extra votes can be used.)

1452
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,050
The sacrificial player will be
the candidate of Deathmatch.

1453
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,579
He or she will be the scapegoat.

1454
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:20,850
This is fun.

1455
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,430
The sacrificial player seemed
like a passive role.

1456
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,359
One will be locked somewhere...

1457
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:32,329
and accept fate.

1458
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,000
Will it be possible...

1459
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:36,670
to peacefully choose
the sacrificial player by voting?

1460
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,439
I'm worried.

1461
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,840
I don't want to be the sacrificial player.

1462
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:44,579
A person with decent strength
should not be chosen as the sacrifice.

1463
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:48,949
Eat something if you're hungry.

1464
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:50,350
What's this? Gimbap?

1465
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,250
- A sweet potato or a potato.
- It's long.

1466
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,489
The shape looks like
it's a sweet potato or a potato.

1467
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,430
- This is too mean.
- I was right.

1468
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,130
Is this all they're giving us?

1469
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,729
A small sweet potato.

1470
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:02,960
My goodness.

1471
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:04,300
My gosh.

1472
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,840
(Eating)

1473
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,979
Do we need to wear the same outfit...

1474
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:20,909
until the raid?

1475
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:21,979
For goodness' sake.

1476
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,460
I wore the stupidest outfit
I could think of.

1477
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,630
For goodness' sake.

1478
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:35,560
This place is... What? It's here again.

1479
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,529
(The bell rings again.)

1480
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:40,729
I think it will say
we must choose a spy to send.

1481
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,239
This is unbelievable.

1482
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:43,970
Even if I go, I feel like I should find...

1483
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:46,340
more here before leaving.

1484
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,979
Let me see.

1485
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,649
- My goodness.
- "The spy player should..."

1486
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:54,520
"go to Bloody Paradise immediately."

1487
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,949
- Goodbye.
- We met for a short time, but...

1488
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:00,890
- I'll go and try to build a foundation.
- Have fun. Okay.

1489
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:02,789
Don't you think he'll do well?

1490
01:12:02,789 --> 01:12:05,689
He's a complex thinker.

1491
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,590
I think he'll do well.

1492
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,529
I'm worried about one thing.

1493
01:12:09,529 --> 01:12:11,729
It's something that Yurisa...

1494
01:12:11,729 --> 01:12:14,899
or someone with experience will point out.

1495
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:17,710
There won't be an announcement
that I'm eliminated.

1496
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,579
I think some might think that's odd.

1497
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:24,449
I'm not sure
if Jin Ho is prepared for that.

1498
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,810
- Stay healthy.
- You can do it.

1499
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,109
- Stay healthy?
- Go for the raid.

1500
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,079
Stay healthy until the raid.

1501
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:32,819
I'm not good at lying.

1502
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,260
I'll mix about 70-percent truth
with 30-percent of lies.

1503
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,489
I can hypnotize myself into believing...

1504
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:40,890
what I said is true.

1505
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,659
The most important thing is...

1506
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,399
my survival.

1507
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,300
Everything ends once I die.

1508
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:47,939
Simply put,

1509
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:51,369
I can act as a spy until the end
only if I survive.

1510
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:53,409
The longer I survive,

1511
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:57,079
I'll have more chances to act as a spy.

1512
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:03,380
The player to be eliminated is decided.

1513
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,590
Everyone, please come to the Main Hall.

1514
01:13:09,789 --> 01:13:11,359
What did you do?

1515
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,289
What if he comes in like
a homeless person?

1516
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:15,800
All muddy.

1517
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,930
As a result of the Deathmatch,
one player got eliminated.

1518
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,310
Congratulations to everyone
who survived the first challenge.

1519
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:28,239
- What?
- What?

1520
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,109
This is the end of the announcement.

1521
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,180
My gosh.

1522
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,380
That was unexpected.

1523
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,590
Everyone was confused.

1524
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:42,920
I'll announce the player who survived.

1525
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,689
"I'll announce the player who survived."

1526
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:47,800
- It was hard.
- What?

1527
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,159
- It was difficult.
- Welcome.

1528
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,430
(Deathmatch survivor: Hong Jin Ho)

1529
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:54,939
My goodness.

1530
01:13:54,939 --> 01:13:56,670
It's really intense from the first day.

1531
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,840
What's all this?

1532
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:08,319
I was immediately suspicious
of how he came back.

1533
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:10,149
What did you do?

1534
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:11,319
We had to play poker.

1535
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:12,750
What was the rule?

1536
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,890
Let me keep it to myself first.

1537
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,289
I think it's important
to know about the games.

1538
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:18,229
Someone who's been through
a Deathmatch is important.

1539
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,689
Where did you play?

1540
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,130
Somewhere like a complete ruin.

1541
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,300
On the second floor.

1542
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,600
- For the Deathmatch?
- Yes.

1543
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,340
Did Hye Seon go home?

1544
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,770
- Hye Seon?
- Yes.

1545
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,569
Who's that?

1546
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:32,670
The person who fought against me?

1547
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:36,510
What? This is too...

1548
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:39,949
I think he's a spy. He must be a spy.

1549
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:41,920
He's a spy.

1550
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,279
Hong Jin Ho is a spy.

1551
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,720
It was the worst situation.

1552
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,430
I thought they might find me suspicious,

1553
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:55,430
but it ended up being exactly
that kind of situation.

1554
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,130
Si Yoon said...

1555
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:00,199
As an experienced player of Bloody Game,

1556
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,239
I think there will be a spy.

1557
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,470
In your perspective,

1558
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,239
who do you think the spy is?

1559
01:15:08,779 --> 01:15:12,050
He asked, "Who do you think the spy is?"

1560
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:15,979
But deep down, he's like,
"I know you're a spy, you jerk."

1561
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:17,850
Whenever I say something,

1562
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:20,189
MJ looked at me with a straight face.

1563
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:22,289
They were very cold.

1564
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:23,760
I'm a spy,

1565
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:27,090
but more than 80 percent of the people
already saw me as a spy.

1566
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,500
It was a difficult situation.

1567
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:33,970
(Meanwhile, at Remaining)

1568
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,409
Whose water is this?

1569
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:42,609
- I think this is mine.
- Okay.

1570
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,539
Let's sit here together.

1571
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:45,710
Okay.

1572
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,750
But we can actually sit here.

1573
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:49,880
It's quite wet.

1574
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,050
- I'll sit next to you.
- It's fine.

1575
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:56,359
This is hard.

1576
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:03,229
Are my lips pale?

1577
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:07,399
There's some color.

1578
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:08,899
Your upper lip is a bit pale.

1579
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,340
I think there's some color.

1580
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:14,779
No, I'm...

1581
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:16,710
not positive at all.

1582
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,479
Hye Seon has...

1583
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,649
a bright, untroubled appearance.

1584
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,319
Will she be the same tomorrow?

1585
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,890
She asked if there was a lip tint.

1586
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:29,119
Lip tint...

1587
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:31,489
It's not the time to look for a lip tint.

1588
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,659
I'm worried.

1589
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,760
I didn't sleep
as much as I thought I would.

1590
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,199
It was too hot.

1591
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:14,500
I woke up earlier than I expected.

1592
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:17,239
I need to make sure I get enough sleep.

1593
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:24,439
It's making me crazy.

1594
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:33,319
There's nothing.

1595
01:17:33,819 --> 01:17:36,159
- This is unbelievable.
- Why?

1596
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:38,130
This is crazy.

1597
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,189
It's insane.

1598
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:44,560
Firstly, I was so tired.

1599
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,699
I couldn't think about where I was.

1600
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:49,369
I just fell asleep.

1601
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,770
But the weather was too humid.

1602
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,869
I was sweaty but I couldn't shower.

1603
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,140
It's really painful
that my body feels sticky...

1604
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,739
because I can't take a shower.

1605
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:00,180
Is there a valley nearby?

1606
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,279
I want to shower in the valley.

1607
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,579
My goodness. The fog.

1608
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,119
- My goodness.
- It's foggy.

1609
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,689
This is absurd.

1610
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,960
- Is it hidden?
- This place is a mess.

1611
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,100
Windows are broken. What's this?

1612
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,600
This is nonsense.

1613
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,439
Seriously. This is absurd.

1614
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,239
- What can we do here?
- I slept here.

1615
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:28,840
We just slept...

1616
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,880
Here.

1617
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,109
- My gosh.
- This is absurd.

1618
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,180
Seriously.

1619
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:35,449
It's devastating.

1620
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:36,819
This is absurd.

1621
