1
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:06,209
(The last morning in the Paradise)

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,609
Another sizzling day.

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,820
Gosh. How come it's so hot today?

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,129
We're determining
the one final winner in Bloody Game.

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,070
But eight players are too many.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,300
It's not the time to let the reins go yet.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,969
I promised myself
not to let my guard down.

8
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,170
We finally have eight players left.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,210
I was last in the first mission,

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,780
and the whole process was arduous.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,520
I tried to hang on...

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,149
and became 1 of the last 8 players.

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,219
I thought, "This turned out well."

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,460
I believe that everyone's a threat
right now.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm desperate.

16
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,759
It'll be legendary...

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,159
if we have the three players
from the Mansion...

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,100
with Min A.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,400
(Min A, Xitsuh, and Acau were allies
in the Mansion on Day 2.)

20
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,939
- That's the dream.
- It is.

21
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,939
If we add Steve,

22
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,379
it'll be 4 to 4
between the Mansion and Paradise.

23
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,879
Right. There's Steve too.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,780
Prison, Paradise,

25
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:18,379
and Mansion.

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,950
This is insane.

27
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,049
Listen.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,689
Min A is from the Mansion.

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,359
Steve is from the Paradise.

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,489
Xitsuh is from Prison.

31
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,700
And I'm from the Remaining.

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,430
We all split up.

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,030
And we regrouped.

34
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,099
(The old Mansion players are
back together.)

35
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,840
I came all the way here
after all those hardships.

36
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,540
I was glad that a lot of the players...

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,769
who played with me...

38
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,239
were still here.

39
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,640
I tried to look at it...

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,049
from multiple directions.

41
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,879
This is a game of odds,

42
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,650
so I believe I'll have...

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,349
a better chance of winning
if the game works for me.

44
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,060
I'm going to miss this view.

45
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,060
The crowded place was...

46
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,730
empty now.

47
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,969
It always feels weird this time around.

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,039
The sensation, I mean.

49
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,240
I came a long way,

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,110
and it wasn't the end.
I still had a long way to go.

51
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,610
I need to get a grip...

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,610
and get to the end.

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,150
I'm the only one left...

54
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,180
among the females.

55
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,120
I wasn't exactly desperate...

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,379
about being the champion.

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,490
I didn't think I stood a chance.

58
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,949
But now that I'm 1 of the final 8,

59
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,819
I suddenly...

60
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,259
want to win.

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,830
How are you going to play it?

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,830
- Today? Let's team up.
- Yes.

63
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,969
No one will suspect...

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,909
- that you and I are teaming up.
- Right.

65
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,379
If either one of us has a shot at winning,

66
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:54,280
we should prevent each other
from placing last,

67
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,650
help each other out,

68
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,250
and give the Immunity Pass to the other.

69
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Okay.

70
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,650
It's a simple strategy.

71
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,120
As long as it's a game
that will work for us.

72
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,189
We need to invest
all the relationships we've built...

73
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,189
in this one.

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,099
I had never...

75
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,229
teamed up with Jin Ho before,

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
so no one could assume...

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,669
that we were an alliance.

78
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,669
Because we've always been enemies.

79
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,710
So, the two of us...

80
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,050
made a promise.

81
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,349
In the most critical situation,

82
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,189
we promised to team up.

83
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,889
Please gather at the Main Hall.

84
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,590
This is a small group.

85
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,889
It's gotten so small.

86
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,699
"Today's Money Challenge is..."

87
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,270
Today, the Pre-final Stage begins.

88
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,240
(The Pre-final Stage?)

89
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,210
There will be two rounds
in the Pre-final Stage,

90
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,550
and a total of four players
will advance to the finals.

91
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,889
Depending on the result of today's game,
the first two players...

92
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,960
will advance to the finals first.

93
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,530
We're going to the finals right away?

94
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,529
I hope I can be 1 of the top 2.

95
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,759
It's a huge benefit.

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,329
You become the person who's
the closest to the 100,000-dollar prize.

97
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,439
I'm dying to go.

98
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,040
I only have eyes on first place.

99
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,240
I should play well today...

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
and secure a spot.

101
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:34,649
So, no one's being eliminated today.

102
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,410
Then, I'll be able to play...

103
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,649
more aggressively.

104
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,550
It's going to be a literal dogfight.

105
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,990
It sounds fun.

106
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,089
Today's game is...

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,730
Cutline.

108
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,529
Cutline is an eight-player
individual game...

109
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,600
where players strategically place
their cards...

110
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,899
within a limited range of slots...

111
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,339
to earn points.

112
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,310
The game consists
of a total of three rounds.

113
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,410
Before the game begins,
each player is given...

114
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,279
two sets of numbered cards...

115
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,779
ranging from 1 to 6
and distinguished by color...

116
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,389
and 20 coins.

117
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,060
Before each round,

118
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,990
players submit coins...

119
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,430
to bid for the right to decide
the card placement order.

120
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,670
The player who bids the most coins...

121
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,069
selects the order of
the first card placements for that round.

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,139
The second card placement order is...

123
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,939
determined in reverse
from the first round's order.

124
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,439
In each round,

125
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,949
players must place a total of three cards
on the game board.

126
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,649
One during the first placement,
and two during the second placement.

127
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,420
The game board consists of four slots,

128
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,750
each with a maximum card capacity...

129
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,459
and a limit determined for each round.

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,689
Players can freely place their cards
in any slot...

131
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,560
as long as the card capacity
is not exceeded.

132
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,959
At the start of each round,

133
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,500
each player is randomly assigned
one rule card.

134
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,540
When placing a number card,

135
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,540
players may submit a rule card
and coins to the desired slot.

136
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,939
If multiple players submit...

137
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,939
rule cards to the same slot,

138
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,879
only the rule submitted by the player
who bid the most coins...

139
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,120
will be applied.

140
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,079
All other rule cards and coins...

141
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,149
will be discarded.

142
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,420
Once all cards have been placed,

143
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,889
the number cards and rules...

144
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,560
applied to each slot are revealed.

145
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,399
Cards in each slot are registered...

146
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,399
based on the following conditions.

147
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,139
One, cards with higher numbers...

148
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,899
are prioritized for registration.

149
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,240
Two, for cards with the same number,

150
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,180
the card placed earlier takes priority.

151
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,910
Three,

152
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,180
if the total value of cards in a slot
exceeds the limit,

153
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,920
the cards exceeding the limit
are discarded,

154
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,720
and the next lowest cards are registered.

155
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,560
These conditions can be altered...

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,430
based on the rule card
applied to the slot.

157
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,860
Players earn points
based on the number cards...

158
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,129
successfully registered in the slots.

159
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,970
After three rounds,

160
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,000
the two players
with the highest total scores...

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,939
advance directly to the Final Match.

162
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,569
That's complicated.

163
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,740
Soon, Cutline will begin.

164
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,050
I wasn't so sure.

165
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,550
I thought luck would play a huge part.

166
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,250
It was a game of luck.

167
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,490
The order of submitting cards...

168
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,220
Also, I don't know
who will be before or after me.

169
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,519
And there are rule cards.

170
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,589
Rule cards.

171
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,490
Those rule cards...

172
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,360
would influence the game a lot.

173
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,300
I'm obviously going to do my best,

174
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,800
but some parts are up to luck.

175
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,370
That was my thought.

176
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,670
Those who don't know might say...

177
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,800
that it's a game of chance.

178
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,540
But it's purely a psychological game.

179
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,069
A game of predictions and a mind game.

180
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,050
I needed to predict...

181
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,709
the opponents' next moves.

182
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,180
"He's going to do this."

183
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,920
"He's going to do this since he's afraid."

184
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,720
"She's going to be bold in this part."

185
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,560
You need to analyze their minds first.

186
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,189
As a man who has a better grip
of these seven players...

187
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,259
than anyone here,

188
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,670
it's like taking candy
out of a kid's pocket.

189
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,370
Players, pick...

190
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,470
a number card each.

191
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,610
(Reading the room)

192
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
Give me the green one!

193
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,279
I got the blue one.

194
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,950
Are those your lucky colors?

195
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
No, it was for no reason.

196
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,519
Wait. I got pink.

197
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,649
A man must go for pink.

198
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,220
A man must go for black.

199
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,090
Black suits you.

200
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,929
Players, show the color of your cards.

201
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:45,929
We'll check the colors.

202
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:47,899
Let's see.

203
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,830
(Kim Min A, Xitsuh, Steve Yea, Acau,)

204
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,970
(Jang Dong Min, Joo Eon Kyu,
Heo Seong Beom, and Hong Jin Ho)

205
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,070
You will now have 30 minutes...

206
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,740
for a strategic meeting.

207
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,279
Let's go.

208
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,080
It's meaningless
unless you place first or second.

209
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,279
Should we help each other out?

210
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,980
- Oh, gosh.
- I'm not sure.

211
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,250
(The 4 players from the Mansion gather
on the 3rd floor.)

212
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,320
Oh, gosh.

213
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,960
We naturally split into teams of four.

214
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:15,960
It's basically 4 to 4.

215
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,559
By Round Two,

216
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,429
there will be people who get worried.

217
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,269
When that happens,
let's boost the one from the Mansion.

218
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,870
Right. I had an idea.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,700
The top two players should be among us.

220
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,809
That way,
we can be proud of making the winners.

221
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:31,580
Darn it.

222
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,980
We don't get to say that
after eliminating each other,

223
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,179
being eliminated on purpose,
and running away.

224
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,149
We'll have to come up with a strategy...

225
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,389
by sharing the rule cards.

226
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,049
Place the cards on your own,

227
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,120
but share the information.

228
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,919
We're all after the first two places,
after all.

229
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,960
Let's do that.

230
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,860
Somehow, Acau, Steve,

231
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,529
Min A and I teamed up,

232
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,399
and we turned out to be
players from the Mansion.

233
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,129
In the very first phase.

234
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,039
I was like, "Fine."

235
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,840
There are 4 Mansion players
and 4 Paradise players,

236
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,570
so the Mansion players decided to team up.

237
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,110
I think those four are teaming up.

238
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,509
- Seriously?
- Yes.

239
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
This is bad.

240
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,720
- Those four?
- Yes.

241
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,950
They want to play
as Team Ex-Mansion and Team Paradise.

242
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,620
Min A and Xitsuh are the type to go,

243
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,820
"I'll make..."

244
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,289
"Steve and Acau win,
even if I can't get any points."

245
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,190
They're capable of supporting others
for no reason.

246
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,259
Right. That will be a problem for us.

247
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,129
Even though we play individually,

248
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,440
we should consider teaming up...

249
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,399
when it comes to deciding the order.

250
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,940
We work together
in the card placement order...

251
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,210
- and share the rule cards.
- Yes.

252
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,940
- That's about it.
- That doesn't sound bad.

253
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
There will be two winners
among us that way.

254
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,009
- Let's go over there and join the group.
- Yes.

255
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,820
- Okay.
- Let's do that first.

256
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,350
I don't want to turn this
into a 4-on-4 match.

257
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,090
- We should join them...
- Let's talk.

258
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,419
- and mingle.
- Yes.

259
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,889
That's better.

260
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,629
Let's team up. All seven of us.

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,059
Dong Min isn't there, right?

262
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,429
- Let's make a 7-person team.
- A 7-person team?

263
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,669
We need to exclude Seong Beom, though.

264
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,440
Seong Beom is his best friend,
so it should be 6 to 2.

265
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,210
There's one person who isn't here.

266
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,710
What if we all spend some coins...

267
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,710
to get in that man's way?

268
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,679
(That man has entered.)

269
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,250
Like, "Please let me use a rule card."

270
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,679
The second player will get B and C.

271
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,789
And...

272
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,350
(That man quietly calls for Seong Beom.)

273
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
It's 6 to 2 now.

274
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,659
Is it 6 to 2?

275
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,460
Do we need to play against those two only?

276
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,529
No. I need to get makeup.

277
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:39,000
Jin Ho and Eon Kyu are playing together,

278
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,639
and the other four are
trying to play together.

279
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,070
Those four have been...

280
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,110
talking together since yesterday.

281
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,179
Steve, Xitsuh, Min A, and Acau.

282
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,350
No one can sacrifice themselves today.

283
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:54,549
That's true.

284
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,690
Then,

285
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,620
let's at least share that.

286
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,259
- The rule card.
- Yes.

287
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,659
- Sure.
- Tell each other what rule card we have.

288
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,330
- I'd like that.
- And we need to know...

289
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,559
- what cards they have.
- That's true.

290
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,500
That way, we can cover for each other.

291
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,730
I don't think we can talk...

292
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,740
Xitsuh or Steve into it.

293
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,710
But I think we can win Min A over.

294
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,980
I thought this game was...

295
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,850
where we needed to make use...

296
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,850
of all the hard work...

297
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,450
and the relationships we've built...

298
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,620
to the fullest.

299
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,159
So, maybe there should be...

300
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,259
teams or alliances.

301
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,559
I'm not sure, though.

302
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,529
I'm not sure which one to pick.

303
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,000
But I don't mind either way.

304
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Oh, man.

305
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,539
This won't do.

306
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,669
(Reading the room)

307
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,210
Take your cards out.
We'll decide who wins them.

308
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,009
- Let's end the game here.
- Why don't we exchange them?

309
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,750
(He quietly brings Jin Ho out.)

310
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,960
Dong Min is trying really hard
to come up with a plan.

311
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,990
He's bringing people out.

312
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,029
I think he wants to play
by himself this time.

313
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,929
- There's no way.
- There's no way.

314
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,730
What an absolute lie.

315
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,700
That's a ridiculous lie.

316
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,769
I just talked to him.

317
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,070
- Seong Beom.
- Yes?

318
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,309
That's not how you lie to people.

319
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,340
It's yesterday all over again.

320
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,509
Let's promise each other
to always tell the truth.

321
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:27,610
- Okay.
- All right?

322
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,309
- Only the truth between us.
- Yes.

323
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,350
We might place first...

324
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,950
or not in the end,

325
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,379
- so that's up to us.
- Yes.

326
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,490
And you can't tell a lie
when you give me...

327
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,320
information from Eon Kyu.

328
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
- Of course.
- Yes.

329
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,419
- Only the truth between us.
- Yes.

330
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,529
- Let's make that sure.
- Yes.

331
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,330
(Glaring)

332
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
- Min A.
- Yes.

333
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,500
- Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

334
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,830
He's already begun.

335
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,100
Seriously.

336
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,470
We all have the right
to have a chat with each other.

337
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,009
There's nothing to talk about
at this stage.

338
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,179
You're being ridiculous.

339
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,779
He's taking my sacrifice away.

340
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,909
Your sacrifice?

341
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,519
That's harsh.

342
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,350
Jin Ho, are you playing
completely individually?

343
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,889
I'm willing to cooperate, though.

344
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,919
But not completely individually.

345
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,789
It'll be fun
if they block all communication...

346
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,059
and make us play individually.

347
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,100
- I'd feel more at ease, then.
- That's easier, actually.

348
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,159
That'd be so fun.

349
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,830
It'd be best if they prevented that
in the first place.

350
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,700
It'd be so fun
if we all played individually.

351
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Yes.

352
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,139
This game is only fun...

353
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,139
if we play completely individually.

354
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,539
Right. I wish I could play individually.

355
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,940
But it feels like a loss
if I don't team up.

356
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,710
- Right.
- Jin Ho.

357
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,139
- Yes?
- Can we talk for a moment?

358
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,179
Sure.

359
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,950
They keep fostering distrust.

360
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,850
I talked to the Devil.

361
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,190
You know we have that today, right?

362
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,889
- The Evil Spirit?
- Yes.

363
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,990
The Evil Spirits are still here.

364
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,759
Seong Beom has a red set.

365
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,899
This is a talisman
to ward off Evil Spirits.

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,070
- What was it about?
- What?

367
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,740
He tried to coax me...

368
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,370
into giving him information.

369
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,909
- We talked about...
- But I don't trust him.

370
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,039
We talked about that,

371
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,379
and it creates mistrust
just by calling us out.

372
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,679
- That's true.
- He's trying to break us apart.

373
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,149
Let me make it clear. You're my sacrifice.

374
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,480
Guys. Let's talk between the four of us.

375
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,720
- They're four people too.
- Yes.

376
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,250
I know, right? They've formed a team.

377
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,259
- They're in a scrum.
- Steve, Acau, and Xitsuh...

378
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,690
have lost their minds already.

379
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,289
That's not what I mean.

380
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,860
They're blinded by the thought
of making Dong Min lose.

381
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,370
I can't communicate with them at all.

382
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,970
I tried talking to Min A,

383
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,070
but she already lost her mind as well.

384
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,769
- Even Min A?
- Yes.

385
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,840
- She's gone too?
- Yes.

386
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,679
The site has negative vibes.

387
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,379
That's where Chungju-Man was.

388
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
- They're mad.
- Right?

389
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,710
Something's blocking them.

390
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,820
Are they possessed?
Aren't they the Evil Spirits?

391
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,279
They still don't get it after all that.

392
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,149
I bet Steve is asking them to boost him.

393
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,289
- Exactly.
- Yes.

394
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,620
He's thinking,

395
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
"I have three sacrifices."

396
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,860
I don't get why they're still with him...

397
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,830
when he's calling them his sacrifices.

398
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,230
(Glaring)

399
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,240
Those four are sticking together.

400
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,539
The moment we entered,

401
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,539
they started staring.

402
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Let's go out for a smoke.

403
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,809
What's your plan, Jin Ho?

404
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,850
We haven't decided on anything yet.

405
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,950
You know,

406
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,350
just looking at the members on our team...

407
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,690
Well, we can't exactly call it a team.

408
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,590
Anyway,
as soon as the four of you teamed up,

409
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,419
we figured...

410
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,490
that you were boosting certain members.

411
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,100
Eon Kyu and I can't do anything,
no matter how hard we try...

412
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,330
in this situation.

413
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,429
So, we're not so happy about that.

414
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,870
I actually root for the idea.

415
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,639
If everyone promises...

416
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,639
with their honor on the line...

417
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,970
to play without disclosing any cards...

418
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,139
or discussing things.

419
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,240
Then, I'm for the idea.

420
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,250
But that's not possible.

421
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,509
I actually like that...

422
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,909
- when I play.
- So do I.

423
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,450
Yes. But it's a matter
of whether it's possible.

424
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,450
Can they be trusted? Is this possible?

425
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,250
Can everyone play honestly with honor?

426
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm 100 percent for it.

427
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,789
I won't get in anyone's way...

428
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:00,789
or boost anyone.

429
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,889
I'll need to talk to them about that.

430
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,960
Yes. Let's have
a group meeting or something.

431
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,569
With Xitsuh and Steve as their leaders,

432
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,140
Min A and Acau...

433
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,099
had already formed a team.

434
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,109
The game will be over...

435
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,240
if it's three against others.

436
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,940
So, we just decided...

437
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,880
to play by ourselves...

438
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,980
and individually try...

439
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,380
to win the game.

440
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,450
That's when we came up with the idea...

441
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,420
of playing a free-for-all.

442
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,049
We'll all play individually.

443
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,720
Even if we play as a team,

444
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,630
only two players will advance
to the finals.

445
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,460
So, we were in a situation
where we could...

446
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,930
literally play individually.

447
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:42,970
(The players gather in one place.)

448
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,039
Why are you swarming in?
You're scaring me.

449
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,799
The Evil Spirits.

450
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,240
I've talked to everyone except for Steve.

451
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,539
But I thought we'd be on the same page.

452
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,880
Here's the idea.

453
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,980
We got a completely fair game this time.

454
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,250
So, how about we play individually,
for real?

455
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,890
That's what we talked about just now.

456
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,960
Of course, Steve and others might think...

457
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,829
that we'd still find a way
to communicate...

458
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,869
after making this promise.

459
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,670
But you'll know
if you've played with me before.

460
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,900
I always keep my word.

461
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,809
I have no intention...

462
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,809
of staining the reputation I've built...

463
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,380
by lying about that.

464
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,950
If you all agree,

465
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,819
why don't we take this chance
to determine who's a better player?

466
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,990
None of us will share
anything with anyone.

467
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,559
Let's have a purely individual match.

468
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,859
That doesn't make sense. No way.

469
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,099
- Why doesn't this make sense?
- It doesn't make sense.

470
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,400
How could I trust him?

471
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,670
Do you trust him?

472
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,170
Yes, I do. If everyone agrees
to play individually, I will.

473
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,339
I won't.

474
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:00,710
This game requires teams.
How can I trust what he says?

475
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,180
We already played a lot of games.
When we played as teams,

476
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,779
my team was at a disadvantage many times.

477
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,619
There were spies and so on.

478
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,160
There was trickery and all.

479
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,089
After all that, my team...

480
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,259
finally had the upper hand with this game.

481
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,960
I had a solid team.

482
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,299
Because they were at a disadvantage,

483
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,869
they suggested that we play individually.

484
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,440
That's just a low move.

485
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,210
Well, I was frustrated and annoyed.

486
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,680
To be honest, Steve and I had gotten
along well as friends before the show.

487
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,650
But he doesn't trust people.

488
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,309
If there's a way to address the issue,
he can keep doubting people.

489
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,279
There's no solution for that.
But he keeps doubting them.

490
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,680
So our discussion didn't go anywhere.

491
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,119
That kind of behavior
made me uncomfortable.

492
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,019
We can't dismiss the possibility...

493
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,430
that they might play as a team
even if we decide...

494
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,059
to play individually.

495
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,700
Our team had already been cheated before.

496
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,170
To be honest,
isn't Dong Min like an ex-convict for it?

497
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,769
Because of the history,

498
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,869
I could understand Steve's reaction.

499
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:03,109
I understood
why Steve couldn't trust them.

500
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,079
There's nothing I can do
if you don't trust me.

501
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,779
- But I...
- I would agree if we make it a rule...

502
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,289
that we must play individually.

503
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,619
- Unless that's the case...
- We can make it a rule then.

504
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,160
We can all stay in our room.

505
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,990
Well, I've played with all of you.

506
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,930
Think about it. I just made a suggestion
in front of everyone here.

507
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,829
I wouldn't suddenly go to Seong Beom
and ask what card he drew.

508
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,970
I'm not that kind of low player.

509
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,869
Right? Xitsuh. Min A, right?

510
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,940
But a verbal agreement means nothing.

511
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,109
- Right.
- We must come up with a system.

512
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,079
Right. As I told you,
we could all stay in our room.

513
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,650
Here's what you worry about.

514
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,779
That I might have a hidden plan
after saying I would play individually.

515
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,920
- Right?
- That's not what this is about.

516
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,190
I don't see the need
to let that possibility be an option.

517
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,490
Right. So...

518
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,259
I'm all for it if we come up
with a strict system to ensure this.

519
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,799
Actually, it doesn't matter
what game we play. Steve...

520
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,269
He always complained that
I planned it or whatnot.

521
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,569
So he doesn't plan anything then?

522
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,539
"Dong Min is good at this game."

523
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,910
"Dong Min has the upper hand here."

524
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,769
To be honest, I'm quite annoyed.

525
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,440
You know what?
We were in the middle of a discussion.

526
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,380
The four of us will discuss it.
If they are okay with it...

527
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,720
- Okay. Let us know what you decide.
- Yes.

528
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
Let's see what to do
based on their decision.

529
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,490
(The former Paradise players
leave them in private.)

530
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:28,230
What do you think?

531
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,660
If we are all going
to be in the same place...

532
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,630
and can play it individually,
I'd like to try it.

533
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,599
Here's what I think.
By playing individually,

534
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,470
if it means everyone will play
for themselves,

535
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
I'll do it.

536
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,970
- They could have an ulterior motive?
- Definitely.

537
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,940
Is there a way to trust them?

538
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,609
Let's say we trust them 99 percent.

539
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,119
If there's a one-percent chance
that they might betray us,

540
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,619
all of us will be harmed.

541
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,650
- But you trust Jin Ho, don't you?
- You...

542
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,890
I trust Dong Min
since I've played with him before.

543
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,390
He won't stoop that low.

544
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,460
We can't say it's stooping low.

545
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
It's within the rule.
He didn't break any rule.

546
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,000
Everything he is saying now
could be his way...

547
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,230
- of appeasing us or playing politics.
- Right.

548
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,500
To be honest, I could have rolled with it
if Dong Min weren't here.

549
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,140
- But honestly, I can't trust him.
- Really?

550
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,039
After everything he said,
I don't think he would betray us.

551
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,380
As long as I have some fun, I don't care.

552
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,779
I can be on board with your decision.

553
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,019
I welcomed playing individually
with open arms.

554
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,250
I loved the idea.

555
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,049
I thought
I could only focus on the game at last.

556
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,690
And that I could stop thinking
about politics for a while.

557
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,059
But Steve started to point out flaws
of the system. Like to play individually,

558
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,960
there must be rules.
He brought up the rules and so on.

559
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,900
Steve has a deep distrust of people.

560
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,529
He's the most untrustworthy player,
though.

561
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,769
When Dong Min and Jin Ho...

562
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,509
suggested that we play individually,
I was so happy.

563
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:50,970
Actually, I wanted to show people...

564
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,539
playing individually
rather than as a team.

565
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,480
In a way, it was an opportunity for me.

566
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,109
I'll be honest.
Let's say it wasn't Dong Min.

567
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,650
If it was Jin Ho,
I would trust him and be on board.

568
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:01,220
But that's not the case.
Think about all the times he tricked us.

569
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,490
So it's impossible
to just overlook the history...

570
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,920
and play the game
while fully trusting him.

571
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,420
This isn't our first time
playing with him.

572
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,390
By the way, Steve is something else too.

573
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Being able to tell me,

574
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,029
"How can I trust you?"
after everything I said...

575
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,230
That's something else, isn't it?

576
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,299
- He's a crazy guy.
- Right.

577
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,839
They're talking way too long.

578
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,170
- I'm certain he'll try something.
- There's a plan.

579
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,410
There's no way he'll do this...

580
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,809
especially when his score is low.

581
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,339
He'll try to do something to save himself.

582
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,279
I'm sure there's a secret plan.

583
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,150
Naively trusting him with this
makes no sense to me.

584
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,119
Or we could do this with the chairs.

585
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,819
- We can make a big circle with them.
- Right.

586
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,319
- We can be right next to him.
- Whatever it is, he can still try.

587
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,759
He can make signals.

588
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,660
Dong Min and Seong Beom must be separated.

589
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,160
Because their bond is strong?

590
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,930
I don't know what to do. Darn it.

591
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Did you guys discuss it?

592
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,099
- What?
- Did you discuss it?

593
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,710
Well, he's still thinking about it.

594
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,970
- He...
- Why is it taking so long?

595
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,279
As you know, it's because of one guy.

596
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,440
Come on. This is annoying.

597
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,710
Playing individually makes no sense.

598
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,750
Gosh, Jin Ho trusts people too easily.

599
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,420
- Right.
- He was tricked so many times.

600
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,490
Are you concerned they might play dirty?

601
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,859
Jin Ho. Let's be honest here.

602
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,589
They could let each other know
which card they played...

603
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,500
and which rule card they got
through body language or something.

604
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,930
If they want, they can totally do it.

605
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,630
Yes, that's possible.
But they swear they won't do it.

606
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,470
- They won't...
- They swear?

607
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,339
Seriously.
You trust people easily, Jin Ho.

608
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,740
No, hear me out.

609
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,140
- I understand your point.
- Yes.

610
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,039
Deception isn't breaking the rule.

611
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,079
Dong Min can use any other method.
It's all allowed in this game.

612
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,710
If that's what you think,
separate only me.

613
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,579
It's not that I can't trust you.

614
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,519
It's that 99 percent of you
might not want to trick us.

615
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,789
- But there's a one-percent risk for us.
- Okay.

616
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,160
As I told you earlier,

617
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,930
I'm all for playing this game
individually 100 percent.

618
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,559
- I told you I was on board with that.
- Yes.

619
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,930
You can discuss a system or a rule
among yourselves.

620
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,900
If you tell me what it is, I'll follow it.

621
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,380
When we played Good and Evil yesterday
in the beginning,

622
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,480
we all sat down together
because Dong Min suggested it.

623
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,579
If you had to leave, you had to go alone.

624
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:11,849
When we're sitting down together,
we won't talk about the game.

625
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,279
We'll just wait. When the time is up,
we'll take turns to go.

626
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,119
We can use that system.

627
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,059
We can be together the whole time.
And if you have to use the bathroom,

628
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,559
- it can't overlap with someone else.
- One at a time.

629
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,859
- You must smoke alone too.
- So...

630
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,759
Right. If we use that system,
we might be able to play individually.

631
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,930
The rule would be
at least the seven of us must be together.

632
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,099
- Yes. The chairs won't be connected.
- That sounds good.

633
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:31,940
Well...

634
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,940
Everyone wants to do it.

635
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,680
I want that too.

636
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,450
It didn't matter for me
if we played individually or not.

637
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,150
It's just that my chance went down a bit.

638
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,549
I thought I wouldn't be at a disadvantage.

639
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,480
So I accepted their suggestion.

640
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,490
In the end, I was persuaded.

641
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:54,220
If I could make a decision unilaterally,

642
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,960
I would have played with my team.

643
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,730
Trying to get 2 out of 4 people to win
is easier in terms of probability...

644
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,599
than trying to get
2 out of 8 people to win.

645
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,440
So forming an alliance
gave us an advantage.

646
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,470
In my opinion, that was the best decision
we could have made.

647
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,779
Round One of Cutline will begin.

648
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,980
Before submitting a card,

649
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,619
the bidding to decide the order
will be held.

650
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,690
To make a sealed bid,
the players will now...

651
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,089
enter one at a time,

652
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,059
state the amount of your bid,
and submit it.

653
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
- What should we do with the order?
- We have to bid for it.

654
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,029
So how should we do it?

655
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,759
You can do whatever you want.
We're all playing for ourselves.

656
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,660
- I see. We'll bid on our own too?
- Yes.

657
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,970
If you want to bid, you can decide
the order however you want.

658
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,029
If you want to bet coins, go ahead.

659
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,799
Then I'll go first.

660
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,769
This will be fun.

661
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,140
Min A. Will you bid to decide the order?

662
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,480
I won't.

663
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:52,680
I didn't think the order was important
for this game.

664
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,019
Wherever you ended up,
there are pros and cons.

665
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:57,549
I thought it would be a waste
to use coins on the bid.

666
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,420
I thought I had to go all-in
with the items.

667
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,829
Min A, you drew a card that allows you...

668
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,730
to destroy the first card that was played.

669
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,200
Not arranging the order well...

670
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,069
could cause bad blood with some people.

671
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:13,740
I didn't want to be the one arranging it.

672
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,339
I won't bid.

673
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:16,970
Please draw a rule card.

674
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,410
I'll pick this one.

675
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:23,009
You drew a card that allows you
to decrease the limit by three.

676
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,920
Will I choose after others have seen them?

677
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,319
Or will I pick first?

678
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,559
I won't bid.

679
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,619
It would be great
if I can win the bidding.

680
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,589
But the moment I fail,

681
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,930
I wouldn't get my coins back.
I would lose them.

682
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,200
That was a huge risk.

683
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,670
I had to be mindful
about the loss I would face.

684
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,430
Jin Ho, you drew a rule card...

685
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,240
that allows you to decrease
the maximum number of cards by one.

686
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,339
I think this card is for defense.

687
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,779
It's not a great card.

688
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,539
Darn it. Okay.

689
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,809
Draw a rule card.

690
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,319
Seong Beom. You drew a rule card that
allows you to increase the limit by three.

691
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,819
Eon Kyu. You drew a rule card that
allows you to destroy card number six.

692
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,430
Steve. You drew a rule card that allows
to register low-numbered cards first.

693
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,599
Please.

694
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,529
You chose a rule card that allows...

695
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,940
the player with the item to register
their first card before any player.

696
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,509
Xitsuh. Will you bid to decide the order?

697
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:24,509
No.

698
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,039
I thought the items were more important.

699
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,250
I wanted to use the coins
when bidding for the items.

700
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,880
Gosh, come on.

701
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:37,119
You drew a rule card that allows you
to change the first card played...

702
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,059
from card number 6 to card number 1.

703
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,960
I got the worst one.

704
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,529
(Destroy the 1st card played,
increase the limit by 3,)

705
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,660
(decrease the limit by 3,
destroy the 1st card played if it is a 6,)

706
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,829
(decease the number of card by 1,
register low-numbered cards first,)

707
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:47,960
(priority registration for the player
who submits a rule card,)

708
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,069
(change the card number 6 to 1
if it is the 1st card played)

709
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,240
Since we're all playing individually,
I'm even more nervous.

710
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,710
I wonder how it will happen.
I don't know what to expect.

711
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,970
- Did you bid?
- What?

712
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,640
Hey, don't even ask such questions.

713
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,009
- They'll suspect us.
- Are you two a team?

714
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,279
I can't ask questions?
Everyone can hear it.

715
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,920
(Staring)

716
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,589
Look at him licking the lid.

717
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,890
That means you did place a bid.

718
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,660
Don't signal each other
with such body language.

719
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,789
What should we do?
Should we say he violated the rule?

720
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,099
- No.
- He just breathed.

721
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,259
That's a signal.

722
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,430
You said you wouldn't breathe.

723
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,170
The bidding to decide the order is closed.

724
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,380
See? The system is already falling apart.

725
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
- What?
- You know?

726
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,279
We all have to sit down.
Only one of them must go.

727
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,079
It's just Acau who left.

728
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,849
No, the three of them are together.

729
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,250
Oh, this? We're just getting food.

730
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,420
They're getting food.

731
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,019
They could talk while getting food.

732
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,259
Okay.

733
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:48,420
When you guys are getting food,
could you step away from each other?

734
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,759
They must go one at a time.

735
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,660
Why are you not following the rule?
Then just forget about this whole thing.

736
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,500
- What is this?
- Okay.

737
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,099
They said we would play individually.

738
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,569
But Dong Min is capable
of plotting a scheme behind my back.

739
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,940
It's not just Dong Min. Other players...

740
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,180
could team up in secret.

741
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,809
I wanted to prevent that from happening
as much as possible.

742
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,750
When they had to use the toilet,
they had to go alone.

743
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,180
The remaining seven of us
had to be together and all.

744
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,079
- Since I was first, I'll get the food.
- Okay.

745
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:16,990
What are we doing? I thought
we were going to follow the rule.

746
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,920
I think the players will follow the rule
on their own.

747
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,190
I thought,
"He's still behaving like that."

748
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,900
We decided to play individually.
We could just play a clean game.

749
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,170
He didn't seem cooperative.

750
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,700
I'll go and use the toilet.

751
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:35,569
- We have to report to everyone.
- My gosh.

752
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,109
- This is a prison cell.
- Go ahead.

753
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:38,509
Don't sit next to each other when you eat.

754
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,380
- Okay.
- Leave two seats in between.

755
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,150
How can we play in this scary environment?

756
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,680
You guys can sit in between us.

757
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,980
Who? Us?

758
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,549
If you guys are suspicious of us,

759
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,519
- you can sit in between us.
- Gosh. If we do that,

760
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,519
- a new team might form.
- No. There could be a new team.

761
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,130
This guy can't see that possibility.

762
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,589
Why are you so trusting of people?

763
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,359
I told you.
That's why I was scammed a lot.

764
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,099
We have to trust each other.
What could we do?

765
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,500
So what if there are suspicions?

766
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,140
Are we going to do a lie detector test?

767
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,710
I was really uncomfortable
by everything...

768
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,839
these distrusting players said.

769
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,609
No player participated in the bidding...

770
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,279
to decide the order for Round One.

771
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,349
You will draw number cards
to decide the order randomly.

772
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:25,960
- What is this?
- My gosh.

773
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,420
- Come on, guys.
- We're all about the same.

774
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,460
My goodness.

775
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,630
(No one partook in the bidding
for Round 1.)

776
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,829
My gosh, seriously.

777
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,730
I should've put in one coin then.

778
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,599
- I should've put in one coin.
- My gosh.

779
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:39,069
I never thought that
no one would participate...

780
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:41,769
in the bidding for Round One.

781
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,240
"Someone probably did it."

782
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,710
But after hearing that no one did,

783
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,109
I think everyone felt the risk
of wasting coins.

784
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,880
They're being the most careful right now.

785
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,880
So they must be thinking
of utilizing the coins...

786
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,349
toward the second half of the game.

787
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:01,019
I think everyone had the same strategy.

788
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:03,289
You will now decide the order.

789
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,960
- Draw one card at a time.
- Come on.

790
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,500
(Drawing at lightning speed)

791
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,059
That's not so important.

792
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,529
Come on.

793
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:10,799
I'm doomed.

794
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,200
Reveal the cards you drew.

795
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,740
- Gosh, Jin Ho.
- Come on.

796
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,779
- Number two.
- What is this?

797
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:21,910
(Hong Jin Ho draws 2.)

798
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,210
That's your number.

799
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,720
It looks like
this will be our final ranking.

800
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,849
That's good then.

801
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,150
(The order of card submissions)

802
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,720
(Dong Min, Jin Ho, Min A, Acau, Xitsuh,
Eon Kyu, Seong Beom, and Steve)

803
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,589
(Dong Min, Jin Ho, Min A, Acau, Xitsuh,
Eon Kyu, Seong Beom, and Steve)

804
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:36,190
(Dong Min, Jin Ho, Min A, Acau, Xitsuh,
Eon Kyu, Seong Beom, and Steve)

805
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:37,789
Steve, what's your number?

806
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,099
- Fourth, right?
- Eighth.

807
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,759
Acau and Xitsuh got nice numbers.

808
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,369
The card gave off good energy
for some reason.

809
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,200
Which card should I play for Round One?

810
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:50,809
It's the worst for the players
who have to go first.

811
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,240
Like players in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

812
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,309
When I get there, I won't see any cards.
But I have to make a guess.

813
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,720
I have to pick something
without having any data.

814
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,880
Then everyone will go after me.
When it's time for me to go again,

815
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:04,750
I'll have to make another decision
after the round is practically over.

816
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,359
Going eighth was iffy.

817
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,519
I had to play another card back to back.

818
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,730
I thought I was at a disadvantage.

819
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,859
So I wasn't happy.

820
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,230
You will now submit your 1st card
for Round 1.

821
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,470
(Everyone has a different opinion
on the disadvantage of the order.)

822
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,500
Player One, within 30 minutes,

823
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,769
please submit a card to a desired slot.

824
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,420
(The limits and the number of cards
vary in the 4 slots.)

825
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,119
(The limits and the number of cards
vary in the 4 slots.)

826
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,960
Why are there so many?

827
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,200
I couldn't be too timid...

828
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:48,500
or too bold either.

829
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,970
I'll submit Number Four to Slot D.

830
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,569
(Dong Min submits number 4 to Slot D.)

831
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,670
I was going to use an item no matter what.

832
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:01,980
So placing it in Slot D...

833
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,609
Only five cards can be placed in Slot D.

834
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,480
So I thought it wasn't a big number
for players.

835
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,489
With my card,
I might be able to score six points.

836
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,059
Hello.

837
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,619
(The second player, Jin Ho, enters.)

838
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,989
I saw slots with 6, 7, and 8 cards.

839
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,329
That was the order.

840
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,599
As the game progresses,
there will be more cards.

841
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,030
There will be more variables.

842
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,030
So for my first card,

843
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,039
I thought I should go with a slot...

844
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,300
where I could place a low-numbered card.

845
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,039
Why is it taking so long?

846
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,869
Jin Ho isn't back yet, right?

847
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,539
- No.
- He hasn't come back yet.

848
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,210
He must be thinking.

849
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,980
Anyway, the rule card I had allowed me...

850
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,719
to get rid of a card.

851
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,619
I thought I could use it to score points
while preventing it from maxing out.

852
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,789
I'll submit Number Two...

853
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,159
to Slot C.

854
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,960
Jin Ho,
you submitted Number Two to Slot C.

855
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,829
Go ahead.

856
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,969
- Okay. I'll be back.
- Go, Min A.

857
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:01,739
Min A,
please submit a card to a desired slot.

858
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,139
I wanted to place a 5
if the 1st box was empty.

859
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,510
But I was the third player to go.

860
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,280
I knew that the 1st box in 2 of the slots
would be empty.

861
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,679
I was relieved.

862
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,119
(She chose her first card
without much difficulty.)

863
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,489
Min A,
you submitted Number Five to Slot A.

864
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,829
Number cards for 5 and 6 aren't that high.

865
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:29,230
But I could earn points
in a stable manner.

866
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,469
I wanted to get rid of them first.

867
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,869
I thought I should have some points
in the beginning.

868
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,800
Even if I couldn't make a big lead,

869
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,570
I thought I could aim for a spot
in the top.

870
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:43,610
In Cutline, more points are allocated
in the following order of number cards,

871
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,480
four, three, two, five, six, and one.

872
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,989
High-numbered cards
will be registered first.

873
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,389
Numbers above the limit
will not be registered.

874
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:56,530
Number cards such as 6, 5, and 1
have a higher chance of being registered,

875
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,659
but they yield low scores.

876
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,900
Number cards such as 3 and 4
have a lower chance of being registered,

877
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,199
but they yield high scores.

878
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:05,170
Dong Min played card number 4 in Round 1.

879
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,239
He went with the high-risk
and high-return strategy.

880
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
But Jin Ho played card number two.

881
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,969
He went with the medium-risk
and medium-return strategy.

882
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,380
Min A played card number six.

883
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,510
She went with the low-risk
and low-return strategy.

884
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,579
Go ahead.

885
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,650
Yes. This is going to be fun.

886
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,050
This is fun.

887
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,519
Let's figure out
what the first three players had in mind.

888
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,429
Acau,
please submit a card to a desired slot.

889
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,329
Let me see.

890
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,269
There were only three rounds.

891
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,010
I had to consider some variables
in the later half with the items.

892
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,880
I thought that Round One...

893
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,349
was the round where the other players
would lower their guards the most.

894
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,750
Four...

895
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,849
First, I tried to predict the numbers
the other players would play.

896
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:02,019
Then I went through all the strategies
I could play for Round One.

897
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,829
I wanted to score points.

898
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,230
So I wanted to score the highest.

899
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,860
That was my strategy.

900
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,000
Seven, eleven...

901
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,070
(He picks a card
after careful deliberation.)

902
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,670
I'll submit Number Three to Slot C.

903
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:16,469
Acau.
You submitted Number Three to Slot C.

904
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,269
(Instead of Slot B, he chooses Slot C
that already has another card.)

905
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,710
Xitsuh,

906
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,940
please submit a card...

907
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,949
to a desired slot.

908
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,210
Did he use a rule card?

909
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,849
Why didn't he place it here?

910
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,320
Did he use a rule card?

911
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,250
Slot B was empty,

912
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,090
but Acau submitted a card to Slot C.

913
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,760
"This could be a trap."

914
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,530
"There might be a risk."
I had that thought.

915
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,840
I'll submit Number Five to Slot D.

916
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,440
Xitsuh,

917
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:53,340
you submitted Number Five to Slot D.

918
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,179
I submitted a card to the slot
with the low maximum number and limit,

919
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,949
Slot D.

920
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,550
I decided to make use of that slot.

921
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,289
Eon Kyu, please submit...

922
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:06,519
a card to a desired slot.

923
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:09,860
I had to submit Number Two sooner
or later.

924
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,429
So I decided to use a low number
when things were easy...

925
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,730
and use a high number
when things were tough.

926
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,530
I'll submit it to Slot B.

927
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,800
Joo Eon Kyu, you've submitted...

928
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,699
Number Two to Slot B.

929
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,340
It's my strategy...

930
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,780
to submit Number Two to a slot...

931
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,679
with a high limit
so that I can win points...

932
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,710
even when all numbers are added up.

933
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:33,449
This is incredible.

934
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,719
This is incredible.

935
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,590
What?

936
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,860
They made the game very well
with thorough details.

937
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,730
You have to rack your brain the most
for this game.

938
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,429
It makes you think.

939
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
It makes you think continuously.

940
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,230
He's back.

941
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,000
Next person should go. Seong Beom.

942
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I can't wait.

943
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,940
Didn't the slots wake you up?

944
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,110
I'm fully awake now.

945
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,239
For goodness' sake.

946
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,480
You end up thinking for a long time
down there.

947
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,650
I see why each person gets 30 minutes.

948
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,190
I was submitting one card
when all the slots were empty.

949
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,289
This is fun.

950
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,289
Seong Beom, please submit...

951
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,800
a card to a desired slot.

952
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:22,699
If it's 26...

953
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,000
(He's the 7th one,
so the slots are pretty full.)

954
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,139
I see that the order isn't...

955
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:27,199
very important.

956
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,739
This is fun.

957
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,280
The numbers were adjusted very finely.

958
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,309
There were four slots, A, B, C, and D.

959
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,949
Some slots had high capacity and limits,

960
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,349
while other slots had
low capacity and limits.

961
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:41,980
I found that fun.

962
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,989
If we think about
other players' next moves,

963
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,920
many things can occur.

964
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,559
That thought made my heart beat fast.

965
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,289
Steve will do this after me.

966
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,099
He won't choose the slot I chose.

967
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm the seventh player,

968
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,570
so my turn comes back quickly.

969
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,030
After Steve submits a card,

970
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,570
I can submit a card right away.

971
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,840
When I entered the room,

972
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,570
I saw that two cards were submitted...

973
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,409
to a five-card slot.

974
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,579
So I thought, "I can use three cards."

975
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,809
I can make a combination of my choice...

976
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,980
and increase the limit by three.

977
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,219
Then it'll be possible for me to win...

978
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,250
many points.

979
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,659
I'll submit Number Four to Slot D.

980
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,659
Heo Seong Beom, you've submitted...

981
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,429
Number Four to Slot D.

982
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,400
(Heo Seong Beom
placed Number 4 in Slot D.)

983
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,429
It isn't so easy to make a choice.

984
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:33,239
That's right. I see why we began early.

985
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,039
Submitting one card takes so much time.

986
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,139
If we have to submit two cards
when there are many other cards...

987
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,710
I know. I can't believe
there'll be three rounds.

988
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,820
It's my goal to play aggressively
and take many points in the beginning.

989
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,920
But the maximum card capacity...

990
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,320
and limit are different...

991
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
from what I expected.

992
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,329
I'll submit this card to Slot B.

993
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,329
Steve, you've submitted...

994
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,429
Number Four to Slot B.

995
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,699
Although it was abstract,

996
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,599
I calculated the number...

997
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,440
and did my best
to make an advantageous move.

998
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,369
The 1st cards of Round 1...

999
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:10,369
have been placed.

1000
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:12,269
(Slot status in Turn 1 of Round 1)

1001
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,380
Soon, you'll submit your second cards...

1002
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,480
for Round One.

1003
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,710
That means the 8th player will place
3 cards in succession.

1004
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,750
That's right.

1005
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,079
How nice.

1006
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,949
That was why it seemed nice to go last.

1007
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,119
(The 8th player needs to submit
3 cards in succession.)

1008
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:28,190
Steve, please submit...

1009
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,329
the cards to the desired slots.

1010
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,630
(Thinking)

1011
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,159
(Remaining cards)

1012
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,659
I'll submit them to Slot C.

1013
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,199
You've submitted...

1014
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,099
Numbers 4 and 3 to Slot C.

1015
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,269
I think people will test the waters,

1016
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,409
so I decided to work fast...

1017
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,010
by submitting Numbers 4 and 3.

1018
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,940
Will you use a rule card?

1019
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:50,210
I'll use six coins on Slot C.

1020
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,409
(Turn 2 of Round 1)

1021
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,980
Steve has submitted...

1022
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,980
six coins to Slot C.

1023
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,550
I don't think people will bet
a lot of coins in the beginning,

1024
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,389
so I kept the number moderate.

1025
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,420
If my rule card gets picked,

1026
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
I'll get points for all my cards...

1027
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,760
unless the worst occurs...

1028
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,829
and all other numbers are three.

1029
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,429
I think Jin Ho's 1st card is Number 2.

1030
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:12,329
It's symbolic,

1031
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,099
so he was bound to submit Number Two.
Right?

1032
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,739
I'll submit Number Two...

1033
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,380
(Correct)

1034
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,210
to Slot C.

1035
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,579
I couldn't put my card next to Dong Min's.

1036
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,250
- I had the same thought.
- I couldn't do it.

1037
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,980
- I was going to do it.
- "Why did he put it here?"

1038
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,289
For goodness' sake.

1039
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,750
I felt like
something strange would happen.

1040
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,289
Hey, I was the first one.

1041
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:34,820
I just submitted a card to an empty slot.

1042
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,860
In any case,
I don't want to be in your group.

1043
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
There must be...

1044
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,159
an evil scheme.

1045
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,530
There were no other cards,

1046
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,329
but placing one card took so much time.

1047
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:44,900
I even thought about
the members' characters...

1048
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,940
before submitting a card.

1049
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,940
You have to think about the tendencies.

1050
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,510
I thought about them so much.

1051
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,139
What would Dong Min do?

1052
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,349
What would Xitsuh do?

1053
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,550
He must've submitted Number Five.

1054
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,380
Number Six is a surefire way
to win points.

1055
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,619
Four was a pretty big number,

1056
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,260
so I felt like I could make it work.

1057
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,059
But it seemed nearly impossible
to make Number Two work.

1058
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,860
(Remaining cards)

1059
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,530
Shall I take a risk or keep it safe?

1060
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:19,840
I'll submit these two cards to Slot D.

1061
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:24,110
You've submitted Numbers Two...

1062
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,639
and Two to Slot D.

1063
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,349
I'll use a rule card with nine coins.

1064
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,320
You've submitted nine coins to Slot D.

1065
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,989
If I increase the limit by three,

1066
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,949
I'll be able to win many points.

1067
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:41,360
(Next is Joo Eon Kyu.)

1068
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,260
If I hold on to Numbers 2 and 3,

1069
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,269
they might yield zero points later.

1070
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,500
I think it'll be a good idea...

1071
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,409
to win points in the beginning
when the competition is less fierce.

1072
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,739
Jin Ho and Steve are poker players.

1073
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,639
If they make a reasonable choice,

1074
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,510
they won't get rid
of the cards of high numbers...

1075
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,880
that are easy to submit later on
in Round One.

1076
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,750
So I'll submit my cards to the slots
with the poker players' cards...

1077
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,789
and close them.

1078
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,360
It's my strategy to choose the slots...

1079
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,659
that were chosen by people who make...

1080
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,900
reasonable choices.

1081
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,769
I'll submit these two cards to Slot C.

1082
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:31,769
You've submitted...

1083
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,710
Numbers 2 and 3 to Slot C.

1084
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,780
Will you use a rule card?

1085
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,110
(Turn 2 of Round 1)

1086
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,280
Acau's card was in Slot C.

1087
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,250
Acau is capable
of submitting Number Six...

1088
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,550
and blowing up the whole thing.

1089
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,119
I'll use it.

1090
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:52,360
(Slot status in Turn 2 of Round 1)

1091
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,929
He's back.

1092
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
How is it?

1093
00:44:57,469 --> 00:44:58,469
It's beautiful.

1094
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,500
Did you make it even more beautiful?

1095
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,969
I don't know if my strategy will work.

1096
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,070
No one knows.

1097
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:07,239
- This is fun.
- This is fun.

1098
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,710
Do you think it's fun? I'm in trouble.

1099
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,250
People who are back...

1100
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,719
have a gloomy facial expression.

1101
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,460
I think I'm doomed.

1102
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,190
Being lucky with the rule card
plays a big role.

1103
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,059
What's your rule card?

1104
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,860
Turn all cards into zero.

1105
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,570
Really? I'm doomed.

1106
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,170
I submitted Number Zero,

1107
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,210
so I guess it won't affect me.

1108
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:41,440
- I used that rule card.
- What?

1109
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:42,880
Go back to Day One.

1110
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:44,949
(It'll be a disaster.)

1111
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,219
For goodness' sake.

1112
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:48,449
Don't even joke.

1113
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,449
Seriously.

1114
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,050
What's this?

1115
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,519
Xitsuh, please submit...

1116
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,389
the cards to the desired slots.

1117
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:58,929
Please submit two cards.

1118
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:02,659
Hold on.

1119
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,530
(Rubbing)

1120
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,909
When I entered the room,

1121
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,980
I saw things had turned strange again.

1122
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,280
It was like a pyramid.

1123
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,280
Slot A only had 1 card.
Slot B had 2 cards.

1124
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,250
Slots C and D had many cards.

1125
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:25,849
I was like, "What's going on?"

1126
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,320
(He doesn't understand the placement.)

1127
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,360
(Remaining cards)

1128
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,889
Should I choose Slot A or Slot B?

1129
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:33,199
It's so confusing. I'm tired.

1130
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,469
(Only Slots A and B are empty.)

1131
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:40,269
That must be Number Four in Slot B.

1132
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,110
I think that's four as well.

1133
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,639
That means five remain.

1134
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:53,579
I'll submit 2 Number 4s to Slot A.

1135
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:58,019
You've submitted 2 Number 4s to Slot A.

1136
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,090
I submitted two cards to Slot A...

1137
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,090
to pressure the others...

1138
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,360
into submitting two small numbers,

1139
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,530
not big numbers.

1140
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,730
Xitsuh, will you use a rule card?

1141
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,699
On Slot A,

1142
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:12,269
I'll use...

1143
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:16,440
seven coins.

1144
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,510
Xitsuh, you've submitted seven coins
to Slot A.

1145
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,110
Even if they submit Number Six,

1146
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,079
I can counter it.

1147
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,820
I only pray...

1148
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,280
that seven coins will be enough.

1149
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:32,320
(The fifth player, Acau enters.)

1150
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,019
- This is insane.
- Acau, please submit...

1151
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,190
two cards to the desired slots.

1152
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:37,730
My goodness.

1153
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:39,929
Firstly...

1154
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,769
Pink is Eon Kyu.

1155
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,099
All six places got filled.

1156
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,139
What's this?

1157
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,469
If your card is the 5th or 6th,

1158
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,980
there's a big chance
of it getting dropped.

1159
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,980
But he did that.

1160
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:57,909
In my opinion,
it's a very unexpected move.

1161
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,280
I didn't understand...

1162
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,550
his decision.

1163
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,989
Did he use a rule card to register...

1164
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:06,559
the low-numbered cards first?

1165
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:09,989
I'm paying attention to...

1166
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:11,860
the ones who put their cards
in a successive order.

1167
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:15,559
My guess is that one of them
used a rule card to register...

1168
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,630
the low-numbered cards first.

1169
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,039
I'll submit...

1170
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,599
two cards to Slot A.

1171
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:26,880
Min A, please submit two cards...

1172
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,880
to the desired slots.

1173
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,579
The limit for Slot A is 24.

1174
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,420
Since people don't submit
cards of the same number,

1175
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,960
it can get cut off at a strange place.

1176
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,489
So I thought that there was a chance
of winning points...

1177
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:45,190
with Numbers 1 or 2.

1178
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,960
But Number One doesn't yield many points.

1179
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,969
I don't want to use Number One
in this game...

1180
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,230
if I can help it.

1181
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,070
If I'm lucky,
I'll be able to win points...

1182
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,670
with Number Two.

1183
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,170
(She submits Number 6 to Slot B.)

1184
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,469
I'll submit Number Six to Slot B.

1185
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,309
Including me, three people remained.

1186
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:00,539
But there were only two cards.

1187
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,139
Even if both of them are Number Six...

1188
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,250
If I submit Number 6,
the total will be 18.

1189
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,849
So I thought that it was
the safe route to win points.

1190
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:10,320
Will you use a rule card?

1191
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:11,949
I won't use it.

1192
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,889
Seriously, the cards...

1193
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,789
What are they like?

1194
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:17,929
I want to see them.

1195
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,159
Gosh, everyone is incredible.

1196
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,199
I want to see them.

1197
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:22,829
I was confused...

1198
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:24,429
about the empty slot.

1199
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,599
What? Which slot was empty?

1200
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,199
It's a secret.

1201
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,199
Soon...

1202
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,110
Gosh, I...

1203
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,909
I placed my cards in a stupid way.

1204
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,239
- Already?
- Why?

1205
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,750
- Already?
- It has begun.

1206
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,510
- The game has begun.
- Did you figure out the result?

1207
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,519
- What?
- You know,

1208
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,619
there was someone
I really didn't understand.

1209
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,690
- Who?
- Eon Kyu.

1210
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,389
I suddenly understood...

1211
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:47,460
- that I placed my cards strangely.
- I mean,

1212
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,320
there was an empty slot.

1213
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,190
Did he place his cards someplace else?

1214
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,860
He put them in dangerous places.

1215
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,199
- Why did you do that?
- I was like, "What?"

1216
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,699
We don't know
what kind of a result it'll bring.

1217
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:58,869
I suddenly understood.

1218
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,539
What?

1219
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,409
You didn't place a card
in the slot I chose, did you?

1220
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,769
That was exactly what he did.

1221
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,039
Why did you do that?

1222
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,449
Seriously. Why did you do that?

1223
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,480
You don't understand.
He put both cards in the slot you chose.

1224
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,789
What? Why did you do that?

1225
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,519
I had a hunch about
the numbers you submitted.

1226
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,090
Just the slot I chose?

1227
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,329
Yes. I thought you guys had a deal.

1228
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,530
I was like, "Why did he do this?"

1229
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,300
Hello.

1230
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,869
Gosh, most of the slots are full.

1231
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,670
(Remaining cards)

1232
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,610
I'm second to last.

1233
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,510
The round will end
once Dong Min goes after me.

1234
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:43,280
The round is nearly over.

1235
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,980
It's just a matter of choosing
between Slots A and B.

1236
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,860
Dong Min is next. Dong Min...

1237
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,599
Let's strategize.

1238
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,500
I'll submit these two cards...

1239
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,329
to Slot B.

1240
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:11,139
I'll submit 2 Number 6s to Slot B.

1241
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,039
Even if Dong Min submits...

1242
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,340
Number Six,

1243
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,679
my cards will have priority.

1244
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:18,579
Even if Dong Min has a rule card...

1245
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:20,519
to destroy a card number six,

1246
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,519
there's a big chance
another Number Six is before mine,

1247
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:25,219
That card will be destroyed first.

1248
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,960
If I place 2 Number 6s here,

1249
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,219
I'll be able to win four points
in a safe way.

1250
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:31,659
Will you use a rule card?

1251
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,829
Yes.

1252
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,199
A rule card Steve might use for Slot C...

1253
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,869
Two cards.

1254
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:40,969
My card came first.
Then there were cards by Acau, Steve,

1255
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:41,969
and Eon Kyu.

1256
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,639
"Which rule card..."

1257
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,639
"would benefit them?"

1258
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:46,710
I took a close look,

1259
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,309
but I couldn't think of anything.

1260
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,380
(Turn 2 of Round 1)

1261
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,809
I'll use three coins...

1262
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,079
on Slot C.

1263
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,550
The competition didn't seem fierce,

1264
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,190
so I bet three coins.

1265
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,920
(The last player, Jang Dong Min)

1266
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,519
- What?
- Dong Min,

1267
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,860
please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

1268
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,030
Okay.

1269
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,929
I can't put my cards in this slot, right?

1270
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,699
It's the same for this slot, right?

1271
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,329
This is driving me crazy.

1272
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,639
I was the 16th player, the last one.

1273
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:18,239
Due to the maximum capacity,

1274
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,380
there were only two places I could choose.

1275
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,880
I didn't know what to do.

1276
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,210
Who's pink?

1277
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,250
Eon Kyu.

1278
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:29,219
Eon Kyu.

1279
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:32,090
I agree that he made a stupid choice.

1280
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,690
Who's red?

1281
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:35,719
Seong Beom?

1282
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,329
What was his order?

1283
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
What?

1284
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:46,699
Why did Seong Beom place his cards there
when he went early on?

1285
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:56,309
Seong Beom submitted Numbers 4, 2, and 2.

1286
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,909
He made a risky move.

1287
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,320
(Dong Min correctly predicted
Seong Beom's cards.)

1288
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,889
Seong Beom submitted Numbers 4, 2, and 2.

1289
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,019
Jin Ho.

1290
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,400
There's a chance he submitted
2 Number 6 cards.

1291
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,559
(He correctly predicts Jin Ho's cards.)

1292
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,570
Then 12...

1293
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:19,269
Then it'll go over the limit.

1294
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:21,699
It happened already.

1295
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,440
It went over the limit.

1296
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,539
It went over the limit.

1297
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,610
It went over the limit. I'm so frustrated.

1298
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:33,050
(He guessed people's cards,
but there are no places to put his cards.)

1299
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,480
It's disadvantageous to go last.

1300
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:39,449
I'll submit Number One to Slot B.

1301
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,789
You've submitted Number One to Slot B.

1302
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,960
You've submitted Number Two to Slot B.

1303
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,400
I'll use a rule card that allows me
to register my first card...

1304
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,829
before any player...

1305
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:52,329
(A rule card that allows him to register
his first card before any player)

1306
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,039
on Slot D.

1307
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,340
(He submits a rule card on the slot
Seong Beom submitted his rule card to.)

1308
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,210
(If Dong Min's rule card is applied,
Seong Beom will lose 4 points.)

1309
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,340
(Seong Beom's rule card:
Increase the limit by 3.)

1310
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,250
Round One has ended.

1311
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,849
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1312
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,619
Let's check the cards of Round One.

1313
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:12,619
I will open the rule card applied
to Slot A.

1314
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,159
The rule card...

1315
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:17,889
that changes the 1st Number 6
to Number 1...

1316
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:20,429
used by Xitsuh was applied.

1317
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,599
I will open the cards of Slot A.

1318
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,300
Min A, Number Five.

1319
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,900
Xitsuh, Number Four.

1320
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,469
Xitsuh, Number Four.

1321
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,210
Acau, Number Four.

1322
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:34,739
Acau, Number Four.

1323
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,480
Min A, Number Two.

1324
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,579
Doesn't that mean everyone earns points?

1325
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,980
All cards have been registered.

1326
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,349
(All cards have been registered.)

1327
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:44,719
This is insane.

1328
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:49,019
(Acau submitted 2 Number 4 cards
to Slot A.)

1329
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,960
Judging by the number of cards and such,

1330
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,559
I didn't think...

1331
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,300
that anyone would use 3 Number 6 cards
in Round 1.

1332
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,730
I thought...

1333
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,039
that people would submit
cards of low numbers for their advantage.

1334
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:03,639
I thought 2 Number 4 cards
would get me points,

1335
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,139
so I submitted them.

1336
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,170
What's this?

1337
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,239
I will open the cards of Slot B.

1338
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,780
No bets were made for a rule card
for Slot B.

1339
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,849
Eon Kyu, Number Two.

1340
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,320
Two?

1341
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,480
Steve, Number Four.

1342
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,250
Min A, Number Six.

1343
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
Jin Ho, Number Six.

1344
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,960
Hong Jin Ho, Number Six.

1345
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,860
For goodness' sake.

1346
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,659
Jang Dong Min, Number One.

1347
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,900
Jang Dong Min, Number Two.

1348
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,170
So what happens?

1349
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,800
Steve's Number 4
and Dong Min's Number 2...

1350
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,969
haven't been registered.

1351
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,110
(Steve and Dong Min
each failed to register 1 card.)

1352
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,710
I will open the rule card applied
to Slot C.

1353
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,750
The rule card...

1354
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:46,550
that decreases the limit by three
used by Acau...

1355
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,550
- was applied.
- This is incredible.

1356
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,550
What?

1357
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,489
To Slot C,

1358
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,219
I'll submit ten coins.

1359
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,690
Acau has submitted ten coins to Slot C.

1360
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,099
Jin Ho submitted Number 2,
Acau submitted Number 3,

1361
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,800
Steve submitted Numbers 4 and 3,

1362
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,469
Eon Kyu submitted Numbers 2 and 3.

1363
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,239
Eon Kyu's Number Two wasn't applied.

1364
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,440
(Joo Eon Kyu has failed
to register Number 2.)

1365
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,010
Gosh, Acau won all the points.

1366
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:17,849
I bet ten coins, so I expected
my rule card would be applied.

1367
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:21,849
And I thought my score wouldn't
be deducted with the current cards.

1368
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:25,219
So I applied the rule card to Slot C
to remove the variable.

1369
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:28,460
I will open the rule card
applied to Slot D.

1370
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,900
(Dong Min and Seong Beom's rule cards
clashed in Slot D.)

1371
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,130
(Seong Beom's rule card was applied
by a narrow margin.)

1372
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:42,699
The rule card that increases the limit
by three used by Seong Beom was applied.

1373
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:46,269
Jang Dong Min submitted Number 4,
Xitsuh submitted Number 5,

1374
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,539
Heo Seong Beom submitted Numbers 4, 2,

1375
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,380
and two.

1376
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,550
All his cards were registered.

1377
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,519
(Seong Beom successfully registered
all 3 cards.)

1378
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,989
(Scores in Round 3)

1379
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:58,320
(Acau: 17 points, Xitsuh: 15 points,
Seong Beom: 14 points, Steve: 11 points,)

1380
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,719
(Eon Kyu: 9 points, Min A: 9 points,
Jin Ho: 8 points, Dong Min: 7 points)

1381
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,619
I missed it by one point.

1382
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,960
(4th place: Steve Yea, 11 points)

1383
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,190
This is so annoying.

1384
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,230
How come there were so many Number Sixes?

1385
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,670
If 1 of them was Number 5,
it would've been fine.

1386
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,829
There were 3 Number 6s in Round 1.

1387
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,699
There were 3 Number 6s behind my card.

1388
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,369
I missed the highest score by one point...

1389
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,280
because of the 3 Number 6s.

1390
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,440
I'm doomed.

1391
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,510
Slot B is crazy.

1392
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,750
Min A tried to kill me...

1393
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,079
- No.
- by destroying Number Six.

1394
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:30,949
I was just trying
to be as rational as possible.

1395
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:33,320
I should've submitted Number 3
instead of 4, which was destroyed.

1396
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,659
- It's unbelievable.
- Min A submitted Number Six,

1397
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,059
and Jin Ho submitted 2 Number 6s.

1398
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:39,789
- I missed it by one point.
- They tried to kill him.

1399
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,630
I tried to receive four points
and kill everyone else.

1400
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:47,570
With 2 Number 6s, I received 4 points
without missing any points.

1401
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,570
I think I did a pretty good job.

1402
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,010
If I don't submit Number Six, the others
might submit it at the same time later.

1403
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,539
In the end, that round will be destroyed,

1404
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,449
which makes it impossible
to receive lower points.

1405
00:57:57,579 --> 00:57:59,150
And I might not be able to receive points
even with Number Six.

1406
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,079
I think it wasn't a bad decision...

1407
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:04,119
to submit Number Six early to prevent it.

1408
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,989
You're quite good, Aunt.

1409
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,860
You received points with all three cards.

1410
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,489
I think I did a good job...

1411
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:14,360
by receiving points
with all three cards safely.

1412
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,070
Even though I received all the points,
my total score is quite low.

1413
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,030
How can I safely receive points...

1414
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,610
allocated to Numbers 3 and 4?

1415
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,639
That's what I'm concerned about.

1416
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:27,380
Acau, Seong Beom, and Xitsuh
have high scores.

1417
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
They're the top three.

1418
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,050
I played just as I wanted.

1419
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:34,019
I was 100 percent sure
that I would receive points.

1420
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,050
And it happened just as I expected.

1421
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,849
It seems they're playing it safer
than I thought.

1422
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:41,389
I used seven coins to use the item.

1423
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,489
I think it was too many.

1424
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:46,030
I thought I should've used fewer coins.

1425
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,829
Guys, Acau received 17 points.

1426
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,059
Keep him in check.

1427
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,139
This is the result of Acau contemplating
here for more than an hour.

1428
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,599
If I submit 2 Number 4s in the 1st round,

1429
00:58:56,739 --> 00:59:00,139
I thought I would be really safe
in Rounds 2 and 3.

1430
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,809
In Rounds 2 and 3,

1431
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,679
they should submit Number 6 or Number 5.

1432
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:07,250
So those who submitted Number Four
earlier...

1433
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,679
won't be able to receive points.

1434
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:13,690
(Jang Dong Min fell to the bottom.)

1435
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,590
From now on, you will start bidding
to decide the order in Round Two.

1436
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,400
Each player will enter the Main Hall...

1437
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,530
to specify the amount you wish to bid
and submit it.

1438
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,500
- I'll get going first.
- Yes.

1439
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,039
Round Two will decide the winner.

1440
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,280
The order in Round Two
is the most important.

1441
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:36,679
Do you think the order is important?

1442
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,210
I have no idea...

1443
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,949
- what the person before me...
- The order isn't important at all.

1444
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:41,449
- submitted which card in which slot.
- It's completely random.

1445
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:42,480
Do you think so?

1446
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,619
But Dong Min had to submit a lower number
in the end.

1447
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,190
Seong Beom.
Will you bid to decide the order?

1448
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,829
I thought going first wasn't good.

1449
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,530
I thought going in the middle
would be better.

1450
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,170
Actually, it's not true
that the order isn't important at all.

1451
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,900
(The players are contemplating
about bidding to decide the order.)

1452
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,210
If I don't receive many points
in Round Two, I will struggle.

1453
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,809
The bidding to decide the order
in Round Two is closed.

1454
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,119
Please go downstairs...

1455
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,989
to pick random number cards.

1456
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,389
- Did no one submit it again?
- Please submit one.

1457
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,090
My goodness.

1458
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,289
- Everyone is saving money.
- This is unbelievable.

1459
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:25,360
My gosh.

1460
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:28,699
I think deciding the order
is very important.

1461
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,159
But...

1462
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,670
I thought it was unlikely...

1463
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,469
that I would get a bad position.

1464
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,039
Everyone has similar thoughts.

1465
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,039
I know.

1466
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:41,039
Yes. This really feels
like an individual match. It's nice.

1467
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:43,409
- Seriously.
- Everyone has ridiculous thoughts.

1468
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,179
- Let's draw one.
- Which one will be good?

1469
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,050
Gosh.

1470
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,619
Gosh.

1471
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,949
What's this?

1472
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,860
- Is this right?
- Oh, my gosh.

1473
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,960
Oh, no.

1474
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,190
Darn it.

1475
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,559
Jin Ho got Number Three.

1476
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:01,500
Min A got Number Four.

1477
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,730
Acau got Number Six.

1478
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,730
Steve got Number Seven.

1479
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,869
Seong Beom got Number Eight.

1480
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,969
Eon Kyu got Number One.

1481
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:11,039
Darn it.

1482
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,739
Dong Min got Number Five.

1483
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,210
Xitsuh got Number Two.

1484
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,050
(Round 2 card submission order)

1485
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,610
(1. Joo Eon Kyu, 2. Xitsuh,
3. Hong Jin Ho, 4. Kim Min A)

1486
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,250
(5. Jang Dong Min, 6. Acau, 7. Steve Yea,
8. Heo Seong Beom)

1487
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:22,650
Draw a rule card.

1488
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:28,460
Seong Beom. You drew a rule card that
allows you to decrease the limit by three.

1489
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,260
Steve. You drew a rule card that allows
you to destroy the card submitted first.

1490
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,159
Acau. You drew a rule card that
allows you to increase the limit by three.

1491
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37,199
Dong Min. You drew a rule card
that allows you...

1492
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:38,929
to reduce the maximum number of cards
by one.

1493
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:42,670
Min A. You drew a rule card that
allows you to destroy the 1st Number 6.

1494
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,510
Jin Ho. You drew a rule card that allows
you to register low-numbered cards first.

1495
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:48,909
Xitsuh. You drew a rule card
that allows you...

1496
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:51,579
to register your 1st card 1st.

1497
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,980
Eon Kyu. You drew a rule card
that allows you...

1498
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,150
to change the 1st Number 6 to Number 1.

1499
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:58,590
(Rule cards in Round 2)

1500
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,789
(Change the 1st Number 6 to Number 1,
register his 1st card 1st,)

1501
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,059
(register low-numbered cards 1st,
destroy the 1st Number 6,)

1502
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:02,260
(reduce the maximum number of cards by 1,
increase the limit by 3,)

1503
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,420
(destroy the card submitted 1st,
decrease the limit by 3)

1504
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,489
Let's begin Round Two.

1505
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,960
Eon Kyu.

1506
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,360
You will now submit your 1st card
for Round 2.

1507
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,969
Eon Kyu. Please submit a card...

1508
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:20,610
to a desired slot.

1509
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,849
(The limit and the maximum number of cards
for each slot is reset.)

1510
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:34,090
The 1st player should submit a card
without any information at 1st.

1511
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:39,190
There aren't many things
the first player can do.

1512
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
I'll submit Number Four to Slot D.

1513
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,230
(Joo Eon Kyu submits Number 4 to Slot D.)

1514
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:49,170
Eon Kyu.
You've submitted Number Four to Slot D.

1515
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,469
Will you use a rule card?

1516
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,840
I'll do it later.

1517
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,380
(Joo Eon Kyu didn't submit a rule card.)

1518
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,079
(Xitsuh is the 2nd player in Round 2.)

1519
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:58,980
Xitsuh. Please submit a card...

1520
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,519
to a desired slot.

1521
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,920
Thank you.

1522
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,820
(Remaining cards)

1523
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,460
Eon Kyu's Number Two
was already destroyed.

1524
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,219
So it's either Number Four or...

1525
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:12,090
Let's avoid that slot.

1526
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,670
I think Slot C will be full.
Should I apply it first?

1527
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,900
I'll submit Number Three to Slot C.

1528
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,809
Xitsuh. You've submitted Number Three...

1529
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:27,210
to Slot C.

1530
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,679
I won't use the item.

1531
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,150
Jin Ho.

1532
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:35,519
You will now submit your 1st card
for Round 2.

1533
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:40,590
What?

1534
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:43,760
The limit...

1535
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,230
The limit has decreased even more.

1536
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:53,429
(Remaining cards)

1537
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,400
The average limit has been decreased.

1538
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,610
Before then, the average limit...

1539
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:01,340
was three, proportional
to the maximum number of cards.

1540
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,280
Now, it's less than three.

1541
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,210
The limit has been decreased.
So it was a variable.

1542
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,949
Anyway, I thought it'd be better...

1543
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:12,019
to submit 3 cards to 1 slot.

1544
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:15,260
I will submit it to Slot A.

1545
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:18,530
I submitted my card to Slot A...

1546
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:20,730
that had the highest
maximum number of cards.

1547
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,559
Considering Round One,
there were many cards on the bottom.

1548
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:25,769
The top slot wasn't full.

1549
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:26,900
Considering that,

1550
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,869
it was likely that the top slot would not
be full, so I submitted my card to it.

1551
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,469
Jin Ho. Will you use a rule card?

1552
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,710
(Register low-numbered cards first)

1553
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,980
I'm not going to use it yet.

1554
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,360
Min A.
Please submit a card to a desired slot.

1555
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,829
Five.

1556
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,769
In Round One,
Slot D had the lowest number.

1557
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:01,300
So I thought I would receive points safely
if I submit my card to Slot D.

1558
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,070
Because it's not easy to submit
a high-numbered card to it.

1559
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,139
Then I saw the limit was 12.

1560
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:08,579
(Limit: 12, Maximum number of cards: 5)

1561
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:11,050
It's 12.

1562
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,050
I thought some crazy guy
might submit Number Sixes.

1563
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:19,219
I'll submit it to Slot C.

1564
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,789
Min A. You've submitted Number Four
to Slot C.

1565
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,789
I didn't choose Slot B...

1566
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,960
because the card
that was submitted to the slot first...

1567
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,670
would be destroyed.
I avoided it just in case.

1568
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:37,469
(Angry Dong Min is the 5th player
in Round 2.)

1569
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:38,469
- Darn it.
- Dong Min.

1570
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:41,239
Please submit a card to a desired slot.

1571
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:42,239
I got it.

1572
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,880
If I don't win Round Two,

1573
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,519
I have no hope.

1574
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,550
I need to climb up the rank
in Rounds 2 and 3.

1575
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:55,260
Which one submitted the pink card?
It's Eon Kyu.

1576
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,760
Gosh, I shouldn't choose the same slot
as him.

1577
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,230
(Suddenly, memories of Lucifer
come to mind.)

1578
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,760
I shouldn't choose the same slot as him.

1579
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,369
Jin Ho submitted the blue card.

1580
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,900
It's 5. I'm sure it's 5.

1581
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:13,739
Jin Ho submitted Number 4 or Number 5.

1582
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:15,809
It means he wants to remove Number Six.

1583
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,650
Okay.

1584
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,820
Let me receive his help.

1585
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:27,320
I will submit...

1586
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,929
Number Five to Slot A.

1587
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:35,559
Dong Min. You've submitted
Number Five to Slot A.

1588
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:38,099
Dong Min. Will you use a rule card?

1589
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,130
No.

1590
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,670
(Jang Dong Min didn't use a rule card.)

1591
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,500
(Reduce the maximum number of cards by 1)

1592
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:47,610
Acau.
Please submit a card to a desired slot.

1593
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:49,739
Well...

1594
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,219
The limit of Slot D is 12.

1595
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:58,320
Eon Kyu submitted a card to it.

1596
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,349
Whatever the card is,

1597
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,019
if I submit Number Five,

1598
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:05,360
I'll be able to receive five points
safely,

1599
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,460
unless they use the rule card that allows
them to register low-numbered cards first.

1600
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:13,670
I will submit Number Five to Slot D.

1601
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,170
(Acau submits Number 5 to Slot D.)

1602
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:18,969
Acau.
You've submitted Number Five to Slot D.

1603
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:21,780
Acau. Will you use a rule card?

1604
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,309
I will not use it.

1605
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:25,179
(Acau didn't use a rule card.)

1606
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:28,920
(Increase the limit by 3)

1607
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,219
(Remaining cards)

1608
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:34,489
Steve.
Please submit a card to a desired slot.

1609
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:37,889
(Slot B is the only slot without a card.)

1610
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:42,000
Steve. You've submitted Number Three.

1611
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,329
Will you use a rule card?

1612
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,670
No. I'm going to use it on my next turn.

1613
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,699
(Destroy the card submitted first)

1614
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:51,070
This is hard.

1615
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,840
One slot was completely empty.

1616
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,239
- Was it?
- Yes.

1617
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,409
Darn it.
Everyone kept one another in check.

1618
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:09,190
(The mind game has become more intense
as they don't communicate anymore.)

1619
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,429
What kind of situation is this?

1620
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:17,970
Seong Beom.
Please submit a card to a desired slot.

1621
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,270
I'm going to choose Slot C.

1622
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:25,439
(Steve Yea chose Slot C.)

1623
01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:28,880
Many people chose Slot C.

1624
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
It seemed they wanted to use
low-numbered cards.

1625
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:33,180
I will submit Number Four to Slot C.

1626
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:38,050
Seong Beom.
You've submitted Number Four to Slot C.

1627
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:39,789
Four is a number that is big enough...

1628
01:08:39,789 --> 01:08:42,060
for me to win against other numbers
and receive points first.

1629
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,119
That's why I submitted Number Four.

1630
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,890
Will you use a rule card?

1631
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,130
I'm not going to use it.

1632
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,159
The 1st cards of Round 2 have been placed.

1633
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:53,800
Soon, you'll submit
your 2nd cards for Round 2.

1634
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,739
(They start submitting their 2nd cards
for Round 2.)

1635
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,340
(Remaining cards)

1636
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,369
(Seong Beom is the first player
to submit 2nd cards.)

1637
01:08:58,369 --> 01:09:02,640
Seong Beom. Please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

1638
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:09,850
Both Jin Ho and Dong Min
submitted their cards to Slot A.

1639
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,489
I thought they wanted
to use low-numbered cards quickly.

1640
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:15,260
I submitted two cards to the same slot
to take advantage of their psychology.

1641
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,989
(Seong Beom submitted two cards
to Slot A.)

1642
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,859
Is there an empty slot left?

1643
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,199
I left it empty.

1644
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:30,470
The first player should submit a card
without any information.

1645
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,840
In the end, they should submit a card
without any choice at the end.

1646
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,739
It's extremely unfavorable
to the first player.

1647
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,880
(The second player is Steve Yea.)

1648
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:44,449
Steve. Please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

1649
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:48,390
(Remaining cards)

1650
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,819
I'll submit a card to Slot C.

1651
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,489
(Steve Yea has submitted Number 2
to Slot C.)

1652
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,659
I'll submit a card to Slot B.

1653
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,060
Steve. Will you use a rule card?

1654
01:09:57,899 --> 01:09:59,630
I'll use four coins in Slot C.

1655
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,399
(Destroy the card submitted first)

1656
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:03,470
If Acau's card was submitted first,

1657
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:07,010
I was going to use the rule card
to decrease his points.

1658
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:11,010
But Xitsuh was the only one whose card
was the first one in the slot before me.

1659
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,949
So I didn't use many coins.

1660
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:15,949
- Yes.
- Acau.

1661
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:19,449
Please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

1662
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:22,659
(Remaining cards)

1663
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:23,819
Seong Beom...

1664
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,729
When I looked at Slot D,

1665
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:29,460
I thought it would be hard for the others
to receive points here.

1666
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,829
So I thought they wouldn't submit a card
to Slot D.

1667
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:36,069
It means they should submit a card
to Slot A.

1668
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:39,039
I'll submit Number Six.

1669
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,449
Acau.
You've submitted Number Six to Slot A.

1670
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:49,880
Actually, in Round Two,

1671
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,819
I didn't play to take first place.

1672
01:10:51,989 --> 01:10:53,819
I played to attack Seong Beom.

1673
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,630
He's been implying
that he's been keeping me in check.

1674
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:01,199
(Acau started having conflicts
with Seong Beom after Try 13.)

1675
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,699
I'm sorry, but I bought it.

1676
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,529
I don't lie in MJ's name.

1677
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,770
- I really bought it. We got the same one.
- Okay.

1678
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,739
But why did you tell me a lie like that?

1679
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:13,510
He also lied to me.

1680
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:16,109
So I didn't really like him.

1681
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:20,550
I'll use ten coins in Slot A.

1682
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,020
(Increase the limit by 3)

1683
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,489
Considering the cards that were submitted,

1684
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,720
I thought someone might have a rule card
that allows them...

1685
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,520
to register low-numbered cards first.

1686
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,960
I used an item...

1687
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:32,529
to neutralize the card.

1688
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,430
I'll submit Number Five to Slot B.

1689
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,770
I hope the card in Slot A is destroyed.

1690
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,800
I want to keep Seong Beom in check.

1691
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,310
(The fourth player is Jang Dong Min.)

1692
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,380
All right.

1693
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:50,109
- I'll submit the cards.
- Dong Min. Please submit two cards...

1694
01:11:50,109 --> 01:11:52,050
- to the desired slots.
- Yes.

1695
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,850
Okay. I got it.

1696
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:57,689
I was in last place in Round One.
It doesn't mean it's over yet.

1697
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,819
So I had to do my best in Round Two.

1698
01:12:00,289 --> 01:12:01,520
It's full with five cards.

1699
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:05,890
(He can't submit a card to Slot C.)

1700
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:09,630
I'm in trouble.

1701
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,800
(Remaining cards)

1702
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:13,069
I was contemplating.

1703
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,140
I had to receive even one more point.

1704
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,539
"It's full
as it reached the maximum number."

1705
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,279
"Then I should play it safe like this."

1706
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:25,380
I became a timid player.

1707
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:30,050
If I submit Numbers 4 and 3...

1708
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:32,920
If I submit Numbers 4 and 3...

1709
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,619
This is driving me crazy.

1710
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,859
I...

1711
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:46,329
will submit...

1712
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:50,199
Numbers 4 and 3 to Slot A.

1713
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:55,439
Dong Min.
You've submitted Number Three to Slot A.

1714
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:59,979
I thought Seong Beomg would use
the rule card that allows him...

1715
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:01,920
to register low-numbered cards first.
So I submitted my cards there.

1716
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:03,649
I submitted Numbers 3 and 4...

1717
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:06,789
to receive points
when he doesn't use the rule card...

1718
01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:09,020
and people with higher numbers
get points first.

1719
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,260
Min A. Please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

1720
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,100
(Remaining cards)

1721
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,529
I was going to submit
Number 4 and Number 3...

1722
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:21,399
to Slot D or Slot C.

1723
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,840
But Acau submitted his card there
when the limit was too low.

1724
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,979
I thought he might submit Number Six
to keep others in check.

1725
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:29,939
So I thought...

1726
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,180
I shouldn't submit my cards there.

1727
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,619
(Min A submits two cards.)

1728
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,319
I will submit them to Slot B.

1729
01:13:39,789 --> 01:13:42,520
I think
it was the best choice I could make.

1730
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,090
(Slot status in Turn 2 of Round 2)

1731
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:51,270
(Slot A's limit: 22, Slot B's limit: 19,
Slot C's limit: 14, Slot D's limit: 12)

1732
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:52,800
Hello.

1733
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,170
(Hong Jin Ho is the sixth player.)

1734
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:58,710
Jin Ho. Please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

1735
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,640
Slot A is full.

1736
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:05,210
When I went in, I found...

1737
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,979
the card arrangement was worse
than I thought, which got me flustered.

1738
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,189
The best scenario was for me
to submit all the cards to one slot.

1739
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,319
But Slot A was almost full.

1740
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,659
It's meaningless
if I can't submit 2 cards to 1 slot.

1741
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,869
Will it work with one card?

1742
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,670
The purple one.

1743
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,909
The yellow one. Whose card is that?

1744
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:35,039
Only one spot was left in Slot A.

1745
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:36,680
I had to go into Slot B,

1746
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,310
but the member happened to be...

1747
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:39,810
Steve and Acau.

1748
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,819
And Min A had two cards.

1749
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,949
Min A's cards were kind of awkward...

1750
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,050
because the others mostly had 2 Number 6s,

1751
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:48,260
but Min A only had 1 Number 6.

1752
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,319
I thought this could be a chance...

1753
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,560
to use up our middle cards.

1754
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:58,430
(The card Min A submitted)

1755
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:00,229
I'll submit Number 4 and 3 to Slot B.

1756
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,770
(Kim Min A placed the middle cards
as Hong Jin Ho predicted.)

1757
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:06,569
(Slot B, Numbers 4 and 3)

1758
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,140
Gosh, if Min A goes here,
it could be risky.

1759
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:14,949
I kept wondering if there was another way.

1760
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,090
But in the end, this was the only time...

1761
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,390
where I could play...

1762
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,550
my winning hand.

1763
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,630
I'll submit this to Slot B.

1764
01:15:28,329 --> 01:15:32,029
(Who will win Round 2?)

1765
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:34,170
(The seventh player is Xitsuh.)

1766
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:35,239
What is this?

1767
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,039
(The only place where he can submit
more than two cards is Slot D.)

1768
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,510
Darn it. I think I have to use an item.

1769
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:47,010
Actually, this time,

1770
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:50,119
I saw the number of spots and thought
about submitting low numbers...

1771
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:52,020
to score extra points.

1772
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,520
Slot D was pretty empty,

1773
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,260
but the limit was too small.

1774
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:59,060
If I submitted a small number there,

1775
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:01,800
my cards might end up being destroyed.

1776
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,329
(Remaining cards)

1777
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:05,500
Gosh, the spot...

1778
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,069
The spot is terrible.

1779
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,100
The ones I had left were
the smaller numbers...

1780
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,470
and the very big numbers.
I was thinking about it.

1781
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,939
Joo Eon Kyu.

1782
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:18,750
You'll now submit your 2nd card
for Round 2.

1783
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,750
Finally.

1784
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,989
Eon Kyu is going last.

1785
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:28,760
That makes me more nervous.

1786
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,060
Why? In case he does something weird?

1787
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:33,789
My gosh.

1788
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,960
Eon Kyu.

1789
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,359
(Spitting out water)

1790
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,369
Darn it.

1791
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,399
Stop calling Eon Kyu's name.

1792
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,810
Eon Kyu.

1793
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:51,579
(The last player is Joo Eon Kyu.)

1794
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:54,850
Darn it.

1795
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,390
(Frowning)

1796
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,989
(The only spots left are in Slot D.)

1797
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,300
(Remaining cards)

1798
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:13,470
My gosh.

1799
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,210
There was nothing I could submit.

1800
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,949
This shouldn't take so long.

1801
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:33,220
He has no choice.

1802
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,789
I doubt there's anywhere to put it.

1803
01:17:34,789 --> 01:17:37,260
He just has to submit two at the back.

1804
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:39,460
I made it easy for him.

1805
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,760
I was thinking about it a lot.

1806
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,770
(Change the 1st Number 6 to Number 1)

1807
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,369
I submitted Number 4
for the very 1st card.

1808
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:50,869
And there was another card behind it.

1809
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:52,510
That was Acau's card.

1810
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:56,380
If I were to submit low-numbered 2 or 3,

1811
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,640
it wouldn't be a problem for me.

1812
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,479
But the five is the most risky.

1813
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:02,680
I can use an item
to get rid of Number six.

1814
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,989
I'll submit Numbers 3 and 1 to Slot D.

1815
01:18:13,829 --> 01:18:15,399
When I thought about it
in the most conservative way,

1816
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,699
I think it's a five.

1817
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:19,369
If it's a five,
the number I would have to give up...

1818
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,800
is the one at the very end.

1819
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,069
Since that's only one point,

1820
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,710
it's a better choice for me...

1821
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,939
to give up the one card
over the other cards.

1822
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:32,680
That was how I chose Numbers 3 and 1.

1823
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,979
Eon Kyu, will you use a rule card?

1824
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,449
I'll use eight coins on Slot D.

1825
01:18:38,449 --> 01:18:39,590
(Joo Eon Kyu bets 8 coins on Slot D.)

1826
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,760
Eon Kyu, you have placed eight coins...

1827
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,159
in Slot D.

1828
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:46,859
The Number 6 that was submitted 1st
will be changed to Number 1.

1829
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:48,199
You have used the rule card.

1830
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:50,760
Round Two is over.

1831
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,369
Please gather at the Main Hall.

1832
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,500
Hello.

1833
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,539
All of the items were used.

1834
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,869
All of the items were used.

1835
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:02,840
All of the rule cards were used.

1836
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,810
I will check the cards for Round Two.

1837
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,720
The rule card applied to Slot A...

1838
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:12,449
was Acau's card
that increases the limit by three.

1839
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:15,119
I will open the number cards.

1840
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,720
I will submit Numbers 6 and 4.

1841
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:19,890
I went after Seong Beom.

1842
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,329
He had been constantly...

1843
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:24,699
saying aggressive things
that were directed at me.

1844
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:27,869
Jin Ho, four.

1845
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:31,270
Dong Min, five.

1846
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:33,810
Seong Beom, three.

1847
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,640
Seong Beom, three.

1848
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,510
Acau, six.

1849
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,520
Dong Min, four.

1850
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:45,090
Dong Min, three.

1851
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:48,220
Xitsuh, six.

1852
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,560
(Increase the limit by three)

1853
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,760
(Acau successfully attacked Seong Beom
with Number 6.)

1854
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,260
Oh, that was the cutline.

1855
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,270
I will open the rule card
applied to Slot B.

1856
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:03,199
(The rule card applied to Slot B)

1857
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:06,069
It's to register low-numbered cards first.

1858
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:08,409
Thank you.

1859
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:11,039
I should just give it to you.

1860
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,380
- Thank you.
- Gosh, darn it.

1861
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:14,649
I will submit Numbers 3 and 4...

1862
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:16,850
to Slot B.

1863
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,489
I'll bet 11 coins on Slot B.

1864
01:20:20,289 --> 01:20:21,689
I will open the number cards.

1865
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:23,020
I should've gone to Slot B.

1866
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,529
Steve, five.

1867
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:28,130
Acau, five.

1868
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:30,630
Min A, four.

1869
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,800
Min A, three.

1870
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,039
Jin Ho, four.

1871
01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:36,500
Jin Ho, three.

1872
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:38,869
Xitsuh, five.

1873
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,970
The rule card has been applied,

1874
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,340
so the low-numbered cards
will be registered first.

1875
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,310
(Acau and Xitsuh fail to gain points.)

1876
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:46,710
Min A, that's great for you.

1877
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:49,479
In Round One, this didn't get applied,

1878
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:50,979
so people didn't get a good taste of this.

1879
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,590
But when it was applied in Round Two,
it made me feel dizzy.

1880
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,920
When she flipped over the item for Slot B,

1881
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,430
I felt so thrilled.
I earned a lot of points.

1882
01:20:58,659 --> 01:21:01,560
I will open the rule card
applied to Slot C.

1883
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:05,229
Steve, will you use a rule card?

1884
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,500
I will bet four coins on Slot C.

1885
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,600
(Destroy the card submitted first)

1886
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,199
(If the rule is applied,)

1887
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,270
(both the Numbers 3 and 2
will be registered.)

1888
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:16,739
For Slot C, it is Xitsuh's rule card.

1889
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,750
It's the card that registers...

1890
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,350
the item card user's 1st card 1st.

1891
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:28,420
I will use an item.

1892
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:29,520
On Slot C,

1893
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,989
I will bet seven coins.

1894
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:35,460
No, I'll bet eight coins.

1895
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:38,930
I should take the three for certain.

1896
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,229
That's what I thought.

1897
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,100
I wasn't sure
if eight coins would be enough,

1898
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,100
but I just went ahead with it.

1899
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,770
I will open the number cards.

1900
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,970
Xitsuh, three.

1901
01:21:47,539 --> 01:21:49,210
Min A, four.

1902
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:51,409
Steve, three.

1903
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:52,979
Seong Beom, four.

1904
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,220
Steve, two.

1905
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,250
I will tell you
which cards were registered.

1906
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,520
(Steve's Number 2 wasn't registered.)

1907
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:01,989
I was ruined.

1908
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:04,090
I still have a chance.

1909
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:05,789
If I can overturn the game,

1910
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,630
I could buy a lottery ticket.

1911
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,500
Lastly, I will open the cards of Slot D.

1912
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,800
The rule card applied to Slot D is...

1913
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:17,899
to change the 1st Number 6 to Number 1.

1914
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,039
I will open the number cards.

1915
01:22:20,739 --> 01:22:22,210
Eon Kyu, four.

1916
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:23,979
Acau, five.

1917
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:25,750
Eon Kyu, three.

1918
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,979
Eon Kyu, one.

1919
01:22:29,149 --> 01:22:30,819
I will tell you
which cards were registered.

1920
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:31,819
(Change the 1st Number 6 to Number 1)

1921
01:22:31,819 --> 01:22:33,720
(Eon Kyu's Number 1 wasn't registered.)

1922
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,720
(Scores in Round 2)

1923
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,659
(Min A: 26, Jin Ho: 25,
Acau: 22, Xitsuh: 22,)

1924
01:22:37,659 --> 01:22:39,659
(Seong Beom: 20, Eon Kyu: 20,
Steve: 19, Dong Min: 16)

1925
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:42,300
From now on, you will start bidding
to decide the order...

1926
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,800
in Round Three.

1927
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,329
Each player will enter the Main Hall...

1928
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,369
to specify the amount you wish to bid
and submit it.

1929
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,640
- Then I'll go first.
- Okay.

1930
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,609
I will not submit my bid.

1931
01:22:56,779 --> 01:22:58,350
Draw a rule card.

1932
01:22:58,979 --> 01:22:59,979
Please.

1933
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:02,520
Gosh, seriously...

1934
01:23:04,989 --> 01:23:06,350
Xitsuh, you've chosen...

1935
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:08,960
the rule card that
destroys the 1st Number 6.

1936
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:12,960
(7th place: Steve Yea, 19 points)

1937
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,130
What is this?

1938
01:23:15,229 --> 01:23:17,399
Seong Beom and I have similar strategies.

1939
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:18,729
I think we have the same score.

1940
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:20,630
(Tied for 5th place:
Joo Eon Kyu, 20 points)

1941
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:21,770
Do we have a similar score?

1942
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,170
We both have 20 points.

1943
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,510
Will you bid to decide the order?

1944
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,640
I will not.

1945
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,909
I will not submit my bid.

1946
01:23:28,909 --> 01:23:30,510
Draw a rule card.

1947
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:36,979
Min A, you've chosen...

1948
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:39,289
the rule card that
changes the 1st Number 6 to Number 1.

1949
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,020
Eon Kyu, you've chosen the rule card...

1950
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,489
that reduces
the maximum number of cards by one.

1951
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:46,859
Acau, you've chosen the rule card that
destroys the card submitted first.

1952
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:49,930
Since I don't have coins, I can't use it.

1953
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,260
But even if I submit first,

1954
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,569
my card will be safe.

1955
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:54,630
So I think it's a good one.

1956
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,140
I should prepare for the next game.

1957
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,310
Now, the only thing I can do is pray.

1958
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:01,470
Even praying won't work for this.

1959
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:02,979
This is doomed.

1960
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:06,079
Will you bid to decide the order?

1961
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,380
No.

1962
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:10,649
Seong Beom,
you've made a bid of three coins.

1963
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:15,420
I will bid all six remaining coins.

1964
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,590
Acau, Xitsuh, Min A, or me.

1965
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,659
There's a good chance that 2 of the 4
will come in 1st and 2nd place.

1966
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:21,189
In my case,
the only numbers I have left...

1967
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,630
are 1, 2, 3, and 5.

1968
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,800
But the 3 others I have to keep in check
each has Number 6.

1969
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,699
So, I thought I would make a bid
to decide the order...

1970
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:27,970
and pick the order as I want to.

1971
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:30,039
(Rule cards in Round 3)

1972
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:31,439
(Destroy the Number 6 rule card,
Decrease the limit by 3)

1973
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:33,039
(Reduce the maximum number of cards by 1,
Increase the limit by 3)

1974
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:34,239
(Change the 1st Number 6 to Number 1,
Register your 1st card 1st)

1975
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:37,510
The bidding to decide the order
for Round Three is closed.

1976
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,579
The one who gets to decide the order
for Round Three is...

1977
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,779
Jang Dong Min.

1978
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,319
(Going all-in with 13 coins)

1979
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:50,760
I went all-in with 13 coins...

1980
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,890
to build a platform
where I can overturn the game.

1981
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,460
Gosh, I didn't expect that.

1982
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,199
Dong Min has a lot of money.

1983
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,529
He wasn't spending any money until then,
but he suddenly spent it all.

1984
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,439
It would be incredible
if he goes to the finals with this.

1985
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:04,569
I know.

1986
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:06,909
Is the sacrifice going to the finals
first?

1987
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:09,909
- Darn it. That makes no sense.
- I mean...

1988
01:25:10,109 --> 01:25:11,279
Didn't you help out?

1989
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:13,109
Didn't you want to play against her
in the finals?

1990
01:25:13,649 --> 01:25:15,350
She ruined me by submitting Number Six.

1991
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,350
Darn those 3 Number 6s.

1992
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,750
Are you laughing?

1993
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,050
If it hadn't been for the 3 Number 6s,

1994
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:21,350
I'd be in the highest ranks.

1995
01:25:21,619 --> 01:25:24,189
I submitted mine beforehand.
Jin Ho just submitted them later.

1996
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:26,260
Didn't Jin Ho submit 2 Number 6s?

1997
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,260
Because of those two cards,
I couldn't win points...

1998
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,260
with a one point difference.

1999
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,560
It's Jin Ho's fault.

2000
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,569
That guy is no help.

2001
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,699
Dong Min will give me a good spot
since my score is low.

2002
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,140
Me too.

2003
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,180
Now, the number of cases
has been reduced by a lot.

2004
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:43,880
I'll have to rely on luck too.

2005
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:45,409
But this is so funny.

2006
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:48,720
So many people have either 1s or 6s.

2007
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,720
This is the bomb round.

2008
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,189
It's war.

2009
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,260
Dong Min, please decide the order...

2010
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,800
to submit cards.

2011
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,270
(Sighing)

2012
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,069
Darn it.

2013
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:16,609
Darn it. I'm doomed.

2014
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:19,880
Darn it. Why did I do that?

2015
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,050
Darn it. I'm doomed!

2016
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,649
I must've been totally crazy.

2017
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:27,149
Why did I go crazy and act like a fool?

2018
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:28,149
Darn it.

2019
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,560
I made the wrong predictions in Round One.

2020
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,689
Gosh, those fools.

2021
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:34,529
Trying to think like fools...

2022
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:36,329
with a genius brain like mine...

2023
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:37,729
I should've just thought like a fool too.

2024
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:40,369
Gosh, okay.

2025
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,739
You guys should get a chance to win too.

2026
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:46,239
Let's think of this
as handing out freebies.

2027
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,840
Who should I put in first place?

2028
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:52,579
Let's see.

2029
01:26:55,979 --> 01:26:56,979
All right.

2030
01:26:57,649 --> 01:26:58,649
This is a skill too.

2031
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:01,789
You guys should compete
against each other.

2032
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,460
This is a gift.

2033
01:27:04,289 --> 01:27:05,430
My last gift.

2034
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,329
From now on,
there's no such thing as mercy. Darn it.

2035
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:13,529
I made it fair and square.
No personal feelings went into it.

2036
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:14,569
Sounds good.

2037
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,039
We'll be waiting.

2038
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:20,369
I will announce the card submission order
for Round Three.

2039
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,939
Number one, Joo Eon Kyu.

2040
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:24,939
Number two, Xitsuh.

2041
01:27:25,649 --> 01:27:26,880
Number three, Acau.

2042
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,880
Number four, Hong Jin Ho.

2043
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,449
Number five, Kim Min A.

2044
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,090
Number six, Jang Dong Min.

2045
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,989
Number seven, Steve Yea.

2046
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,689
Number eight, Heo Seong Beom.

2047
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,090
(Round 3 Card Submission Order)

2048
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:40,390
(Joo Eon Kyu, Xitsuh, Acau, Hong Jin Ho,)

2049
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,899
(Kim Min A, Jang Dong Min,
Steve Yea, Heo Seong Beom)

2050
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,670
I tried to play...

2051
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:49,140
the game fairly today,

2052
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,699
which is why this mess happened.

2053
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:53,970
(He can't control his anger.)

2054
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:57,739
I wanted to give the others
a chance to compete until the end,

2055
01:27:58,409 --> 01:27:59,409
so I did it this way.

2056
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:03,380
You will now place your cards
for Round Three.

2057
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:08,119
(The 1st player to go in Round 3 is
Joo Eon Kyu.)

2058
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:10,760
Joo Eon Kyu,

2059
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,560
please submit a card to a desired slot.

2060
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,029
It was my turn first,

2061
01:28:16,029 --> 01:28:18,029
and I think it's a good thing.

2062
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:21,100
(Remaining cards)

2063
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,300
I still had the Numbers 4 and 5.

2064
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,569
And the limit was nine.

2065
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Please place Number Four...

2066
01:28:32,909 --> 01:28:33,909
in Slot D.

2067
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:37,380
Since the others have low-numbered cards,

2068
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,649
if they think I have a high-numbered card,

2069
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,920
for example, Number Six,

2070
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,430
it could be good for them to add
a low-numbered card behind mine.

2071
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,729
Because I still have Number Six too.

2072
01:28:47,729 --> 01:28:49,029
(They have no choice but to place
low-numbered cards behind his.)

2073
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,359
So, I placed Number Four there,

2074
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,729
and the low-numbered cards
will be coming in to clean up.

2075
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:57,100
Then, I'd place Number Five behind them.

2076
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:59,369
That would make me win
both Numbers 4 and 5.

2077
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,340
That's the strategy I went with.

2078
01:29:01,939 --> 01:29:03,279
Gosh, what is this?

2079
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:04,939
Gosh, what's this?

2080
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,350
This is too aggressive.

2081
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:10,850
If you looked at the other slots,
it was a total mess.

2082
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,250
There are lots of cards you can register,

2083
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,590
but does this limit even make sense?

2084
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,390
I have to register three low numbers.

2085
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,229
So, I didn't want to place my card...

2086
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:22,229
where a single six
could blow the whole slot.

2087
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:23,229
(Xitsuh was taken aback
by the lower limits than he expected.)

2088
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:26,300
I will submit Number Three to Slot A.

2089
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,539
(Xitsuh placed a card in Slot A
which has the highest limit.)

2090
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,810
Will you use a rule card?

2091
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:34,069
No.

2092
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:36,880
I think I'll use it
when my second turn comes around.

2093
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:40,010
I'll see where I can use my two cards.

2094
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:44,819
(Acau comes in third.)

2095
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:50,220
Acau,
please submit a card to a desired slot.

2096
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:55,600
First, people have lots of...

2097
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,899
Numbers 5 and 6 left.

2098
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,930
So, if there isn't a good item
in that slot,

2099
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,640
I wanted to place numbers...

2100
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,640
where I could definitely win.

2101
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,880
I will submit Number Two to Slot B.

2102
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:11,880
Acau, you have submitted...

2103
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,750
Number Two to Slot B.

2104
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,010
(Acau placed a card in an empty slot.)

2105
01:30:15,819 --> 01:30:18,149
In case of a limit of 20,
even with 3 Number 6s,

2106
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:19,489
I could win with Number Two.

2107
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,449
That was what I was going for.

2108
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,989
Oh, the limits have changed.

2109
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:29,029
Unlike the 1st 2 rounds,

2110
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,100
The limits
and the maximum number of cards...

2111
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:34,399
weren't even.

2112
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:35,399
(The slots have very different limits
in Round 3.)

2113
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:36,600
It's kind of a complicated situation.

2114
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:39,739
First, Xitsuh placed a card in Slot A.

2115
01:30:39,909 --> 01:30:42,810
Acau placed a card in Slot B,
and Eon Kyu placed a card in Slot D.

2116
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:46,979
Actually, I don't have to mind Eon Kyu
at this point.

2117
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:49,250
Acau, Xitsuh, Min A, or me.

2118
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,779
It's most likely that 1 of us 4
will come in 1st or 2nd place.

2119
01:30:52,949 --> 01:30:55,420
I will place Number Three in Slot A.

2120
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:57,520
Slot A, where Xitsuh placed his card.

2121
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,189
Since the average is greater than three,

2122
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:00,390
I placed Number Three there.

2123
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,399
I was contemplating
between Numbers 5 and 3.

2124
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,229
And in order to gain some points,

2125
01:31:04,729 --> 01:31:05,869
Number Five is actually better.

2126
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,500
But I placed Number Three...

2127
01:31:07,899 --> 01:31:10,470
because other people will try to win...

2128
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:13,270
and place cards below five.

2129
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,270
Like 2 or 3.

2130
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:15,579
And if I place a five to blow it up?

2131
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,880
Then...

2132
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,409
I should just die.

2133
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:23,850
Min A,
you've submitted Number Five to Slot A.

2134
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:26,390
Xitsuh and Jin Ho were in front of me,

2135
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,520
but I still placed my card with them...

2136
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,090
because the people who should be
kept in check the most...

2137
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:32,489
were both there.

2138
01:31:32,489 --> 01:31:34,430
So, I figured a lot of people would place
Number Sixes here the most.

2139
01:31:35,029 --> 01:31:36,430
No matter how much it gets filled up,

2140
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,170
I think it will be about 3 Number 6s.

2141
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,000
If I placed Number Five, I thought
I could have a good chance of winning.

2142
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:47,409
Darn it.

2143
01:31:47,409 --> 01:31:48,409
(Annoyed)

2144
01:31:48,409 --> 01:31:50,239
Why did I make this mess? Darn it!

2145
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:56,149
My gosh.

2146
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:01,550
(Trying to turn back time)

2147
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,930
Oh, I'm Dr. Strange.

2148
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:08,829
I'm turning back time right now.

2149
01:32:08,829 --> 01:32:09,829
Why isn't it going back?

2150
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:12,729
Why isn't the time turning back? Darn it.

2151
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:16,569
I could mark everything with a six,

2152
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:19,069
but even if I do that,
I'd win four points.

2153
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:21,369
Those points would be meaningless for me.

2154
01:32:22,539 --> 01:32:23,539
Nothing will work.

2155
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,609
Gosh, if I were to win points,

2156
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,119
the others would win points too.

2157
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:31,050
All right.

2158
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,920
Let's try my best.

2159
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:36,989
I decided to either play offense
or defense...

2160
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,060
in the next round...

2161
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,060
and went with Slot C.

2162
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:46,699
I'll submit Number Three to Slot C.

2163
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:51,199
Dong Min,
you've submitted Number Three in Slot C.

2164
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:54,140
(Remaining cards)

2165
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,539
I'll place this in Slot A.

2166
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:58,949
You've submitted Number Two in Slot A.

2167
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:01,779
Does this make sense?

2168
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,949
There aren't many number of cases
where I can win.

2169
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,350
It might be a much lower probability...

2170
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:09,720
than the likelihood
of the Avengers saving the Earth.

2171
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,989
But unless it's zero percent,

2172
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,960
I think the game has to be played out
until the very end.

2173
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:17,029
Is it possible to earn points with five?

2174
01:33:17,729 --> 01:33:18,829
I had one strategy.

2175
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:20,369
My priority was...

2176
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,300
to have 2 Number 6s and 1 Number 5
change into points...

2177
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:26,140
while stopping Jin Ho...

2178
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,140
from earning points.

2179
01:33:28,909 --> 01:33:32,109
It seemed Slot A had 6, 5, 6, and 6.

2180
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,350
I figured if I joined in as well,
I'd earn points...

2181
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:36,979
and prevent Jin Ho from earning points.

2182
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:38,020
(He guessed the cards in Slot A
would be 6 or 5.)

2183
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,789
I'll submit Number Six to Slot A.

2184
01:33:39,789 --> 01:33:40,819
(Heo Seong Beom has placed
Number 6 to Slot A.)

2185
01:33:40,819 --> 01:33:45,489
Seong Beom,
you have submitted Number Six to Slot A.

2186
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:49,399
The 1st cards of Round 3 have been placed.

2187
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,529
The players will begin placing
the second cards shortly.

2188
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,100
It might be unpredictable until the end.

2189
01:33:57,970 --> 01:33:59,010
That's right.

2190
01:34:00,109 --> 01:34:01,170
Except for me.

2191
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:04,239
- You're confirmed to place first?
- Yes.

2192
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,510
Haven't you seen it?

2193
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:10,020
We can purchase points
with our private funds.

2194
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:14,119
I'd rather like you to place first.

2195
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,789
I'm already disgusted
to have a Deathmatch with you.

2196
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:24,899
(The 2nd turn of Round 3 begins.)

2197
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,939
Seong Beom, please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

2198
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:34,239
(Hesitating)

2199
01:34:34,539 --> 01:34:38,210
I had big numbers, so I thought
I'd earn points in Round Three for sure.

2200
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:40,979
But the limit was way too small.

2201
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:42,979
The average number
was two point something.

2202
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:45,680
(Remaining cards)

2203
01:34:45,989 --> 01:34:49,159
It's not good. Lower than 2... 1.8?

2204
01:34:50,359 --> 01:34:52,760
(Dejected)

2205
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,460
I can't see any number of cases.

2206
01:34:56,329 --> 01:34:59,770
What should I do?

2207
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:04,869
It might be funny if someone happily
takes two points at a time like this.

2208
01:35:04,869 --> 01:35:06,210
Six times three is eighteen...

2209
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,640
I couldn't do this alone.

2210
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,340
It was almost impossible...

2211
01:35:11,409 --> 01:35:13,380
unless Steve, Eon Kyu, and Dong Min...

2212
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,380
made up their mind to help me win.

2213
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:18,819
How smart of them.

2214
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:23,989
I'll submit Numbers 5 and 6 to Slot B.

2215
01:35:24,789 --> 01:35:26,460
Slots C and D...

2216
01:35:26,729 --> 01:35:30,359
seemed least likely,

2217
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:32,000
so I gave up on them.

2218
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:34,430
I hoped something lucky would happen...

2219
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,899
and submitted two cards to Slot B.

2220
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:38,770
Will you use a rule card?

2221
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,310
I will not.

2222
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:46,880
Oh, he blocked there.

2223
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:51,619
Steve, please submit two cards
to the desired slots.

2224
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,090
(Remaining cards)

2225
01:35:56,619 --> 01:35:57,659
I should just...

2226
01:35:58,659 --> 01:35:59,689
I will...

2227
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,430
(Jin Ho placed Number 3 to Slot A.)

2228
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:06,869
(He expected the other players
wouldn't place any numbers higher than 5.)

2229
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:08,770
I will...

2230
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,640
submit two cards to Slot A.

2231
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,869
(Steve chooses to place
Numbers 5 and 6 to Slot A.)

2232
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:15,710
Will you use a rule card?

2233
01:36:15,909 --> 01:36:19,180
Yes, I will use it on Slot A.

2234
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,810
I'll bet all the rest.

2235
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:23,149
(The 1st card of the one who uses
a rule card is to be registered 1st.)

2236
01:36:23,149 --> 01:36:25,279
(In this case, Xitsuh and Jin Ho
will not earn any points...)

2237
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,350
(while Min A and Seong Beom will.)

2238
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:28,920
(Dong Min is the 3rd player
of the 2nd turn in Round 3.)

2239
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,159
Hello.

2240
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:32,760
What on earth? Darn it.

2241
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:36,630
Is he insane?

2242
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,069
Oh, he submitted them
because he had no choice.

2243
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:42,899
(Thinking carefully)

2244
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:43,970
Hold on.

2245
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:46,510
Darn.

2246
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:52,039
The situation isn't so favorable.

2247
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:54,310
(Remaining cards)

2248
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:55,310
What I can submit...

2249
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,250
I'll just do my best to earn points.

2250
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,920
Please submit your cards
on the other side.

2251
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:03,590
Why don't you go and do it
on the other side?

2252
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:04,859
(Getting mean for nothing)

2253
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,430
(Complaining)

2254
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:12,430
I'll submit Number Five to Slot B.

2255
01:37:14,069 --> 01:37:17,270
I'll submit Number Two to Slot C.

2256
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:20,569
The game is going neck-and-neck.

2257
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:22,979
It's unpredictable who will win.

2258
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,079
It doesn't matter to me.

2259
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:27,050
I'll beat them all anyway.

2260
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:31,149
Whoever survives,
they will only last a little longer,

2261
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,619
I think.

2262
01:37:33,449 --> 01:37:35,350
"All right.
You can breathe a little more."

2263
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,789
Let me return this too.

2264
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,829
(Rejected)

2265
01:37:41,229 --> 01:37:42,329
I appreciate your hard work.

2266
01:37:45,229 --> 01:37:46,229
(Next is Min A,
who is currently in the lead.)

2267
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:48,270
Min A, please submit two cards...

2268
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,569
to the desired slots.

2269
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:52,609
There is...

2270
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,409
a one-point difference
between me and Jin Ho...

2271
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:56,880
and a four-point difference
between me and Acau.

2272
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,550
If Acau and Xitsuh take points
with all Numbers 2, 2, and 3,

2273
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:02,109
it will be 13 points in total.

2274
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,750
If they take all the points
and I make a mistake,

2275
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,789
the tables may be turned.

2276
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:12,020
So I'm trying to find a number
that's best for me.

2277
01:38:13,789 --> 01:38:16,729
Slot C's limit is 12.

2278
01:38:16,729 --> 01:38:18,729
There are tons of crazy people here,

2279
01:38:18,899 --> 01:38:21,300
so I didn't even have it in mind
in case they'd mess with it.

2280
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,770
But the moment I saw Dong Min's card,

2281
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:27,869
I thought...

2282
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,210
even if he submitted Number Six,

2283
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:31,680
he wouldn't submit 2 of Number 6...

2284
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:35,880
and that he'd want to earn points too.

2285
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,380
(She precisely assumed
that he submitted a low-number card.)

2286
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,390
There are two empty slots behind me.

2287
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:41,750
If Jin Ho...

2288
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:44,859
already submitted Number 5
and has Numbers 2 and 3 left,

2289
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:47,659
he might decide to submit his cards
to the 1 with 2 empty slots.

2290
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:51,800
(Min A places two cards to Slot C.)

2291
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,470
Min A, you have submitted two cards
to Slot C.

2292
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,369
Hello.

2293
01:38:58,369 --> 01:39:00,539
Gosh, what's going on?

2294
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:02,539
Jin Ho, please submit two cards...

2295
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:04,909
to the desired slots.

2296
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:10,180
As soon as I entered the room,

2297
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:13,850
I checked
where Min A's cards were placed first.

2298
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:17,590
Two of Dong Min's cards
were placed before hers.

2299
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,789
I assumed he placed low-numbered cards...

2300
01:39:19,789 --> 01:39:22,289
in order to earn points.

2301
01:39:23,229 --> 01:39:24,859
So I ruled him out first.

2302
01:39:25,029 --> 01:39:27,729
I have two opposite cases
about Min A's cards.

2303
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:29,229
It's whether she submitted
Numbers 5 and 6 or 1 and 1.

2304
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:31,970
It's very important what her cards are.

2305
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,539
If she placed
two low-numbered cards there,

2306
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:37,210
she'll place first
the moment she takes those points.

2307
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:39,409
Will I be able to hold that in check?

2308
01:39:39,409 --> 01:39:40,810
What numbers did she submit?

2309
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:43,180
She submitted Number 1 to Slot A
and Number 2 to Slot C.

2310
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,420
I tried to guess the cards
based on these ideas.

2311
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:48,649
What matters is if Min A submitted
Numbers 6 and 5...

2312
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,590
or low-numbered cards.

2313
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,899
I'll submit Numbers 3 and 2 to Slot C.

2314
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,500
(Min A plans to get many points
with low-numbered cards.)

2315
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:09,039
(Hesitating)

2316
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,010
A lot of cards were submitted to slots.

2317
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:13,779
To mind all the number of cases,

2318
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:16,380
it'd be impossible to place any.

2319
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:19,649
I needed to rule out some cases.

2320
01:40:24,489 --> 01:40:25,989
I just assumed...

2321
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:28,289
that Min A submitted
low-numbered cards to Slot C.

2322
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,630
(His guess was right.)

2323
01:40:33,029 --> 01:40:36,170
I'll submit Numbers 5 and 5 to Slot C.

2324
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:41,069
Jin Ho, you've submitted...

2325
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,079
Numbers 5 and 5 to Slot C.

2326
01:40:44,979 --> 01:40:47,310
If Min A submitted two low-numbered cards,

2327
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:50,979
I'll cancel it out
and take points myself...

2328
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,090
while leaving no slots behind me.

2329
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,750
This way, I can prevent Xitsuh and Acau
from holding me in check,

2330
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,489
which can be the best situation for me.

2331
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,930
If I gain six points here...

2332
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:02,189
with 2 of Number 5,

2333
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,800
Min A will think
I'm placed higher than her.

2334
01:41:06,699 --> 01:41:08,569
Xitsuh and Acau will be left, then.

2335
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:12,170
Still, I'll place 1st if lucky
and 2nd at least.

2336
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,239
If not...

2337
01:41:14,739 --> 01:41:16,210
(Sighing)

2338
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,279
I'll have to go again.

2339
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:22,180
(Next is Acau, the 6th player
of the 2nd turn in Round 3.)

2340
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:24,020
Acau, please submit two cards...

2341
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,449
to the desired slots.

2342
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:29,489
(Meticulous)

2343
01:41:29,489 --> 01:41:31,489
Numbers 5, 6, and 6.

2344
01:41:32,859 --> 01:41:35,390
Purple...

2345
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:36,500
(Calculating based on the information
he's obtained so far)

2346
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,329
Min A and Jin Ho submitted...

2347
01:41:38,329 --> 01:41:40,529
two of their cards each to Slot C.

2348
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:44,939
My wish is for them
to gain only two points each...

2349
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,970
and lose three points.

2350
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:51,579
Then, I still have an open chance
to place 1st or 2nd.

2351
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:54,750
(Remaining cards)

2352
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,520
(Sighing)

2353
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,649
Please.

2354
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,420
I will...

2355
01:42:04,859 --> 01:42:09,699
(Eon Kyu submitted Number 4 to Slot D.)

2356
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:12,329
(He induced a low-numbered card
as if he placed a high-numbered card...)

2357
01:42:13,229 --> 01:42:17,340
(to submit Number 5 at the end
to gain points alone.)

2358
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:19,539
I will...

2359
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:23,909
submit Numbers Six...

2360
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,479
and Three to Slot D.

2361
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:29,079
(Submitting Numbers 6 and 3 to Slot D?)

2362
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:30,279
Actually,

2363
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:33,250
I was really concerned at that time.

2364
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:37,020
I wondered a lot about
whether Eon Kyu submitted Number 6 or 4.

2365
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,989
Joo Eon Kyu...

2366
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:42,960
Eon Kyu submitted Number Four for sure.

2367
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:47,100
I tried hard to analyze...

2368
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,130
his behaviors thus far.

2369
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:51,840
Acau, you have submitted...

2370
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,310
Numbers 6 and 3 to Slot D.

2371
01:42:57,279 --> 01:42:59,779
(Slot status in Turn 2 of Round 3)

2372
01:42:59,779 --> 01:43:04,079
(Slot A's limit: 26, Slot B's limit: 20,
Slot C's limit: 12, Slot D's limit: 9)

2373
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:06,420
Xitsuh, please submit two cards...

2374
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,750
to the desired slots.

2375
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:10,560
(Xitsuh is the 7th player
of the 2nd turn in Round 3.)

2376
01:43:10,789 --> 01:43:13,760
Acau and I were
in the exact same situation...

2377
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,159
except that his turn was before mine.

2378
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:21,899
So when my turn came,
I was almost the last to submit cards.

2379
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,039
I had no choice at that time.

2380
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:26,909
(Torn)

2381
01:43:27,069 --> 01:43:30,210
I'll submit 2 of Number 2 to Slot B.

2382
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,079
(Remaining cards)

2383
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:36,920
Xitsuh, you have submitted...

2384
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:40,250
Numbers 2 and 2 to Slot B.

2385
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:44,159
Will you use a rule card?

2386
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:48,060
(Hesitating)

2387
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:49,600
I was so unlucky with items too.

2388
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,329
I didn't have any items
to turn the tables.

2389
01:43:52,329 --> 01:43:53,500
(Destroy the 1st Number 6)

2390
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,369
I will use it on Slot A.

2391
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,539
How many coins will you bet?

2392
01:43:57,539 --> 01:43:58,939
Five.

2393
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:01,840
You used the rule card
on Slot A with five coins...

2394
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,880
to destroy the 1st Number 6.

2395
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:09,979
I was really unlucky in Round Three.

2396
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,520
(The last player is Joo Eon Kyu.)

2397
01:44:15,289 --> 01:44:17,159
(Eon Kyu has no idea
that his strategy was broken.)

2398
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:19,020
I'll place this to Slot D.

2399
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:24,329
You have submitted Number Five to Slot D.

2400
01:44:25,729 --> 01:44:28,069
And I will submit this to Slot B.

2401
01:44:28,069 --> 01:44:30,670
(He has submitted
his last card to Slot B.)

2402
01:44:30,739 --> 01:44:32,369
The game is over.

2403
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:36,270
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2404
01:44:40,579 --> 01:44:43,250
(Currently tied in 3rd place: Acau...)

2405
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,220
(and Xitsuh)

2406
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:49,250
(Currently in 1st place: Kim Min A)

2407
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:52,989
(Currently in 2nd place: Hong Jin Ho)

2408
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:55,529
This is so nerve-wracking.

2409
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,659
I don't know what's what.

2410
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:01,029
Let me announce the result.

2411
01:45:03,369 --> 01:45:06,439
The 2 players
who will advance to the finals 1st...

2412
01:45:09,909 --> 01:45:13,310
are Acau and Hong Jin Ho.

2413
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:15,279
(Acau, Hong Jin Ho)

2414
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,550
(Jin Ho managed to stay in the lead.)

2415
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:18,750
I expected it'd be Acau.

2416
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,989
(Acau succeeded to make a great reversal.)

2417
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:23,390
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2418
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:24,489
Thank you.

2419
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,819
I stole the points.

2420
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,300
(Slot status in Round 3)

2421
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:35,430
(Xitsuh betted 5 coins on Slot A.)

2422
01:45:35,869 --> 01:45:40,909
(But Steve betted 10 coins on Slot A.)

2423
01:45:40,909 --> 01:45:43,310
(Xitsuh's rule card was discarded.)

2424
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,779
(Register his 1st card 1st)

2425
01:45:44,779 --> 01:45:49,109
(Xitsuh failed
to gain points from Slot A.)

2426
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:54,149
(And Eon Kyu's last card)

2427
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:58,060
(He submitted Number 6 to Slot B.)

2428
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:03,199
(In the end, Xitsuh couldn't gain
any points during Round 3.)

2429
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:05,329
That played a big part.

2430
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,970
I helped him out.

2431
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:08,029
(The older members got in his way.)

2432
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:10,069
- Until the end...
- You really did.

2433
01:46:10,939 --> 01:46:12,770
When I went up to first place...

2434
01:46:12,869 --> 01:46:15,470
in troubled waters during Round Two,

2435
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:18,810
I thought I'd go straight to the finals
if I managed to keep the place.

2436
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:21,409
But this caused my defeat.

2437
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:24,520
I was playing too safe...

2438
01:46:24,579 --> 01:46:26,720
when I should've tried to go higher.

2439
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:29,590
In the end, I couldn't stop
other players from coming up.

2440
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,119
It's a shame that I placed third.

2441
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,659
(Meanwhile, Acau made a winning move.)

2442
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:42,930
(He raked in points from Slot D
and made a great reversal.)

2443
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,670
(Final Score:
Acau, Hong Jin Ho, Kim Min A,)

2444
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:47,369
(Steve Yea, Heo Seong Beom,
Xitsuh, Joo Eon Kyu, Jang Dong Min)

2445
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:49,779
I knew it. Nice.

2446
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:50,810
(Acau and Jin Ho get to go straight
to the finals.)

2447
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,140
Acau did well.

2448
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,850
Eon Kyu gave Acau all the help.

2449
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:58,380
(He played a major role
in Acau placing 1st.)

2450
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:02,149
I calculated and wrote down everything.

2451
01:47:02,489 --> 01:47:05,689
I kept calculating possible variables...

2452
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:06,890
and what cards other players
would possibly submit.

2453
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,130
Min A...

2454
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,399
(Acau is a tenacious player.)

2455
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:15,729
All that was of great help.

2456
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:19,569
I believe I placed first...

2457
01:47:20,069 --> 01:47:21,609
because I counted the cards thoroughly.

2458
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:23,340
I won because I nailed it.

2459
01:47:24,779 --> 01:47:27,979
Today's game was
a 100-percent individual match.

2460
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,380
Everyone agreed so.

2461
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:33,920
I'm proud of myself...

2462
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,520
for the strategies I made.

2463
01:47:36,689 --> 01:47:39,460
Of course, I'm glad
that I'm going straight to the finals,

2464
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:43,090
but I feel a sense of confidence
in a while...

2465
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:45,729
that I'm capable of doing...

2466
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:48,470
what I put my mind to do.

2467
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:58,479
Except for Jin Ho and Acau,

2468
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,250
the six remaining players...

2469
01:48:02,949 --> 01:48:05,350
will play the second Pre-final Stage...

2470
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:07,090
to determine the finalists.

2471
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:11,189
The second Pre-final Stage
and the final match...

2472
01:48:11,789 --> 01:48:13,729
will take place at a new location.

2473
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,529
I thought I'd feel so wronged
if I couldn't be one of the finalists.

2474
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:23,439
I gave all my might thus far.

2475
01:48:23,699 --> 01:48:26,869
I did the best I could to the bone.

2476
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:28,340
I must advance to the finals for sure.

2477
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:32,579
Only 2 of the 6 players
will make it to the finals,

2478
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:34,680
and the rest will all be eliminated.

2479
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:37,119
I'm planning to fully engage myself...

2480
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:41,449
as if it was a Deathmatch
without making any mistakes.

2481
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:45,359
I'll do the best I can
until I become the final winner.

2482
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:47,489
I must be the most desperate one.

2483
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:49,899
I have been eliminated
in the semi-finals...

2484
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,159
of all the survival programs
I've joined so far.

2485
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:53,630
It's finally time...

2486
01:48:54,569 --> 01:48:56,229
to break that record...

2487
01:48:56,869 --> 01:48:58,340
and go beyond that.

2488
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:00,909
I'm going to go to the finals.

2489
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:04,039
I'm sure I'll be a finalist.

2490
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,409
I know I can smash anyone against me.

2491
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:09,180
No one really is my threat.

2492
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:12,880
I'll resort to everything I can
to become a finalist.

2493
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,250
I'll advance to the finals for sure.

2494
01:49:14,449 --> 01:49:15,850
I want to go to the finals.

2495
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,319
I'll give all my might.

2496
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:24,460
Please get ready for the match
to determine Bloody Game's final winner.

2497
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,590
I'll take only the half
of the prize money.

2498
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:50,689
It will be burned to ashes soon. Darn it!

2499
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,489
- Ask what?
- I'll carry the ball.

2500
01:49:52,489 --> 01:49:54,229
Kyung Ran,
I think I'll be going to Deathmatch.

2501
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:55,829
- Acau disappeared.
- I'll go kill them all.

2502
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,729
- Darn it. What's going on?
- I played...

2503
01:49:57,729 --> 01:49:58,859
- a stupid card.
- You could be hurt.

2504
01:49:58,859 --> 01:49:59,930
Oh, please.

2505
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:01,130
He read my plan.

2506
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:02,170
Come out already.

2507
01:50:02,869 --> 01:50:04,600
- I calculated it wrong.
- I was scared.

2508
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,340
- I got them all.
- I found it.

2509
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,109
- I couldn't say a thing.
- Do you admit it?

2510
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:09,869
- You became the Evil Spirit.
- Let's pick Jin Ho.

2511
01:50:09,869 --> 01:50:11,609
- You've become an elimination candidate.
- What?

2512
01:50:11,609 --> 01:50:13,449
- He hid his suspicion from me.
- Let's survive individually.

2513
01:50:13,449 --> 01:50:15,050
- I'll punish the Evil Spirit.
- I'm doomed.

2514
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,850
- Oh, goodness.
- There are three Evil Deed cards.

2515
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:18,479
- If we let the Archangel know...
- It's me.

2516
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:20,590
- Do it one by one.
- I'm doomed.

2517
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:31,630
(The 8 final survivors
after the long journey)

2518
01:50:31,729 --> 01:50:33,300
I'll win no matter what.

2519
01:50:33,569 --> 01:50:34,630
I have confidence.

2520
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,840
Bring it on. Let's fight.

2521
01:50:36,939 --> 01:50:38,340
I'll seize the victory.

2522
01:50:38,569 --> 01:50:40,210
I have the highest chance to win.

2523
01:50:40,409 --> 01:50:41,970
I must win
now that I've come all the way here.

2524
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:43,739
I don't really feel like losing.

2525
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:45,579
I'll race to win.

2526
01:50:45,579 --> 01:50:47,149
(Heo Seong Beom, Xitsuh,)

2527
01:50:47,149 --> 01:50:48,909
