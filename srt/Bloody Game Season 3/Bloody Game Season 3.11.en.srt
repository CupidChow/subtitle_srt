1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,509
(After the Deathmatch)

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,880
All the players on the losing team
of the Money Challenge...

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,980
must go to the Remaining.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,679
Come on!

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,890
- Come on!
- Come on. Stop it.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,359
(Hong Jin Ho, Xitsuh, Chungju-Man,
Steve Yea, and Choi Hye Seon will go.)

7
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,059
My goodness.

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,500
Darn it. What is this?

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,670
- What on earth...
- I really thought I'd never come back.

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,369
It already stinks here.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,439
We went back there and took over
the place with a sledgehammer.

12
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,679
How does it make any sense that
we come back here? Seriously.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,280
When I first got there,

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,549
I thought,
"I ended up here after everything."

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,049
Gosh, what is this?

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,689
- Goodness.
- This is awful.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,119
It is so dark here.

18
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,289
Why are we going down
to the second basement level?

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,289
It's bright upstairs.

20
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,530
Gosh, the water is dripping here.
This place is a mess.

21
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,799
- Gosh, this is just dreadful.
- Hey, there's a puddle.

22
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,170
Where on earth is this water coming from?
Seriously.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,570
This makes no sense.

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,140
That place felt like the situation
I was in.

25
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,069
Everything was broken and ruined.

26
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,409
And our team too.

27
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,040
We didn't have one proper win.

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,609
Or there wasn't a moment
when we thoroughly enjoyed something.

29
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,650
We kept losing and making mistakes.

30
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,950
There's always a spy.

31
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,549
Our teammates keep on fighting.

32
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,250
So I just wanted to throw everything away.

33
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,659
Gosh, seriously.

34
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,560
Everything was just annoying.

35
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,700
I realized that I wasn't doing well
with these games.

36
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,629
Something wasn't...

37
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:37,269
going right with me.
I wasn't performing well.

38
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,939
I felt a sense of shame...

39
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,939
on my own.

40
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,010
I felt like I wasn't doing
a good job leading our team.

41
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,310
That crossed my mind.

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,319
Darn it. What is this?

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,760
But anyway,

44
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,359
the people on my team thought of me...

45
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,400
as their captain.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,829
And I felt it too.

47
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,699
For that, I couldn't give up.

48
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,370
I bounced ideas around my head.

49
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,840
"What should my team do?"

50
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:18,379
All right, everyone. Let's gather around.
Everyone, come here.

51
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,580
I've sorted out some thoughts
on my way here.

52
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:22,979
Right.

53
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,719
Here's my first thought.

54
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,919
So there are five of us here.

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,449
The five of us...

56
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,759
- should trust each other today.
- Yes.

57
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,219
We'll trust each other. Okay?

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,629
Yes.

59
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,330
For our team to do better,

60
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,729
there shouldn't be any problems
within the team.

61
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:40,969
This keeps bugging me.

62
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,229
Here's the thing with Dong Min's team.

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,669
Some people say that
Dong Min is like a dictator.

64
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,740
But they're solid as a team.

65
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,210
We didn't even try to get
one of them to betray their team.

66
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,240
We never succeeded either.
That's where we are now.

67
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,409
Their bond is strong,
but our team is swayed easily.

68
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,750
It's important for our team
to make sure we can trust each other.

69
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,620
Everyone including Heo Seong Beom...

70
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,419
probably had a role to confuse us
with wrong information and so on.

71
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,490
When they come and talk to us,
it's to give us wrong information too.

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,789
If there's anything
you want to share with the group,

73
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,330
let's come together,
discuss it as a group,

74
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,689
- and decide. Let's do that.
- Yes.

75
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,300
I'll go to the Deathmatch
if our team loses because of that.

76
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,599
I'll go and come back.

77
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,900
I'll be punished. Okay?

78
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,000
- I'll take responsibility for that.
- Yes.

79
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,500
Anyway, if you trust me,

80
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,969
let's use that to build our team.

81
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,840
Let's build our team based on what I said.

82
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,710
If we focus on the game,
we totally have a shot at beating them.

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,180
We can definitely beat them.

84
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,050
Okay?

85
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,349
- Yes.
- Yes. I got it.

86
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,520
I thought to myself that
we were in the worst-case scenario.

87
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,150
Meanwhile, Jin Ho,
being the oldest guy on the team,

88
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,389
tried his best to sort things out
for the entire team.

89
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,129
I ended up leading the team.

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,629
After bonding as a team,
I wanted us to go up against them.

91
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,830
That's what I had in mind.

92
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey, what should we do here?
What did you do here?

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
- We didn't do anything.
- We just lay down here.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,300
We did nothing for 20 hours.

95
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,810
We got something. There's something.

96
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,539
- We got something?
- There's something.

97
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,039
- What is it?
- We got something.

98
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,539
- What is it?
- Here I come.

99
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,479
What is it?

100
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,610
- When they ring the bell,
- Yes.

101
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,680
there's a message.

102
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,520
What are we? Dogs?

103
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,590
I think it's our food.

104
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,620
- Gosh.
- It's food and the rule book.

105
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,789
- The rule book.
- Is it the same as before?

106
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,189
They just give us a letter and a pencil.

107
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,360
What? I think it's the same thing.

108
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,959
The Ghost Casino is the same.

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,230
The food is the same.
The Remaining players...

110
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,629
So nothing is new.

111
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,639
So nothing's new?

112
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,639
- Should I tell them?
- So nothing's new.

113
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,769
- Hold on. Not yet.
- I told you.

114
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,279
When the Ghost Casino opens later,

115
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,910
we might be able to buy something there.

116
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,279
Jin Ho. Well...

117
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,819
The sweet potato.

118
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,680
- There's something to tell you.
- Yes.

119
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,490
- I have some information.
- What is it?

120
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,459
There could be another raid.

121
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,290
Darn it.
Where did you get this information?

122
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,060
It's not the same raid.

123
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,959
We can finally go and make some money.

124
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,329
I see. You found out about it
when you were staying in the Mansion.

125
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,930
But we can use the Hidden Rule now?

126
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,970
Could you tell us what the Hidden Rule is?
We should all know what it is.

127
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,910
So... Go ahead. Explain it to them.

128
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,279
- Yes, sir.
- My gosh. They're so funny.

129
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,779
So we could only raid Paradise
when we were outside.

130
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,649
In the Mansion or here?

131
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,920
Players outside Paradise can steal
from the safe box in Paradise...

132
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,689
on the Day of the Loot.

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,730
We must open up the safe box
within 90 minutes upon entering Paradise.

134
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
If we cannot open it within 90 minutes,
it's over.

135
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,800
But if we open the safe box
within 90 minutes,

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,740
the time clock will begin again
for 90 minutes.

137
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,569
An alarm will go off after 20 minutes.

138
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,040
It will go off again every 20 minutes.

139
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,579
- Then that's it.
- Okay.

140
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,720
The time we had to go
without getting caught was pretty long.

141
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,250
So I thought this was a tough challenge.

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,149
Holding out with the safe box
would be difficult.

143
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,550
I tried to come up with a way
on how to tackle it.

144
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,459
We could just brazenly walk in there.

145
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,930
We would pretend
we weren't there to steal.

146
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,529
We could just hang out with them.
When they lower their guard,

147
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,459
we would grab the safe box and run.

148
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,970
Let's say we go up there.

149
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,930
If there are people in the pantry
and they start looking at us,

150
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,339
we can scatter and take a shower.

151
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,240
- Let's take a shower for an hour.
- Okay.

152
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,310
If no one's downstairs
and they're all sleeping,

153
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,310
you'll go in right away.

154
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,980
The three of you go in right away.
You can go upstairs.

155
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,449
We can start stealing right away.

156
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,920
Okay.

157
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,449
When they find out that
we are there to steal,

158
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,490
we would be
in difficult and bothersome situations.

159
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,019
We can't locked up in the vault
and get smashed by the sledgehammer again.

160
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,959
I also have another idea.

161
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,959
We do need some money.

162
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,069
But if there's no chance of getting it,
a few of us can go and burn their money.

163
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,970
We can just burn their money
instead of taking it for us.

164
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,639
Burn what?

165
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,870
- What?
- Set it on fire?

166
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,910
Set it on fire. We can wipe out
all of their private funds.

167
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,810
They keep trying to scare us with money.

168
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,449
If we don't have a chance
at holding onto the money for 90 minutes,

169
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,050
- let's wipe it out.
- Yes. Let's bring a lighter.

170
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,480
Yes. I do think
that's one of the strategies we can take.

171
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,819
Dong Min has a lot of money.

172
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,620
The biggest difference
between us and them...

173
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,889
is the money.

174
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,959
Even if we were to take
their private funds,

175
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,060
the gap between our private funds
is still too big.

176
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,899
So I did some reverse thinking.

177
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,839
I heard the money was on fire
on the first day for them.

178
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:15,040
Then I thought there was a way for us...

179
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
to get rid of their private funds too.

180
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,339
To be honest,

181
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,009
I want to make them angry.

182
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,310
- Can we trick them in every way possible?
- Same here. I want to do that too.

183
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,949
We were deceived by their spy.

184
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,850
Let's use all the tricks we have
to make them angry.

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,250
Seriously.

186
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,420
I want to bring down Yurisa just once.

187
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,790
We can brag it to her
after we get her money.

188
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,860
The members of our team were excited.

189
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,629
I was on board
with going over there to steal it.

190
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,500
But I didn't want the situation...

191
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,769
to get out of hand or too aggressive.

192
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,139
We don't need to bring any tools
when we go there.

193
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,639
Let's just sneak in there.

194
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,370
We're not going there as robbers,
but thieves.

195
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,740
- Don't take any weapons.
- We're there as a player.

196
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,310
If things go south, we could be robbers!

197
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,649
Right.

198
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,610
Since we had to go through the trouble
staying in the Remaining again,

199
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,680
we wanted to take some of their money
at least.

200
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,050
We don't have a sense of ethics, morals,

201
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,819
or guilt. Nothing.

202
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,689
Let's go.

203
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

204
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:10,160
Until Dong Min loses all of his money.

205
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,959
This will be fun.

206
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,540
You know what?
This could give us a huge advantage...

207
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,670
if this raid is successful.

208
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,910
Right? We'll have their money.

209
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,379
Hold on.

210
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,209
(Team Remaining approaches Paradise.)

211
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,209
Over there.

212
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,279
Could you walk a bit slowly?

213
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,190
- Slow down.
- Yes, just a bit.

214
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,919
I want to lie down on the bed right away.

215
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,289
- That's one thing.
- Don't go in there.

216
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,090
- Let me check under the sheet.
- What?

217
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,830
Let me look for a hiding spot.

218
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,529
Wait.

219
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,399
Slow down.

220
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,500
Come this way.

221
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,370
(Team Remaining is carrying out
their plan.)

222
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,809
(Thud)

223
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
What's that sound?

224
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,419
Min A is walking around.

225
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm not sure about that.

226
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,360
Min A, Seong Beom, and Dong Min
are moving something.

227
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,720
- It's big and red.
- Really?

228
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,259
Let's go in there. Act naturally.

229
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,460
What are they moving?

230
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,200
(They stack up the chairs in the hallway.)

231
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,970
Wait. You opened the safe box?

232
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,279
I did. I know the passcode.

233
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,809
Nothing is in there. I know that for sure.

234
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,679
(Yurisa opens the safe box.)

235
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,090
What?

236
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,690
What is it?

237
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,720
(Money is in the safe box.)

238
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,389
What is it?

239
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,230
You know that I'm gifted, right?

240
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,230
- You're all dead.
- We do.

241
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,059
- I'll kill you one at a time.
- What?

242
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,700
Do you have superpower?

243
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,269
- What is it?
- You...

244
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,870
I'll tell you later.

245
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,740
Is it a new mission?

246
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,669
Let me tell you something.

247
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,139
We're on the same team now.

248
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,379
The first Hidden Rule was
about the ultimate power holder.

249
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,850
And there was another rule.
There were two rules.

250
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,120
If the safe boxes were robbed
or empty because something happened,

251
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,919
they would be filled with money again.

252
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,159
- It means we could face a raid.
- Right.

253
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,330
Right, there could be a raid.

254
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,759
This will be our final line of defense.

255
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,159
We have to make it difficult
for them to walk freely.

256
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,769
Let's put up a line of defense.

257
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,840
(He starts locking up
the entrance to the pantry.)

258
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,840
Whatever. Darn it. I'll do this too.

259
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,149
(A hair dryer)

260
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,250
(They sealed the pantry
after spotting the safe box.)

261
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Who is that?

262
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,759
- I think it's Jin Ho.
- What?

263
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,059
It's Jin Ho.

264
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,159
- It's Jin Ho.
- They're coming.

265
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,559
- Wait.
- They're coming.

266
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,629
(The Remaining players approach Paradise.)

267
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:57,799
- We don't have to stay there anymore.
- It's over.

268
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,200
- They're coming.
- They're here.

269
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,700
- It's a raid.
- They're here.

270
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,600
- We almost died there.
- What?

271
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,100
- Why did you come back so soon?
- They're here.

272
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,200
You're not even trying to sneak in.

273
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,409
- You're just walking so brazenly.
- Waltzing in here must be your plan.

274
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,039
- Let's go up together.
- What are you doing?

275
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,679
- What's this?
- They are so brazen.

276
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
What is this?

277
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,080
- It's over with the Remaining.
- Go in.

278
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,679
There are no more Remaining now.

279
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,679
What is it?

280
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,450
- Are there any snacks?
- What?

281
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,220
- Snacks? There are a lot upstairs.
- Yes, snacks.

282
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,490
Come on. What's Hye Seon doing?

283
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,789
- Your acting is awful.
- What?

284
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,129
What are you doing?

285
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,100
My goodness. Look at these fools.

286
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,700
- Come out of there! What are you doing?
- Hey.

287
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,000
Why won't the alarm go off?

288
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,740
- This is hilarious.
- We got intruders!

289
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,409
- Well, I love the enthusiasm.
- Hey.

290
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,980
But you're wasting your energy.
Come on out.

291
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,409
Guard it!

292
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,879
- We're guarding it.
<i>- Love and honor</i>

293
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,879
Sing.

294
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,279
It was obvious that
they were faking the whole thing.

295
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,690
When you come back from the Remaining,
you would be pretty upset.

296
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,419
But given that
they just came back from there,

297
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,220
they walked in as if nothing was wrong.

298
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,759
I knew for sure that this was a raid.

299
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,559
It was obvious.

300
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,860
They do catch on fast.

301
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm going to wash up fast.

302
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,169
Okay.

303
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,639
Gosh, I'm tired.

304
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,909
(The safe box hasn't been touched.)

305
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,019
What are you doing?

306
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
What?

307
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,529
Hey, do something. Come on.

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Darn it. I prepared so much.
Do something at least.

309
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,070
I should eat.

310
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:48,909
Hey.

311
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,440
Come on. Everything I fail is a bust.

312
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
Hey.

313
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,179
Hey, we prepared all this. Do something.
Make it look like it's a raid.

314
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,179
- That's so funny.
- We're relieved to come back here...

315
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,549
- You know?
- today.

316
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,190
She's eating over there.

317
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,220
I really thought it was a raid.

318
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,259
It would be so embarrassing
if this was all for nothing.

319
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,460
This cannot be all for nothing.

320
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,029
What are you doing? Let's drink some soju.

321
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,500
What?

322
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,470
What? Why did you lock up the pantry?

323
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,700
Could you open that for a second?

324
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,299
- We can't.
- Even we can't open it.

325
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,299
I need something.

326
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,570
- We can't.
- No.

327
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,539
I'm really sorry. But it's not possible.

328
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,179
We don't know how to open it again.

329
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,309
You can't open it.

330
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,110
You guys are crazy.

331
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,320
I will give you two points
for your acting.

332
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,049
Next.

333
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,990
- We can't enter the pantry at all?
- No.

334
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,629
- No.
- The instant rice... I don't have rice.

335
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,289
- You can't enter.
- Look at this.

336
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,559
- You see this? It's not possible.
- You can't open it.

337
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,330
- Even we can't open it.
- The microwave...

338
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,629
- We can't use the microwave now.
- No microwave.

339
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,700
There's nothing we can do now.

340
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,539
How many points for her acting, Acau?

341
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,610
- I'll give her four points.
- That was the same score.

342
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,980
He keeps moving. That's hilarious.

343
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,779
- But let me use the toilet.
- No.

344
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,450
- I won't go into the pantry.
- No.

345
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,250
- You have MJ. I'm no match for her.
- Gosh, no.

346
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,990
- Seriously.
- Dong Min, let me use the toilet.

347
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,259
Go upstairs and use that one.

348
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,820
- Come on.
- They're all clogged here.

349
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,730
- The toilets are clogged?
- They're clogged.

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,460
Come on.

351
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,259
I'll give him 1.5 points for his acting.

352
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,970
- They sealed off the door to the pantry.
- What?

353
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,399
They sealed off the door to the pantry.

354
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,500
How did they think
of opening the safe box?

355
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,580
Did they talk about anything else?

356
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,210
Other than putting up a defense?
I mean, that's one thing.

357
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,909
They worked really hard.

358
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,480
- Today...
- That's how Dong Min is.

359
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,879
(Hye Seon leaves to get more food.)

360
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,049
They didn't talk about anything else?

361
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,190
You need to win first place
no matter what.

362
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,230
Why?

363
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,289
I think whoever wins first place...

364
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,330
gets to pick who gets eliminated.

365
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,799
The player who goes
to the Deathmatch right away.

366
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,169
How do you know that?

367
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,870
What did you say?

368
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
(Pretending not to hear her)

369
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,669
- What did you say?
- How do you know that?

370
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,870
He thinks whoever wins first place
gets to pick who gets eliminated.

371
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,909
(Eon Kyu doesn't respond.)

372
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:07,950
Eon Kyu played...

373
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:10,250
with Dong Min's team the day before.

374
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,220
And he was sharing some information
from them.

375
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,919
When I came over, he stopped talking.

376
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,960
Other guys on the team were like...

377
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,090
"I don't trust you 100 percent.
But I'll still trust you."

378
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,460
That was their stance.

379
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,059
But Eon Kyu was increasing
his suspicions about me on his own.

380
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,629
It was frustrating.
And I couldn't understand him.

381
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,669
If they try to create a rift among us,

382
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,299
they already know that it will work.

383
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,370
But it's the opposite for us.

384
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,539
No matter how hard we try to create
a rift among them, it won't work.

385
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,879
That's why they keep trying
to create a rift among us.

386
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,309
- And he keeps letting that happen.
- Yes.

387
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,549
So don't let that get to you.
In your opinion,

388
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,950
if you're not certain about what you hear,

389
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,250
you don't have to tell us.

390
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,720
We'll trust everything you say...

391
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,919
from here on out. We all decided that.

392
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,059
That's my point.

393
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,559
- That's it.
- You know what?

394
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,460
I already said I would play on my own...

395
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,529
if you had any ounce
of suspicion left of me.

396
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,529
(Hye Seon suddenly makes a declaration.)

397
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,769
It's not just you.
If anyone here suspects me even a bit...

398
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,740
and that's going to affect the game,

399
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,139
the five of you can bond
and play as a team.

400
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,179
And I can play on my own.

401
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,480
If you're getting this angry...

402
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,779
by what I brought up,

403
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,720
I can leave the team.

404
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,250
- So this is the situation...
- There's no need for me to be here.

405
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,690
I hate the most.

406
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,320
This is exactly what they want now.

407
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,659
- You're especially suspicious of me.
- She...

408
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,929
She trusted and relied on you the most.

409
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,059
Hye Seon was very angry.

410
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,960
I was the cause
behind the rift on our team.

411
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,259
I didn't even tell her
I was suspecting her by then.

412
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,169
My role was to share
whatever information I found out.

413
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,269
But she suddenly threw a fit like that.

414
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,740
I was angry too.

415
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,169
If you're going to get upset
and be offended...

416
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,480
Instead of letting that happen,

417
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,879
I don't have to play with this team.
No hard feelings.

418
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,909
- You didn't have to cause this then.
- I mean it.

419
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,279
No one has to leave the team.
You just didn't have to say that.

420
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,519
There was no need to come here...

421
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,649
- and give us information.
- Jin Ho, we have to see it...

422
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:55,750
from his point of view too.

423
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,559
If there's a slight chance
that there's a spy,

424
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,029
we're bound to lose the game
even with him on our team.

425
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,829
If you're going to get angry,
I don't want to play with you.

426
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,799
I don't like interacting with people
who get angry and upset.

427
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,140
- I don't like getting upset either.
- Right.

428
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm telling you not to get upset at me.

429
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,279
But there's nothing you can do about it.

430
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,180
Whether or not they wanted it,
it doesn't matter how it happened.

431
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,779
This already happened.

432
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,049
- So...
- This is bound to happen.

433
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,250
- Put yourself in our shoes.
- But here's why I'm angry.

434
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,119
He already suspected me
even before all this.

435
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,950
Then he kept adding onto that.

436
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,759
"I talked to the other team.
I heard Seong Beom was angry."

437
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,730
"Seong Beom talked to you in private."

438
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:38,160
He already believed what they said
and started suspecting me...

439
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,799
- before he talked to me.
- He didn't do that. Even I heard that.

440
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,500
It just came out.
Everyone heard about that.

441
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,930
They talk about me too.

442
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,539
Darn it. Then should I lose it too?

443
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,440
- Come on.
- When you talk, you're so aggressive.

444
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
- Slow down.
- But I'm right.

445
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,140
Put yourself in my shoes.

446
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,910
(Team Remaining ends up arguing.)

447
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,980
Here's what I'm saying.

448
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,779
Fine. Let's say you started to suspect me.

449
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,819
You could have told me
what you were thinking and hearing.

450
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,349
But you could've said,
"But you're not a spy, right?"

451
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,890
"If you tell me that, I'll trust you."
Or...

452
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,690
All right. Calm down a bit.

453
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,259
No. Could you not talk to me
aggressively like that?

454
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,799
- Not right now. I can't do that.
- Okay.

455
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,799
I have a lot of piled-up anger
toward you right now.

456
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,400
Let's not talk.
I don't need to talk to you.

457
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,940
Right. Let's take a break right now.

458
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,609
(The conversation ends
without resolving their problem.)

459
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:50,900
What is it?

460
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,970
I want to ask you something.

461
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,970
- What?
- Are you guys...

462
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,380
spreading rumors to create a rift
between me and my team?

463
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,079
No.

464
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,619
- Me?
- Not you.

465
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:10,849
Who?

466
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,029
Then why does my team keep
hearing rumors about me from your team?

467
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,000
My gosh. Darn it. What is this?
What kind of game is this?

468
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,869
I hate playing politics seriously.

469
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,609
I'm exhausted.

470
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,980
They keep saying I'm a spy.

471
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,660
Someone said
they saw me talk to Seong Beom.

472
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,960
It's because I keep talking to you.

473
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,059
This is a vicious cycle.

474
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,769
Because I can't talk to my team,
I'm here talking to them again.

475
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,339
I told them she couldn't be a spy.
When we were out there,

476
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,869
I told them we should just trust everyone
on our team and came here.

477
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,880
I told Eon Kyu
not to bring up stuff like that.

478
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,910
- She's not a spy.
- I know that.

479
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,180
- She really isn't.
- This is frustrating for me too.

480
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,079
She doesn't have a sense of belonging
to her team.

481
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,990
She has no one to talk to.

482
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,359
We're both women. We're roommates.

483
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,859
We talk about personal things too.
So when she talks to me,

484
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,930
you guys say that she's a spy.

485
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,859
So she has no sense of belonging.

486
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:26,960
When I got upset,

487
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,599
I went to MJ and talked to her.

488
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,539
It was a vicious cycle.

489
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,140
Outside the Money Challenges,
I have bonded...

490
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,740
more with the people on Dong Min's team
on a personal level.

491
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,880
But I'm playing with Jin Ho's team
when we play Money Challenges.

492
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,880
People who can't distinguish
Money Challenges...

493
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,450
from personal relationships...

494
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,220
might find me suspicious.

495
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,619
Personally, it was frustrating
and didn't make sense that...

496
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,859
they were suspecting me
based on my behaviors outside the games.

497
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,630
- So...
- So this is my point.

498
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,900
I don't want to be involved
in this kind of emotional conversation.

499
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,200
- That's all.
- This is emotionally draining.

500
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,299
We had another incident like this
right after we decided not to.

501
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,109
So it's exhausting for me and all.

502
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,210
It started with the Expression Link.

503
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,539
So for 3 to 4 days,

504
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,880
people suspected me
because I kept contact...

505
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,619
with Dong Min's team.

506
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,549
The pent-up frustration...

507
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,049
exploded.

508
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,819
I was tired.

509
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,089
I don't know what to do.

510
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,829
We have too many internal conflicts.

511
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Gosh, Eon Kyu.

512
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,940
Let's play by ourselves
when we get the game.

513
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,369
Why don't we do that for real...

514
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
whether or not we lose?

515
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,339
On the team,

516
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,380
each member has...

517
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,480
so much stress from various aspects.

518
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,880
So there isn't anything I can do.

519
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,619
At this point...

520
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't know. I'm exhausted.

521
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,359
I didn't want to do anything.

522
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,559
We went to Remaining and talked about...

523
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,960
how we should stick together.

524
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,569
"We shouldn't fight.
An internal conflict will be our doom."

525
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,569
Although we had that conversation,

526
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,069
an internal conflict surfaced.

527
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:47,670
"I'm just going to play alone."

528
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,309
I made that announcement
since I had a mental breakdown.

529
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:52,839
I think it's because of me.

530
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,549
It occurred to me that the problem was
my presence in the team.

531
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,650
To go that far...

532
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,049
It was so stressful.
I struggled emotionally.

533
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,529
My goodness.

534
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,269
I think I understand you more.

535
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,029
I don't know.

536
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
My goodness.

537
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,809
(Xitsuh, Steve Yea, Kim Min A)

538
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:25,609
The team is dissolved.

539
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
What?

540
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,410
Let's compete individually now.

541
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,079
Why are you dissolving the team?

542
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,849
I'm sick and tired of this.

543
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,720
I'll play alone or with someone else...

544
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
and die if it comes to that.

545
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,259
I can't do politics. I quit.

546
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,390
I declare that I quit.

547
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,200
It was the biggest bomb.

548
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
That meant there was
only the Jang Dong Min Alliance.

549
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,099
The opposition party was gone.

550
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,200
There was only one party.

551
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,369
I was like, "How could this happen?"

552
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,569
It was like agreeing
to pass around a bomb.

553
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,180
It sounded like he was suggesting...

554
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,910
that we begin worrying about
sucking up to Dong Min's team...

555
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,779
and competing for a later elimination.

556
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,220
- Are we breaking up?
- Yes. We're breaking up for real.

557
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,990
Eon Kyu, Hye Seon, and you exploded.

558
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,420
I can't stand that.

559
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,829
I think it'll be better
to go our separate ways.

560
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,759
I'm serious about it.

561
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,529
I'm having a mental breakdown.

562
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,200
I decided on my path.

563
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,069
If Eon Kyu leaves the team,

564
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm compete alone or with him.

565
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,869
I'll be the bottom player often.

566
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,369
I'll kill off everyone at the Deathmatch
and move my way up.

567
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,410
What does it mean
that the team got dissolved?

568
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,809
(Hong Jin Ho Alliance gathers around.)

569
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,779
I hate wasting my emotions needlessly.

570
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,119
Due to the continuous internal conflicts,

571
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,720
I've been getting aggravated.

572
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,559
I held on to the team...

573
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,660
because I wanted to win.

574
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,660
It was a matter
of how much I could endure.

575
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,799
I can't endure it any longer.

576
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,900
Dong Min's team...

577
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
had the perfect strategy in a sense.

578
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,869
To break up the team,

579
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:01,240
they planted an unsteady member like me.

580
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,609
The fact that their strategy worked
made me upset...

581
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,109
and disappointed.

582
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,009
I'm simply letting go.

583
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,650
That's it.

584
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,490
The team got dissolved.

585
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,859
We got dissolved.

586
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,460
Gosh, was my effort useless again?

587
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,799
For goodness' sake.

588
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,269
- Why aren't you guys doing anything?
- Dong Min.

589
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
Let's keep it neat and make a deal.

590
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,039
- Let's get it over with.
- Let's make a deal.

591
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,539
We won't steal from the safe box.

592
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,480
Instead, give 200,000 dollars.

593
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Did you say 200,000 dollars?

594
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,349
You can take it out of the safe box.

595
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,019
The new funds won't be generated...

596
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,750
if we don't open...

597
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,779
the safe box.

598
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,619
You know the rules, right?

599
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,589
So there's a mission, right?

600
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,160
When we raided the Paradise,

601
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,559
we opened the safe box with a hammer
and got caught.

602
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,329
The hammer left traumatic memories.

603
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,529
That was why we begged for 50,000 dollars.

604
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,569
But we could continue with this.

605
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:05,640
Money kept getting generated.

606
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,240
"When you guys come back,"

607
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,569
"give us 150,000 dollars."

608
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,910
That was Team Mansion's deal.

609
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,839
People who were here before us did that.

610
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,150
I don't know about that.

611
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,019
It was a deal with us.

612
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,750
- It doesn't apply anymore.
- No.

613
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,190
You can't ask me to uphold...

614
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,960
the deal of the past.

615
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,460
That's the deal of the past members.
However,

616
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,329
we have no intention
to have a physical fight...

617
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,500
or something like that.

618
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,930
That was why we put up a defense.

619
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,769
That defense is a way to open up...

620
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:40,869
a conversation.

621
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,640
If we can find the middle ground,

622
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,210
we'll agree to it.

623
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:49,450
The two of you are the key members, right?

624
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,150
Let's talk.

625
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,019
- All right. Let's talk.
- Okay.

626
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,259
If only two of you can have the funds...

627
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,259
If only two of you can have the funds
instead of sharing,

628
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,829
how much do each of you want?

629
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,130
I'm sure we'll share.

630
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,430
- The optimal situation...
- No.

631
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,430
- We were thinking 75,000 dollars...
- Listen.

632
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,839
- because...
- Listen.

633
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,400
If you guys don't touch it, it's over.

634
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,670
- That's right.
- Right?

635
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,640
Those people want to take...

636
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,339
the funds that came to be...

637
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,710
because of you guys.

638
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,509
- Right.
- Right?

639
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,650
When I look at it,

640
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,779
I don't understand.

641
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,650
In any case, funds will give you power...

642
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,650
later on.

643
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,089
So that's...

644
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,619
the key of the deal.

645
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,730
You want the funds to go...

646
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,130
to your own team members...

647
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,430
- as well as...
- We...

648
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,829
the two of us.

649
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:41,930
That's right.

650
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,730
We put up the barricade all day long...

651
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,339
because we didn't know
when you guys would come.

652
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,200
They sat there all day long.

653
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,670
I need to give them 20,000 dollars each.

654
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,210
If we get 120,000 dollars,

655
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,880
we can give the 2 of you 180,000 dollars.

656
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,079
- It's that or nothing.
- We understand.

657
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,079
We'll go...

658
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,380
and tell them about the deal.

659
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,950
Shall we go and talk?

660
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,950
- Okay.
- All right.

661
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,660
We had a deal.

662
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,190
We received a suggestion.

663
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,690
They'll give us 180,000 dollars.

664
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,329
But there won't be any more raids.

665
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,460
But the thing is...

666
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,299
You know, right?

667
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,630
What?

668
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,329
At this rate, we'll fail.

669
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,039
Let's hurry up with the deal.

670
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,500
- What about 180,000 dollars?
- You guys can do that...

671
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,509
- and keep the money.
- So we receive that much.

672
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,640
But Dong Min wants us to take more.

673
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,410
- Take more.
- He doesn't want you to give us more.

674
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,309
- I don't need it.
- To be honest... Okay.

675
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,650
- Hurry up.
- We'll complete the deal.

676
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,779
That's okay.

677
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,880
Compared to making the funds go to zero,

678
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,450
it was more beneficial...

679
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,789
to have 10,000 dollars more
than the other team.

680
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,789
So we agreed to the deal.

681
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,319
Shall we go and open it?

682
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,329
- Yes.
- Okay.

683
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,440
(They open the safe box on the 3rd floor.)

684
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,339
Let's take 50,000 dollars each
and go downstairs.

685
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,670
Okay.

686
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,410
The atmosphere is bad,
so let's go this way.

687
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,380
It's money.

688
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,950
Easy money.

689
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,049
- Hurry up and open.
- You guys worked hard.

690
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:07,279
We'll just enjoy the money.

691
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,380
Did you make a deal?

692
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,789
If we hadn't made the deal,

693
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,089
we would've been forced
to do this for three days.

694
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,690
So we made a deal.

695
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,529
(150,000 dollars
from the 3rd floor's safe box)

696
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,430
Of course.

697
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,029
A peaceful war is the best.

698
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,730
That's right.

699
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,869
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your hard work.

700
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:27,869
How gentle.

701
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Be happy.

702
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,970
Don't touch the money.
We'll set up the defense line here.

703
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,240
(The total amount of looted money:
300,000 dollars)

704
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,710
The loot is over.

705
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,410
Please gather at the Main Hall.

706
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,349
Please distribute the acquired money...

707
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,519
freely...

708
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,750
and enter the voting room
to make a deposit.

709
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,619
Steve, here you go.

710
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,289
Easy money.

711
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,329
(A delivery accident)

712
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,299
Here.

713
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,099
I keep losing money during delivery.

714
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,970
- During the first loot...
- Hye Seon.

715
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,670
Shall I bow?

716
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,700
Come here.

717
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,740
All right. Go ahead and bow.

718
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,210
Why are you giving me money?

719
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:06,109
It's a farewell gift.

720
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
That's so funny.

721
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,549
Eon Kyu, we'll give you 10,000 dollars.

722
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,549
No.

723
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,650
It's really okay.

724
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,349
- It's a farewell gift.
- Won't you accept it?

725
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,819
Then I won't say no.

726
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,890
Why don't we give Jin Ho 1,000 dollars?

727
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,019
I won't... What?

728
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,230
- You said you didn't need any money.
- How much do you have?

729
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,230
I won't say no.

730
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,430
Gosh, thank you.

731
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,700
Chungju-Man,
will you deposit 50,000 dollars?

732
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,799
Yes.

733
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,210
- Xitsuh, will you deposit 50,000 dollars?
- Yes.

734
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:42,480
(Steve, Hye Seon, Eon Kyu, and Jin Ho
deposit 20,000 dollars each.)

735
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,450
Heo Seong Beom,
will you deposit 20,000 dollars?

736
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,480
Yes.

737
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,920
(Dong Min, Min A, MJ, Yurisa, and Acau...)

738
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,650
(deposit 20,000 dollars each.)

739
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,690
(The current status of the private funds)

740
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,660
(Jang Dong Min, Acau, Kim Min A,
MJ Kim, Heo Seong Beom, Yurisa,)

741
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,289
(Hong Jin Ho, Choi Hye Seon, Chungju-Man,
Xitsuh, Joo Eon Kyu, Steve Yea)

742
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,930
Please gather at the Main Hall.

743
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,970
Today's Money Challenge is
an individual match.

744
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,369
- Good.
- The winner...

745
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,940
of the Money Challenge...

746
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,309
will receive private funds
of 20,000 dollars...

747
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:13,140
and two Immunity Passes.

748
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:14,880
- Two?
- One of them...

749
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,950
can be transferred to another player.

750
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,549
Today, a total of three player
will participate in the Deathmatch.

751
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,390
Two players will be eliminated.

752
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,559
There is a new announcement
regarding elimination.

753
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,789
This morning, an Evil Spirit...

754
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,960
selected one elimination candidate.

755
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,670
- It must be an eliminated player.
- An Evil Spirit?

756
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,140
Today, the two bottom players
of the Money Challenge...

757
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,210
and the one selected player
will go to the Deathmatch.

758
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,480
But if the player who was selected
by the Evil Spirit becomes...

759
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,549
the winner,

760
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,849
the Evil Spirit...

761
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,890
will switch places...

762
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,589
with the elimination candidate
who ranked higher.

763
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,789
If the selected elimination candidate
fails to become the winner,

764
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,460
he or she will go to the Deathmatch
instead of the elimination candidate...

765
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,059
who ranked higher.

766
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,569
- The Evil Spirit is among us.
- The Evil Spirit is among us.

767
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,900
Isn't it too much?

768
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,440
The Evil Spirit will choose someone
he or she wants to eliminate.

769
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,869
Is there anyone in here...

770
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,509
who gets that much hatred?

771
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,609
All players, please enter the voting room
one at a time...

772
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,109
and check if you're
an elimination candidate.

773
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,549
There's a player who's the Evil Spirit?

774
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,589
Did they plant the Evil Spirit?

775
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,890
It's scary.

776
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,190
There's a player who's the Evil Spirit?

777
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,930
I guess the Evil Spirit already selected
am elimination candidate.

778
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,259
No way.

779
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,490
It must be Jin Ho.

780
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,759
- Me?
- Yes.

781
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,460
No, it isn't me.

782
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,170
Was this player always the Evil Spirit?

783
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,440
If the selected elimination candidate
fails to win... What was it?

784
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
If the player
the Evil Spirit selected wins,

785
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,039
- the Evil Spirit goes to the Deathmatch.
- Yes.

786
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,250
If the player
the Evil Spirit selected fails to win,

787
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,150
he or she will switch places...

788
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,079
with the elimination candidate
who has a better score.

789
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:02,990
The bottom player will still go
to the Deathmatch.

790
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,690
But the player with a higher score...

791
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,119
- might survive.
- Yes.

792
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,730
We're checking if we got selected
by the Evil Spirit, right?

793
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,730
Yes.

794
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,430
Xitsuh,

795
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,109
you haven't been selected
as an elimination candidate.

796
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Thank you.

797
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,740
Kim Min A, you haven't been selected...

798
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,309
as an elimination candidate.

799
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,579
You haven't been selected...

800
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:33,279
(The players take turns to check.)

801
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,690
(Yurisa and Choi Hye Seon...)

802
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,859
(head over to the voting room.)

803
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,960
Choi Hye Seon...

804
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:48,660
Yurisa, you...

805
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:51,029
You...

806
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,670
have been selected.

807
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,269
You will be exempt from elimination...

808
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,480
only if you win today.

809
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,360
So the Evil Spirit...

810
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,559
will select someone
who doesn't have much chance of winning.

811
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,099
Gina was selected yesterday...

812
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,500
- for the same reason.
- That's right.

813
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,670
If the selected player wins,

814
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,599
- he or she will go to the Deathmatch.
- That's right.

815
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,840
I get it now.

816
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,099
I didn't know why Gina was selected.

817
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,409
We should watch carefully.

818
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,440
Yesterday, the Evil Spirit chose...

819
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,610
Hye Seon. No, it came out wrong.

820
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,679
- Gina.
- Gina.

821
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,210
Gina.

822
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Who is it?

823
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,349
There must be someone who's grinning.

824
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:47,460
The Evil Spirit must have...

825
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,829
- his or her penalty.
- Right.

826
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,530
There's no way
he or she has only the good skills.

827
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,730
Perhaps...

828
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,530
he or she needs to pretend to doze off.

829
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,199
What was that?

830
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:00,699
- He or she...
- You weren't asleep.

831
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,369
needs to pretend to doze off?

832
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,409
He'll channel a spirit.

833
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:07,940
I'll go first. I'm drowsy.

834
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,949
(Glancing over)

835
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,489
You know...

836
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,889
What did I tell you?

837
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:24,929
There's someone
who had to make a selection yesterday.

838
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,929
(Steve Yea heads over to the voting room.)

839
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,769
You know what I mean, right? I told you.

840
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:32,800
I don't know.

841
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,369
You know,

842
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,409
even the player
who was selected as an Evil Spirit...

843
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,610
doesn't know who the other ones are.

844
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,710
So it'll be hard to communicate
with the others...

845
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,840
and exchange signs.

846
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,150
Let's say I talk to someone
since I believe that he or she wasn't...

847
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,449
an Evil Spirit.

848
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
If he or she is an Evil Spirit,

849
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,119
I'll get eliminated right away.

850
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,690
See? He's taking a long time.

851
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,860
He took a long time yesterday as well.

852
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,349
Today's Money Challenge will be revealed.

853
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,860
Today's Money Challenge is...

854
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,329
Try 13.

855
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,599
Try 13 will be an individual match
of 12 players.

856
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,269
On the set game board,

857
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,969
each player must negotiate
with the neighboring players...

858
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,139
and make a number that's less than 13.

859
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,309
There will be a total of five rounds.

860
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,179
When Round One begins, each player...

861
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,710
will pick his or her box at random.

862
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,849
After negotiating...

863
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,079
with the neighboring players,

864
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,349
each player will select
a number from 1 to 9...

865
00:36:58,489 --> 00:36:59,789
and submit it in secret.

866
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,460
If his or her submitted number...

867
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,860
and the neighboring players'
submitted numbers...

868
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,130
make a sum...

869
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,059
of less than 13,

870
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,070
the player will receive the points...

871
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,400
that is the multiplication
of the number on the box...

872
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,639
and the submitted number.

873
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,139
If the sum exceeds 13,

874
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:18,710
the player will lose the points...

875
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,909
that is the multiplication
of the number on the box...

876
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,210
and the submitted number.

877
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,909
After each round,

878
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,019
the players who acquired points...

879
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,420
and the player at the very bottom
will be revealed.

880
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,090
From Round Two onward,
the player who placed last...

881
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,159
in the previous round
will assign the boxes.

882
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,559
After five rounds,

883
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:38,130
the player with the highest score...

884
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,130
will win.

885
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,159
It's simple, but complicated.

886
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,829
- The box...
- The number you have, and...

887
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,329
There must be a number
that's written on the box.

888
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,039
The multiplied amount
will be added to the score.

889
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,510
If the sum exceeds 13,

890
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,340
the multiplied amount
will be subtracted from the score.

891
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,340
It's best to keep it close to 13.

892
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,849
With the neighboring players...
Let's say my number is nine.

893
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,550
What's your number?

894
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,320
It's five.

895
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,650
I don't think it'll work.
My number is nine.

896
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,019
Let me start over. My number is three.

897
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,559
Then it works.

898
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,360
Let's say my number is actually five.

899
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,789
- Then you'll be ruined.
- Yes.

900
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,760
You know, it's dangerous.

901
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,599
How will you trust other players
and reveal your number first?

902
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,440
- It's a game of trust.
- It's a game of trust.

903
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,809
The player who placed last...

904
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,570
will arrange the boxes after the round.

905
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,579
You're right.

906
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,840
Even the player who placed last...

907
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,150
will have power...

908
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,610
- in the next round.
- The most amount of power.

909
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,219
The rankings will change continuously.

910
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,380
You're right.

911
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,750
All players will have...

912
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,449
a strategy meeting for 30 minutes.

913
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,119
I think an Evil Spirit
could've picked you.

914
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:43,960
Why? It isn't me.

915
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,230
The Evil Spirits would make two choices.

916
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,900
Number one, the weakest player.

917
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,070
Number two, the wilted one
among the weak players.

918
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,840
- Hye Seon.
- Yes?

919
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,639
Must you win today?

920
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,440
Are you crying internally?

921
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,239
Must you win?

922
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
Must you win?

923
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,550
I think it's Dong Min.

924
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,219
The Evil Spirit?

925
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,960
He made a verbal blunder.

926
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
What did he say?

927
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,760
He chose Gina yesterday...

928
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,929
- and me today.
- Okay.

929
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,960
Dong Min kept staring at me.

930
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,829
"Yesterday,
the Evil Spirit chose Hye Seon."

931
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:24,300
Then he looked at me and said,
"No, I meant Gina."

932
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,269
So I realized that it was Dong Min.

933
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,969
(Right after the rules regarding
the Evil Spirits were announced)

934
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:29,969
Hye Seon.

935
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,539
- No, that came out wrong.
- Gina.

936
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:33,539
Gina.

937
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,510
Why did he pick you? What was his reason?

938
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,849
- You guys aren't on bad terms.
- If I win,

939
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:38,980
he'll become an elimination candidate.

940
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,420
We'll try to save you.

941
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:44,150
- Do you have the heart to win?
- Thank you.

942
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,389
I can rank in the middle.

943
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,590
That'll be useless.

944
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,289
I know. Ranking in the middle
will be meaningless.

945
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:50,659
What's your strategy for that?

946
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,090
I'll keep choosing a safe number...

947
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,130
and going to a safe box.

948
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,400
Or I'll mess things up...

949
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,369
if the neighboring players
don't cooperate.

950
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,869
That team is bound to have the winner.

951
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,039
It's advantageous to have more numbers.

952
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,170
It's advantageous to have more members.

953
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,409
We don't know if the winner will come
from that team. Do you know why?

954
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,670
We have more lunatics.

955
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,510
- We can put it on our foreheads.
- We can compete for the last place.

956
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:11,050
- We can put a 9 on our foreheads.
- It's 9.

957
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,480
"I want the first place
to get assigned to a neighboring box."

958
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
We can do that.

959
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,349
We can put a nine on our foreheads.

960
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
Hye Seon, just you wait.

961
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,159
- We'll gather members for the team.
- Thank you.

962
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,159
It's nine.

963
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
That's so funny.

964
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,699
Give me a cigarette.

965
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,530
- Do you have a lighter?
- A cigarette.

966
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,329
- A cigarette.
- Let's smoke.

967
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,699
Hurry over. It's an emergency.

968
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,539
I talked to Chungju-man hurriedly
because I was worried...

969
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,210
that he was picked by an Evil Spirit.

970
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,539
But he denied it.

971
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,679
I didn't get picked.

972
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,010
Hye Seon seemed like the next likely one,

973
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,050
so I went over and asked.
She said it was her.

974
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,150
- She said Dong Min made a verbal blunder.
- What?

975
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,489
"Yesterday,
the Evil Spirit chose Hye Seon."

976
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,420
- "No."
- "Gina."

977
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,489
"It was Gina."

978
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,760
It was a slip of the tongue.

979
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,389
No. Hye Seon was chosen by an Evil Spirit.

980
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,130
There was no way he got confused.

981
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,329
There was no way he got confused
about who was chosen.

982
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,469
It's just impossible.

983
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:06,769
I don't how everyone will play,

984
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,610
but it's my intention...

985
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,610
to make Hye Seon the winner.

986
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,409
Such foul players need to be identified
and dealt with...

987
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:16,409
as soon as possible.

988
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,679
If the player who was chosen
by an Evil Spirit wins,

989
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,780
the Evil Spirit will go to the Deathmatch.

990
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,519
"How can I make Hye Seon the winner..."

991
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,860
"and send the Evil Spirit
to the Deathmatch?"

992
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,190
In my mind,

993
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,230
Dong Min seems to be an Evil Spirit.

994
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,860
"How can I catch him and drag him down?"

995
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,869
That thought filled my head.

996
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:39,170
I'll take down the Evil Spirit.

997
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,570
How does one do that?

998
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,639
- What?
- How does one take down the Evil Spirit?

999
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,809
By making the selected player the winner.

1000
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,210
- It won't be easy.
- What?

1001
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,210
It won't be easy.

1002
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,949
Steve, do you want to win?

1003
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,619
Then just catch the Evil Spirit.

1004
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,960
It'll be fun.

1005
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,289
(They form an alliance
to take down the Evil Spirit.)

1006
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,190
We can come up with ways...

1007
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,190
to make Hye Seon the winner.

1008
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,860
But what we know for sure is...

1009
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,400
that we need many allies.

1010
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,500
We don't have enough people.

1011
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,199
We need someone who will disrupt,
someone who will win points,

1012
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,800
- and someone who will attract attacks.
- Yes.

1013
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,110
We need to show minus 27 in Round 1.

1014
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,880
They'll think, "This punk is serious."

1015
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Really?

1016
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,480
- "This punk actually chose nine."
- You're insane.

1017
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,079
I'll write a big nine.

1018
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:28,179
Will you carry it around?

1019
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,019
- You're a lunatic.
- That's so funny.

1020
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:32,019
You're a lunatic.

1021
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,219
"Xitsuh, what will you submit?"

1022
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,360
(Showing)

1023
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,960
I won't say more.

1024
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
We need to...

1025
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,199
- We need to keep them on their toes.
- Yes.

1026
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:45,369
What?

1027
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,699
(Jang Dong Min Alliance
calls over Jin Ho and Eon Kyu.)

1028
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,139
While this strategy is important, we...

1029
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,079
What was it called? A witch?

1030
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,050
- An Evil Spirit.
- We need to...

1031
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,579
Dong Min must be crazy about it.

1032
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,980
- I see.
- We need to find it.

1033
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,179
- I want to find it too.
- Otherwise,

1034
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,949
we'll keep getting played tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

1035
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,989
It began yesterday, right?

1036
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,119
His behaviors changed the most.

1037
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,760
I think he became
an Evil Spirit yesterday.

1038
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,699
That's how it is with people
who are bad at the Mafia Game.

1039
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,130
When they become a mafia,
they become timid.

1040
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,969
Here's what I think. I don't know...

1041
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,170
who got selected today,

1042
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,269
but we need to catch this Evil Spirit.

1043
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,869
Here's the thing.

1044
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:29,239
Unless you ask me to do something big
that could affect my score in the game,

1045
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,880
I'll completely cooperate
to catch the Evil Spirit.

1046
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,280
No. When you say...

1047
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,519
you're going to cooperate
to catch the Evil Spirit,

1048
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:40,760
you should be able to figure out who it is
and make that person take last place.

1049
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,090
But I don't know
how you're going to catch them.

1050
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,329
It means if you think you know who it is,

1051
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,460
you should persuade others to choose them
as an elimination candidate.

1052
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,969
That person should take last place.
Got it?

1053
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,199
Even the Evil Spirit can't avoid
taking last place.

1054
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,610
What do we do about the Evil Spirit?

1055
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:58,739
We should make the person chosen
by the Evil Spirit take first place.

1056
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,179
We must make the Evil Spirit
take last place to catch them.

1057
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,750
We should make them take last place.

1058
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,150
- We should.
- Do you know what I mean?

1059
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,150
(The two alliances have different
strategies to find the Evil Spirit.)

1060
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,420
- It's funny.
- What?

1061
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:12,889
- It's funny.
- I know.

1062
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,960
- I'm taking the middle ground.
- Yes.

1063
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:17,630
- I went back and forth between them.
- Yes.

1064
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,730
But...

1065
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,099
Isn't it suspicious?

1066
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,500
Both of their strategies sound good.

1067
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,500
I honestly don't know.

1068
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,369
I just know both of their strategies
sound good.

1069
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:29,639
Anyway, it's a confusing situation.

1070
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,880
What's important is that it turned out
that the Evil Spirit was among us...

1071
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,110
and we should find them.

1072
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,179
Someone is suspicious on our team as well.

1073
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,280
Steve Yea made a ridiculous mistake.

1074
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:43,349
(Steve Yea didn't share a decisive clue.)

1075
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,320
We also had conflicts with Hye Seon.

1076
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,159
I think the Evil Spirit might be
on our team.

1077
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,230
It could be Hye Seon, Steve Yea,

1078
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,900
or someone else.

1079
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,000
I think I should put the puzzle pieces
together to figure out something.

1080
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,239
The game is important too,

1081
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,179
but I agree it's very important...

1082
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:08,010
to catch the Evil Spirit.

1083
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,780
Since we want to catch them quickly,

1084
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,050
- we'd like to share information...
- Okay.

1085
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:15,780
- little by little,
- Okay.

1086
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,949
- as long as it doesn't affect the game.
- Okay.

1087
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,989
What Team Dong Min doesn't know...

1088
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,429
is that one of them confessed
that they're the Evil Spirit.

1089
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,489
- Right?
- Yes.

1090
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,929
I wonder if telling them about it...

1091
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,730
will affect the game or not.

1092
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:30,599
I think it'll be all right
to say that much.

1093
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,699
Do you think so?

1094
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,139
Or how about this?

1095
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,739
- We need them all.
- Yes.

1096
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,309
And they might need us too.

1097
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:43,409
So I thought of writing a number
below average...

1098
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:45,909
- and saying I can help everyone...
- Yes.

1099
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,420
- so anyone could join in.
- Yes.

1100
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,690
I'm thinking about this.

1101
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:53,360
What's the biggest number
that can be neutral?

1102
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,860
We can think about the number of cases
when three numbers are adjacent,

1103
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,559
two numbers are adjacent,
and one number is adjacent.

1104
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,429
There would be a maximum number
you can submit in each case.

1105
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:06,300
If we find the optimum number...

1106
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,469
and say that we'll submit it,

1107
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:10,639
it'll work, right?

1108
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,380
I think it's very unlikely
to take last place if we do that.

1109
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,449
- Right?
- Yes. It's a good idea.

1110
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,679
This is more doable than I thought.
Is it not?

1111
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,519
- Why?
- Do you want to talk to everyone?

1112
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,960
- Take a seat here for a moment.
- Okay.

1113
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,260
Let me tell you something.

1114
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,929
One of them said...

1115
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,559
they were chosen by the Evil Spirit.

1116
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,170
I think it's Hye Seon.

1117
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:38,929
I don't know about that.

1118
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:41,639
I guess there's no penalty
for revealing it.

1119
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:43,670
- Is that so?
- Hye Seon looked miserable.

1120
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,710
I think it's Hye Seon.

1121
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,880
(The elimination candidate
has been narrowed down to Hye Seon.)

1122
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,010
Round One will now begin.

1123
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:54,219
Please enter the voting room
one at a time...

1124
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,449
and draw the letter for your box.

1125
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,559
Yurisa, please choose a card.

1126
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,199
Yurisa, you've been assigned to K.

1127
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,869
MJ Kim, you've been assigned to C.

1128
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:18,639
Steve Yea, you've been assigned to A.

1129
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,480
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

1130
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,510
I'll choose this.

1131
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,079
(Xitsuh has been assigned to B.)

1132
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,110
Thank you.

1133
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:28,449
(Chungju-Man has been assigned to E.)

1134
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:29,480
Thank you.

1135
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,389
Kim Min A, you've been assigned to J.

1136
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:34,260
I'll choose the top right.

1137
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,460
(Heo Seong Beom has been assigned to G.)

1138
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,260
(Choi Hye Seon has been assigned to D.)

1139
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,329
This one.

1140
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,570
(Acau has been assigned to L.)

1141
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,300
You've been assigned to I.

1142
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:50,809
(Jang Dong Min has been assigned to F.)

1143
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,780
(Lastly, Joo Eon Kyu
has been assigned to H.)

1144
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,280
(Round 1: Steve Yea, Xitsuh, MJ Kim,
Choi Hye Seon, Chungju-Man, Jang Dong Min)

1145
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,380
(Heo Seong Beom, Joo Eon Kyu, Hong Jin Ho,
Kim Min A, Yurisa, Acau)

1146
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,710
Please enter the voting room
in 30 minutes from now...

1147
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:00,579
and submit a number.

1148
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,519
Let's see.

1149
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,019
- Are you F?
- Yes.

1150
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,489
That's nice.

1151
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,019
I can support you.

1152
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,030
Acau, Dong Min, Seong Beom, and MJ
are adjacent to each other.

1153
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,289
Acau is here?

1154
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,900
Okay.

1155
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,159
The other team...

1156
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,630
- This is interesting.
- It's interesting.

1157
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,840
They're talking
about the same thing we said,

1158
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,639
and they think it's me.

1159
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:25,809
The six of them think...

1160
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,239
- I'm the Evil Spirit.
- Yes.

1161
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,679
- And we think Steve is the Evil Spirit.
- Yes.

1162
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,380
Why do they think that way?

1163
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,349
- I don't know. I haven't heard.
- You haven't?

1164
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:37,750
It's 6 versus 6 today as always.

1165
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,789
- Oh, my.
- That's right.

1166
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:43,789
So today, we should keep them in check
starting from Round One.

1167
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:48,630
Look. Seong Beom
can get the maximum number...

1168
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,300
among us.

1169
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:53,969
And you need Eon Kyu's cooperation.

1170
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:57,739
But he likely has a connection
with Jin Ho...

1171
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,940
because they're adjacent to each other.

1172
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,309
MJ, you should talk with Hye Seon.

1173
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:04,809
I don't think she'll tell me.

1174
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,650
She has no choice.

1175
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,719
She needs to talk with you
to receive points.

1176
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,019
- Right.
- Yes.

1177
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,090
Now, Xitsuh is left.

1178
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,760
Who is in charge of Xitsuh?

1179
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,489
- It's the two.
- Okay.

1180
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:19,659
- But she doesn't want to talk.
- Right.

1181
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,760
She doesn't lie, but she wouldn't talk.

1182
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:24,400
She said she would submit nine,
but I think she lied.

1183
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,170
- Everyone is crazy.
- So she wouldn't tell us?

1184
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,599
How about Chungju-Man?

1185
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,070
He also...

1186
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,070
Chungju-Man as well?

1187
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:31,469
Are they acting crazy again?

1188
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,909
- Didn't he say he would talk?
- Is he willing to talk?

1189
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:36,179
- We need to know his number then.
- Yes.

1190
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,849
- Try talking to him.
- Okay.

1191
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:41,320
I'll go to Eon Kyu.

1192
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,019
- Sorry? Yes. Go to him.
- I'll go to Eon Kyu.

1193
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,789
- Seong Beom.
- Yes. What number are you thinking of?

1194
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:49,260
I'm always ready to cooperate.

1195
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,329
- You are?
- Yes.

1196
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,559
I have a times three,

1197
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,599
so I do want to earn a lot of points
this time.

1198
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,199
I could help you
when we're adjacent to each other later.

1199
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,869
- What do you think?
- You don't have to worry about that.

1200
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,539
- Jin Ho.
- Yes?

1201
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:02,869
The three of us...

1202
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:05,940
Actually, it's easy for Eon Kyu
to cooperate now,

1203
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,139
but I'll choose a fixed number
because I adjoin Chungju-Man and Min A.

1204
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,409
- Okay. That'd be better.
- I can't negotiate with both of them.

1205
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,579
I'll choose number two.

1206
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,619
I can't write a number that is too big.

1207
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:17,750
Right.

1208
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,289
I'll write 6 or 7.

1209
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:22,989
You can write 3 or 4 then. How about that?

1210
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,289
I'll choose three then.

1211
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:28,000
- That'll be enough.
- Yes.

1212
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,130
- It's not a good spot.
- What number will you choose?

1213
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,530
- Sorry?
- Can you give me a rough number?

1214
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,099
What are you going to submit, Hye Seon?

1215
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,440
- Sorry?
- What are you going to submit?

1216
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:35,800
Can you give me a rough number?

1217
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,809
Is that for real?

1218
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,880
- And...
- They're going to submit nines.

1219
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:44,880
Hey, we're "Galaxy Express 999."

1220
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,179
When Steve said he would submit nine,
I said I would do that too.

1221
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:49,119
I decided to follow him.

1222
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,150
I intend to submit a nine.

1223
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:52,789
- I should think about it.
- Jin Ho said...

1224
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,460
- he wanted to earn about three points.
- Okay.

1225
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,030
- I also want to earn about three points.
- Okay.

1226
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,630
If we divide the points equally,

1227
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,559
- we could earn points easily...
- Yes.

1228
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,329
- in Round One.
- What number do you want me to write?

1229
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,840
I'm not going to say a specific number.
I'm just asking your opinion.

1230
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:08,969
- I'll cooperate for now.
- Okay.

1231
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,639
- So it means you won't choose that.
- Sorry?

1232
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,380
It means you won't submit a nine
at least, right?

1233
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,409
What number are you going to write?

1234
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,079
I don't know. Hold on.

1235
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,349
The sum of your number,
Seong Beom's number, and my number...

1236
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,619
- must be 13 or less.
- Yes.

1237
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:26,690
- I'll submit a 4.
- Will you submit a 4?

1238
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,829
If you're going to write four,

1239
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,400
we could find a way.

1240
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,699
Or I could write three.

1241
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,800
Hurry up and ask Xitsuh...

1242
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,510
what he's going to write.

1243
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,340
My strategy for today
is to go against Dong Min.

1244
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:57,090
Hong Jin Ho, please submit your number.

1245
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:58,849
I...

1246
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,559
(Hong Jin Ho submits 2.)

1247
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:04,630
I'll submit two.

1248
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,929
Whether I believe Dong Min or not,

1249
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,800
I agree we should catch the Evil Spirit.

1250
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:11,300
So I wanted to find the Evil Spirit...

1251
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,570
by making Hye Seon take first place.

1252
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,369
(Joo Eon Kyu submits 3.)

1253
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,940
(Hong Jin Ho and Joo Eon Kyu
submitted small numbers.)

1254
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,679
- Did you meet Hye Seon?
- Yes.

1255
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:24,980
- What number is she going to submit?
- She didn't tell me.

1256
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,719
For the next round... Gosh.

1257
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:29,480
We should play mind games now.

1258
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:31,489
We should play mind games.

1259
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:35,090
If we play mind games, we can win.

1260
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,090
It's not that difficult
to calculate the numbers.

1261
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:40,929
The next round is our last chance.

1262
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,059
Can you close the door, please?

1263
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:43,730
Please close it.

1264
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,869
In Round Two, we all must lie
about the numbers we're going to submit.

1265
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,980
If we don't betray them all in Round Two,

1266
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,340
- the game will be over.
- Yes.

1267
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:57,650
It's too late to do something
in Round Three.

1268
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,179
Fortunately, we're fine in Round One...

1269
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,780
due to Seong Beom's position.

1270
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,920
(Heo Seong Beom is assigned to times 3.)

1271
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,030
So let's help Seong Beom.

1272
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,989
Should I write a one then?

1273
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,329
You should.

1274
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,460
If you and I submit ones,

1275
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,429
eight is the maximum number.

1276
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,570
Then in this round,

1277
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,469
you'll earn 24 points.

1278
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:25,639
I could take the damage later on.

1279
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,039
- Twenty-four points is big.
- Yes. It's very high.

1280
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,880
You should earn this much at least...

1281
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,179
- to cover for the others later.
- Yes.

1282
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:34,380
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1283
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,050
Seong Beom was in a nice position.

1284
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:41,219
He has a chance
to earn a lot of points this time.

1285
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:43,460
I decided to submit a one...

1286
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,659
so that he could earn
the highest point possible.

1287
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,400
Heo Seong Beom, please submit your number.

1288
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,010
I'll submit eight.

1289
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,610
(Jang Dong Min submits 1.)

1290
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:04,110
(MJ Kim submits 1.)

1291
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,849
(Yurisa submits 9.)

1292
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:11,050
(Kim Min A submits 2.)

1293
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:13,619
I'll choose nine.

1294
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,690
(Acau submits 9.)

1295
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,929
We'll let them win this round.

1296
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,400
We don't know if they will draw
their swords in the next round...

1297
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:25,969
or in the round after the next one.

1298
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,800
We'll figure it out when we see
their positions in the next round.

1299
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:32,440
Round One has ended.

1300
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,280
The players who earned points
in Round One...

1301
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:38,079
are MJ Kim,

1302
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,150
Heo Seong Beom,

1303
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,420
Joo Eon Kyu,

1304
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:44,619
Kim Min A,

1305
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,860
Yurisa,

1306
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,289
Acau,

1307
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,230
Steve Yea,

1308
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,860
and Xitsuh.

1309
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,900
(Choi Hye Seon and Chungju-Man
couldn't earn points.)

1310
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:01,800
Based on the accumulated points so far,
the player in 12th place is...

1311
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:04,769
Chungju-Man.

1312
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,309
Hye Seon couldn't earn points?

1313
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:11,949
- She didn't.
- Idiot.

1314
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:13,250
What happened?

1315
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,050
How did it happen?

1316
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,289
- Why did she do that?
- Well...

1317
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,489
If Hye Seon couldn't earn points
even when MJ wrote one...

1318
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,619
Eight.

1319
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,860
- It means Xitsuh also wrote a big number.
- Did he write four?

1320
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,059
Xitsuh and Hye Seon
didn't communicate well.

1321
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:32,969
(Did Xitsuh and Hye Seon
not communicate well?)

1322
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:36,369
Based on the accumulated points so far,
the player in 12th place is...

1323
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:37,909
Chungju-Man.

1324
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:40,039
- It's done, right?
- It's over.

1325
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,380
Chungju-Man,
please enter the voting room...

1326
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,650
and arrange the positions for Round Two.

1327
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,420
We can win just with 5 people.
We can make anyone take 1st place.

1328
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,519
Our strategy
is to take first place and last place.

1329
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:51,750
- Right.
- First and last places on the same team.

1330
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,489
If the two of us take turns and take hits,

1331
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:56,159
we can make any result we want
in every round.

1332
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:57,829
The first round is the most important...

1333
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,559
in Try 13...

1334
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:02,829
because the person in last place...

1335
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,630
can assign people to each position.

1336
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,769
If one of my teammates
could take last place,

1337
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:11,139
we could make Hye Seon take first place
by surrounding her,

1338
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,980
and disturb the opponents next to them.

1339
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,679
As for our strategy,
how many points MJ will earn is important.

1340
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,750
What number did she say?

1341
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,050
- She said she would submit three, but...
- Okay.

1342
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,449
You should submit 1. We can submit 1 then.

1343
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,050
No. We should make sure.

1344
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,789
- Are we going with nine?
- We should make sure.

1345
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:29,619
- And...
- Okay. Let's go with 9, 1, 1, and 3.

1346
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,090
When you submit nine,

1347
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,099
one is the only number
Hye Seon can submit.

1348
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,329
Okay.

1349
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,769
But wait.

1350
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,329
- The point difference is...
- We shouldn't go with nine.

1351
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,900
- Seven is...
- No. I mean we shouldn't go with one.

1352
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,300
Because you need a negative number.
We almost ruined it.

1353
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:46,070
Hye Seon should submit
a bigger low number then.

1354
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,480
- Hye Seon, you should submit three.
- Yes.

1355
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,409
- You understand our plan, right?
- Yes.

1356
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:51,949
- Jin Ho will submit two.
- Yes.

1357
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,719
The rest of them don't matter anyway.

1358
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:56,820
- So start with negative points.
- Okay.

1359
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,719
But if you earn 27 points
in 4 rounds each,

1360
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,190
- it'll be 108 points in total.
- Yes.

1361
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:04,289
We'll keep reallocating the opponents.
So we'll give 27 points...

1362
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,230
We shouldn't let 1 of them earn 27 points.

1363
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,300
- Yes.
- Okay. I got it.

1364
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,530
(Xitsuh submits 1.)

1365
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:14,900
(Chungju-Man submits 9.)

1366
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,639
(Steve Yea submits 9.)

1367
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,139
Three.

1368
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:21,179
(Choi Hye Seon submits 3.)

1369
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,139
(Round 1)

1370
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,880
(Steve: 9, Xitsuh: 2, MJ: 2,
Hye Seon: Minus 9, Chungju-Man: Minus 18)

1371
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,579
(Dong Min: Minus 2, Seong Beom: 24,
Eon Kyu: 6, Jin Ho: Minus 6)

1372
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:27,579
(Min A: 4, Yurisa: 9, Acau: 9)

1373
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,489
Hye Seon should take first place
to catch the Evil Spirit.

1374
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,320
I thought we would be able...

1375
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,760
to make anyone take first place
in this game.

1376
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:39,829
I took last place in Round One.

1377
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,329
That was...

1378
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,730
when it was over.

1379
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,070
I didn't have to play more. I could sleep.

1380
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,269
- Chungju-Man,
- Yes?

1381
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:50,809
please arrange the positions
for Round Two.

1382
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:53,010
Okay. I'll start from A.

1383
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,150
Yurisa and MJ Kim.

1384
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,150
(Chungju-Man has finished
the arrangement.)

1385
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,690
Just remember this. Keep submitting one.

1386
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:05,920
He wants us to submit one.

1387
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:08,059
- Both of us?
- Yes.

1388
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,690
It's getting ambiguous.

1389
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,000
He asked both of us to submit one.

1390
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,369
- Yes.
- Right?

1391
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,369
Yes.

1392
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:19,929
We should tell Team Dong Min...

1393
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,070
that we're going to write one.

1394
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:24,610
Right?

1395
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,139
Then they'll be able to guess.

1396
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:28,610
Guess what?

1397
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:30,679
Their plan.

1398
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,309
We agreed to let them know.

1399
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,619
That's true.

1400
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,050
The position arrangement for Round Two
has been completed.

1401
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:42,559
The position arrangement for Round Two
will be revealed at the Main Hall.

1402
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:50,929
(The players check the positions.)

1403
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,739
(Round 2: Acau, Joo Eon Kyu,
Steve Yea, Choi Hye Seon, Hong Jin Ho)

1404
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:57,469
(Heo Seong Beom, Jang Dong Min,
Xitsuh, Chungju-Man, Kim Min A,)

1405
00:58:57,469 --> 00:58:58,510
(Yurisa, MJ Kim)

1406
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:04,650
(Dong Min calls Jin Ho.)

1407
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,849
Look. In this round,

1408
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,650
- you earned negative points.
- Yes.

1409
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,820
Tell them
you want to earn a lot of points.

1410
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,389
- Just try it.
- Okay.

1411
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,500
I'm 100 percent sure they will oppose it.

1412
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,599
See how they react.

1413
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,969
This one has nine points.

1414
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,440
- Who?
- Steve.

1415
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,739
Steve is here.

1416
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,179
Steve has nine points.

1417
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,809
He has the highest point among them.

1418
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,750
But he will want to earn more points...

1419
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,750
even though he has no reason to do so.

1420
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,719
(Chungju-Man Alliance's strategy
is to make Hye Seon take 1st place.)

1421
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,420
That's why I'm frustrated.

1422
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:45,989
I haven't watched the game.

1423
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,489
- Steve acts like he's cooperating...
- Yes.

1424
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,360
and trying to help Hye Seon
take first place,

1425
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,860
but it's not his strategy.

1426
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,460
But Xitsuh is calculating everything.
Why would he do that?

1427
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,030
My goodness.
He's not smart enough to do that.

1428
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,340
He kept telling me to keep Steve in check.

1429
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,110
"Jin Ho, you idiot,
you still don't get it?"

1430
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,639
He kept telling me off.

1431
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,409
He kept telling me that,

1432
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,280
but I wasn't convinced.

1433
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,380
"Why is he doing this?"

1434
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,219
It's getting annoying.

1435
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:18,349
- Why?
- What?

1436
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:20,219
- The gist of what Dong Min said is this.
- Okay.

1437
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:22,460
If they want Hye Seon to take first place,

1438
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,389
- they should help her earn points.
- Yes.

1439
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,389
- But they've been keeping Steve in check.
- Yes.

1440
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,659
Steve has nine points.

1441
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,130
- He has the highest point.
- Yes.

1442
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,300
He's claiming
that it doesn't make sense...

1443
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,699
and making Hye Seon take first place
isn't their strategy.

1444
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:37,639
He basically said...

1445
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,070
I didn't think it through.

1446
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,179
- I think you can just write one.
- Sorry?

1447
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,440
Just write one.

1448
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,179
Dong Min said Steve was the Evil Spirit.

1449
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,949
But if that were true,

1450
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,019
they...

1451
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:56,090
can't stick to the strategy.

1452
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,530
Steve is participating in the strategy...

1453
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,099
to make Hye Seon first place,

1454
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:02,900
and the strategy is working.

1455
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,630
It means...

1456
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:07,769
Steve is not the Evil Spirit.

1457
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,670
Why does he claim that he is?

1458
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,579
So you're going to help Hye Seon
earn 27 points this time, right?

1459
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,179
Both of us submitted nine.

1460
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,809
(As soon as Round 2 began,)

1461
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,250
(Xitsuh...)

1462
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,420
(and Chungju-Man submitted 9.)

1463
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:28,789
If you guys submit 1,
we're going to tell Hye Seon to submit 9.

1464
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:30,690
So did Steve submit one?

1465
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,230
He said he could submit two,

1466
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,829
so we told him to go on if he wanted.

1467
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,960
There'll be no more variables...

1468
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,199
if you all submit one...

1469
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,800
and we submit nine.

1470
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,969
I already submitted nine.

1471
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,110
So did I.

1472
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:49,739
It'll be over
as long as you don't change your mind.

1473
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,210
Okay. I'm totally fine with that plan.

1474
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,349
Here...

1475
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,289
- Can I talk for a moment?
- Sure.

1476
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,760
I didn't know what numbers they had from
the beginning. I didn't see mine either.

1477
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:02,860
Because even if I knew,
we could tell them.

1478
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,889
After you told me
it wasn't their strategy,

1479
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,590
I looked into it.

1480
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,659
This time, Hye Seon is in the center,

1481
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:10,800
surrounded by me, Eon Kyu, and Steve.

1482
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,599
Hye Seon will write 9,
Eon Kyu and I will submit 1,

1483
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,099
- and Steve will submit 1 or 2.
- Okay.

1484
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,969
So that Hye Seon can earn 27 points.

1485
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:19,570
They'll keep helping her earn points
from now on.

1486
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,840
- It's their plan.
- Okay.

1487
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,940
If it doesn't work, we'll join you.

1488
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,179
- Okay?
- So if they were lying...

1489
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:26,510
The moment we find out they were lying,
we'll join you.

1490
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,079
(The neutral team will join Dong Min
if they lied about their strategy.)

1491
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:29,849
- Okay.
- It doesn't matter anyway.

1492
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:31,889
You're going to join us
the moment you find out it was a lie?

1493
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:33,989
Yes. We'll join you right away.

1494
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,489
Actually, I suspected
Dong Min might be the Evil Spirit.

1495
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:39,460
Steve was also suspicious.

1496
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,329
But I'd be able to figure it out
through Hye Seon.

1497
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:44,269
So I wanted
to make her first place quickly...

1498
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,199
to figure out who the Evil Spirit was.

1499
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,239
That's the only thought I had.

1500
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:50,639
Maybe Hye Seon lied that she was chosen.

1501
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,469
If that's the case...

1502
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,010
Do you think she told us a lie like that?

1503
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,550
It might be their strategy.

1504
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,309
We can catch the Evil Spirit
if we do this.

1505
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:02,079
- We can.
- We can.

1506
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,550
So...

1507
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:05,420
We can,

1508
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,219
but they'll have a Deathmatch.

1509
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,289
They won't be eliminated right away.

1510
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,190
We want to catch the Evil Spirit.

1511
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,960
It means we want to eliminate them,
but we want to figure out who that is.

1512
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,059
That's what we all agreed to.

1513
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:19,730
- So...
- But...

1514
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,070
there are 2 Evil Spirits, not 1.

1515
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:23,769
- What?
- What?

1516
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,170
There are 2 Evil Spirits, not 1.

1517
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,269
Does that mean
both of them will have a Deathmatch?

1518
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,409
You heard the rule earlier.

1519
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,679
If the person
chosen by the Evil Spirits...

1520
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,550
takes first place,

1521
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,860
the Evil Spirit with lower points
will have a Deathmatch.

1522
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:43,860
And the Evil Spirit with higher points
will stay.

1523
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,989
No. The person with the lowest point...

1524
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,329
will stay,

1525
01:03:50,329 --> 01:03:52,730
and the one with the second-lowest point
and the Evil Spirit will switch places.

1526
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:54,670
It baffled me.

1527
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:57,070
The way he said it
felt a little different...

1528
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,070
from how he usually
explained his strategy.

1529
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:02,840
Judging from his behavior,
he seemed a little nervous too.

1530
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,579
We should help Seong Beom again this time.

1531
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:08,079
(Dong Min Alliance
is going to help Seong Beom again.)

1532
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,420
We should help him.

1533
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,420
And they...

1534
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,659
I think Chungju-Man chose this position...

1535
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:18,630
to write a big number like nine
with Xitsuh...

1536
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,699
so that he earns minus 27 points again...

1537
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:22,460
and take last place.

1538
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,469
This lunatic could do that.

1539
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:27,070
- So he'll keep taking damage?
- He'll keep doing that...

1540
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,940
to help them earn points.

1541
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,239
It means...

1542
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,840
they'll get to arrange the positions
in every round...

1543
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,780
if Chungju-Man keeps taking last place.

1544
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,980
(Dong Min Alliance was going
to make a big move in Round 2.)

1545
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,150
What are we doing?

1546
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,050
(But they let the other team take the lead
in Round 1.)

1547
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,219
This is hopeless.

1548
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,349
I didn't expect them...

1549
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,420
to make just one person...

1550
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:50,829
lose points.

1551
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,230
You can make anyone take first place
in this game...

1552
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,900
because the person in last place
can arrange the positions.

1553
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,429
If Chungju-Man gives up earning points
and takes last place,

1554
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,369
there's nothing we can do.

1555
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:02,940
Hye Seon...

1556
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,909
will probably take first place.

1557
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,210
Anyway...

1558
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,079
I think it's over.

1559
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,809
- The game is over.
- We were defeated.

1560
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,420
- I'll also submit one then.
- What are you going to do?

1561
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,519
(The players disperse to submit numbers.)

1562
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,050
- Me?
- What are you going to do?

1563
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,389
We should still help Seong Beom...

1564
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:20,690
- earn points.
- Yes.

1565
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,389
- Then nine?
- Just in case.

1566
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:24,289
- Please write 3.
- I'll write 3.

1567
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:25,460
You won't still take last place.

1568
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,360
A strategy to take last place?

1569
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,130
I've done it too.

1570
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,400
I'll go for it and come back.

1571
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,699
It's to make everyone win.

1572
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,340
That's the strategy you can use
when you can say that.

1573
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,840
Are you confident?

1574
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:41,880
Are you confident?

1575
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,980
Why are you doing such a crazy thing?

1576
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,150
Acau, please submit your number.

1577
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,219
I'll go with nine.

1578
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:52,690
(Acau submits 9.)

1579
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,590
(Kim Min A submits 1.)

1580
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,559
(Yurisa submits 9.)

1581
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,329
I'll go with nine.

1582
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:00,860
I'll choose three.

1583
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,130
(MJ Kim submits 3.)

1584
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,630
Can I go in?

1585
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:13,440
Jang Dong Min, please submit your number.

1586
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,039
When they explained the rules...

1587
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,409
earlier,

1588
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,880
did they say there were two Evil Spirits?

1589
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:23,150
No, they didn't.

1590
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,250
- They didn't?
- No.

1591
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:25,650
- They didn't?
- No.

1592
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:28,659
My goodness.

1593
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:30,860
I'm doomed. Darn it.

1594
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,059
(Last night)

1595
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,670
(After the power holder
divided them into teams)

1596
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,210
Please enter the voting room
one at a time...

1597
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:46,170
and check your team.

1598
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:56,219
Jang Dong Min, please check your team.

1599
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:00,519
Please wait for a moment.

1600
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,960
Why?

1601
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:04,929
What's this?

1602
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,800
Dong Min, open the card and check it.

1603
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,179
I've become an Evil Spirit?

1604
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:37,360
You've become an Evil Spirit
according to the rules of Bloody Game.

1605
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,559
Visit the Purgatory, as marked on the map,

1606
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,500
within an hour to check the new rules.

1607
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,500
(He received a map as well as a card.)

1608
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,969
Gosh, what's this?

1609
01:07:51,409 --> 01:07:52,409
"Pool."

1610
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,380
"Second floor."

1611
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:01,780
(Somewhere in the Paradise)

1612
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:09,860
(There's a hidden space.)

1613
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:11,659
"Danger?"

1614
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,889
What should I do here again?

1615
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,929
Am I given a new mission?

1616
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:21,140
You are free to move around
until the next announcement.

1617
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,010
(While the players...)

1618
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,739
(are resting,)

1619
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:34,750
(Dong Min visits Danger.)

1620
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,159
It's done.

1621
01:08:58,939 --> 01:08:59,970
Wait.

1622
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:01,939
Was there a place like this?

1623
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,710
Darn it. This is unbelievable.

1624
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:41,279
(Purgatory)

1625
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:45,250
Another Evil Spirit hasn't entered yet.

1626
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,890
- I'll give you a new mission...
- "Evil Spirit?"

1627
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,920
and the rule book when everyone is here.

1628
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:52,229
What?

1629
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,359
Darn it.

1630
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:57,359
Darn it.

1631
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,600
What? Why did they attach a talisman
on my picture?

1632
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:14,680
(Talismans are attached
on the picture of some players.)

1633
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:17,149
It's this punk.

1634
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,760
(Opening)

1635
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,670
I knew it.

1636
01:10:34,369 --> 01:10:35,439
What is it?

1637
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:40,739
(Steve Yea was also given
the Evil Spirit Mission.)

1638
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,680
What?

1639
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:52,949
No wonder why it took so long.

1640
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,630
Steve Yea, who received negative energy by
the resentful eliminated players the most,

1641
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:02,529
- What?
- and Jang Dong Min,

1642
01:11:02,529 --> 01:11:05,399
one of the players who received
the second most negative energy,

1643
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:08,340
and was cursed by the lowest-ranked player
in the recent Money Challenge...

1644
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,840
have become Evil Spirits.

1645
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,449
(Rules for Evil Spirits)

1646
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,050
(You're an Evil Spirit in Bloody Game 3.)

1647
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,689
(Try to survive without getting caught.)

1648
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:29,189
(Basic rules)

1649
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:31,060
The player who receives
the most resentful negative energy...

1650
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,930
by the eliminated players...

1651
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,090
becomes an Evil Spirit.

1652
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,760
If they receive
the same amount of negative energy,

1653
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:40,100
the player who receives negative energy
most recently becomes an Evil Spirit.

1654
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:43,899
If more than one person is eliminated,
they can enter the Purgatory...

1655
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,270
in the order of their rankings from the
Money Challenge to send negative energy.

1656
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:47,340
(They can enter the Purgatory
in the order of their rankings.)

1657
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:57,479
(Kim Young Kwang is the first player
who was eliminated.)

1658
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,319
(Kim Kyung Ran is the second player
who was eliminated.)

1659
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:07,760
(Those who were eliminated
visited the Purgatory first.)

1660
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,460
What's this?

1661
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:15,369
Kim Young Kwang has become the first
player to be eliminated from Bloody Game.

1662
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,109
You can choose
one player you resent the most...

1663
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:20,609
to send negative energy to.

1664
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:24,680
Choose the card of the player you want to
send negative energy to and stick a knife.

1665
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:31,989
I thought he would say goodbye at least,

1666
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:33,619
but he didn't do it earlier.

1667
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,859
(Kim Young Kwang sends negative energy
to Steve Yea.)

1668
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:42,300
I was on the same team
with Steve and Xitsuh.

1669
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,170
But he didn't even say goodbye
and went to the other side.

1670
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,869
I was actually upset.

1671
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,069
He didn't make eye contact at all.

1672
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,640
Try to survive. Good luck.

1673
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,279
(Kim Kyung Ran chooses Steve Yea.)

1674
01:13:00,449 --> 01:13:02,680
Steve who hates me for no reason.

1675
01:13:02,949 --> 01:13:06,890
When someone hates you for no reason,
you'll be upset, right?

1676
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,189
Dong Min.

1677
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,460
This knife is for you.

1678
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:20,069
(Si Yoon chooses Hong Jin Ho.)

1679
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,470
I sent negative energy to Jin Ho...

1680
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:25,310
who was the spy.

1681
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,079
Liar.

1682
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,319
(Lim Hyun Seo chooses Yurisa.)

1683
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,789
I resent Yurisa only.

1684
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,859
Because she lied to my team directly.

1685
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,430
(Another Evil Spirit will be created
according to Pani Bottle's choice.)

1686
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,960
Which punk should I choose?

1687
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,729
Let me see.

1688
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:00,340
(Pani Bottle chooses Jang Dong Min.)

1689
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,539
I chose Dong Min...

1690
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:05,310
because I wanted someone to catch him.

1691
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,189
Your survival game in the show has ended.

1692
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,289
Please leave Bloody Game immediately.

1693
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:16,819
(The eliminated players left
after sending negative energy.)

1694
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:20,060
The house is so weird.

1695
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,930
This is supposed to be a Paradise.

1696
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,930
But there's a place that looks like
a passageway leading to the underworld.

1697
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,600
It got me chills.

1698
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,970
Do your best...

1699
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:32,970
not to be resented by others.

1700
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,909
That's what I've learned.

1701
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,119
I'll give you a new mission
and the rule book.

1702
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:49,590
What's this?

1703
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,960
Someone sent negative energy to me.
What does it say? I can't see.

1704
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:55,729
Evil Spirits automatically become
elimination candidates...

1705
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,600
for the Money Challenge.

1706
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:58,970
So what happens?

1707
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,130
What? Why do we automatically become
elimination candidates?

1708
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:04,500
Does it make sense?

1709
01:15:06,939 --> 01:15:09,039
To avoid becoming
an elimination candidate,

1710
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:11,750
the Evil Spirit must send negative energy
to one player...

1711
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,109
to replace the existing curse
in the Purgatory.

1712
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:15,279
The player who receives
the negative energy...

1713
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:17,449
becomes the elimination candidate
instead of the Evil Spirit.

1714
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,050
So I can just choose one?

1715
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,119
It says we need to bring their item.

1716
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:27,430
The Evil Spirit should steal an item
from the chosen player...

1717
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,659
and offer it as a sacrifice
in the Purgatory...

1718
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,329
to send negative energy to them.

1719
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:34,840
(Offer it as a sacrifice in the Purgatory
to send negative energy to them.)

1720
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:45,250
If the player who received negative energy
wins the Money Challenge,

1721
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:48,279
the curse is lifted.

1722
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,949
They're no longer
an elimination candidate,

1723
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,119
and the Evil Spirit
becomes an elimination candidate.

1724
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:58,090
Our team has a plan this time.

1725
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,489
So it's hard to lose.

1726
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,500
- Let's go with Gina then.
- And...

1727
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,430
Basically,

1728
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,930
your team should lose today.

1729
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,300
- Yes. I know.
- Your team should lose.

1730
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,300
Okay. You need to bring her item.

1731
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:12,770
- Shall I bring it now?
- Yes, you should bring it now.

1732
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,069
- Shall I do it?
- Then you should do this.

1733
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,140
You should do it, then.

1734
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,010
Since I can freely move around here,

1735
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:20,550
- Will you do it?
- I'll bring Gina's...

1736
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,979
here and finish it.

1737
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:22,979
Okay.

1738
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:24,250
- They said one of us can do it.
- Okay.

1739
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,149
But you shouldn't pick someone else.

1740
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,220
- Of course, I won't.
- You know,

1741
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,289
we're a team.

1742
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:30,289
- Of course.
- Right.

1743
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,460
So you need to lose, no matter what.

1744
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:33,529
I'll get things done.

1745
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,899
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's get it.

1746
01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:38,270
Let's go.

1747
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:40,229
(The Evil Spirits' target is Lee Gina.)

1748
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,670
- You get out first.
- All right.

1749
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:02,960
What an idiot.

1750
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,399
I thought it'd be better.

1751
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,529
The fact Steve is the Evil Spirit...

1752
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,270
was a relief to me.

1753
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,439
Today's...

1754
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,340
Deathmatch...

1755
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,310
will be performed...

1756
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:28,479
by these.

1757
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:32,989
Gosh.

1758
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:36,119
(The Evil Spirit gets started.)

1759
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,159
- What are you doing?
- I came for a pen,

1760
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:41,659
but it's not here.

1761
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,359
I'm here for a pen and a notebook.

1762
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,800
The girls' room is nice.

1763
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,630
- It's cool, isn't it?
- It is.

1764
01:17:48,739 --> 01:17:49,970
(Looking around)

1765
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:05,949
Min A.

1766
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:10,489
(Rummaging)

1767
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,729
(He acquired an item he needed.)

1768
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:15,329
(Checking out if there are other people)

1769
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,640
(Leaving as if nothing happened)

1770
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,640
Where is she?

1771
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,109
I made a fuss by myself,

1772
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,810
but when I entered...

1773
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,680
You look happy.
It seems things are perfect for you.

1774
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:34,979
You left me here. What shall I do?

1775
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:43,890
All right.

1776
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,390
This is Gina's personal item.

1777
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,310
Gina.

1778
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,069
For today's mission,

1779
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:03,380
offer your heart.

1780
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,789
(The Evil Spirits sent
negative energy to Lee Gina.)

1781
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:18,529
(The first sacrificial player
is Lee Gina.)

1782
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:20,789
(And Criminal Memory,
a team match, begins.)

1783
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:23,229
Did anyone see material on something
related to a video?

1784
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,529
Someone saw evidence that could be
the answer...

1785
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:26,529
for this question.

1786
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:28,029
I didn't miss anything.

1787
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,340
Was there anything related to
April 28, 2017?

1788
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,909
(Steve Ye didn't share the hint.)

1789
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,210
I didn't see that at all.

1790
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,539
I think you're acting.

1791
01:19:36,909 --> 01:19:37,979
No, seriously.

1792
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,750
I didn't see that at all.

1793
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:41,579
Actually, there's no way I didn't see it.

1794
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,050
If I didn't see it,

1795
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,189
it means I intended it.

1796
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:49,960
That was the only answer I could give
in that situation.

1797
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,090
The video showed someone pushed.

1798
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:54,529
(Heo Seong Beom caught a clue
from the video.)

1799
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:56,229
Does it say anything...

1800
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:57,229
about pushing someone to fall?

1801
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:59,000
Didn't you share it?

1802
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,430
Why?

1803
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:02,399
- I did. What is it?
- I know.

1804
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,939
In the video that she filmed,

1805
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:05,739
someone was pushing another
off of the rooftop.

1806
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,970
What video are you talking about?

1807
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,350
I didn't see that at all.

1808
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,279
They wear the same clothes...

1809
01:20:15,579 --> 01:20:16,779
and she is blonde.

1810
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:18,789
She's Claire. Claire pushes someone...

1811
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,220
to fall.

1812
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,289
Steve must have thought...

1813
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:23,960
that he wouldn't be caught.

1814
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,390
It's because in playing games so far,

1815
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:28,859
they never shared information on games...

1816
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:30,399
and had a conversation...

1817
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:31,699
with other teams.

1818
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,800
He must have thought
he could secretly commit...

1819
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:36,869
perfect crime, I suppose.

1820
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:41,579
I worked so hard to create this scenario.

1821
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:44,039
I planned to expose what he was up to,

1822
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,149
and whether Steve was confused or lying,

1823
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,819
I wanted his act to attract attention.

1824
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,489
So I pushed Seong Beom
to talk about it more saying,

1825
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:54,859
"What are you doing? Go and tell them!"

1826
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,119
Keep asking as you did earlier.

1827
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,760
Xitsuh is with him now.

1828
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,060
And Xitsuh is sensitive
about those things.

1829
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,060
So keep talking about it.

1830
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,300
This is the strategy I planned.

1831
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,829
What were you doing? Didn't you see it?

1832
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:05,829
Are you a spy?

1833
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:07,199
Only with that much bait,

1834
01:21:07,869 --> 01:21:09,699
since Jin Ho always...

1835
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,569
holds someone responsible,

1836
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:13,909
he'd say, "Steve, you should go today."

1837
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,479
Anyway, you missed an important point.

1838
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,750
You should go and come back winning.

1839
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:22,180
I knew that was what he'd say.

1840
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:26,220
Then an Evil Spirit
would kill another Evil Spirit.

1841
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:29,920
That's a terrific scenario
I could create, I thought.

1842
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,890
The final eliminated player
of Bloody Game...

1843
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:34,729
is Lee Gina.

1844
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:35,960
(However, Lee Gian loses the Deathmatch.)

1845
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:38,600
Gosh, things got ruined.

1846
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,800
I'll work things out myself.

1847
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,840
Wait and see.

1848
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,810
I have a bigger picture in my mind,

1849
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:48,210
but Steve has no idea about it.

1850
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:52,510
(In the morning that day)

1851
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,689
Who will you pick?
We need to send negative energy.

1852
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,859
This is darn difficult.

1853
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:06,029
I don't know.

1854
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,659
Yurisa. She's the only one.

1855
01:22:08,659 --> 01:22:09,659
That's the best choice for us.

1856
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,100
Then I'll do it.

1857
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:16,899
(Jang Dong Min goes alone.)

1858
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:28,479
(Rummaging)

1859
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:29,579
Gosh.

1860
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,020
I'll take a sock only.

1861
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,760
I'll look like a freaking pervert
if they catch me.

1862
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:48,340
(He takes the item
for sending negative energy...)

1863
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,000
(and arrives at the Purgatory.)

1864
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,039
Steve.

1865
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:00,210
According to your opinion,

1866
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:02,819
Yurisa?

1867
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:05,819
Why would I pick Yurisa?

1868
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,520
You stupid soul.

1869
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:12,130
I told you we were playing
an individual match today.

1870
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,960
Yurisa is someone
who can aim for the final win.

1871
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:18,699
But today, as I see,
she should never win...

1872
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:21,300
so that you and I can survive.

1873
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,840
Therefore,

1874
01:23:23,369 --> 01:23:25,140
The one who can never win is...

1875
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:36,920
I'm sorry, Hye Seon.

1876
01:23:38,949 --> 01:23:39,989
Hye Seon.

1877
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,590
It's not "Single's Inferno" here.

1878
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,399
This is just purgatory!

1879
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:52,970
Get your act together.

1880
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,800
(Evil Spirit Jang Dong Min
sent negative energy to Choi Hye Seon.)

1881
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:02,310
(The second sacrificial player
is Choi Hye Seon.)

1882
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,409
Choi Hye Seon, you're selected
as an elimination candidate today.

1883
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,949
You can be ruled out
from an elimination candidate...

1884
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:14,119
only when you win today.

1885
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:23,329
I sent negative energy,

1886
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,100
but we're having
an individual match today.

1887
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:27,970
Yurisa has a possibility to win.

1888
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:28,970
Right.

1889
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,100
Then both of us get messed up.

1890
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,909
So I picked someone
who has no possibility to win,

1891
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:34,970
Hye Seon.

1892
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:38,079
But that doesn't make sense.

1893
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:40,310
We need to get rid of Yurisa.

1894
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:41,550
No. In our team,

1895
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,020
we never know who will take first place.

1896
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,319
Think about the game
we played the day before yesterday.

1897
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,760
What happens if we pick someone at random?

1898
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,060
Let's say it's Min A,
and she has the highest score?

1899
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,289
Then we only support her to win.

1900
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:54,630
But Dong Min, still,

1901
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:56,560
the possibility is one-sixth.

1902
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,560
We need to consider that.

1903
01:24:57,899 --> 01:24:59,600
In that logic, you're saying...

1904
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,399
you won't leave anyone in your team,
and that's nonsense.

1905
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,500
Let's do this, then.

1906
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,539
Tomorrow, we'll get rid of Seong Beom,

1907
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
and the day after tomorrow,
we'll get rid of Jin Ho.

1908
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,479
Promise this.

1909
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,510
I can't promise that.

1910
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,609
Then you're saying...

1911
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:13,409
you won't pick any of your closest ones.

1912
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:15,380
Who did you pick among your closest ones?

1913
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,920
- I can pick Jin Ho.
- Yesterday,

1914
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,079
you picked one as you like.

1915
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:21,619
- You said your team would never lose,
- I...

1916
01:25:21,619 --> 01:25:22,720
that's why we made such a choice.

1917
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,819
What are you saying?

1918
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:26,130
What are you saying?
You're being unreasonable.

1919
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:27,930
You're not listening to me now.

1920
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,100
No, what you said doesn't make sense.

1921
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,829
Do you know why I got rid of Gina?

1922
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,529
I don't know.

1923
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:34,800
- It has nothing to do with this.
- There's a reason I got rid of her.

1924
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:37,300
It doesn't matter.

1925
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:39,109
- It has nothing to do with this.
- Why not?

1926
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:40,770
I don't care whether she stays or not.

1927
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,840
Dong Min,
you shouldn't do things this way.

1928
01:25:42,909 --> 01:25:44,380
You shouldn't make an arbitrary decision.

1929
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,380
It doesn't make sense.

1930
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,149
He went there after reaching an agreement,

1931
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:49,619
but he picked someone else
all of a sudden.

1932
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,319
Then I could go there alone
and pick whom I want.

1933
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,789
It doesn't make sense.

1934
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,649
He didn't keep to what he said.

1935
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:55,890
I hate that.

1936
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,390
He just did as he liked.

1937
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,659
Then Dong Min, in my position,

1938
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:01,829
I'd want to pick someone in your team.

1939
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:02,829
Isn't that natural?

1940
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,300
That's true.

1941
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,399
Think about it.

1942
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,340
If I was going to pick one
by an arbitrary decision,

1943
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,439
I would have picked Seong Beom.

1944
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:12,970
It doesn't make sense.

1945
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,250
With him, I feel like
I'm talking to myself.

1946
01:26:19,949 --> 01:26:21,810
It's like talking to a wall.

1947
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:23,880
Gosh.

1948
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,420
I don't know. Gosh, things are messed up.

1949
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,859
When they explained the rules earlier,

1950
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:37,529
did they say there were two Evil Spirits?

1951
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,800
No, they didn't.

1952
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,699
- They didn't?
- No.

1953
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:41,699
No.

1954
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,399
My goodness.

1955
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,439
I'm doomed. Darn it.

1956
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:51,909
They didn't explain in the rules?

1957
01:26:53,949 --> 01:26:54,949
I heard it somewhere.

1958
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,380
But I heard it...

1959
01:26:57,149 --> 01:26:59,520
from the butler in the voting room.

1960
01:27:00,689 --> 01:27:03,090
(When he came to the voting room
about selecting the Evil Spirit)

1961
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,630
Quick. Say it now.

1962
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,390
If today's elimination candidate wins,

1963
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,800
between Steve Yea and you, Jang Dong Min,

1964
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,970
the Evil Spirit with the less
Money Challenge score...

1965
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,199
becomes an elimination candidate.

1966
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:17,039
Also, when Evil Spirits
have the same score,

1967
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,239
Steve Yea who received
more negative energy...

1968
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,369
becomes an elimination candidate,

1969
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:24,109
and if an Evil Spirit becomes a player
in the lowest ranking,

1970
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:25,310
he goes to the Deathmatch.

1971
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:35,020
(Jang Dong Min hurried not to get caught.)

1972
01:27:39,829 --> 01:27:41,659
I don't know about the condition
for an Evil Spirit.

1973
01:27:41,659 --> 01:27:43,000
I thought about it.

1974
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:45,100
There's not 1 Evil Spirit, but 2.

1975
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,170
- What?
- What?

1976
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:49,500
No, that can't be. Among the ones
with the lowest score...

1977
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,909
(Dong Min said
there were 2 Evil Spirits, by mistake.)

1978
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:03,850
All right.

1979
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,319
Darn it.

1980
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:12,789
Things are messed up. Darn it.

1981
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,430
Round Two has ended.

1982
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,100
The players who earned points
in Round Two are...

1983
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:23,470
Acau,

1984
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,170
Steve Yea,

1985
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,039
Choi Hye Seon,

1986
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,510
Heo Seong Beom,

1987
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,380
Yurisa,

1988
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,550
and MJ Kim.

1989
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:35,979
Based on the accumulated points so far,

1990
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:37,220
the player in 12th place is...

1991
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,449
Chungju-Man.

1992
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:42,819
(Chungju-Man, minus 45 points)

1993
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,489
Chungju-Man who has the lowest ranking
in Round Two...

1994
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,760
should assign the positions
for Round Three.

1995
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:49,760
He's so lucky.

1996
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:53,970
He seems to be someone
who has nothing to lose.

1997
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:56,399
He plays game with a detached manner
all the time.

1998
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,569
We kept saying...

1999
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:01,170
he was a wacko,

2000
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,380
but I didn't imagine him
to be that much of a wacko.

2001
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:18,420
I really wanted to have a win,
in the first place.

2002
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,060
Since I kept losing, I wanted to win.

2003
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:30,239
(Chungju-Man Alliance never had a win.)

2004
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,479
I wanted to win
and put in a lot of effort.

2005
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:38,310
I really wanted to win,

2006
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,909
but I guess I'm not competent enough.

2007
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:42,979
(He couldn't take a win
with his competence alone.)

2008
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:44,649
My team broke up.

2009
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,319
I thought, "Again?"

2010
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,489
That made me...

2011
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:52,960
so troubled.

2012
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:57,760
(The alliance he settled in
suddenly broke up.)

2013
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:01,869
What shall we do?

2014
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,140
What are we going to do?

2015
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:09,109
In this situation,
I couldn't see anything ahead.

2016
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:12,039
We only had to wait
to be eliminated one by one.

2017
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,649
I wanted to catch the player
who was the Evil Spirit.

2018
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:18,020
And I guessed it was Dong Min,
of everyone.

2019
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:19,350
So, the three of us thought...

2020
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,949
we should catch him and win.

2021
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,859
I thought I needed at least five people.

2022
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:27,189
So I focused on finding those five people.

2023
01:30:27,859 --> 01:30:30,359
And fortunately, we broke up today.

2024
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:32,130
As soon as we broke up,

2025
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:34,899
the situation turned out that
six people can't be united.

2026
01:30:34,899 --> 01:30:37,069
As Jin Ho stated...

2027
01:30:37,069 --> 01:30:38,640
he would stay neutral,

2028
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:40,270
and Eon Kyu in the same situation,

2029
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,640
I needed two justifications.

2030
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,579
One was to punish the Evil Spirit,

2031
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:47,010
and the other was
to make someone sacrifice.

2032
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,119
That would gather people, right?

2033
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:53,720
There's something I felt in Bloody Game.

2034
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,619
Without sacrificing yourself,
you cannot achieve anything.

2035
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,760
Someone should sacrifice.

2036
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,399
If I don't sacrifice, people won't gather.

2037
01:31:04,729 --> 01:31:05,729
If I don't do that,

2038
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:07,600
I can't win.

2039
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,399
And I didn't want to be
listless like that again.

2040
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:14,470
(Chungju-man posed himself
as the lowest position...)

2041
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:19,909
(and built his alliance again.)

2042
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:25,350
By expressing such a solid promise,

2043
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,550
I tried to secure
the number of people I needed.

2044
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:30,590
This is so funny.

2045
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,260
Why?

2046
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:37,029
Chungju-Man has all the power now.

2047
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:40,270
I told you we could catch the Evil Spirit.

2048
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:42,130
You earned 27 points, right?

2049
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:45,840
- That's great.
- Then I have 18 points now.

2050
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,340
The next round is for 45 points.

2051
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,239
I've made a calculation earlier.

2052
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:51,279
Even if we start from minus eight points,

2053
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,949
the final score is 99 points.

2054
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,220
And since we keep changing the locations,

2055
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,850
and for them, it's three times...

2056
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,420
and one member isn't fixed.

2057
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,949
- They can't catch up with us.
- They can't.

2058
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:03,390
- It won't happen.
- It's over for them.

2059
01:32:06,359 --> 01:32:09,159
Chungju-Man, please assign
the positions for Round Three.

2060
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:12,159
Acau for A, Jang Dong Min for B...

2061
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:23,840
The positions in Round Three
are revealed in the Main Hall.

2062
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:25,810
Are we having a notice?

2063
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,180
Please enter the voting room
in 30 minutes from now,

2064
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,250
and submit a number.

2065
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:35,789
What? It's changed.

2066
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,060
It's the same.
Only the positions are changed.

2067
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:40,489
No matter what, Hye Seon...

2068
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:42,630
will be surrounded by Eon Kyu,
Jin Ho, and Steve Yea.

2069
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:47,229
(Chungju-Man Alliance and
the Neutral Nation submit numbers soon.)

2070
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:49,170
Choi Hye Seon, please submit your number.

2071
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:51,869
(Choi Hye Seon submits 9.)

2072
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:54,369
(Hong Jin Ho submits 1.)

2073
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:55,369
It's one.

2074
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:57,539
(Joo Eon Kyu submits 1.)

2075
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,079
(Steve Yea submits 1.)

2076
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,180
(Chungju-Man submits 9.)

2077
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:05,619
(Xitsuh submits 9.)

2078
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:09,590
(Choi Hye Seon
confirms 27 additional points.)

2079
01:33:11,489 --> 01:33:13,029
There's no way to survive.

2080
01:33:14,729 --> 01:33:17,359
There's no way... Darn it.

2081
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,069
Steve clearly said,
"Let's put Hye Seon in first place."

2082
01:33:22,939 --> 01:33:24,539
That's...

2083
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,439
How annoying.

2084
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:30,310
In Round One, Steve...

2085
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,579
took nine points already.

2086
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:32,949
(Steve Yea: 9 points,
Jang Dong Min: minus 2 points)

2087
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:35,350
And I started from minus points.

2088
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,819
If Steve uses a defense strategy...

2089
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:40,649
and a strategy to mark me,

2090
01:33:41,289 --> 01:33:43,489
I can't win, whatever I do.

2091
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,890
When Steve used 9 points in Round 1...

2092
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:52,369
and made sneaky actions,

2093
01:33:52,369 --> 01:33:53,399
the game was over for him already.

2094
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,470
Steve, please check this arrangement.

2095
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,699
It's the same arrangement,
but I changed the names' locations.

2096
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,869
If Hye Seon takes first place,

2097
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,909
the Evil Spirit with fewer points...

2098
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:03,779
would go to the Deathmatch.

2099
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:06,250
So I hid my identity...

2100
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:08,550
and only focused on sending Dong Min
to the Deathmatch,

2101
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,579
not myself.

2102
01:34:09,579 --> 01:34:15,789
(Dong Min didn't earn points
as the points concentrated on Seong Beom.)

2103
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:18,489
For a box with a single person,

2104
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,090
I'll submit the number nine.

2105
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,699
As soon as the game began,

2106
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,729
I told them I'd submit nine...

2107
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:25,729
and I submitted nine first.

2108
01:34:25,729 --> 01:34:27,100
(Steve Yea: 11 points,
Jang Dong Min: minus 5 points)

2109
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,399
Darn it.

2110
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:31,439
Who's the Evil Spirit?

2111
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:33,140
We have no idea.

2112
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,109
- So I hope the game ends soon.
- I hope the numbers are open.

2113
01:34:35,109 --> 01:34:36,979
You haven't noticed yet?

2114
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,739
- What?
- You haven't noticed yet?

2115
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,180
I have no idea, seriously.

2116
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:42,250
I really don't know.

2117
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,649
It's nonsense
that you haven't noticed yet.

2118
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,880
Is that so?

2119
01:34:45,649 --> 01:34:47,390
How come that jerk targets me?

2120
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:49,420
Since Steve and I,

2121
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:51,260
the two of us became Evil Spirits,

2122
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:54,859
I knew we wouldn't be able
to live in union.

2123
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,729
In Bloody Game, Steve and I...

2124
01:34:57,729 --> 01:34:59,600
were playing another Bloody Game.

2125
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:02,739
Steve and I were playing two games.

2126
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,840
I can't stand it. I'll take that jerk...

2127
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:10,479
to the Deathmatch today.

2128
01:35:16,949 --> 01:35:19,050
Now I'll think about how I can take Steve.

2129
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:21,289
What shall I do?

2130
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,289
How can I kill him?

2131
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,630
The one in last place is Chungju-Man.

2132
01:35:34,569 --> 01:35:36,739
If Chungju-Man keeps using
the last place strategy...

2133
01:35:36,739 --> 01:35:40,039
and Xitsuh supports that,

2134
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:43,180
Hye Seon would take first place anyway.

2135
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,680
The result is fixed.

2136
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:48,449
I'm in a big trouble now.
In a situation like this,

2137
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:50,119
the only strategy I can use...

2138
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,920
Where's Chungju-Man?

2139
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,060
That's Chungju-Man.

2140
01:36:10,369 --> 01:36:12,170
Chungju-Man, can we talk for a minute?

2141
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,310
Will you keep your strategy the same?

2142
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:20,210
That's our position.

2143
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:22,050
- Okay. I get it. That's awesome.
- Yes.

2144
01:36:22,779 --> 01:36:25,350
Can I ask a favor...

2145
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,149
to you and Xitsuh?

2146
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:28,449
What is it?

2147
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:35,489
I'm not saying you should accept it.
I hope you can consider it...

2148
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:37,100
and I'd appreciate it
if you could accept it.

2149
01:36:37,729 --> 01:36:39,430
- You will go to the Deathmatch.
- Yes.

2150
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:43,069
Can you include one person I want...

2151
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,170
among those you're going to select?

2152
01:36:48,109 --> 01:36:49,939
- Which one do you want?
- Who is it?

2153
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:53,609
I want you to pick Steve.

2154
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:56,920
Then Steve,

2155
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,119
to survive,

2156
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:01,220
will venture all his fortune.

2157
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,159
And you will go up higher...

2158
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:06,859
that much.

2159
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:09,529
If he could predict the future,

2160
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,500
he should accept my suggestion.

2161
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,399
I can make someone in your team
spend money,

2162
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:16,770
and we'll use all our money anyway.

2163
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:19,939
For you, it's a way
to take an advantageous position.

2164
01:37:19,939 --> 01:37:23,609
If Steve becomes a candidate
for the Deathmatch,

2165
01:37:23,609 --> 01:37:27,880
with the situation I'm far ahead of him
in funding power,

2166
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:31,319
I can send Steve
to the Deathmatch, for sure.

2167
01:37:32,989 --> 01:37:34,149
I swear.

2168
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:37,220
Steve said he'd cooperate,

2169
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:39,020
and he asked me to give
the Immunity Pass instead.

2170
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,430
It's true.

2171
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:43,199
Steve.

2172
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,500
For the next round, with the arrangement,

2173
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,970
are you going to be all right
with one point?

2174
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:50,840
It's because you'll get minus two
in the next round.

2175
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,710
Your points will be minus two.

2176
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,979
I get it. I'll keep submitting one point.

2177
01:37:57,810 --> 01:38:00,609
I'll make Hye Seon win first place
regardless of the score.

2178
01:38:00,609 --> 01:38:03,220
- You just need to keep submitting one.
- No.

2179
01:38:04,619 --> 01:38:06,850
How about you give me
the Elimination Exemption Card?

2180
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:09,960
Let's say someone has
to be eliminated, like Dong Min.

2181
01:38:10,819 --> 01:38:13,529
You still have to choose
one more person to eliminate.

2182
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:16,800
I don't want to do it.

2183
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,529
Just in case.

2184
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:22,800
I'll tell Chungju-Man.

2185
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:24,199
No, tell Hye Seon.

2186
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,270
- I see.
- She's going to win first place anyway.

2187
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:30,439
Let's tell Hye Seon and get
the Elimination Exemption Card,

2188
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:31,779
so I can get some rest.

2189
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:34,710
We've agreed to give
the Elimination Exemption Card...

2190
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:37,750
to Steve...

2191
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:40,289
in exchange for one point from him.

2192
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:42,590
That means I'm the one.

2193
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,420
If you give me
the Elimination Exemption Card...

2194
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:47,689
and no one goes to the Deathmatch
under the new rule,

2195
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:48,960
then it means I'm the Evil Spirit.

2196
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:51,029
I can finally break free
from the false accusation.

2197
01:38:51,329 --> 01:38:53,399
- Oh, my gosh.
- I can play for another round.

2198
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,800
I won't be able to stop Hye Seon...

2199
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,539
from winning first place.

2200
01:38:57,539 --> 01:38:59,000
It's been that way since Round One.

2201
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:00,439
Instead of getting a good score,

2202
01:39:01,239 --> 01:39:03,640
I just needed to cooperate...

2203
01:39:03,939 --> 01:39:07,550
and play with whatever number
Xitsuh and Chungju-Man tell me to...

2204
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,079
in exchange
for the Elimination Exemption Card.

2205
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,479
That was his condition.

2206
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:16,119
We can't make this plan come true
if we lose even just one person.

2207
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:19,020
Shouldn't we give it to Xitsuh instead?

2208
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:21,130
The people making the biggest sacrifice...

2209
01:39:21,130 --> 01:39:24,560
to make Hye Seon win first place are...

2210
01:39:24,829 --> 01:39:27,029
Xitsuh and Chungju-Man.

2211
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:30,399
So if Hye Seon wins first place,

2212
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:33,470
then it's only natural to use...

2213
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:35,909
the Elimination Exemption Card on them.

2214
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,810
But darn it.

2215
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:41,310
Steve wasn't doing anything,

2216
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:44,020
yet why were they giving Steve...

2217
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,489
the Elimination Exemption Card
that they should've gotten instead?

2218
01:39:46,649 --> 01:39:48,220
I couldn't understand a thing.

2219
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,020
This is only fair
because you guys are risking your lives.

2220
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,289
What is Steve risking?

2221
01:39:53,829 --> 01:39:55,359
He's been trying to win points
since Round One.

2222
01:39:57,329 --> 01:39:58,600
You're right about that.

2223
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:01,430
He's been saving his own life
since Round One.

2224
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:02,800
This isn't a valid reason.

2225
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,970
You guys are the ones
who made Hye Seon win first place.

2226
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:08,270
Talk to Hye Seon to give it...

2227
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,579
to Xitsuh, not Steve.

2228
01:40:10,409 --> 01:40:12,239
Tell her it was you who put her there.

2229
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:15,180
That puts you in the bottom.

2230
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:18,319
Hye Seon has to listen to your opinion.

2231
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,550
In that case,

2232
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:23,260
I'll do everything I can...

2233
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,920
to help you guys starting tomorrow.

2234
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,899
From now on,

2235
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:37,470
I'll be able to help you guys out.

2236
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:41,340
This is the first time
I'm asking you a favor.

2237
01:40:41,609 --> 01:40:42,779
Yes.

2238
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:46,449
We'll think about that.

2239
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,079
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

2240
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:50,180
You guys should not
discuss this between yourselves...

2241
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:51,819
- but tell Hye Seon about this.
- Yes.

2242
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:53,449
- Then let me know.
- Okay.

2243
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,199
What did he say?

2244
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:16,210
Pretend like we're talking
about something serious.

2245
01:41:16,710 --> 01:41:17,979
Come on.

2246
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:19,239
The great Jang Dong Min...

2247
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:21,909
came and tried to persuade us,

2248
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:23,779
but it didn't make sense at all.

2249
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:25,250
He told us to pick Steve.

2250
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:28,189
We asked what he would do for us
in return if we pick Steve instead,

2251
01:41:28,189 --> 01:41:29,220
and he said he would be nice to us.

2252
01:41:30,989 --> 01:41:33,130
Be nice?

2253
01:41:33,489 --> 01:41:34,560
Everyone is an enemy.

2254
01:41:35,229 --> 01:41:37,229
I was actually surprised
because he had no logic.

2255
01:41:37,229 --> 01:41:40,300
I guess Dong Min was anxious.

2256
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:44,100
There's a 99 percent
that Dong Min is the Evil Spirit.

2257
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,640
Why?

2258
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:47,439
Because he's telling us to pick Steve.

2259
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:48,939
Is that what he said to you?

2260
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:50,180
Why did he say that?

2261
01:41:51,079 --> 01:41:52,579
I don't know. He just said
he was asking us a favor.

2262
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,180
He didn't explain why
but just asked us a favor.

2263
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:56,779
We didn't have a reason to pick him.

2264
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:59,149
The team that scattered
all over the place this morning...

2265
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:02,050
has gathered once again.

2266
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:05,560
You could say he's our teammate...

2267
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,829
who is following our strategy.

2268
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:08,760
Steve is an important player...

2269
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:10,560
both in our team and the other team...

2270
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,760
that's against Dong Min,
so I felt like we should protect him.

2271
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:16,270
I think Chungju-Man will repeat my words,
so let me tell you this right now.

2272
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:18,939
Dong Min told us not to give you
the Elimination Exemption Card.

2273
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:20,970
He was the kind of person...

2274
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:24,010
who could manipulate, betray,
and fool people.

2275
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,350
I wasn't surprised.

2276
01:42:26,979 --> 01:42:28,409
Why did he insist not giving me the card?

2277
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:29,779
He's trying to break us apart.

2278
01:42:29,779 --> 01:42:30,779
(Pretending to be upset)

2279
01:42:30,779 --> 01:42:33,090
What do you think we're going to do?

2280
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:36,560
Guess what we're planning to do.

2281
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:39,960
You have five minutes left
to submit the number.

2282
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:42,090
What are you going to play?

2283
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,130
You can submit either 1, 2, or 3.

2284
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:47,300
If you submit 3, I'll submit 1,
then you'll get 6 points.

2285
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,640
No, I'll submit one.
You can win the points.

2286
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,069
Should we take the nine points?

2287
01:42:51,069 --> 01:42:52,140
Yes, go ahead.

2288
01:42:52,369 --> 01:42:55,869
I knew we couldn't win
as soon as someone was trying to lose.

2289
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,579
If we're going to lose anyway,
I want to get as many points as possible.

2290
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:01,479
(Acau submits 9.)

2291
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:03,979
(Dong Min submits 1.)

2292
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:08,090
(Dong Min's team submits numbers
that are based on defense.)

2293
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:10,989
(Yurisa submits 1.)

2294
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,159
(Min A submits 3.)

2295
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:15,529
(Seong Beom submits 9.)

2296
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:18,100
(MJ Kim submits 8.)

2297
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:20,229
Round Three is now over.

2298
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,270
(Scores of Round 3: Acau, Dong Min,
Steve, Chungju-Man, Xitsuh,)

2299
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:23,970
(Jin Ho, Hye Seon, Eon Kyu,
Yurisa, Min A, Seong Beom, MJ Kim)

2300
01:43:24,069 --> 01:43:26,170
(Heo Seong Beom: 51 points,
Choi Hye Seon: 45 points)

2301
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,840
(The 1st and 2d places are
only 6 points apart now.)

2302
01:43:29,239 --> 01:43:31,680
Chungju-Man who has the lowest ranking
in Round Three...

2303
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:34,350
should assign the positions
for Round Four.

2304
01:43:34,779 --> 01:43:37,319
A is Jang Dong Min, B is Joo Eon Kyu.

2305
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,449
The positions for Round Four
has been announced in the Main Hall.

2306
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:43,260
Please enter the voting room
in 30 minutes from now,

2307
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,189
and submit a number.

2308
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,199
Have you thought about it?

2309
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,500
I'm thinking about it.

2310
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,439
He's right next to me,
so I didn't have the chance.

2311
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,710
- Have you thought about it?
- Pardon?

2312
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,180
- About what I asked you.
- Chungju-Man...

2313
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:08,350
told me not to go along with it.

2314
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,050
You're not doing it?

2315
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,250
Why not?

2316
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:13,119
It's because he already made a promise.

2317
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:14,720
He had already made his promise.

2318
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,220
Try to persuade him more.

2319
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,829
I'll try to talk to him about it.

2320
01:44:21,029 --> 01:44:22,760
That's the only way.

2321
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,930
I practically pleaded with them.

2322
01:44:26,329 --> 01:44:29,369
It wasn't only for my own good
but for their own good as well.

2323
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:31,800
Chungju-Man.

2324
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,810
We need to talk.

2325
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:44,750
Dong Min asked me to ask you once again.

2326
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,289
So this is just a gesture
of trying to persuade you.

2327
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:51,220
I was actually curious
of any good restaurants in Chungju.

2328
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:53,760
When can I go to try them?

2329
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,390
Okay.

2330
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:56,859
Please consider what I said.

2331
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,260
But I'm curious...

2332
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:01,670
what kind of deal is he making with us?

2333
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:03,470
It's a silent threat.

2334
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,670
There isn't any plan behind this.

2335
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:09,210
What can a wacko like him give us anyway?

2336
01:45:09,239 --> 01:45:11,310
Is he saying he'll be nice to us
in case he survives?

2337
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:13,310
That's nonsense.

2338
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:14,850
They're empty words.

2339
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:16,380
He promised to be nice to us.

2340
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,050
What does that even mean?

2341
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,819
Dong Min must be getting anxious.

2342
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:22,319
Round Four has come to an end.

2343
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:24,920
(Dong Min, Eon Kyu,
Steve, Hye Seon, Jin Ho)

2344
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,260
(Acau, Seong Beom, Xitsuh, Chungju-Man,
Yurisa, Min A, MJ)

2345
01:45:26,659 --> 01:45:28,689
(Choi Hye Seon: 72 points,
Heo Seong Beom: 48 points)

2346
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:31,130
(Choi Hye Seon has taken over.)

2347
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:33,930
Chungju-Man who has the lowest ranking
in Round Four...

2348
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:35,970
should assign the positions
for Round Five.

2349
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:38,170
I'll go with this.

2350
01:45:38,369 --> 01:45:40,840
The positions for Round Five
has been announced in the Main Hall.

2351
01:45:42,109 --> 01:45:43,140
Seriously.

2352
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:45,609
With so many bulldozers on the other team,

2353
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:47,050
this game is getting harder.

2354
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:53,119
I called Xitsuh and Chungju-Man...

2355
01:45:54,449 --> 01:45:55,989
and asked them for one favor.

2356
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:00,060
Chungju-Man will end up
going to the Deathmatch...

2357
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,130
- whether the Evil Spirit exists or not.
- Yes.

2358
01:46:02,229 --> 01:46:05,859
So I asked them to pick Steve instead.

2359
01:46:06,829 --> 01:46:09,270
If this happens,

2360
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:11,670
I'll use all the money I have...

2361
01:46:13,609 --> 01:46:14,770
to choose Steve.

2362
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:16,710
Me too.

2363
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,109
I'll use all my money.

2364
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:22,050
As long as Eon Kyu and Jin Ho...

2365
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:26,279
don't help them out, we won't be voted.

2366
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:30,159
But that's only if Chungju-Man
votes for Steve.

2367
01:46:30,489 --> 01:46:32,789
This won't be possible by ourselves.

2368
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:34,090
No.

2369
01:46:35,289 --> 01:46:36,529
I'll go make them do it.

2370
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,039
It's not over until it is.

2371
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:46,399
Here's the best way...

2372
01:46:46,569 --> 01:46:48,539
to eliminate Steve.

2373
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:06,760
I'm starting...

2374
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:09,859
to think that Dong Min is...

2375
01:47:11,329 --> 01:47:12,359
the Evil Spirit.

2376
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:17,069
There's no need for any negotiation.

2377
01:47:17,569 --> 01:47:20,770
The other team changed
their opinion earlier.

2378
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:23,810
If we helped Hye Seon win first place,

2379
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,279
they promised to help us out.

2380
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:29,109
But now that she's winning,

2381
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,020
they're asking us for more.

2382
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:36,689
Can I ask you a favor?

2383
01:47:38,189 --> 01:47:39,520
What is it? Let me listen to it first.

2384
01:47:41,729 --> 01:47:44,159
If ever...

2385
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,869
the Deathmatch comes down...

2386
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:51,239
to Seong Beom and Steve,

2387
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:54,069
then who will you vote for?

2388
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,739
Well,

2389
01:47:58,409 --> 01:48:00,350
according to our initial plan,

2390
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:01,779
we'd pick Seong Beom.

2391
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:09,090
But since you're asking us a favor,
I guess you want us to choose Steve.

2392
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:12,189
Yes.

2393
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:15,859
He'll be leaving anyway.

2394
01:48:16,329 --> 01:48:17,359
Do you know why?

2395
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,899
We've got more money on our side.

2396
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:24,140
I'm just telling you
not to waste your money.

2397
01:48:25,869 --> 01:48:28,770
I won't ask you to buy votes.

2398
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:29,810
I see.

2399
01:48:30,109 --> 01:48:32,510
You're saying since it's going to be him,

2400
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:34,079
we don't need to waste our energy.

2401
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,880
I'll do that for you.

2402
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,590
- Me too.
- I trust you two.

2403
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:42,550
- Sure.
- Okay?

2404
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,590
That's enough.

2405
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:46,760
I won't ask you to buy votes.

2406
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:48,130
Okay.

2407
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:54,270
(Sighing)

2408
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:58,140
He must've guessed
who we were going to pick,

2409
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,970
so he came up with that example.

2410
01:49:00,369 --> 01:49:01,569
In my opinion,

2411
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:04,479
Dong Min is the Evil Spirit.

2412
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:05,640
- That's what I think.
- Okay.

2413
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:08,180
Dong Min knows
he's about to be eliminated.

2414
01:49:08,649 --> 01:49:11,050
But he wants to take Steve with him.

2415
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,149
Then he must've asked them...

2416
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:16,689
to choose Steve.

2417
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,819
That's why he came to tell us
not to waste our energy voting for him.

2418
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:22,460
You're right.

2419
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:25,029
In a way, it was almost like a confession.

2420
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:26,359
Yes.

2421
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:29,569
But in order to eliminate Dong Min,

2422
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,569
voting for Steve is a good move as well.

2423
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,079
This is going to cause some chaos.

2424
01:49:42,149 --> 01:49:44,350
I want to watch today's Deathmatch.

2425
01:49:53,829 --> 01:49:56,289
Well,

2426
01:49:56,289 --> 01:49:59,359
it's almost fixed
that I'll be sent to the Deathmatch.

2427
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:03,270
But in case there's a chance...

2428
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:06,270
that I'll get eliminated,

2429
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:09,510
I started to wonder...

2430
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:12,640
what will happen to them without me.

2431
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:14,750
I just got worried.

2432
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,050
All right.

2433
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:18,649
- When tomorrow comes,
- Yes.

2434
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:20,750
- we'll end up with ten people.
- Yes.

2435
01:50:22,649 --> 01:50:23,659
So...

2436
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:28,130
you have to keep this in mind.

2437
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,829
It's going to be
a loop of competition from now on...

2438
01:50:32,199 --> 01:50:34,569
with ten people left.

2439
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:37,939
Don't show all your cards,
but compete with each other.

2440
01:50:38,869 --> 01:50:39,899
Okay?

2441
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:42,810
You have to play this game
with that in mind.

2442
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:46,640
You shouldn't hate
those who don't share with you.

2443
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:49,250
Do your best as you compete.

2444
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:50,880
That's what makes you admirable.

2445
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:53,079
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

2446
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:55,689
Dong Min was talking as if he was leaving.

2447
01:50:55,989 --> 01:50:57,520
I felt bad about it.

2448
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,420
- What's wrong with him?
- Who?

2449
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:01,960
In my opinion,

2450
01:51:03,899 --> 01:51:05,960
Dong Min is the Evil Spirit.
I'm 100 percent sure.

2451
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,069
Why do you say so?

2452
01:51:07,069 --> 01:51:10,840
What's the biggest reason
that made you think that?

2453
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:14,869
I could tell that he was trying
to push Steve away.

2454
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,680
There's a slight difference in his tone.

2455
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,010
I can feel that he's lying...

2456
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:22,680
when we talk about the Evil Spirit.

2457
01:51:23,079 --> 01:51:24,619
He's a smart person.

2458
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,550
He's not the kind of person
to forget the word Evil Spirit.

2459
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:29,220
But he said the word demonic spirit...

2460
01:51:29,289 --> 01:51:31,260
as if he didn't know the word.

2461
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,289
What was it again, the Demonic Spirit?

2462
01:51:34,289 --> 01:51:36,390
- Evil Spirit.
- We're going...

2463
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,159
You must be the Evil Spirit.

2464
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,529
But the important thing is...

2465
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:43,840
that he's not going to choose us.

2466
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:47,770
I knew Dong Min was the Evil Spirit.

2467
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:51,079
The only person
who would benefit from Hye Seon...

2468
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:52,579
getting chosen was...

2469
01:51:53,409 --> 01:51:54,810
Dong Min.

2470
01:51:54,949 --> 01:51:57,250
He was planning to make it look
like Steve was the Evil Spirit...

2471
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:01,050
and that he chose Hye Seon,

2472
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,149
while he becomes free from the suspicion
that he's the Evil Spirit.

2473
01:52:03,149 --> 01:52:04,760
It was the perfect chance
for him to eliminate Hye Seon...

2474
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,359
who we don't like at the same time,

2475
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:08,529
which is probably when he chose her.

2476
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:11,130
That's why I felt frustrated.

2477
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:14,630
All games have ended.

2478
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:18,199
(Scores for Round Five)

2479
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:20,310
(Choi Hye Seon wins first place,)

2480
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:22,439
(while Chungju-Man is at the bottom.)

2481
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:25,640
The elimination candidates based on
the Money Challenge results are...

2482
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:27,649
Chungju-Man...

2483
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:30,920
and Jang Dong Min.

2484
01:52:39,789 --> 01:52:42,489
As expected,
Dong Min who received a lot of suspicion,

2485
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:44,560
turned out to be the Evil Spirit.

2486
01:52:44,659 --> 01:52:46,829
It was scary and interesting.

2487
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:48,100
I was wondering
why he became the Evil Spirit.

2488
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:49,869
I was curious about that.

2489
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:51,800
I realized I couldn't trust
in Dong Min anymore.

2490
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,109
Now that
he was in a threatening situation,

2491
01:52:54,409 --> 01:52:56,210
he was just a player after all.

2492
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:57,640
It woke me up.

2493
01:52:57,710 --> 01:53:01,149
Chungju-Man and Jang Dong Min have
become elimination candidates,

2494
01:53:01,409 --> 01:53:03,180
so they will be facing a Deathmatch.

2495
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:06,350
The winner of the Money Challenge is
Choi Hye Seon.

2496
01:53:07,449 --> 01:53:10,189
Choi Hye Seon will be awarded
with personal funds of 20,000 dollars...

2497
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,359
and two Elimination Exemption Cards.

2498
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:14,829
Please enter the voting room now...

2499
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:18,399
and choose one player
to give the Elimination Exemption Card to.

2500
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:22,369
You cannot choose
Chungju-Man and Jang Dong Min.

2501
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:25,569
Were you the Evil Spirit?

2502
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:28,140
You knew it.

2503
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:30,579
- How did you become the Evil Spirit?
- Why did you turn into it?

2504
01:53:30,579 --> 01:53:31,979
You must've done something
at the Remaining.

2505
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:33,649
At the Remaining,

2506
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:35,979
I got possessed when I entered.

2507
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:39,619
It was an annoying ghost.

2508
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:44,189
Steve, I think you need glasses...

2509
01:53:44,189 --> 01:53:45,720
if you didn't see the clue yesterday.

2510
01:53:45,789 --> 01:53:47,130
No, this is...

2511
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:48,689
Darn it.

2512
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,859
Why am I getting the backlash?

2513
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,170
I'm just kidding, Steve.

2514
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:02,039
Here's the result of her pick.

2515
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:05,640
The player chosen by Winner Choi Hye Seon
to be exempted from elimination is...

2516
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,689
Steve Yea.

2517
01:54:21,859 --> 01:54:23,760
What a relief.
I don't have to go to the Deathmatch.

2518
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,470
He must've planned to eliminate me.

2519
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,600
Okay, I lost.

2520
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,840
You have defeated me.

2521
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,710
I'll accept my loss and come back.

2522
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,909
I'll see you again.

2523
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:39,109
I felt relieved to have survived.

2524
01:54:39,109 --> 01:54:41,979
It's a relief that I can live
for another day or two.

2525
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:45,680
Dong Min was the dictator in their team.

2526
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:48,720
He even played the dictator
even with two Evil Spirits.

2527
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:50,520
But he's now gone
after trying to control things his way.

2528
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,189
Chungju-Man and Jang Dong Min
will now enter the voting room...

2529
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:58,500
and choose one candidate
to join you in the Deathmatch.

2530
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:02,500
The Money Challenge winner
Choi Hye Seon...

2531
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:06,800
and exempted player Steve Yea
cannot be chosen.

2532
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:15,550
I'm jealous. She even got a prize money.

2533
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,850
Jin Ho, I think you'll be chosen
for the Deathmatch.

2534
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,050
I'm so heartbroken today.

2535
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,420
That can't be, Jin Ho.

2536
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:26,960
If ever Chungju-Man survives...

2537
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,989
while Dong Min and I get eliminated,

2538
01:55:29,729 --> 01:55:31,359
- that would be funny.
- Why would you get chosen?

2539
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:33,100
It was just an example.

2540
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,529
It's a possibility.

2541
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:36,029
We don't know who'll get chosen.

2542
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:45,039
I had to play the Deathmatch
eventually at some point.

2543
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:48,050
But all my opponents were competitive,

2544
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:49,380
so I liked it.

2545
01:55:54,619 --> 01:55:56,449
I only had my eyes on Steve,

2546
01:55:56,449 --> 01:56:00,630
but Steve has
the Elimination Exemption Card.

2547
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:03,359
I didn't have any reason
to choose anyone else.

2548
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,829
Chungju-Man,

2549
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:09,899
you're the one who chose this.

2550
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:18,079
Here are the results.

2551
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:22,909
The player chosen by Chungju-Man is...

2552
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:27,550
Yurisa.

2553
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:30,220
- What?
- What?

2554
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,659
Dong Min's alliance was very strong,

2555
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:38,100
so I felt the need to shake them a bit.

2556
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,800
Yurisa was the one...

2557
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,029
who betrayed Team Paradise.

2558
01:56:43,029 --> 01:56:44,069
(Yurisa fooled Team Paradise
with her tears.)

2559
01:56:44,069 --> 01:56:45,970
I felt like I had to get my revenge.

2560
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:49,539
The player chosen by Jang Dong Min is...

2561
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:55,979
Xitsuh.

2562
01:56:58,649 --> 01:57:00,449
I was practically pleading.

2563
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:04,260
But Chungju-Man refused my favor.

2564
01:57:04,659 --> 01:57:07,560
That just means
it's Chungju-Man who killed Xitsuh.

2565
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,829
You made me choose him for the Deathmatch.

2566
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:16,500
From now on, voting will take place...

2567
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:20,470
between Yurisa and Xitsuh.

2568
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:24,579
This is so cruel.

2569
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:27,409
I didn't expect this at all.

2570
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:33,250
If Chungju-Man chooses an opponent,

2571
01:57:33,649 --> 01:57:37,920
I thought he would choose
someone he can defeat...

2572
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,960
or someone he held a grudge...

2573
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,289
at the Mansion.

2574
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:45,760
But I didn't expect him to choose me.

2575
01:57:46,199 --> 01:57:47,869
I saw it coming.

2576
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:52,470
I even played with the thought
that I'd be the lowest-ranking player.

2577
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:55,609
It would've been stranger
if he had chosen someone other than me.

2578
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:59,109
But at the same time,
if I go to the Deathmatch,

2579
01:57:59,609 --> 01:58:01,779
our strategy would...

2580
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:04,779
turn into something completely useless.

2581
01:58:05,619 --> 01:58:08,420
So I wanted to eliminate Yurisa
no matter what.

2582
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:12,090
I'd like to buy three extra votes.

2583
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:14,529
(Yurisa)

2584
01:58:14,529 --> 01:58:17,899
So I bought as many extra votes
as I could...

2585
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:19,060
to pick Yurisa.

2586
01:58:22,069 --> 01:58:25,199
(Xitsuh votes for Yurisa with 4 votes.)

2587
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,310
Hye Seon, can you buy me some extra votes?

2588
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:29,909
Can you buy me three?

2589
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:31,239
(Nodding)

2590
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:35,310
The people who played with me...

2591
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:36,979
didn't need any convincing.

2592
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:42,189
They spent all their money on Yurisa
like it was a given.

2593
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:44,390
They told me they were going to vote
for her, and I believed them.

2594
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:48,529
I'd like to buy 3 extra votes
for 60,000 dollars.

2595
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,329
I'll buy two.

2596
01:58:50,859 --> 01:58:53,600
(Choi Hye Seon votes for Yurisa
with 4 votes.)

2597
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:57,069
(Joo Eon Kyu votes for Yurisa
with 3 votes.)

2598
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:00,300
For me,

2599
01:59:00,739 --> 01:59:03,069
Chungju-Man gave me 20,000 dollars
as the neutral party.

2600
01:59:03,369 --> 01:59:05,140
I'll spend
my entire 80,000 dollars on this.

2601
01:59:05,739 --> 01:59:06,779
Thank you.

2602
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:08,880
The moment I heard that Yurisa got chosen,

2603
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:11,180
I was planning to kill Yurisa
even if I had to spend all my money.

2604
01:59:11,449 --> 01:59:14,989
I didn't really say anything
when Yurisa fooled us,

2605
01:59:14,989 --> 01:59:17,760
but I was really in a turmoil inside.

2606
01:59:17,989 --> 01:59:20,119
It's sad that I won't get
to eliminate her myself,

2607
01:59:20,119 --> 01:59:23,460
but I'll do my best to eliminate her
when I have the chance.

2608
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:26,560
I used all five votes on Yurisa.

2609
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,800
(Hong Jin Ho votes for Yurisa
with 5 votes.)

2610
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:31,800
(Yurisa got 16 votes,
while Xitsuh got none.)

2611
01:59:32,939 --> 01:59:38,840
(Dong Min's alliance is in chaos
due to the absence of Leader Dong Min.)

2612
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:42,050
How much do you think they'll spend?

2613
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,819
Xitsuh might spend all that he has.

2614
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:48,050
The way I see it,
they'll spend geometrically.

2615
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:51,489
And they received 20,000 dollars today.

2616
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,720
Not to mention 90,000 dollars today.

2617
01:59:54,289 --> 01:59:58,300
(The negotiation backfired.)

2618
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,859
Isn't that what you're suggesting?

2619
02:00:00,699 --> 02:00:03,399
I'm getting a headache. Why...

2620
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:05,270
Why does it have to be Yurisa?

2621
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:09,609
We've shared time
and built memories together...

2622
02:00:09,609 --> 02:00:11,010
for a long time.

2623
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:14,079
We've experienced falling
and getting back on track together.

2624
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:15,779
So from one point, my teammates...

2625
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:17,979
feel so precious like family members.

2626
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,880
My only intention is...

2627
02:00:21,189 --> 02:00:22,689
to protect these people.

2628
02:00:22,689 --> 02:00:25,560
Victory? Winning is many moments away.

2629
02:00:25,819 --> 02:00:28,229
I need to win this game today...

2630
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,199
because I can't stand seeing
any of my teammates go home.

2631
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:33,430
What do you think, Yurisa?

2632
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:35,130
Do you want me to spend?

2633
02:00:35,329 --> 02:00:36,869
- It's your call.
- I'd love you to.

2634
02:00:36,869 --> 02:00:38,539
It's actually best to eliminate...

2635
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:39,939
Xitsuh and Chungju-Man together today.

2636
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:41,670
I wonder how much they'll spend.

2637
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:43,979
I expected...

2638
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:46,680
this was going to be a money fight.

2639
02:00:47,109 --> 02:00:49,680
I knew this fight was going
to be about money for sure.

2640
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:52,750
Don't spend too much.

2641
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:53,750
(Suddenly sticking his head in)

2642
02:00:53,779 --> 02:00:55,220
I guess you're spending all you have.

2643
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,750
Who knows?

2644
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:58,920
We could use that as a trick
and actually spend a little.

2645
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,359
Is he here to tease us or what?

2646
02:01:02,529 --> 02:01:03,560
He's really irritating me.

2647
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,529
It was when my level of stress...

2648
02:01:06,529 --> 02:01:08,569
reached its limit.

2649
02:01:09,699 --> 02:01:12,100
I thought I was going to kill them all.

2650
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:13,569
I briefly checked.

2651
02:01:13,899 --> 02:01:16,210
For now, we can use...

2652
02:01:16,710 --> 02:01:19,439
three additional votes that Acau has,

2653
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:21,949
two of Yurisa's votes,

2654
02:01:22,350 --> 02:01:24,819
two of MJ's and two of Seong Beom's.

2655
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:27,250
Min A, how much can you spend?

2656
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,350
I have 100,000 or 120,000 dollars.

2657
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:31,159
Then, can you use two votes?

2658
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,420
I'm okay with spending all my money.

2659
02:01:33,989 --> 02:01:35,460
If Dong Min comes back,

2660
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:38,600
he can support us financially anyway.

2661
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:42,170
Seong Beom or MJ, use one more if you can.

2662
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:43,500
Fine.

2663
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,600
It doesn't matter for me.

2664
02:01:45,369 --> 02:01:46,539
Should I just spend all my money?

2665
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,539
You can do that.

2666
02:01:48,539 --> 02:01:49,539
How many votes can you use, then?

2667
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:51,439
I can use 15... No, 20.

2668
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:52,640
Twenty...

2669
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,810
It should at least be that much.

2670
02:01:54,649 --> 02:01:56,149
I've become a joker.

2671
02:01:58,449 --> 02:02:00,220
(Glancing)

2672
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,859
I'm going to help you in any way,

2673
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:07,789
but let me go read the air there.

2674
02:02:07,789 --> 02:02:09,460
I'll fake things a little.

2675
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:13,430
(Acau suddenly leaves the place.)

2676
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:20,199
Goodness.

2677
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,810
This is darn hard.

2678
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:28,079
Seriously...

2679
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:29,479
- Look.
- What?

2680
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:32,750
(Acau meets Xitsuh in secret.)

2681
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:34,649
Unfortunately, we didn't get
to play together much...

2682
02:02:34,649 --> 02:02:35,920
except for the second day.

2683
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,260
I helped you with the rankings once.

2684
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,289
Yes, right.

2685
02:02:39,659 --> 02:02:41,189
I helped you place first just like that.

2686
02:02:41,189 --> 02:02:42,189
Right, you did.

2687
02:02:45,329 --> 02:02:46,329
So, what is it that you want?

2688
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,140
I wasn't sure
how the other team figured us out,

2689
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:55,739
but we were quite short on money.

2690
02:02:56,939 --> 02:03:00,609
(Right after the Deathmatch candidates
were announced)

2691
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,710
How much do you have?

2692
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:05,180
During the previous voting,

2693
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:07,550
I bought all the votes I could
to get Dong Min.

2694
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:09,149
So I wasn't left with much money,

2695
02:03:09,149 --> 02:03:10,489
but hardly anyone was aware of it.

2696
02:03:11,689 --> 02:03:16,689
(Team Dong Min wasn't clearly aware
of Team Xitsuh's financial situation.)

2697
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:21,930
(Meanwhile, Steve visited
to get some information.)

2698
02:03:22,069 --> 02:03:24,539
We're pretty much loaded.

2699
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,369
I know. I know that you're loaded.

2700
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:29,609
We felt a little anxious.

2701
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:33,909
- Chances to beat them are darn scarce.
- That's true.

2702
02:03:33,979 --> 02:03:35,579
- They have a lot of money.
- They're darn loaded.

2703
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:37,310
So,

2704
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:40,079
we thought we needed
to conciliate a few of the other team.

2705
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,949
That was why I...

2706
02:03:41,949 --> 02:03:43,449
approached Acau.

2707
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:46,159
(Xitsuh called Acau out in secret.)

2708
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,890
I meant to talk him
into using his additional votes...

2709
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,090
against Yurisa.

2710
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:52,800
You can do what you want.

2711
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,829
I'd appreciate it if you choose
to use your votes against Yurisa.

2712
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:57,569
But if you don't want to,
don't use any of your votes.

2713
02:03:58,640 --> 02:03:59,640
That's more than enough for me.

2714
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:03,170
You promised you'd repay me once
on the second day.

2715
02:04:05,979 --> 02:04:09,449
Goodness,
this is the biggest crisis of my life.

2716
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:14,319
What are you doing here?

2717
02:04:15,189 --> 02:04:17,220
Honestly speaking,
I was given a duty to drag time.

2718
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:18,359
(Xitsuh sacrificed himself for the team
during the Money Challenge.)

2719
02:04:18,359 --> 02:04:22,329
In a sense, Xitsuh's behavior...

2720
02:04:22,529 --> 02:04:24,329
to drag time...

2721
02:04:24,329 --> 02:04:27,329
played a huge role in winning.

2722
02:04:28,869 --> 02:04:31,340
(Acau is torn between his past team
and his current team.)

2723
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,939
Okay. I won't use any of my votes...

2724
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:35,609
because I made my promise to you.

2725
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,640
You have a good reason.

2726
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:37,880
- I don't want any more.
- Right.

2727
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:39,479
I'll lie that I'll use my votes.

2728
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:41,109
Just do that, please.

2729
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:45,279
Then, can you give me your word...

2730
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:46,420
- on not using your additional votes?
- Yes.

2731
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:47,989
- Not at all?
- I promise.

2732
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:50,449
That's more than enough. Thanks.

2733
02:04:50,449 --> 02:04:53,189
(Acau promised Xitsuh
that he wouldn't use additional votes.)

2734
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:02,670
I was a little confused at that time.

2735
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:12,409
I'll buy four votes.

2736
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:16,109
(Yurisa: 5 votes against Xitsuh)

2737
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:22,250
(Xitsuh)

2738
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,760
I'll buy five additional votes.

2739
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:37,270
(And Acau enters the voting room
at the end.)

2740
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,909
Well...

2741
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:46,079
When I first came to Paradise...

2742
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:47,649
and joined Team Jang Dong Min,

2743
02:05:48,909 --> 02:05:51,250
we had our own dramatic story.

2744
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:53,949
Dong Min told her to play a betrayer,

2745
02:05:53,949 --> 02:05:55,149
so she went to the other team and cried.

2746
02:05:56,350 --> 02:05:57,859
She even went to jail before that.

2747
02:05:58,189 --> 02:05:59,390
I knew what she went through.

2748
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:02,489
After all the trouble she put up with,

2749
02:06:02,489 --> 02:06:04,090
I thought it'd be wrong...

2750
02:06:04,090 --> 02:06:06,029
if we didn't save her at that moment.

2751
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,970
And Dong Min was sent
to play the Deathmatch.

2752
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:15,270
If Yurisa became his opponent,

2753
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:19,539
I thought it would cause
a dangerous situation.

2754
02:06:23,449 --> 02:06:24,979
I'll buy additional votes.

2755
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,380
Please say how much and how many votes.

2756
02:06:30,619 --> 02:06:32,560
I'll buy eight votes.

2757
02:06:35,029 --> 02:06:36,489
For those numerous reasons,

2758
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:40,100
I decided to spend all my money on this.

2759
02:06:40,859 --> 02:06:42,899
(20,000 dollars, 40,000 dollars)

2760
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:44,939
(60,000 dollars, 80,000 dollars)

2761
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:45,970
(100,000 dollars)

2762
02:06:45,970 --> 02:06:47,399
(120,000 dollars, 140,000 dollars,
160,000 dollars)

2763
02:06:47,439 --> 02:06:51,380
(Acau: 9 votes against Xitsuh)

2764
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:52,380
I'm sorry, Xitsuh.

2765
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:55,880
This is survival.

2766
02:07:03,989 --> 02:07:05,590
The voting is closed.

2767
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:10,029
Between Yurisa and Xitsuh,

2768
02:07:12,329 --> 02:07:14,470
the elimination candidate
voted for the Deathmatch is...

2769
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:19,369
(Yurisa)

2770
02:07:19,369 --> 02:07:20,399
Yurisa.

2771
02:07:23,810 --> 02:07:25,239
(Flustered)

2772
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,609
Gosh, how much did you spend?

2773
02:07:28,909 --> 02:07:30,250
Just how much?

2774
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:36,319
I was honestly very flustered.

2775
02:07:39,289 --> 02:07:40,789
I couldn't believe that Yurisa
became an elimination candidate...

2776
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:42,960
even after so much money we spent.

2777
02:07:43,829 --> 02:07:45,729
I came to think that one of us...

2778
02:07:46,199 --> 02:07:48,229
could be lying.

2779
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:53,140
(30 minutes ago)

2780
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:56,970
I'm indebted to Xitsuh,
so I'm going to repay him.

2781
02:07:57,539 --> 02:07:59,380
What played a key role was...

2782
02:07:59,979 --> 02:08:02,479
that Min A voted against Yurisa.

2783
02:08:03,149 --> 02:08:04,649
Can you use additional votes too?

2784
02:08:04,979 --> 02:08:06,220
- All my money?
- Yes.

2785
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:07,479
If that's what you want.

2786
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:09,920
We come from the same origins.

2787
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:11,060
We're both from Mansion.

2788
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:12,819
I'm more attached to him.

2789
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:16,659
I'll buy five additional votes.

2790
02:08:17,329 --> 02:08:20,060
(Kim Min A: 6 votes against Yurisa)

2791
02:08:20,529 --> 02:08:24,029
(20 minutes ago)

2792
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:28,069
Dong Min mentioned
we shouldn't spend money...

2793
02:08:28,069 --> 02:08:29,239
if it wasn't part of his plan.

2794
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:31,979
I'd do it if chances were high.

2795
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:34,279
But there are hardly any chances.

2796
02:08:36,579 --> 02:08:37,819
Let's say we'll buy two.

2797
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,680
And we'll choose not to buy?

2798
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:41,850
Okay.

2799
02:08:44,789 --> 02:08:46,020
This is...

2800
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:48,489
so ironic.

2801
02:08:50,090 --> 02:08:51,500
Yurisa must feel so wronged.

2802
02:08:56,229 --> 02:08:57,939
It was actually a little tricky...

2803
02:08:57,939 --> 02:08:59,470
because I couldn't think
of anyone within the team.

2804
02:09:00,939 --> 02:09:03,770
We were such a closely bonded team.

2805
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:06,609
We did our best.

2806
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:08,079
- Good work.
- Come back.

2807
02:09:08,979 --> 02:09:10,779
It's true that
you're the most impressive player...

2808
02:09:10,779 --> 02:09:12,180
in Bloody Game 3.

2809
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:14,350
I'll come back
after the Deathmatch anyway.

2810
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:15,420
Let's talk later.

2811
02:09:17,619 --> 02:09:18,920
We agreed to use...

2812
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,859
our additional votes each to save Yurisa.

2813
02:09:22,359 --> 02:09:24,600
I wondered
if anyone didn't keep their word...

2814
02:09:25,159 --> 02:09:28,069
and thought I should find them.

2815
02:09:32,739 --> 02:09:33,869
I felt excited...

2816
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:36,170
and bad in a sense.

2817
02:09:37,909 --> 02:09:38,979
I want to survive.

2818
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,010
More than 50 percent of my heart says so.

2819
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:44,250
I know it's realistically hard,

2820
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:46,850
but I'll do my best to make a twist.

2821
02:09:48,449 --> 02:09:50,149
- Hello.
- Hello.

2822
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:55,229
I honestly think I'll survive.

2823
02:09:55,829 --> 02:09:57,789
Chungju-Man is going
to get eliminated for sure.

2824
02:09:58,430 --> 02:10:00,800
It might be neck-and-neck
between me and Dong Min.

2825
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:02,770
Hello.

2826
02:10:02,829 --> 02:10:04,029
- Hello.
- Hello.

2827
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:08,539
I'm just calm.

2828
02:10:08,539 --> 02:10:10,670
I'm neither anxious nor nervous like,

2829
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:11,979
"Why must I be here again?"

2830
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:16,079
"Why does it have to be three players
when I'm up for it?"

2831
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:17,680
If I'm hung up on such ideas...

2832
02:10:18,579 --> 02:10:19,819
Darn, I'm actually hung up on those ideas.

2833
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:24,789
I'm hung up on them. Darn it.

2834
02:10:25,159 --> 02:10:27,930
Evil Spirit... Goodness.

2835
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:30,130
Well, I bet no one would want...

2836
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,659
to play a Deathmatch.

2837
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:33,760
But...

2838
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,600
Deathmatch itself is...

2839
02:10:35,829 --> 02:10:38,600
all about focusing on my play faithfully.

2840
02:10:38,739 --> 02:10:41,609
Well, it doesn't matter
whether I'm against 3 or 30 others.

2841
02:10:45,279 --> 02:10:46,310
Jang Dong Min,

2842
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:48,050
Yurisa,

2843
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:49,949
and Chungju-Man.

2844
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:51,680
The three of you...

2845
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:55,850
must play a 1-on-1-on-1 Deathmatch.

2846
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:00,319
Let me reveal today's Deathmatch now.

2847
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:02,829
Today's Deathmatch is...

2848
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:05,960
Memory 30.

2849
02:11:07,899 --> 02:11:10,430
Memory 30 is about using your memory...

2850
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:11,539
to memorize given propositions...

2851
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:15,109
and using your reasoning ability
to answer a question...

2852
02:11:15,109 --> 02:11:16,170
related to the given propositions.

2853
02:11:17,069 --> 02:11:19,239
There will be a total of two rounds.

2854
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:22,279
Before each round,
the players will be given...

2855
02:11:22,279 --> 02:11:25,079
number cards that are needed
to make an answer.

2856
02:11:25,350 --> 02:11:26,479
When each round begins,

2857
02:11:26,949 --> 02:11:29,119
a total of 30 propositions
will be revealed in turn.

2858
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:32,720
Afterward, a total of 15 questions
related to the propositions...

2859
02:11:32,789 --> 02:11:34,189
will be revealed one by one.

2860
02:11:34,659 --> 02:11:36,689
Upon reading each question,

2861
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,329
the players will secretly submit
the number card...

2862
02:11:39,329 --> 02:11:41,930
which they think is the correct answer.

2863
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:43,699
The cards will be revealed
all together at once.

2864
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:46,039
Whoever guesses it right...

2865
02:11:46,539 --> 02:11:48,069
will obtain one point.

2866
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:51,279
Whoever guesses it wrong...

2867
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:52,479
won't lose any points.

2868
02:11:52,909 --> 02:11:55,210
Once all the questions
for the first round are made,

2869
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:57,710
a total of 30 propositions
and 15 questions...

2870
02:11:57,909 --> 02:11:59,850
will be revealed for the second round.

2871
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:01,850
After the second round,

2872
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:04,619
each player's points
for both rounds will be combined.

2873
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:06,920
Whoever with the highest total points...

2874
02:12:07,659 --> 02:12:08,859
will be the final winner.

2875
02:12:09,390 --> 02:12:12,029
If the points are tied
after the second round,

2876
02:12:12,729 --> 02:12:15,430
ten questions will be made
for the additional round.

2877
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:21,939
I'm too old to memorize anything.

2878
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:28,050
Memory?

2879
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:30,710
I think I used to have
a really good memory.

2880
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:32,449
But now with age,

2881
02:12:32,649 --> 02:12:35,090
I often even wonder where my phone is...

2882
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:37,119
when it's actually in my hand.

2883
02:12:37,989 --> 02:12:39,590
I wish I could go back to ten years ago.

2884
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:43,760
I didn't feel like
Dong Min would mess up at all.

2885
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:47,560
I assumed I wouldn't be horrible...

2886
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:49,670
at this game either.

2887
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:52,300
That I'd win this game
as long as it was doable enough.

2888
02:12:52,939 --> 02:12:54,039
Memory...

2889
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:56,640
I was rather like a challenger
in that situation.

2890
02:12:57,069 --> 02:13:00,439
I was neither nervous nor anxious.

2891
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:03,850
The first round will begin now.

2892
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:05,779
Here are the propositions.

2893
02:13:05,779 --> 02:13:07,279
(The propositions for Round 1
are to be revealed.)

2894
02:13:07,619 --> 02:13:09,149
(Memory 30, Round 1)

2895
02:13:09,149 --> 02:13:11,960
One, Kang Min likes pork neck.

2896
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:18,199
Two, Jung Hoon obtained
a driver's license in 2013.

2897
02:13:19,159 --> 02:13:23,729
Three, Jae Ha grew 14cm taller in 2 years.

2898
02:13:23,899 --> 02:13:26,100
Dae Hee started
weight training this year...

2899
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:27,970
and lost 17kg.

2900
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:32,180
The distance between Min Hye's house
to her workplace is 870m.

2901
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:35,550
Hyun Sik's parents
run a pork galbi restaurant...

2902
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:37,609
at Hyun Sik's hometown.

2903
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:40,850
Seven, a blue duck boat.

2904
02:13:41,649 --> 02:13:44,890
Eight, nine-seven-four-six.

2905
02:13:45,789 --> 02:13:48,189
Soo Jung works at a bank.

2906
02:13:48,489 --> 02:13:49,560
Climbing.

2907
02:13:50,359 --> 02:13:52,500
Dae Hee's 500-dollar
installment savings plan for 6 months...

2908
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:55,470
has matured.

2909
02:13:55,829 --> 02:13:57,470
Melon-scented soap.

2910
02:13:58,439 --> 02:14:00,869
Dong Joo's laptop is gray.

2911
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:03,970
Yoo An visited Min Hye's house...

2912
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:05,779
on August 3.

2913
02:14:06,439 --> 02:14:10,680
Min Kyu failed a driving test once.

2914
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:14,119
A 2,850-dollar secondhand car.

2915
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:18,460
Protein worth 23g, fat worth 9g.

2916
02:14:19,159 --> 02:14:23,130
Jae Ha's current height is 186cm.

2920
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:39,939
August 7 is Wednesday.

2921
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:42,909
Won Woo has three white shirts...

2922
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:45,720
and two black shirts.

2923
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:48,250
Necklace-type headphones.

2924
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:50,289
A girl with bobbed hair.

2925
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:52,960
Min Kyu wears a black shirt...

2926
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,560
once every two days.

2927
02:14:55,659 --> 02:14:57,789
Blud Mart Grocery Store offers...

2928
02:14:57,789 --> 02:14:59,560
a huge discount today.

2929
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:02,600
A 20-percent discount on all products...

2930
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,869
including extension cord.

2931
02:15:04,699 --> 02:15:05,869
Diamond.

2932
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:07,869
Won Woo bought...

2933
02:15:07,869 --> 02:15:10,569
a green baseball cap yesterday.

2934
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:16,680
Number 30, a chocolate snack with 171kcal.

2935
02:15:17,979 --> 02:15:20,449
(Memory 30, Round 1)

2936
02:15:20,449 --> 02:15:22,920
(Numbers 1 to 10)

2937
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:27,960
(Numbers 11 to 20)

2938
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:32,930
(Numbers 21 to 30)

2939
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:36,069
At first, the sentences were
simpler than expected.

2940
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,539
So I thought...

2941
02:15:38,539 --> 02:15:40,069
this could be doable.

2942
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:42,340
Back when I was in school,

2943
02:15:42,569 --> 02:15:46,140
I memorized what my teachers said...

2944
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:48,079
during each class...

2945
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:49,710
and used what I memorized to take exams.

2946
02:15:50,109 --> 02:15:52,350
I can even memorize a voice itself.

2947
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:55,220
It's almost impossible
for me to get things wrong.

2948
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:57,949
I thought the questions...

2949
02:15:57,949 --> 02:16:00,390
could be confusing...

2950
02:16:00,390 --> 02:16:02,329
with no limits.

2951
02:16:02,329 --> 02:16:04,590
I wondered how twisted
the questions would be.

2952
02:16:07,899 --> 02:16:09,170
Here is the first question.

2953
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:15,439
Number 1, how tall was Jae Ha 2 years ago?

2954
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:18,810
Please submit a number card.

2955
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:20,609
(How tall was Jae Ha 2 years ago?)

2956
02:16:20,609 --> 02:16:22,680
(1: 168cm, 2: 170cm, 3: 172cm, 4: 174cm)

2957
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:24,710
I thought I was...

2958
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:27,149
quite smart in the past.

2959
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:31,020
Please reveal your cards.

2960
02:16:33,059 --> 02:16:35,860
(Jang Dong Min and Yurisa chose number 3.)

2961
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:41,059
(Chungju-Man chose number 2.)

2962
02:16:42,229 --> 02:16:45,569
The correct answer is number 3, 172cm.

2963
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,069
(Number 18,
Jae Ha's current height is 186cm.)

2964
02:16:50,709 --> 02:16:52,010
(Number 3,
Jae Ha grew 14cm taller in 2 years.)

2965
02:16:52,139 --> 02:16:53,340
(His height 2 years ago)

2966
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:55,379
(He grew 14cm to be 186cm tall.)

2967
02:16:55,379 --> 02:16:57,709
(The current height minus 14cm
is equal to his height 2 years ago.)

2968
02:16:58,110 --> 02:17:00,149
Yurisa and Jang Dong Min have obtained...

2969
02:17:00,149 --> 02:17:01,850
a point each as they guessed
the question right.

2970
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:03,819
It was my first time
playing a Deathmatch in the first place.

2971
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:05,889
Maybe I was having a mental breakdown.

2972
02:17:06,590 --> 02:17:07,620
Moving on to the next question.

2973
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:11,329
What kind of store
do Hyun Sik's parents run?

2974
02:17:11,899 --> 02:17:13,799
(What kind of store
do Hyun Sik's parents run?)

2975
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:15,829
(1: A hardware store,
2: A pork galbi restaurant,)

2976
02:17:15,829 --> 02:17:18,030
(3: A grocery store, 4: A clothing store)

2977
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:20,239
I got more competitive
than I thought I'd be.

2978
02:17:20,239 --> 02:17:22,270
As I played the game, I happened to focus.

2979
02:17:22,409 --> 02:17:24,510
Please reveal your cards.

2980
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:33,420
The correct answer is number two,
a pork galbi restaurant.

2981
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:35,790
Every player has obtained a point
as they all guessed the question right.

2982
02:17:35,790 --> 02:17:36,819
(Number 6, Hyun Sik's parents run
a pork galbi restaurant at his hometown.)

2983
02:17:36,819 --> 02:17:38,760
Moving on to question number three.

2984
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:41,860
If you pay 3,000 dollars
to buy the secondhand car,

2985
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:43,530
how much will be the change?

2986
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:45,899
Please put down an answer card.

2987
02:17:48,530 --> 02:17:50,700
Please submit a number card.

2988
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:51,799
(All three of them submitted a card
as soon as they heard the question.)

2989
02:17:51,799 --> 02:17:53,469
Please reveal your cards.

2990
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:55,440
(The cards are revealed.)

2991
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,610
The correct answer is
number 3, 150 dollars.

2992
02:17:57,610 --> 02:17:59,780
Every player has obtained a point
as they all guessed the question right.

2993
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:01,409
(The secondhand car is 2,850 dollars.)

2994
02:18:01,409 --> 02:18:05,379
(The paid amount minus 2,850 dollars
is equal to 150 dollars.)

2995
02:18:05,549 --> 02:18:07,979
Question number four,
what is the color of the duck boat?

2996
02:18:07,979 --> 02:18:09,049
(1: Yellow, 2: Red, 3: Green, 4: Blue)

2997
02:18:09,049 --> 02:18:12,659
Memory? Of course, it's not easy
to remember something for a long time.

2998
02:18:12,659 --> 02:18:14,719
But when it comes to short-term memory,

2999
02:18:14,719 --> 02:18:16,430
I think I'm quite good at it.

3000
02:18:16,430 --> 02:18:18,129
(What is the color of the duck boat?)

3001
02:18:18,129 --> 02:18:20,229
The correct answer is number four, blue.

3002
02:18:20,299 --> 02:18:22,930
Which of the following
has not been mentioned?

3003
02:18:23,129 --> 02:18:25,370
(1: Diamond, 2: Soap,
3: Pork belly, 4: Headphones)

3004
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:27,770
My memory isn't superb,

3005
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:31,139
but I'm quite good...

3006
02:18:31,139 --> 02:18:33,409
at memorizing important details.

3007
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:41,120
Number three, pork belly.
Every player has obtained a point...

3008
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:42,620
as they all guessed the question right.

3009
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:45,719

3012
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:52,030

02:18:52,030 --> 02:18:53,860

02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:55,799
Every player has obtained a point
as they all guessed the question right.

3015
02:18:56,569 --> 02:18:59,739
Where is Soo Jung in the daytime
every weekday?

3016
02:19:00,139 --> 02:19:03,309
Number three, bank.
Every player has obtained a point.

3017
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:07,879
Question number nine,
who purchased a green baseball cap?

3018
02:19:08,209 --> 02:19:10,110

02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:18,020
The correct answer is number 2, 171kcal.

3022
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:20,319
Every player has obtained a point
as they all guessed the question right.

3023
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:21,790
It was fun playing that game.

3024
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:23,729
It was quite fascinating.

3025
02:19:23,959 --> 02:19:28,700
Question number 11,
who got a driver's license in 2013?

3026
02:19:28,829 --> 02:19:34,299
(Who got a driver's license in 2013?)

3027
02:19:34,299 --> 02:19:42,079
(1: Kim Kang Min, 2: Lee Jung Hoon,
3: Park Jae Ha, 4: Kim Min Kyu)

3028
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:45,549
(The cards are revealed.)

3029
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:50,920
(All three players submitted
different number cards.)

3030
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,959
The correct answer is number 2,
Lee Jung Hoon.

3031
02:19:55,959 --> 02:19:58,500
Jang Dong Min has obtained a point.

3032
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:02,799
(Number 2, Jung Hoon obtained
a driver's license in 2013.)

3033
02:20:04,770 --> 02:20:06,969
It really was a mistake.

3034
02:20:06,969 --> 02:20:08,510
I memorized it perfectly.

3035
02:20:09,309 --> 02:20:10,370
It really was a mistake.

3036
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:14,479
But Dong Min isn't the type...

3037
02:20:14,479 --> 02:20:16,280
who makes mistakes.

3038
02:20:16,309 --> 02:20:19,850
I couldn't help but hope...

3039
02:20:19,979 --> 02:20:21,549
that he'd make mistakes.

3040
02:20:21,649 --> 02:20:25,559
I realized that I had...

3041
02:20:25,559 --> 02:20:28,760
quite a good memory...

3042
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:31,590
because I could even remember
a lot of full scenes...

3043
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:34,829
of what happened...

3044
02:20:34,829 --> 02:20:36,870
when I was 4 and 5.

3045
02:20:37,229 --> 02:20:39,200
I think I can memorize quite well.

3046
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:41,840
Question number 12,
after how many attempts...

3047
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:43,709
did Min Kyu pass the driving test?

3048
02:20:43,709 --> 02:20:45,979
(After how many attempts
did Min Kyu pass the driving test?)

3049
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:49,450
(1: Once, 2: Twice,
3: Three times, 4: Four times)

3050
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:51,510
Please submit a number card.

3051
02:20:54,079 --> 02:20:57,190
(Dong Min submitted
a different number card alone.)

3052
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:00,659
The correct answer is number two, twice.

3053
02:21:00,659 --> 02:21:02,760
(2: Twice)

3054
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:04,360
I was like, "Oops."

3055
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:06,159
Only after I held the card,

3056
02:21:06,159 --> 02:21:07,760
I realized I submitted a wrong one.

3057
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:10,299
Chungju-Man and Yurisa
got the question right.

3058
02:21:10,299 --> 02:21:12,069
They have obtained a point each.

3059
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:13,969
Yurisa and Chungju-Man got it right.

3060
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:15,670
Darn.

3061
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:17,639
It was darn embarrassing.

3062
02:21:19,479 --> 02:21:21,850
I told myself not to be off guard anymore.

3063
02:21:22,649 --> 02:21:23,649
Moving on to the next question.

3064
02:21:23,709 --> 02:21:28,350
How much was the five-port extension cord
you bought at Blud Mart today?

3065
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:32,690
I already expected it.

3066
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:36,159
It said later on
that it included the extension cord.

3067
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:37,989
(A big sale on daily items at Blud Mart)

3068
02:21:37,989 --> 02:21:39,860
(All items 20 percent off,
including extension cord)

3069
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:42,229
The extension cord was 19.9 dollars,

3070
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:45,270
and it was 20 percent off.
So, I had already calculated it then.

3071
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:46,469
It was 16 dollars.

3072
02:21:46,469 --> 02:21:49,239
(How much is the 5-port extension cord
at Blud Mart today?)

3073
02:21:49,239 --> 02:21:50,510
Everyone is correct.

3074
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:51,909
You each get one point.

3075
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:53,239
Number 14.

3076
02:21:53,709 --> 02:21:57,579
What is the 3rd number
in the 4-digit number starting with 9?

3077
02:21:58,950 --> 02:22:01,889
When I memorize numbers or dates,

3078
02:22:01,889 --> 02:22:05,790
I picture the phone keypad in my mind.

3079
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:07,620
I press the keypad...

3080
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:10,459
and memorize my hand motions.

3081
02:22:10,860 --> 02:22:13,329
(They open their number cards.)

3082
02:22:13,329 --> 02:22:17,270
(Only Chungju-Man has a different card.)

3083
02:22:18,370 --> 02:22:20,670
The answer is number 3, 4.

3084
02:22:21,739 --> 02:22:25,540
Jang Dong Min and Yurisa,
you each win one point.

3085
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:28,579
I wasn't going to say this
in case it sounded like an excuse,

3086
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:30,079
but I must be kind of impatient.

3087
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:31,920
I just answer
if I think I see something I know.

3088
02:22:31,979 --> 02:22:33,620
I thought I was definitely right,

3089
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:35,049
but I ended up being wrong.

3090
02:22:38,690 --> 02:22:39,790
Here is the next question.

3091
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:41,620
Number 15.

3092
02:22:41,719 --> 02:22:45,959
Which day of the week did Yoo An
go to Building 411, Unit 213?

3093
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:51,129
As the time went on,
I couldn't remember things very well.

3094
02:22:53,569 --> 02:22:56,309
It wasn't as easy a game
as I thought it was.

3095
02:22:56,309 --> 02:22:57,940
You had to have a good memory, obviously.

3096
02:22:57,940 --> 02:22:59,709
And you had to use your brain too.

3097
02:22:59,979 --> 02:23:01,879
You had to be focused the whole time.

3098
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:03,909
(21. Min Hye's house is
Building 411, Unit 213.)

3099
02:23:03,909 --> 02:23:04,979
(22. August 7 is Wednesday.)

3100
02:23:04,979 --> 02:23:06,319
(You have to combine three propositions
to answer this question.)

3101
02:23:07,450 --> 02:23:09,649
(Yoo An went to Min Hye's house
on August 3.)

3102
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:14,360
(Yurisa starts calculating quickly.)

3103
02:23:15,020 --> 02:23:17,629
(Meanwhile, Dong Min contemplates
for a long time.)

3104
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:22,629
When I saw the dates,
I was sure there would be...

3105
02:23:22,629 --> 02:23:24,399
a question on this.
I think that was a key point.

3106
02:23:28,909 --> 02:23:31,709
Please open your number cards.

3107
02:23:32,309 --> 02:23:33,709
(Yurisa holds up number 2.)

3108
02:23:33,709 --> 02:23:35,950
(Chungju-Man and Yurisa hold up number 2.)

3109
02:23:36,309 --> 02:23:40,350
(Jang Dong Min holds up number 4.)

3110
02:23:40,379 --> 02:23:44,620
(Which day of the week did Yoo An
go to Building 411, Unit 213?)

3111
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:46,760
The answer is number four, Saturday.

3112
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:50,629
Jang Dong Min, you win one point.

3113
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:52,729
I remembered that...

3114
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:55,969
Min Hye's home address
was Building 411, Unit 213.

3115
02:23:55,969 --> 02:23:59,069
And it said that August 7 was a Wednesday.

3116
02:23:59,069 --> 02:24:01,239
Then, I recalled once again...

3117
02:24:01,239 --> 02:24:03,540
that there was something
about August 3 too.

3118
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:06,579
So, I counted back four days...

3119
02:24:06,579 --> 02:24:09,209
and was able to get it right.

3120
02:24:09,209 --> 02:24:11,979
If the questions stay
about the same level of difficulty,

3121
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:15,420
I could win without much problem.

3122
02:24:15,719 --> 02:24:17,520
There isn't too much of a gap.

3123
02:24:17,719 --> 02:24:20,459
I did well for not having prepared a lot.

3124
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:22,290
(Round 1, Final Score)

3125
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:24,829
(Jang Dong Min: 14,

3127
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:29,500
Now, we will begin Round Two.

(Memory 30, Round 2)

I'm confident.

3173
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:20,870

(Jang Dong Min and Yurisa

3198
02:28:36,409 --> 02:28:38,750
(Chungju-Man holds up number 2.)

3199
02:28:39,479 --> 02:28:42,520
(Their number cards finally differ
for the 1st time in Round 2.)

3200
02:28:42,549 --> 02:28:44,350
(5. Which is the yellow number?)

3201
02:28:44,350 --> 02:28:46,659
The answer is number 4, 3.

3202
02:28:47,690 --> 02:28:50,690
(Chungju-Man fails to win a point.)

3203
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:52,059
Gosh, my memory.

3204
02:28:52,829 --> 02:28:53,899
They were smart.

3205
02:28:53,959 --> 02:28:55,729
They were indeed smart.

3206
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:58,899
But had I been just ten years younger...

3207
02:29:01,569 --> 02:29:04,709
Number 6. When ordering
3 iced Americanos...

3208
02:29:04,909 --> 02:29:08,180
and 4 iced mochas, how much is the total?

3209
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:11,950
Number 1, 21.8 dollars.

3210
02:29:12,579 --> 02:29:15,750
Number 2, 23.9 dollars.

3211
02:29:18,149 --> 02:29:21,889
(B Game Coffee, iced Americano
2.9 dollars, Iced latte, 3.3 dollars)

3212
02:29:21,889 --> 02:29:25,360
(Iced mocha, 3.8 dollars)

3213
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:28,299
When I memorized the prices
of Americano and caffe latte,

3214
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:29,969
the Americano was 2.9 dollars,

3215
02:29:29,969 --> 02:29:32,770
and it got bigger by 30
and 50 cents each time.

3216
02:29:32,770 --> 02:29:35,200
I memorized the differences
between numbers.

3217
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,069
(Yurisa memorized the exact prices
of the coffee.)

3218
02:29:39,739 --> 02:29:42,950
The answer is number 2, 23.9 dollars.

3219
02:29:43,979 --> 02:29:45,780
(Iced Americanos, 2.9 dollars each)

3220
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:47,719
(Iced mochas, 3.8 dollars each)

3221
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:49,920
(2.9 times 3, 8.7 dollars,
3.8 times 4, 15.2 dollars)

3222
02:29:49,989 --> 02:29:52,420
(Answer: 8.7 dollars plus 15.2 dollars,
23.9 dollars)

3223
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:56,329
Jang Dong Min and Yurisa,
you each win one point.

3224
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:01,959
They were good, indeed.

3225
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:04,829
Yurisa and Dong Min are known to
try hard, from what I hear.

3226
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:08,840
But I don't use my brain
as much as they do in life, so...

3227
02:30:09,969 --> 02:30:11,610
I should've maintained my posture.

3228
02:30:11,909 --> 02:30:14,280
Was I too laid back as I came here?

3229
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:15,809
I don't think I have any excuses.

3230
02:30:16,950 --> 02:30:18,110
Here is the next question.

3231
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:20,649
Which number doesn't exist in spades?

3232
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:23,819
The answer is number 1, 2.

3233
02:30:23,819 --> 02:30:24,920
Number two, B.

3234
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:27,190
Everyone is correct.
You each get one point.

3235
02:30:27,719 --> 02:30:29,459
The answer is number three, dumplings.

3236
02:30:29,459 --> 02:30:31,489
Number ten. Everyone is correct.

3237
02:30:31,530 --> 02:30:33,360
You each get one point.

3238
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:37,770
Number 11,
which day of the week is October 17?

3239
02:30:39,399 --> 02:30:43,809
(There are 4 questions
currently remaining.)

3240
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:47,010
(If Chungju-Man gets this wrong,)

3241
02:30:47,010 --> 02:30:51,510
(he will be confirmed for elimination.)

3242
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,379
I thought the gap had widened a lot.

3243
02:30:55,379 --> 02:30:57,989
Starting then, I became more nervous.

3244
02:30:58,549 --> 02:31:02,219
(They open their number cards.)

3245
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:04,190
(They all have the same number cards
this time as well.)

3246
02:31:04,190 --> 02:31:06,329
The answer is number three, Thursday.

3247
02:31:06,329 --> 02:31:08,000
Everyone was incorrect.

3248
02:31:10,069 --> 02:31:11,569
(10. Ju Kyung's birthday is
October 17, 1989.)

3249
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:15,299
(30. Ju Hee went to Ju Kyung's house
for Ju Kyung's birthday on Thursday.)

3250
02:31:15,370 --> 02:31:16,870
(Ju Kyung's birthday: October 17)

3251
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:17,940
(Thursday, visiting to celebrate birthday)

3252
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:20,239
(October 17 is Ju Kyung's birthday,
Thursday is Ju Kyung's birthday.)

3253
02:31:24,379 --> 02:31:28,450
(Chungju-Man is confirmed
for elimination.)

3254
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:31,190
I actually lost again.

3255
02:31:31,750 --> 02:31:33,020
Was this eight losses in a row?

3256
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:35,860
Still, the situation now is that one of
the opponent's leading players...

3257
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:37,959
must be eliminated.

3258
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:41,700
So, anyway, I've won by losing.

3259
02:31:42,129 --> 02:31:43,469
I've lost but won.

3260
02:31:44,430 --> 02:31:47,870
(Now, 1 of these 2 will be the survivor.)

3261
02:31:47,969 --> 02:31:50,709
Here is the next question.
How old is Byung Jin in international age?

3262
02:31:51,370 --> 02:31:53,280
Number 1, 9 years old.

3263
02:31:53,479 --> 02:31:55,579
Number 2, 11 years old.

3264
02:31:55,950 --> 02:31:57,909
Number 3, 14 years old.

3265
02:31:58,209 --> 02:32:00,579
Number 4, 17 years old.

3266
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,120
(13. Yu Chan and Byung Jin are
friends in the same class.)

3267
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:04,590
(23. Yu Jun is number 29 in Year 2,
Class 7 of B Game Middle School.)

3268
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:06,219
(You have to combine three propositions
to answer this question as well.)

3269
02:32:07,059 --> 02:32:09,159
(26. Yu Jun and Yu Chan
are twin brothers.)

3270
02:32:19,340 --> 02:32:24,170
(12. How old is Byung Jin
in international age?)

3271
02:32:24,170 --> 02:32:28,110
(They open their number cards.)

3272
02:32:28,739 --> 02:32:31,780
(Jang Dong Min and Yurisa
hold up the same numbers.)

3273
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,979
The answer is number 3, 14 years old.

3274
02:32:35,719 --> 02:32:38,319
Yu Chan and Byung Jin are
friends in the same class.

3275
02:32:38,719 --> 02:32:41,260
And Yu Chan is twins with Yu Jun.

3276
02:32:41,559 --> 02:32:43,959
Therefore, one can deduce that
Yu Chan, Yu Jun, and Byung Jin...

3277
02:32:43,959 --> 02:32:45,459
are all the same age.

3278
02:32:46,459 --> 02:32:48,200
Also, in proposition 23,

3279
02:32:48,559 --> 02:32:50,399
Yu Jun was said to be
in Year Two of middle school.

3280
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:53,000
Therefore,
he is 14 years old in international age.

3281
02:32:53,799 --> 02:32:55,469
Since they are all the same age,

3282
02:32:56,469 --> 02:32:59,040
Byung Jin's age can also be assumed...

3283
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,079
as 14 years old in international age.

3284
02:33:00,610 --> 02:33:01,680
Goodness, Yurisa.

3285
02:33:02,409 --> 02:33:05,479
I think I felt why everyone was...

3286
02:33:05,479 --> 02:33:07,180
going on and on about Yurisa.

3287
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:10,120
Actually,
the mistake I made in the first round...

3288
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:12,049
kept weighing on my mind.

3289
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:15,190
If I hadn't made that mistake,
I could still...

3290
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:17,760
play without feeling so pressured.

3291
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:22,229
But if I got something wrong here,

3292
02:33:22,430 --> 02:33:25,270
it would make it hard to recover
from that gap in points.

3293
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:28,370
In the last seven digits
of Ju Hee's resident ID number,

3294
02:33:28,370 --> 02:33:29,940
how many ones are there?

3295
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:33,139
(13. In the last seven digits
of Ju Hee's resident ID number,)

3296
02:33:33,139 --> 02:33:34,979
(how many 1s are there?)

3297
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:50,260
The answer is number 3, 4.

3298
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:52,530
Jang Dong Min and Yurisa, you are correct.

3299
02:33:52,530 --> 02:33:54,059
You each win one point.

3300
02:33:54,399 --> 02:33:55,829
(The last 7 digits of Ju Hee's
resident ID number is 2171114.)

3301
02:33:55,829 --> 02:33:58,700
(Lee Ju Hee, 97xxxx-2171114)

3302
02:33:59,170 --> 02:34:03,670
(Their total scores are
only 1 point apart.)

3303
02:34:03,809 --> 02:34:04,870
Number 14.

3304
02:34:05,209 --> 02:34:08,110
What is the third letter or number
in Ju Hee's laptop password?

3305
02:34:08,379 --> 02:34:11,750
Number 1, 9. Number 2, m.

3306
02:34:12,250 --> 02:34:15,680
Number 3, n. Number 4, g.

3307
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:18,920
(They open their number cards.)

3308
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:22,290
The answer is number four, g.

3309
02:34:22,290 --> 02:34:24,959
Everyone is correct.
You each get one point.

3310
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,600
(8. Ju Hee's laptop password
is wngml0209.)

3311
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:32,840
(Password: wngml0209)

3312
02:34:33,239 --> 02:34:34,270
Here is the next question.

3313
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:35,440
(The final question of Round 2)

3314
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:40,079
Number 15. What is the 2nd to last number
in Byung Jin's bank account number?

3315
02:34:40,639 --> 02:34:44,209
Number 1, 9. Number 2, 3.

3316
02:34:44,709 --> 02:34:48,149
Number 3, 1. Number 4, 2.

3317
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:51,620
(If Dong Min gets this right,
the game ends with Dong Min's victory.)

3318
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:53,559
(If Dong Min gets it wrong
and Yurisa gets it right,)

3319
02:34:53,559 --> 02:34:54,959
(they'll play an extra round.)

3320
02:35:00,059 --> 02:35:02,969
Since I was almost
at the edge of a precipice,

3321
02:35:03,469 --> 02:35:05,700
I was concentrating...

3322
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:07,969
all of my energy on that one question.

3323
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:11,040
I focused solely on answering correctly.

3324
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:18,809
This is... I can only hope for...

3325
02:35:18,809 --> 02:35:20,950
good luck on this one.

3326
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:24,750
Please open your number cards.

3327
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:28,319
(They reveal their number cards.)

3328
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:30,959
(Jang Dong Min holds up number 3.)

3329
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:34,129
(Yurisa holds up number 1.)

3330
02:35:35,299 --> 02:35:38,030
(If the answer is 1,
they will play an extra round.)

3331
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:44,069
The answer is number 3, 1.

3332
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:49,450
(Jang Dong Min is the survivor
of the Deathmatch.)

3333
02:35:51,209 --> 02:35:53,219
(21. Byung Jin's bank account number,
B Game Bank, 515-34-2045319.)

3334
02:35:53,219 --> 02:35:57,149
(B Game Bank, 515-34-2045319,
Kim Byung Jin)

3335
02:35:57,889 --> 02:36:00,690
I really couldn't memorize that.

3336
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:03,059
When I memorized the bank account number,

3337
02:36:03,159 --> 02:36:04,760
I memorized the front part mostly.

3338
02:36:04,930 --> 02:36:06,930
So, I couldn't remember the latter part.

3339
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:09,670
In the final question of Round Two,

3340
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:11,370
for question number 15, I just guessed.

3341
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:13,500
I almost lost to Yurisa.

3342
02:36:18,670 --> 02:36:19,940
The game is over.

3343
02:36:20,709 --> 02:36:24,479
Jang Dong Min, you are the final winner.

3344
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:28,780
So, the biggest difference between me
and Dong Min in this game was...

3345
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:30,790
that Dong Min didn't make mistakes,

3346
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:32,590
and I'm someone who makes mistakes.

3347
02:36:32,989 --> 02:36:37,030
I wouldn't be Jang Dong Min
if I were to fail here.

3348
02:36:37,329 --> 02:36:38,959
There is someone...

3349
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:42,299
I must kill once I go back alive.

3350
02:36:42,899 --> 02:36:46,340
That's exactly the reason why...

3351
02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:47,399
I must overcome this obstacle.

3352
02:36:49,469 --> 02:36:51,540
I will announce
the result of the Deathmatch.

3353
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:55,139
The final contestants to be eliminated
from Bloody Game...

3354
02:36:55,139 --> 02:36:56,750
after losing in today's Deathmatch are...

3355
02:36:58,079 --> 02:36:59,180
Chungju-Man...

3356
02:37:00,579 --> 02:37:01,719
and Yurisa.

3357
02:37:03,350 --> 02:37:06,420
Chungju-Man and Yurisa,

3358
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:08,159
please leave this place immediately.

3359
02:37:12,129 --> 02:37:13,899
The eliminated contestants
cannot return...

3360
02:37:13,899 --> 02:37:15,629
to Bloody Game ever again.

3361
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:20,540
Where do we go?

3362
02:37:23,709 --> 02:37:25,709
- You worked really hard.
- You worked hard too.

3363
02:37:26,379 --> 02:37:27,409
That was fun.

3364
02:37:27,809 --> 02:37:28,809
It was fun.

3365
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:36,120
Anyway, from the outside,
I'm not as qualified...

3366
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:39,389
or as well-known as the other contestants.

3367
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:45,930
(Chungju-Man thought of himself
as the weaker player.)

3368
02:37:45,930 --> 02:37:50,270
(However, he had more original plays
than anyone else.)

3369
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:57,309
(A player with the strongest heart of all)

3370
02:37:57,569 --> 02:37:58,739
I'm not a weakling.

3371
02:37:58,870 --> 02:38:00,409
I must've been a political character.

3372
02:38:00,409 --> 02:38:02,079
(Laughing)

3373
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:05,350
I hated the image
of a political character so much,

3374
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:06,350
but I had that side in me.

3375
02:38:06,750 --> 02:38:09,280
It felt like I had found
a side of me I didn't know about.

3376
02:38:10,489 --> 02:38:11,489
It's really sad.

3377
02:38:12,149 --> 02:38:14,090
I obviously knew that this day would come,

3378
02:38:14,659 --> 02:38:17,159
but realizing that I'm saying goodbye
to everyone...

3379
02:38:17,159 --> 02:38:20,030
makes me feel relieved and sad
at the same time.

3380
02:38:20,899 --> 02:38:22,600
But I think everything will become
a good memory.

3381
02:38:23,299 --> 02:38:26,899
Even outside of this game,
I haven't really done well...

3382
02:38:26,899 --> 02:38:28,340
as a team player.

3383
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:31,139
I thought that I had lived my life
too independently...

3384
02:38:31,139 --> 02:38:32,569
until now.

3385
02:38:32,639 --> 02:38:35,040
This was pretty much my first time...

3386
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:37,379
to do something as a team.

3387
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:40,120
And during that process,
I learned so many things.

3388
02:38:40,120 --> 02:38:42,149
I'm taking many life lessons with me.

3389
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:47,659
(The final eliminated contestants:
Chungju-Man and Yurisa)

3390
02:38:49,489 --> 02:38:53,159
(2 hours ago)

3391
02:38:57,069 --> 02:39:00,239
(Heo Seong Beom called Acau.)

3392
02:39:00,239 --> 02:39:02,200
Dong Min told you not to use money...

3393
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:03,739
if it wasn't for sending
Steve away too, didn't he?

3394
02:39:04,409 --> 02:39:05,409
What?

3395
02:39:06,479 --> 02:39:08,079
- Did you hear?
- What?

3396
02:39:08,309 --> 02:39:10,780
I was really taken aback
when I heard that.

3397
02:39:10,780 --> 02:39:12,809
(At the time of the vote)

3398
02:39:12,979 --> 02:39:16,450
Dong Min said that if it wasn't
according to the plan he had in mind,

3399
02:39:16,450 --> 02:39:17,750
we shouldn't spend money.

3400
02:39:18,219 --> 02:39:20,459
We have to make
Acau hold onto his money too.

3401
02:39:21,159 --> 02:39:22,219
Okay.

3402
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:28,559
Hang on.

3403
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:33,000
But then, will Acau be on our team
starting tomorrow?

3404
02:39:35,969 --> 02:39:37,110
He might not be.

3405
02:39:37,209 --> 02:39:39,139
Then isn't it better
to make him spend money?

3406
02:39:39,370 --> 02:39:40,440
Should we tell him to?

3407
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:42,340
Not that much,
but maybe three extra votes?

3408
02:39:42,979 --> 02:39:44,209
Okay.

3409
02:39:44,750 --> 02:39:46,520
Let's just say that.

3410
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:47,850
- Right, I won't spend my money.
- Okay.

3411
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:51,649
So, the money that we can spend...

3412
02:39:52,049 --> 02:39:55,819
Acau buys three extra votes? And MJ...

3413
02:39:55,819 --> 02:39:59,729
(He didn't share Dong Min's orders
with Acau.)

3414
02:39:59,930 --> 02:40:01,799
- How much did you spend?
- I didn't spend any.

3415
02:40:05,829 --> 02:40:07,139
You should've told me.

3416
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:10,409
I thought you knew.

3417
02:40:12,409 --> 02:40:14,209
You should've shared
that information with me.

3418
02:40:15,579 --> 02:40:17,180
Didn't Dong Min tell you separately?

3419
02:40:17,409 --> 02:40:19,780
I mean, we're a team.
You could tell me that stuff.

3420
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:21,850
No, I mean... Didn't Dong Min...

3421
02:40:21,850 --> 02:40:22,850
tell you that separately?

3422
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:25,049
So, I thought you knew.

3423
02:40:27,459 --> 02:40:28,959
Why is the guy who led our team...

3424
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:31,430
into buying extra votes...

3425
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:33,100
lying to me...

3426
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:36,329
and making me buy extra votes?

3427
02:40:37,129 --> 02:40:38,399
I couldn't understand it.

3428
02:40:38,569 --> 02:40:40,799
(MJ Kim joins them.)

3429
02:40:40,799 --> 02:40:42,069
How many extra votes did you buy?

3430
02:40:44,510 --> 02:40:46,069
- How many did you buy?
- I bought three.

3431
02:40:46,639 --> 02:40:47,879
I actually bought three extra votes too.

3432
02:40:47,879 --> 02:40:50,809
(Seong Beom lies
and says he bought 3 extra votes.)

3433
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:53,180
What are you saying?
We'll find out if we check.

3434
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:54,180
No, I did.

3435
02:40:54,819 --> 02:40:56,350
I thought you didn't
because Dong Min told you not to.

3436
02:40:56,590 --> 02:40:57,649
What are you saying?

3437
02:40:57,649 --> 02:41:00,420
When it was just the two of us,
you said you didn't buy any...

3438
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:01,459
- because Dong Min told you not to.
- No, that's why...

3439
02:41:01,690 --> 02:41:03,889
If you weren't going to buy any,
why didn't you tell us?

3440
02:41:04,090 --> 02:41:05,389
I'm sorry, Acau. I bought extra votes.

3441
02:41:05,729 --> 02:41:07,430
I swear on MJ. I'm not lying.

3442
02:41:07,430 --> 02:41:09,530
I really bought extra votes.
We really spent the same amount.

3443
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,069
But the reason I told you that...

3444
02:41:11,469 --> 02:41:13,370
was because, honestly...

3445
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:15,600
I thought you told the others
how many extra votes we bought.

3446
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,110
What are you talking about?

3447
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:19,110
- So...
- I bought so many.

3448
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:21,879
But why are you lying to me
about something like this?

3449
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:23,379
Well...

3450
02:41:23,379 --> 02:41:25,149
Seong Beom came back to me...

3451
02:41:25,149 --> 02:41:27,750
and said that he was lying.
He said he voted too.

3452
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:28,819
That's what he said.

3453
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:32,149
But that sounded like a lie to me.

3454
02:41:32,819 --> 02:41:34,290
When I felt that was a lie,

3455
02:41:34,319 --> 02:41:36,729
it made me distrustful of my team.

3456
02:41:42,899 --> 02:41:43,899
That punk.

3457
02:41:45,770 --> 02:41:47,040
Honestly, I was pretty mad.

3458
02:41:47,299 --> 02:41:48,299
This won't do.

3459
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,540
I should bring this guy down.

3460
02:41:50,770 --> 02:41:51,840
Acau...

3461
02:41:52,209 --> 02:41:53,879
He hasn't really done much.

3462
02:41:53,879 --> 02:41:55,309
He wasn't a helpful teammate.

3463
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:57,110
He couldn't find the cards
in the Expression Link.

3464
02:41:57,250 --> 02:41:58,649
And he didn't help us
with calculations either.

3465
02:41:58,850 --> 02:41:59,950
In Criminal Memory,

3466
02:42:00,219 --> 02:42:01,979
he was all over the place
because he couldn't memorize things well.

3467
02:42:02,079 --> 02:42:05,149
I was picking up the pieces...

3468
02:42:05,149 --> 02:42:06,489
that Acau had failed to do himself.

3469
02:42:06,989 --> 02:42:08,659
I was putting out
the embers of suspicion...

3470
02:42:08,659 --> 02:42:09,719
that the others had for Acau.

3471
02:42:09,719 --> 02:42:11,059
I think I worked really hard to do that.

3472
02:42:11,389 --> 02:42:13,459
I honestly didn't think highly of him.

3473
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:17,569
I think that was when we started
to fall apart.

3474
02:42:18,329 --> 02:42:21,940
I think that was when
I developed a strong distrust for him.
