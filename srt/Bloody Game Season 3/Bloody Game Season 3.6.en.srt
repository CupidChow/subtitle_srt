00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,609
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,480
Gosh. What is this?

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,880
I feel like there are ghosts here.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,390
Is this how it's supposed to be?

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,260
These look like actual remains.

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:24,000
It was such a poor environment.
It was literally the wild.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,929
"Would I be able to sleep here?"

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,929
It was way worse than I thought.

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,270
It wasn't going to be easy.

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,609
- All right. Let's go down.
- Yes.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,939
My throat hurts.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,979
Water's dropping.

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,479
What's this?

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,880
I was so angry about losing.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,750
This place must be very dusty.
My throat is starting to hurt.

16
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,259
Me too.

17
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,619
I feel like...

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,789
there are centipedes.

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,460
It was so humid.

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,960
The air was so humid and stale.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,770
This is so...

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,170
Where are we supposed to sleep?

23
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,870
Don't tell me that's the one.

24
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,739
It's literally a place
for homeless people.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,379
Check out the graffiti.

26
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,450
Shoot.

27
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,280
They said that there would be beds,

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,650
and these must be them.

29
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:26,859
This is so poor.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Gosh.

31
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,700
It's all wet.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,909
- Is it wet?
- Yes.

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,040
"We're doomed. Darn it."

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,510
"We're literally doomed. This is..."

36
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,680
"a place for revengeful ghosts."

37
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,060
If we were to sleep there,

38
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,329
I might have to play the games...

39
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,290
with my soul on the line.

40
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:05,159
Those stupid guys lived like this?

41
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,599
There are certain ways of the world.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,069
You take things from someone,

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,909
you will have to sacrifice
something big of yours.

44
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,009
Got it?

45
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:30,759
(In the meantime, Paradise)

46
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,520
This isn't it. I picked up the wrong one.

47
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,490
- You didn't get caught?
- I picked up the wrong one too.

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,189
They don't know...

49
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,960
- we have this yet.
- They don't.

50
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,800
I was watching him from behind.

51
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,240
I thought, "That's Chungju-Man."

52
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,639
I wanted to see for myself,
so I went down there.

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,110
We can't drag on for too long.
They've just started being cautious.

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,449
What are you doing?

55
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,250
Gosh. It's Hyun Seo.

56
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,960
(Hyun Seo found the Mansion players.)

57
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,360
I was like, "Is this the key?"

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
Hyun Seo showed up
as soon as I picked up the key.

59
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,000
I had already given them the key,

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,229
then I found out he was after us.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,639
Come on. Let's go.

62
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,740
You'll get hurt.

63
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,740
- You'll get hurt.
- Everyone, come here!

64
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,180
I let them catch me. I blocked them...

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,310
and told my members to run.

66
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,680
Fortunately,
Chungju-Man sacrificed himself.

67
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,520
- You'll get hurt.
- Everyone, come here!

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,189
it's fine.

69
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,990
I'll give it to you.

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,189
Put it in your bra or underwear.

71
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,430
Your bra or underwear.

72
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,229
Gosh.

73
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,729
I was definitely going to guard this.

74
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,270
That was the only thought I had.

75
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,710
I'll give it to you.

76
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,780
- I got him.
- I'll give it back.

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,780
- What's going on?
- Steve.

78
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,310
- The girls ran.
- What's happening?

79
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,949
Come on, guys.

80
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,520
I can't do anything right now, anyway.

81
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,120
- Yes, you can.
- Give me a second.

82
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,590
Where were you?

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,150
- I'm dumbfounded.
- I mean...

84
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,560
I won't run. You can let me go.

85
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,659
Chungju-Man,
who I've only heard of by his name.

86
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,360
Our guys caught him and dragged him.

87
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,759
I was like, "What's happening?"

88
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,970
What were the Mansion people
trying to do...

89
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,100
infiltrating our place
while we were asleep?

90
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,670
Why did you come here, though?

91
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,110
Tie his hands behind.

92
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,040
- No.
- No, tie his hands.

93
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,279
- Let's tie his hands for both of us.
- Yes.

94
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,610
This makes no sense.

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,310
Tightly.

96
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,949
It hurts. Be gentle.

97
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,750
I won't loosen it.

98
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,680
- Is there a mission?
- I've come to surrender.

99
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,819
- Is there a mission?
- No.

100
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,519
- We know you're here to open a safe.
- It hurts.

101
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,490
You're here to open safe boxes.
But my question is this.

102
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,459
Where's the key to the box?

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,699
What key?

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
Aren't you here to open the safe boxes?

105
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,100
I don't even know where the keys are.

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,870
But the announcement told us
to find the keys.

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,069
It hurts too much, though!
How many times are you tying them?

108
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,870
I mean it. I won't loosen it.

109
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,339
- We know that.
- I'm not that strong.

110
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,839
My heart breaks.

111
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,180
It's too painful, though.

112
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,649
- What's this?
- Come on. It actually hurts.

113
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,550
This is too harsh.

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,220
I look like a prisoner of war.
You've gone too far!

115
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,720
They had lost their minds.

116
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,220
They looked like madmen.

117
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,689
I thought, "Do they have to tie
my hands so tightly?"

118
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,230
I couldn't shake the feeling...

119
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,160
- This is too...
- that it was Chungju-Man.

120
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,930
- Hyun Seo noticed it so well.
- Yes, he did.

121
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,269
I didn't have any idea what was going on.

122
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,439
Whether everyone was safe...

123
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,139
or what happened to Chungju-Man.

124
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,509
Where are they?

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,689
- We should have caught one more.
- Yes.

126
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,149
I'll tell you why.

127
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,860
I don't think we should leave them
like that.

128
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,860
Where is he going?

129
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,129
He's off to catch more.

130
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,230
- I'll be back!
- Okay.

131
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,769
It's pretty common.

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,670
Accomplices have a tendency
to hang around the scene...

133
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,569
when one of them is caught.

134
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,769
So, I did another recon.

135
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,819
Gosh.

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,560
- They're here!
- Darn it.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,029
Get them!

138
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,399
Gosh.

139
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,149
Cut her off from there.

140
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,019
Hi. It's been a while.

141
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,790
It's been a long time.

142
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,290
It's been a while. I'm going to jump off.

143
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,620
- Just jump off.
- Fine.

144
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,860
Your arm's all better now.

145
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,899
Is it from staying at such a nice place?

146
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,899
Gosh.

147
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,829
Do you want to come,
or do you want me to come?

148
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,569
I'll come to you.

149
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,339
What are you doing?

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,810
I just wanted to look around.

151
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,540
- So, why did you come out here?
- I wanted to look around.

152
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,740
(Even Gina of Team Mansion is caught.)

153
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,649
- Hi, Gina. Good morning.
- Hi.

154
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,180
It's nice to see
that your shoulder is better.

155
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,180
How many of you are there?

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,649
About 30 to 50.

157
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,220
This is what happens.

158
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,230
When you don't tie it as hard,
they keep wiggling.

159
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,230
It makes both of us uncomfortable.

160
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,160
Why would you wiggle your hands?

161
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
I turned it because it was too painful.

162
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,199
Just a little.

163
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,970
- Now we're talking.
- Untie it, please.

164
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,470
- Untie it.
- What on earth is this?

165
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,040
I honestly won't run.
I could have run away earlier.

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,970
- When Steve was there.
- Yet you tried to wiggle your hands out.

167
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,470
If you gave up,

168
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,240
tell us how to open the safe box.

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
Why won't you tell us that?

170
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,250
- I'm afraid I can't tell you anymore.
- Gosh.

171
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,350
Sorry, Jin Ho.

172
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,250
But we have two members left, so...

173
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,920
You'd rather lay your hopes on them?

174
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,860
That's what you're saying. But I get it.

175
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,259
There's a frog in front of me.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
There must be snakes here.

177
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:17,029
No matter how hard I ran,
my legs were too slow.

178
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,370
I thought it'd be better to hide.

179
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,500
Then, I saw a warehouse.

180
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,009
I went into that and hid.

181
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,579
(The warehouse where Min A is hiding)

182
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,110
While I was in the warehouse,

183
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,750
Steve walked around,

184
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,220
going, "Gosh, where are they?"

185
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,519
(Steve searches the vicinity
of the warehouse.)

186
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,490
And my legs were trembling.

187
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,919
All I could do was stay still.

188
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,629
(Tilting his head)

189
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,000
I was going to hide around.

190
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,429
The rule stated
that I had to have the key on me.

191
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,440
So, I decided to hide it
somewhere they won't find it.

192
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,110
I hung it on my underwear,

193
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,809
thinking, "No one can take this key."

194
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,610
What if they're winning my teammates over?

195
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,210
If you're willing to surrender,

196
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,620
then we can start talking. If not,

197
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,179
there's a waiting room
that sends people to the Deathmatch.

198
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,659
You can choose either of them.

199
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,320
What do you mean,
"A room that sends us to the Deathmatch?"

200
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,830
You're not going to the Deathmatch
right away, but you become...

201
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,129
an elimination candidate.

202
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,330
- Oh, the rules are different here.
- Yes.

203
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,470
But the Deathmatch is pretty scary.

204
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,100
Talk to each other,
and I'll come back soon.

205
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:35,450
(The players search
every nook and cranny of the Paradise.)

206
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,419
When will the 90 minutes be over?

207
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,960
(Chungju-Man still isn't talking.)

208
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,789
Anyway, I'm sorry
I can't give you any information.

209
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,629
I'll be executed, instead.
That sounds better.

210
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,870
- Untie me!
- Hi.

211
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,769
Why did you break into our place
in the first place?

212
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,240
Why did you bring a knife?

213
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,639
Why are you tied up here?

214
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,039
- I mean,
- What's going on?

215
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,340
he'd rather stay silent and go to prison.

216
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,190
The loot is over.

217
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:17,220
All use of force is prohibited
from now on.

218
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,990
Players from other places,
please pick the things you looted...

219
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,490
and leave this place.

220
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,429
(A total of 3 keys)

221
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,129
(He successfully looted
the Hidden Rule key.)

222
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,870
I was told that the alarm would go off...

223
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,210
after 20 minutes.

224
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,909
But it went off...

225
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,879
the moment I stepped on the stairs.

226
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,409
I didn't really understand that.

227
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,009
I honestly don't...

228
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,710
get it.

229
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,480
We were told that the alarm would go off
20 minutes...

230
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,820
after we stepped on the central staircase.

231
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,059
Our plan was to finish everything
and run away...

232
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,559
before the 20 minutes ended.

233
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,100
(The alarm was supposed to go off
20 minutes after stepping on the stairs,)

234
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,230
(but it malfunctioned
due to a configuration error...)

235
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,370
(and rang at 0 minutes.)

236
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,529
Why did it go off already?

237
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,570
(After the loot, the crew informed
the Mansion players and apologized.)

238
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,000
- Why did it go off?
- Something's not right.

239
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,570
It was a shame.

240
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,139
We were short of private funds...

241
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,580
and teammates at that moment.

242
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,350
A lot of things went wrong there.

243
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,720
Reinforcement,
which we desperately wished,

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,490
did not happen.

245
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,320
We didn't get any additional funds.

246
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,559
It all ended,

247
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,330
and we were only left with one key.

248
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,730
I was so upset.

249
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,830
Anyway, it all happened.

250
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,970
We couldn't have done it...

251
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,740
again...

252
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,110
because it had already happened.

253
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,639
We had no other choice but to accept this,

254
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,080
and we did accept it.

255
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,580
Of course, it's a bummer.

256
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,389
But I think, "What's done is done."

257
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,990
There can be mistakes or bad calls...

258
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,490
in a sports game.

259
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,129
It doesn't seem fair
to change the whole game.

260
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,700
There was no guarantee
that we would have succeeded either.

261
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,200
I just thought,

262
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,669
"Though we were wronged,"

263
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,110
"it must be cooler..."

264
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,610
"to overcome all of this."

265
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,440
My heart is racing.

266
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,110
What would the Hidden Rule be?

267
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,450
Min A, please carry the Hidden Rule key...

268
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,950
and enter the voting room.

269
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,220
Let's find out the Hidden Rule first.

270
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,320
I'll be back.

271
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,590
Great.

272
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,990
What do you think it is?

273
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm excited and scared at the same time
to see the look on Min A's face...

274
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,100
when she comes back.

275
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,870
Min A, please submit the Hidden Rule key.

276
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,779
(Hidden Rule)

277
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:53,539
Here's the Hidden Rule.

278
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,250
You may read it.

279
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,299
Please. I wish we could claim
the Bloody Paradise.

280
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,470
I guess we have something.

281
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,210
I think it's a rule book.

282
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,440
Food and water.

283
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,179
"Basic Rules of Remaining."

284
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,279
"You have been kicked
out of the Paradise..."

285
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,620
We weren't kicked out!

286
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,690
"And you must survive in the Remaining."

287
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,990
"Wait for your opportunity
to reclaim the Bloody Paradise."

288
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,490
"The Remaining players will be given
minimum food..."

289
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,559
"once every day at the appointed time."

290
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,059
That's all?

291
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,570
Then,

292
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,669
we need to survive in the Remaining.

293
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,179
- And there are puddles everywhere.
- Yes.

294
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:01,179
Sleeping there will only worsen
our conditions.

295
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,250
We need to go where the sun is.

296
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,149
It might be too bright,
but let's go to the ground.

297
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,350
Sure.

298
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,889
(Candidate 1: The yard
next to the basement survival ground)

299
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,220
This place is nice.

300
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
- There's fresh air.
- It's far better.

301
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:15,789
- But...
- If it rains...

302
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,360
when the sun is up, it may be too hard.

303
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,830
Let's find a place
where there's less water.

304
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,269
Maybe the upper floor is better.

305
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,940
- Maybe.
- Yes.

306
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,610
This isn't too bad.

307
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,740
This place doesn't look so bad.

308
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,139
There's good ventilation.

309
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,850
- And it's neat.
- There's wind.

310
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,120
This is insane.

311
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,049
- This is pretty nice, right?
- Yes.

312
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,889
- This will be our base.
- Yes, that sounds fair.

313
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,860
Sure. Let's bring the stuff up.

314
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,889
Yes.

315
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,970
Let's make the best of it here.

316
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,500
I'll turn this place into the Paradise
with a sign.

317
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,570
Guys, from what I see,

318
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,879
I think we'll be able to sleep...

319
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,110
when the weather isn't so hot.

320
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,519
But we won't be able to sleep
when it gets hotter.

321
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:16,549
So, let's get some sleep...

322
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,960
when there's some breeze.

323
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,919
We don't even have to get ready for bed.

324
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,559
- We can sleep right away.
- We need to sleep like this.

325
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,559
Yes.

326
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,370
- Great work today, everyone.
- Oh, boy.

327
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,870
- Good work, guys.
- Good work.

328
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,379
Today was full of surprises.

329
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,879
His house changed twice a day.

330
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,110
My biggest weakness is the heat.

331
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,110
My first thought,

332
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,820
"Have I encountered heat that was
hotter than this before in my life?"

333
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,220
It was sweltering.

334
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,019
It drove me insane.

335
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,029
It felt like I was melting away.

336
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,559
It felt like someone put us
into a giant cauldron...

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,970
and kept adding fire to the hearth.

338
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,200
My body got hotter,
even when I was staying still.

339
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,440
It's driving me up the wall.

340
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,940
I could only take a catnap.

341
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,840
Did you get some sleep, Dong Min?

342
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,450
Now that I'm old,

343
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,049
it's so tough.

344
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,889
I'm drained. This is a problem.

345
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,069
(Seong Beom was the first one
to wake up to the sound of the bell.)

346
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,240
How are they all sleeping so well here?

347
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,910
I'm going to the basement.
Do you want to come with me?

348
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,809
Or do you want to stay down?

349
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,650
- I'll go.
- Okay.

350
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,400
"The Ghost Casino is open."

351
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,130
When I read, "The Ghost Casino is open,"

352
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,500
I was thrilled.

353
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,240
I thought that we should exchange
the sweet potatoes and eggs...

354
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,579
to start things...

355
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,509
with bigger capital.

356
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,650
We had to win, no matter what.

357
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,549
All I could think was,
"We need to get more coins."

358
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,750
See? My eyes are trembling
because I couldn't eat.

359
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,190
Low on magnesium. Darn it.

360
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,390
Shall we?

361
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,960
Yes.

362
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,029
(They take the sweet potatoes
to exchange.)

363
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,470
Good. That's enough.

364
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,529
Let's go.

365
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,700
(Moving to the Ghost Casino)

366
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,440
I'll go and catch the chicken.

367
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,109
It's incredibly strong.

368
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,410
(They caught a chicken
as soon as arrived at the Remaining.)

369
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,509
You caught it.

370
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:28,680
Bravo!

371
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,119
Welcome to the Ghost Casino.

372
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,200
(Ghost Casino)

373
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,309
I'm going to win.

374
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,250
She's now the mistress of Bloody Game.

375
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,779
I was like, "What's this icon
of betrayal doing here?"

376
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,750
Would you like to exchange
your ingredients?

377
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,049
- Yes.
- Yes.

378
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,390
Please put them on the scale.

379
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,390
It's over a kilogram.

380
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,990
It's over a kilogram.

381
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,829
You get ten coins.

382
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,569
No one's going to eat
the sweet potatoes, right?

383
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,630
Right.

384
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,940
They're tough to eat, anyway.

385
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,369
Put one more. There we go.

386
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,140
- It went over.
- Good.

387
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,240
- If it's over 1kg... Wait.
- You will get 10 coins...

388
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,039
(Dong Min takes one sweet potato
off the scale.)

389
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,279
That's a kilogram, right?

390
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,180
Please take your hand off.

391
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,849
These sly foxes had already weighed them
before giving them to us.

392
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,890
You will get ten coins
for the sweet potatoes.

393
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,089
- Yes.
- Yes.

394
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,859
Now, we have 20 coins.

395
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,759
Do you want to buy the necessities first,

396
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,970
or bet them all?

397
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,700
We should buy some after we win some.

398
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,900
Good.

399
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,940
There are a sensory game and a brain game.

400
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,940
You can play one game each,
and two games at best.

401
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,579
We'll have a higher chance of winning
with the brain game.

402
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,849
- Sure.
- You've chosen the brain game.

403
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,119
Today's brain game is Fermi Estimation.

404
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,789
(Fermi Estimation)

405
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,390
Fermi Estimation is
a game of calculation...

406
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,990
where you have to guess an estimate
based on basic knowledge...

407
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,930
and logical deductions.

408
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,029
You will take a look
at the given keywords...

409
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:27,630
and decide whether or not
you'll place a bet...

410
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,269
and the number of coins
should you decide to place a bet.

411
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,369
Once you place a bet,
the question will be presented.

412
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,039
You can take as much time as needed
to discuss.

413
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,809
Then you can present your estimate.

414
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,380
As long as your estimate falls
within the margin of error,

415
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,539
it will be considered correct.

416
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,710
Your coins will
then be multiplied by five.

417
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,119
But if your estimate doesn't fall
within the range,

418
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,390
you will lose all of the coins you bet.

419
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,859
You can request only a hint
for each question.

420
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,289
If you wish to receive a hint,
you must bet one more coin.

421
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,029
You have a total of three chances
to figure out the correct answer.

422
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,900
If you place another bet,

423
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,829
you can try again.

424
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,339
I think I can do a good job with this.

425
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:06,400
Fermi...

426
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,470
The moment I heard the rules,

427
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,339
I thought this quiz
would have to do with math.

428
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,880
I was determined to take all the coins.

429
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,450
"I'm going to empty out the casino."

430
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,180
That's the first thing
that crossed my mind...

431
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,480
the moment I heard the name of the game.

432
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,150
- Dong Min. I think the other team...
- Yes.

433
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,690
played this a couple of times
while staying here for two days.

434
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,019
I think they chose their own names
as the keywords.

435
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,220
I don't see Lim Hyun Seo's name.

436
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,460
- I don't see some of their names.
- You're right.

437
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,589
Their names aren't in here.

438
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,599
Should we try this out?

439
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,599
(Lim Hyun Seo and Choi Hye Seon
were the first Remaining players.)

440
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll choose Lim Hyun Seo.

441
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,970
What's the average age
of the applicants...

442
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,000
who passed the 12th bar exam?

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,140
I'll bet on Choi Hye Seon.

444
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,940
What is the total straight-line distance
from Seoul to London?

445
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,140
How would I know that?

446
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,349
I shouldn't have turned off the screen.
I should've looked at it.

447
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,579
I have no idea.

448
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,819
I'll go with 14,000km.

449
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,819
That's incorrect.

450
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,849
My gosh, why?

451
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,420
It's better that we don't play this.

452
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,390
Well, this must be the case for everyone
looking at these keywords.

453
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,829
The keyword you guys
would probably know the most about...

454
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:07,859
must be me
even if I don't know the answer, right?

455
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:10,200
- True. You're the most popular guy.
- Right.

456
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,369
- Right.
- Yes.

457
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,240
Let's start with your keyword...

458
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,710
- and bet small to see what it's like.
- Right.

459
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,369
We can test out the water.

460
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,210
- We can...
- I've got an idea. Come here.

461
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,049
- That's good.
- Going all-in might be a better tactic.

462
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,980
- Let's start with one coin.
- Right.

463
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,019
We'll listen to the question first.

464
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,049
- If we think we got it...
- If we're sure about it,

465
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,519
- then we'll get it wrong on purpose.
- Yes.

466
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,990
- We'll go all-in.
- We'll go all-in at the end.

467
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,190
- Right.
- Only when we're 100 percent sure.

468
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,690
Yes. That's a good idea.

469
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,559
We're a bunch of cowards.
So we'll go with just one.

470
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,089
Okay. Have you decided on the keyword?

471
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,859
- Jang Dong Min.
- We'll go with Jang Dong Min.

472
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,529
- You bet one coin on Jang Dong Min.
- Yes.

473
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,569
(Betting 1 coin on the keyword,
Jang Dong Min)

474
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,740
I thought that it might be
about my achievements.

475
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,140
I've made a reputation for myself
on these competition shows.

476
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,009
So it might be about one of my highlights.

477
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,750
I'll read the question.

478
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,220
"Jang Dong Min, the successful comedian,"

479
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,579
"is also a successful businessman."

480
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,619
"His Internet cafe is one
of his well-known businesses."

481
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,460
"Then as of April 2024,"

482
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,829
"according to
the top 100 industry statistics..."

483
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,029
"from the National Tax Service's
TASIS portal,"

484
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,200
"how many Internet cafes
are there nationwide?"

485
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
- Come on!
- Hey, this has nothing to do with...

486
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,299
A margin of error of either above
or below two percent...

487
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,569
is acceptable.

488
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,240
- The number of Internet cafes? What?
- Could you repeat that? The year...

489
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,410
I'll give this to you.

490
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,609
- You can freely guess the estimate.
- The number of Internet cafes nationwide?

491
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,180
After hearing the first question,
I was dazed.

492
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:29,480
When I first heard the question,
I was shocked.

493
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,279
"How could we guess that?"

494
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,680
It was impossible to guess the estimate.

495
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,849
Only having two boiled eggs won't kill us.

496
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,990
What is this?

497
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,789
This isn't about using our intellect.
It's just guessing.

498
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:40,859
No.

499
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,559
You see, people these days...

500
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,099
don't register their business
as an Internet cafe.

501
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,369
We have to pay 30 or 40 cents...

502
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,299
to the gaming companies
if we charge 1.2 dollars per hour.

503
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,170
My gosh, that's a huge cut.

504
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,369
Yes. They take the biggest cut.
And then we have to pay for electricity.

505
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,839
There are other expenses.

506
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,380
So we don't have any money left
at the end of the day!

507
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,450
Dong Min, we have to guess
the number of Internet cafes.

508
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,819
- Okay?
- We're not calculating the margins.

509
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,250
She said the margin of error
was two percent.

510
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:12,059
Every day, two percent of Internet cafes
close down and open up.

511
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,890
Got it?

512
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,190
Come on.

513
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,829
The daily change in the number
would go over the margin of error!

514
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,700
Before COVID-19, there were...

515
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,329
about 28,000 Internet cafes nationwide.

516
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,170
But after the pandemic ended...

517
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,109
But during the pandemic, about
60 percent of Internet cafes closed down.

518
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,910
In my opinion, there might be
around 12,000 Internet cafes.

519
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,250
But after the pandemic,
the number went up.

520
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,779
If the margin of error is 2 percent,
we can go with 12,000.

521
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,049
- Okay.
- Our answer is 12,000.

522
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,890
(They present their answer as 12,000.)

523
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,259
- That's incorrect.
- Okay.

524
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,359
- How many were there then?
- It's as if you were waiting for it.

525
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,430
(The answer is 7,584.)

526
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,829
- How could we get this right at once?
- This is hard.

527
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,460
- The range is too wide.
- Among us...

528
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,470
We might have a shot at getting this
right even if the question is hard.

529
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,670
The keyword for ramyeon.

530
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,140
Or Bloody Game.

531
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,339
Keywords like this might be better.

532
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:03,910
Let's just pick one.
I'm confident with any keyword.

533
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,779
- We still have 18 more chances.
- Dong Min.

534
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,980
Let's go with ramyeon.

535
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,779
<i>Is it ramyeon?</i>

536
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:10,880
- We'll go with ramyeon.
- Okay.

537
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,650
How many coins will you bet?

538
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,279
- One.
- One.

539
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,089
"According to the data released..."

540
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:17,849
"by the World Instant Noodles Association
in 2022,"

541
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,759
"the world's top consumer
of instant noodles per capita..."

542
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:21,960
"was Vietnam."

543
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,660
"And Korea ranked second."

544
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,799
"Then what is the average
annual noodle consumption..."

545
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,329
"of Koreans?"

546
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,369
A margin of error of either above
or below two percent is acceptable.

547
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:32,400
Two percent?

548
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,740
It's asking for our annual consumption.

549
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,809
My gosh, no one can guess this right.

550
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,009
- Darn it.
- How can we guess the number?

551
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,779
- Let's go around the room and guess.
- Come on! This is impossible to guess!

552
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,910
Dong Min. The margin of error isn't two.

553
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,680
(He lost his cool a long time ago.)

554
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,819
(What is the average
annual noodle consumption of Koreans?)

555
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,589
- Come on.
- How can we guess this?

556
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,660
- Hey, let's do it with a club.
- Hey, this is...

557
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,420
This was... Come on.

558
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,859
I figured out the intention of the staff
regarding this quiz.

559
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,200
You didn't expect us to win the coins
or change our situation.

560
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,869
You wanted to see how many of us...

561
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,410
would pass out from high blood pressure.

562
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,410
That's why you prepared this quiz
to test that out, right?

563
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,980
This...

564
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,079
(Feeling frustrated)

565
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,849
What do you think? Should we get a hint?

566
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,880
- Totally. We must test it out first.
- Yes.

567
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,890
I think the hint will give us
Vietnam's consumption.

568
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,519
Let's test it out.

569
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,859
All right.
You paid one more coin for the hint.

570
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,859
"The average per-capita..."

571
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,430
- "annual noodle consumption..."
- You were right.

572
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,430
"in Vietnam is 85."

573
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,829
I thought that on average,
they had to eat...

574
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,509
at least one bag of ramyeon or more
every week.

575
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,609
There are 52 weeks in 1 year.

576
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,349
- It must mean our number goes over 50.
- Yes.

577
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,150
Let's all guess.

578
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,819
Let's make an average of our guesses.

579
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,980
I say 73.

580
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,950
Same here. It must be between 72 to 73.1.
That's my guess.

581
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,859
- I think it's about 75.
- About 75?

582
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,789
I thought of a number between 72 and 73.

583
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,359
Let's go with 73 then.

584
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,230
Okay.

585
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,630
We'll go with 73.

586
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,430
(They present their answer as 73.)

587
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,799
That's incorrect.

588
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:14,869
- She hesitated a bit.
- I guess we must be close.

589
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,240
- She didn't say it right away.
- Right.

590
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,440
Let's play one that tests our senses.

591
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,609
- Our senses?
- Yes.

592
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,980
Let's play one more round
before we move on.

593
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,049
- Okay.
- Yes.

594
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,279
- Sure.
- Our last one. Which one?

595
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,450
You guys pick one.

596
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:28,049
- Hurry. The question...
- Let's go with the sea and the land.

597
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,190
The sea and the land.

598
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,519
- Let's hurry. The sea and the land.
- Okay.

599
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,960
You chose the keyword,
the sea and the land.

600
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,690
- You bet one coin.
- Yes.

601
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,799
"The coastline is the boundary
that separates the sea and land."

602
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,769
"It's basic data that defines
the shape of Korea's territory."

603
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,269
"Then based on the 2023 Ministry of Oceans
and Fisheries National Marine Survey,"

604
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:50,470
"what is the total length
of Korea's coastline?"

605
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,079
A margin of error of either above...

606
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,809
- or below five percent is acceptable.
- Gosh, forget about this one.

607
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,549
- Let's just try it.
- Yes. Let's try it.

608
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,049
Let's use this to wipe our buttocks
after taking a dump.

609
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,279
- Let's do it quickly.
- We can at least make one guess.

610
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,650
Let's listen to the hint and then guess.

611
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,420
You bet one more coin for the hint.

612
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,359
"The total length of our coastline is..."

613
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,559
"about 37 percent
of the Earth's circumference."

614
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,500
- About 37 percent?
- I got this.

615
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,900
The radius of the Earth is 6,400km.

616
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,069
The question itself...

617
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,799
was impossible to guess.

618
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,069
I thought, "Whatever we tried,
it would be difficult to guess it right."

619
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,180
But we got such a useful hint.

620
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,849
Students who love science like me
would all know this.

621
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,779
The radius of the Earth is 6,400km.

622
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,650
"I can figure this out right away."

623
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,220
I multiplied 6,400 by 2. That's 12,800km.

624
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,319
Then that's the diameter of the Earth.

625
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,289
Once I multiplied it by 3.14,
I would have the circumference.

626
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:44,359
Multiplying 0.37 to that would give me
37 percent of the circumference.

627
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,059
I thought I could figure it out with math.

628
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,400
- This...
- What did you get?

629
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:52,440
I got 14,871.04km.

630
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,509
Then I'll give an incorrect answer
on purpose this time.

631
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,809
The total length
of Korea's coastline is...

632
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,079
Say 1cm.

633
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll go with 4mm.

634
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,910
(They present 4mm as the correct answer.)

635
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,250
- That's incorrect.
- Gosh.

636
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,450
- You lost two coins.
- My gosh, so close!

637
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,849
- We'll bet again.
- How many coins are you betting?

638
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,950
- That's about 12 or 13 coins.
- My gosh.

639
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,289
- Eleven? Oh, ten coins.
- You gave me ten coins.

640
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,930
All right. What's the correct answer?

641
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,359
The answer is 14,871.04km.

642
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,829
The correct answer...

643
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:29,210
- is 15,285.4km.
- We're in the range.

644
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,369
That's correct.

645
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,380
(The margin of error:
From 14,521.13km to 16,049.67km)

646
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,279
- We did it!
- Bring our money!

647
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,119
- Bring it!
- Give us our money!

648
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,720
We kept failing one after another.
And the moment we got it right,

649
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,690
it felt like going from rags to riches.

650
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,160
My gosh. This was...

651
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,759
Goodness.

652
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,099
Without this, we would've been doomed!

653
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,470
It was so hot.
But we still did the group hug.

654
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,970
We were so elated to the point
that we could even jump up and down.

655
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,009
What a thrill.

656
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:06,079
- Hey, what should we buy? First...
- Coffee.

657
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,509
- Hold on.
- Should we buy some food?

658
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,250
First off, what do you want to eat?

659
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,420
- We can buy 1L of iced Americano, right?
- Get 2L.

660
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,519
Iced Americano is considered
processed goods.

661
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,519
- It's not available.
- Come on.

662
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,589
- That's not good.
- You can only buy ingredients.

663
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,619
- Is that so?
- Then...

664
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,819
Can we buy ramyeon?

665
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,559
That's also processed goods. So no.

666
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,759
Then what kind of food isn't processed?

667
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's say we want gochujang.

668
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,900
Does it mean we have to buy
chili pepper and meju?

669
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,740
Since the raw ingredient for gochujang
is chili pepper. So you can buy that.

670
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,599
Come on.

671
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,039
- Let's...
- Why don't we have a barbecue?

672
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,109
- We should just order meat.
- Let's get pork belly.

673
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,480
- Raw pork belly.
- That will be easy.

674
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,279
- Should we get pork? Pork belly?
- Yes. Pork.

675
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,279
- Yes. Pork belly sounds good.
- Pork belly.

676
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,609
- Pork belly.
- We need pork belly.

677
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,150
Let's make kimchi tomorrow.

678
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,650
Let's get ready for winter.

679
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,190
It's night already?
We spent a lot of time at the casino.

680
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,289
I didn't know
we spent that much time there.

681
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,319
- Smell it.
- It's so good.

682
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,230
The meat is perfect.

683
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,829
- What?
- I'll go and get it.

684
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,470
We can take turns to eat it.

685
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,440
We can have a bite and share it.

686
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,710
Come on.

687
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,579
Darn it.

688
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:19,920
Come on.

689
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,450
What is it?

690
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,650
What is it?

691
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,990
Our team match for today will begin.

692
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,160
Today?

693
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,460
I guess we'll play a game then.

694
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,059
It felt like they destroyed...

695
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,799
our perfectly fine home
to steal it from us.

696
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,529
I was overwhelmed with spite...

697
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,299
toward the Paradise players.

698
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,740
I was boiling inside.

699
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,710
How dare they use the hammer
to break the glass?

700
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:47,609
Everyone, be ready
to get your head smashed today.

701
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,609
Please gather at the Main Hall.

702
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,420
Today's team match will begin.

703
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,920
We'll play it right away?

704
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,059
- They're coming here, right?
- So this is the home stadium.

705
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,190
They must be all in the Main Hall now.

706
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,930
We won't be kicked out from here.

707
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,829
But we look so dirty.

708
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,140
Remaining players,
please enter the Paradise.

709
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,539
Everyone must be here.

710
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,309
People from the Mansion are here too?

711
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,640
Who knows?

712
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,180
- Anyway, winning is what matters.
- Let's win.

713
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,880
We can do this.

714
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,619
Hello.

715
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:32,559
- You're here.
- Hello.

716
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:40,259
- Gosh. They...
- We got everything ready. Was it okay?

717
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,900
It seemed that they went through a lot
over that short period of time.

718
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,200
It's cold outside.

719
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,039
A corner of my heart warmed up.

720
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,500
My gosh, it's so humid outside.

721
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,609
You seem to be doing all right.

722
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,609
- You think we're doing all right?
- That jerk.

723
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:53,779
Not really.

724
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,910
Everyone seemed so dry and fresh.

725
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,849
Seriously. We were miserable outside...

726
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,220
where there was no air conditioner.

727
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,180
But they took a shower and ate well.

728
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,619
Their faces were slightly chubby
and their skin was milky white.

729
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,390
But we looked so filthy.

730
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,619
It looks like
only Dong Min aged about ten years.

731
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,160
Whatever they said,

732
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,500
I wasn't interested in listening to them.

733
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,400
"I'll kill you guys."

734
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,869
"But I'll be merciful
and kill you off in one go."

735
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,339
I don't want to see them.

736
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:24,670
- Right. I'm not thrilled to see them.
- Right.

737
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,910
- I'm not happy at all.
- Right.

738
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm not happy to see them at all.

739
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,880
Why are they clapping each other
while greeting?

740
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,250
- Why are they so happy with each other?
- I guess they get along really well.

741
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,980
Are we the outcasts?

742
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,890
Great. We'll be the ones ostracizing them.

743
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,490
- Yes.
- We'll exclude them.

744
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,990
Let's show them.

745
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,829
More people came.

746
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,930
This part is dirty too.

747
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:48,230
We didn't clean up.

748
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,170
- They're here.
- Hello.

749
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Hello.

750
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,369
They look very tired.

751
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,900
Hello.

752
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,509
What's up with their facial expressions?

753
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,079
- Seriously.
- They look tired and unhappy.

754
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,349
Did they fight on their way here?

755
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,550
It has been a while.

756
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,119
It has been a while.

757
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,449
Hello, traitor.

758
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,860
We were in the wild.

759
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,920
Did you have a hard time?

760
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,090
I should just stay still.

761
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,929
We hoped that you'd have a hard time.

762
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,829
I had a very hard time.

763
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,199
He shouldn't be the one to talk.

764
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,469
They were the ones who deserted me.

765
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:33,309
Punishing the traitors of the Mansion...

766
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:34,340
is my goal.

767
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,610
Since we had quite a chase in the morning,

768
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,079
I didn't want to see any one of them.

769
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,380
Especially Acau.

770
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,619
Acau betrayed us,

771
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,219
but he ended up struggling
in Team Remaining...

772
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,159
and becoming dirty.

773
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,190
It made me happy to see him like that.

774
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,130
Dong Min.

775
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,630
He struggled.

776
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,369
It's so good to see you.

777
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,699
- Have you been well?
- I missed you.

778
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,809
I was there last night.

779
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,849
There were Hong Jin Ho and Jang Dong Min.

780
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,880
It's so cutthroat here.

781
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,579
(3 hours later)

782
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,949
It's nice to meet you.

783
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:29,969
The time has come.

784
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,800
Only one will survive.

785
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,769
I want to beat Dong Min here.

786
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,469
The game of the day will begin.

787
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,380
Today, the 1st team competition
of the 3 teams...

788
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,980
including the Paradise players,
Mansion players,

789
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,050
and Remaining players will begin.

790
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,320
All players of the winning team...

791
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,489
will receive private funds
of 20,000 dollars...

792
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,219
and Immunity Pass.

793
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,030
One of the defeated teams
will decide on...

794
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,789
one elimination candidate through voting.

795
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,929
The player who gets chosen
through voting...

796
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,530
will have the Deathmatch
with the Underground Prison players.

797
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,570
The defeated player will get eliminated.

798
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,239
Today's Money Challenge,

799
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,579
the first team match game
will be revealed.

800
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,010
Today's Money Challenge is...

801
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,480
Victory or Defeat Prediction.

802
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,780
(Victory or Defeat Prediction)

803
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,619
Victory or Defeat Prediction
will proceed as a team competition.

804
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,190
In each round, you'll need to predict
if your team will win or lose...

805
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,219
and turn in cards strategically...

806
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,630
in order to make the prediction come true.

807
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,630
In the game, four color cards...

808
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,969
in red, blue, yellow, and green...

809
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:37,469
from numbers 1 to 16...

810
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:39,400
as well as 4 achromatic 100 cards...

811
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,469
and 4 achromatic 0 cards will be used.

812
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:45,239
Each team will receive 16 number cards
that have been picked at random,

813
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,840
a 100 card, and a 0 card.

814
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,309
The remaining cards
will be used as open cards.

815
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,349
The game will consist of six rounds.

816
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:55,650
In each round, a player of each team...

817
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,650
will play three consecutive games...

818
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,489
using three cards.

819
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:03,059
When the first open card is revealed,
each player...

820
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:06,699
will predict how many times
he or she will win in three games.

821
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,769
In each round, the player who brought
the card with the smallest number...

822
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,639
will be the starting player
of the first turn.

823
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,869
In the next turn,
the winner of the previous turn...

824
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,210
will be the starting player.

825
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,940
The player's order will limit
the card he or she can turn in.

826
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,949
The first player can turn in
any card he or she wants to...

827
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,079
regardless of the open card.

828
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,750
The 2nd and 3rd players...

829
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,849
must turn in a card
that has the same color as the first card.

830
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,420
If there are no such cards,

831
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,559
they must turn in a card
that has the same color as the open card.

832
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,730
After all three players turn in the cards,

833
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,800
the player who turned in the card
with the same color as the open card...

834
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,070
and the highest number will win.

835
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,139
If there are no such cards,

836
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,670
the player who turned in the card
with the same color as the first card...

837
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,739
and the highest number will win.

838
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,440
Players can turn in
100 cards and 0 cards...

839
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,809
regardless of the colors.

840
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:00,250
If 2 or more players turned in a 100 card,

841
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,519
the one who turned it in last will win.

842
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,250
If all players turned in a zero card,

843
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,989
the one who turned it in first will win.

844
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,889
In each round, only the team
that succeeded in prediction...

845
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,230
will receive points.

846
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,059
Ten points for each win...

847
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,829
and ten points for the correct prediction
will be awarded.

848
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,099
As for the teams
that failed in prediction,

849
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,699
ten points will be deducted
for each win that was in error.

850
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,570
In the total number of rounds,

851
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,880
each team can use the double item once.

852
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,079
If a player uses the item
and succeeds in prediction,

853
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,110
the points he or she acquired
will be doubled.

854
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,780
Before Round 1 and Round 4,

855
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,090
each team will predict the number of wins
in the total number of rounds.

856
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,389
A correct prediction before Round 1
will be awarded 50 points.

857
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,329
A correct prediction before Round Four...

858
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,429
will be awarded 30 points.

859
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,630
After the six rounds,

860
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,670
the team that has
the highest combined scores will win.

861
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,269
(Team C wins.)

862
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,070
This is definitely a psychological game.

863
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,110
I have confidence
when it comes to a psychological game.

864
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,210
However,

865
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,980
the opposing teams have Hong Jin Ho
and Kim Kyung Ran.

866
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,309
It won't be easy.

867
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,820
I think Team Paradise has an advantage.

868
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,820
I currently work
as a professional poker player...

869
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,250
and Steve is on the same team as me.

870
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,989
As for Hyun Seo, he's a lawyer.

871
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:16,460
I had the Deathmatch
with Hye Seon in the past,

872
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,400
so I know that she isn't terrible
at card games.

873
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,730
She'll do well
once she understands the rules.

874
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,800
My heart beat fast. It sounded fun.

875
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,969
I'm a strong player.

876
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,539
I want to show them.

877
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,969
After a strategy meeting,

878
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,139
come up with a team roster for the rounds.

879
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,050
Everyone.

880
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,349
This is a game we can't lose in.

881
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,949
Just keep that in mind.

882
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,849
In this game,
card counting is the most important.

883
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,820
After erasing the possibilities,

884
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,760
it's a matter of using
the remaining cards.

885
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,420
The used cards...

886
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,690
We need to write them down.

887
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,090
We can't be wrong.

888
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,159
As the game goes on,

889
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,130
it'll be hard to win points
due to card counting.

890
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,199
Winning points in the beginning...

891
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,809
- Strategically speaking.
- Yes, it's better.

892
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,840
I think we should first receive
the cards...

893
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,809
- that are distributed at random.
- You're right.

894
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:09,449
After about six rounds,

895
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,409
- most of the cards will be out.
- That's right.

896
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,409
The last round will be predictable.

897
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,250
Yes. The last round will be predictable.

898
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,050
I'm pretty sure...

899
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,889
all the teams will use the double item...

900
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:23,659
toward the end of the rounds.

901
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,559
- That's right.
- How we use...

902
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,960
the 100 card and 0 card will be important.

903
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:29,929
All right.

904
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,099
We need to use the double item well.

905
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,639
In the end, the most important thing
is predicting the wins correctly...

906
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,909
and getting the points.

907
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,440
A correct prediction will be a plus.

908
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,610
- Otherwise, you'll lose...
- Wins...

909
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,809
even if you take three wins.

910
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,610
A failed prediction is zero points.

911
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,579
- It's a minus.
- It's a minus.

912
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,849
A correct prediction
will make the wins meaningful.

913
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,190
- It'll bring the points.
- So...

914
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,690
even three wins will be useless...

915
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,920
- without a correct prediction.
- Yes.

916
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,320
That's how it is.

917
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,059
Then we can purposefully
make another team win.

918
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,059
That's right.

919
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,530
That's right.
It can mess up the prediction.

920
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,530
If you think about it, you need to match
the color of the first player's card.

921
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,670
If you don't have such cards,
you can match the color of the open card.

922
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,800
So you don't have much freedom
regarding the cards.

923
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,010
To gain freedom,

924
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,469
- you need a bit of luck.
- Yes.

925
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,840
The first player can turn in
any card he or she wants to...

926
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,650
regardless of the open card.

927
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,320
From the second player onward,
the color of the card will be restricted.

928
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,690
Firstly, the players
can only turn in a card that has...

929
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,460
the same color as the first player's card.

930
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:30,030
If they don't have any cards
in that color, they can only turn in...

931
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,659
a card that has the same color
as the open card.

932
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,900
If they have neither,
they can turn in any card freely.

933
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,469
In terms of winning the points,
the card that has the same color...

934
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,570
as the open card will have priority.

935
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:44,039
Thus, if the first player wants to win...

936
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,409
with the card he or she turned in,

937
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,550
he or she must turn in the card
that has the same color as the open card.

938
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,619
However, a 100 card and 0 card
can be turned in regardless of the color.

939
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,250
The player who turned in a 100 card
will become the winner of the turn.

940
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,989
On the contrary, the player
who turned in a zero card...

941
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,760
will become the loser of the turn.

942
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,230
If you have a card with a high number,

943
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,030
it's best to match
the color of the open card.

944
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,599
That way, we can prevent others
from winning with another card.

945
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,599
In any case,

946
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,199
when you turn in a card
with a high number,

947
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,440
you should hope
that other players have a card...

948
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,670
in that color.

949
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:19,909
That's if you want to win.

950
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
That's it.

951
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,650
It was a card game...

952
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,880
and we had two card players.

953
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,219
I thought, "This is our game."

954
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,719
As soon as I heard the rules,

955
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,389
I thought that I'd do better
than anyone...

956
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:31,590
in there.

957
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,789
Who can do well in Round One
without getting confused?

958
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,159
- Round 1?
- Round 1.

959
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,389
Jin Ho and I should aim to win...

960
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,000
with other cards.

961
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,059
- Let's enter the awkward rounds.
- We...

962
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,099
- Rounds 3 and 4 or Rounds 4 and 5.
- Yes.

963
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:47,170
In the middle rounds,
awkward cards will remain.

964
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,570
Then we can adjust our strategy...

965
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,340
by studying the opponents' cards...

966
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,210
or the open card.

967
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,980
So Rounds 3, 4, and 5
will be the most important.

968
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,579
The last round is meaningless
since all the cards will be out.

969
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,849
In the last round,

970
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,119
- the result will be obvious.
- It'll be obvious.

971
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,650
Dong Min will play twice, right?

972
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,519
Having more members isn't an advantage.

973
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,489
- It's a disadvantage.
- If there's a good player...

974
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,630
- If there's a good player...
- He or she will go multiple times.

975
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,630
If the good players take...

976
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,130
Rounds 2, 3, and 4,

977
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,769
we'll be able to make
a correct prediction.

978
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,840
Toward the end,
it'll be hard due to card counting.

979
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:25,980
Rounds 5 and 6...

980
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,480
are psychological warfare.

981
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,349
But we're lucky. One team has Jin Ho...

982
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:33,349
and another team has Kyung Ran.

983
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:36,349
I know how they think,

984
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,190
so we'll be able to play well.

985
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:42,789
But still, we never know. Thus,

986
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,730
we need to win points
when we can without a doubt.

987
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,699
We need to figure out
how many wins they predicted.

988
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,630
That way, we'll be able
to figure out their directions.

989
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,570
Let's say Team Mansion already has a win.

990
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,409
Then we can think, "They don't have
a 16 card or a 100 card."

991
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:59,269
It isn't a certainty,
but we can make that prediction.

992
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,039
- It'll help us with the game.
- That's right.

993
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,050
Let's say the team that predicted 1 win
takes a win in the 1st and 2nd turns.

994
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,610
Then lower numbers will follow.

995
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,880
That team needs losses.

996
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,920
So the most important thing
about this game is...

997
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:12,690
how many wins they took.

998
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,719
For example, other teams...

999
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,429
Listen carefully.

1000
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,960
Let's say Jin Ho enters a round
with a prediction of one win.

1001
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,059
However, he loses in two turns.

1002
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:24,699
He'll try anything to win
in the third turn.

1003
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:26,000
Then I'll need to stop him.

1004
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,199
I might need to deviate from the plan...

1005
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,900
- and use a 100 card...
- Yes.

1006
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,010
- in order to stop him.
- Yes. He'll need to be stopped.

1007
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,380
You can't play the game as you want.

1008
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,039
You need to read the flow and go,

1009
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,150
"I have to stop that punk this time."

1010
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,420
All the teams will think this much.

1011
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:42,150
So if another player is trying
to put a stop to it,

1012
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,349
we don't need to.

1013
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,320
That's how I usually strategize.

1014
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,219
While our strategy is important,

1015
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,460
it's best to put ourselves...

1016
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,960
in other teams' shoes.

1017
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,000
I've always strategized accordingly.

1018
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,269
Let's say we use the double item.

1019
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:00,340
If we use the double item, we must take...

1020
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,440
two wins at the very least.

1021
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,409
Three wins will be the best.

1022
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,670
- But three wins...
- If we get stopped...

1023
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,110
are unlikely.

1024
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,840
Thus,
we must take a safe route for two wins.

1025
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,480
This is the only way to take two wins.

1026
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,750
- A 100 card and a 16 card.
- A 16 card.

1027
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,349
Then we have to lose in one turn.

1028
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:18,219
For that turn,
it'll be best to use a zero card.

1029
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,420
This strategy.

1030
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,019
Here's the thing about the strategy
of taking two wins...

1031
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,989
with 100, 16 and 0 cards.

1032
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,900
Because of the zero card,

1033
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,670
we can become the first player.

1034
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,070
It'll be nice. But there's a chance
we aren't the first player...

1035
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,539
because of the 100 and 16 cards.

1036
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:36,739
Let's say we aren't the first player.

1037
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,909
Let's say we're the second player.
Then we'll lose.

1038
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:42,210
In your opinion,
when will Kyung Ran and Jin Ho's teams...

1039
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,980
use 0 and 100 cards?

1040
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,309
Jin Ho's team will use them together.

1041
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,820
As for Kyung Ran's team...

1042
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,050
- They'll watch 1st.
- Yes. They'll watch 1st.

1043
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,820
In the game with multiple rounds,

1044
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,519
it's hard to turn the tables
on the ones who take points first.

1045
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,030
Jin Ho is aggressive by nature.

1046
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:02,400
Also, that team also has Steve Yea.

1047
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,900
Steve Yea is aggressive too.

1048
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,440
Because of that,
the 0, 16, and 100 cards...

1049
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,099
Jin Ho's team might go,
"Let's use them in Round One."

1050
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,309
How will we play the first turn?

1051
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,840
For the first turn,

1052
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,079
we can be like gamblers.

1053
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,309
Let's take the 100 and 0 cards...

1054
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:19,079
as well as a card with a high number.

1055
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,750
Then we can predict 2 wins and 1 losses...

1056
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,320
and take double points.
We can do that in Round One.

1057
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,920
Most people will think,

1058
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,059
"Let's play it safe in the beginning..."

1059
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,489
"and see how things go."

1060
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,360
In the 1st 2 rounds out of 6 rounds,

1061
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,130
let's see how things go.

1062
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,230
It'll be dangerous to take...

1063
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,099
a 100 card for Round 1.

1064
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,599
Wouldn't it be better to use a 100 card...

1065
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,710
- when things are certain?
- That's right.

1066
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,909
You've played games...

1067
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:47,510
- with Jin Ho and Dong Min.
- Yes.

1068
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,550
Are they the cautious type?

1069
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,480
Dong Min will definitely attempt
to turn this psychological.

1070
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,760
As for Jin Ho, he'll play for a while
and go, "Let's take a break."

1071
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,159
- Then he'll eat snacks.
- Yes.

1072
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,889
We can make specific plans
after we receive...

1073
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,530
- the cards.
- Yes.

1074
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:10,199
For now,
we can only come up with guidelines.

1075
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:13,170
- Predict 1 win.
- Predict 1 win and get 20 points.

1076
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,000
- We'll get 20 points.
- Right.

1077
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,539
Is there any way
to win three times for sure?

1078
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:17,840
By all means.

1079
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,010
It won't be easy to win three times...

1080
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,639
because the dealer's cards have colors.

1081
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,710
Winning 3 times means 40 points.

1082
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,010
Right, if we predict three wins
and it turns out to be right.

1083
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,750
- Then, it will be 40 points.
- It'll be 40 points, right?

1084
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,019
Multiplying to this may end the game.

1085
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:31,719
Right. If we get 2 cards of 16,

1086
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:33,420
we will have a chance...

1087
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,219
because given what I heard,

1088
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,829
I don't think they'll bring 100
in the beginning.

1089
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,489
- Right, for the last round.
- According to what you said,

1090
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,300
the chances of using the double item
are much higher later on.

1091
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,869
Of course. If it's me,
I'll use the double item...

1092
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,329
during the last round for sure.

1093
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,170
For example,
there are 100, red 16, and blue 16.

1094
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,239
Say the dealer's card turns out...

1095
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,010
to be red. In this case, we'll win.

1096
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,949
If it's blue, we'll still win.

1097
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,579
If it's yellow, we'll use 100.

1098
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:02,650
- If it's green, we'll be doomed.
- Right.

1099
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,920
- The chances are 3 over 4.
- Yes, 3 over 4.

1100
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,920
This is worth gambling.

1101
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,559
The problem is which round it should be.

1102
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,760
I think it should be the first round.

1103
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,230
The first round?

1104
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:18,630
Let me tell you what we'll do
if we earn the points.

1105
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,199
We'll mix everything all over again.

1106
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:21,739
We'll mix all the cards...

1107
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,010
and offer to take them all.

1108
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,409
Then, we'll keep predicting one win.

1109
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,539
It's not bad.

1110
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,409
We can play blindly as if we were monkeys.

1111
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,150
You know monkeys are really good
at making stock investments, right?

1112
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,050
They invested in those
that a monkey chose...

1113
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,119
and placed first in stock investment.

1114
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,150
- That's the way it is.
- Are you serious?

1115
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,090
- That's it.
- It wasn't a person,

1116
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,090
but a monkey who choices
brought the best investment results.

1117
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,119
Let's be like monkeys.

1118
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,929
I'm so happy, but tired at the same time.

1119
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,300
- We're monkeys.
- Wait.

1120
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:49,099
If we take 80 points in the 1st round,

1121
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:50,369
the game will be over for sure.

1122
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,599
From then on,

1123
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:54,070
- we'll be like, "Yummy."
- We'll just...

1124
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,610
"Give us just one win."

1125
00:48:58,039 --> 00:48:59,539
On the table for sure, we...

1126
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,480
"No, we won't change.
We'll go with one win no matter what."

1127
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,510
This is so funny.

1128
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,179
All right, listen.
The Yummy Yummy Strategy...

1129
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,820
is possible
only when we have 2 cards of 16.

1130
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,659
- That's right.
- The Yummy Yummy...

1131
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,460
If we do,
we'll take this strategy for sure...

1132
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,690
because it will be impossible to lose.

1133
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,829
You're insane.

1134
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,260
- Yummy...
- I'll go.

1135
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,929
Give me just 100, 16, and 16.

1136
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:26,030
And Dong Min tries to read the game,
you know.

1137
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,099
It's the same with Jin Ho. They even
have their opponents' cards in mind.

1138
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,340
- Right.
- Now we have you, Kyung Ran.

1139
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,469
"They'll make this move
with Kyung Ran in their team?"

1140
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,539
- "That's ridiculous."
- They'll never see it coming.

1141
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,449
They have Dong Min the Deity...

1142
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,610
and the poker players.

1143
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,150
I can predict a difficult situation.

1144
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,980
But if we ever get a chance,

1145
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,250
I want us to play for high stakes.

1146
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,389
And if it works,
the game might go in our favor.

1147
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:48,989
All teams, please take
a pack of shuffled cards each...

1148
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,730
at the Main Hall.

1149
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,630
You may choose 1 of the 4 packs.

1150
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,170
Please take a 0 card and a 100 card
along with the pack you chose.

1151
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,179
(Team Paradise has taken the cards.)

1152
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:16,219
Please take a 0 card
and a 100 card as well.

1153
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:17,619
The cards first.

1154
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:19,150
Stand here
so that the other team can't see.

1155
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:21,090
Okay, 15.

1156
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:22,889
Eight.

1157
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,389
Ten.

1158
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,570
No, we need high numbers. Come on.

1159
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,730
No.

1160
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,070
Fifteen.

1161
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,840
Fourteen.

1162
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:37,809
Nine.

1163
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,980
- This is not good.
- Darn it. We don't have 16.

1164
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,239
We don't have 16.

1165
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,710
(Team Remaining's cards)

1166
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,579
We don't have 16. Darn it.

1167
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:49,250
Should we go with guessing
the cards right?

1168
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,250
Even if we don't take enough wins,

1169
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,219
we can earn 80 points
if our prediction turns out right.

1170
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,690
So it's worth eight wins in a sense.

1171
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,789
We have to make a prediction
in each round too.

1172
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,559
Our winning cards...

1173
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,760
are only this and this.

1174
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,300
We have to use 15 instead of 16.

1175
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,530
But 15 isn't so...

1176
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,239
We have to do this
when they don't have 16.

1177
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,610
It's important to count
how many cards of 16 they have.

1178
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,670
- We better count along the way.
- Right.

1179
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,780
We have to count the number for sure.

1180
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,909
Of all 18 rounds,

1181
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,010
what do you say about seven wins?

1182
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,179
Let's take one win in each round...

1183
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,880
and take two wins once.

1184
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,420
- Do we bet double then?
- Yes.

1185
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,719
- Sounds good.
- I think it's a good idea.

1186
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,289
There are 4 cards of 16,
but we don't have any.

1187
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:30,590
One team may have two of them.

1188
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,300
Even if we're lucky with cards, be quiet.

1189
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,329
Don't be too excited.

1190
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,869
- This...
- Gosh, that surprised me.

1191
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,000
- Wait.
- We don't know the order. Wait.

1192
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,400
- Yes!
- Guys.

1193
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,079
It's not bad.

1194
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,449
Hold on. It's not so great.

1195
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:52,480
- Rather than this...
- Yummy Yummy Strategy won't work.

1196
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,579
It's not so good.

1197
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,449
(Team Mansion's cards)

1198
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:57,889
- What a bummer.
- It's such a shame.

1199
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,250
Still, we have 1 of 16.

1200
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:01,960
Should we bring the 16 card
in the beginning...

1201
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,559
- Win two times?
- and bet double?

1202
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:06,289
- Like this?
- Anything...

1203
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,630
Is it impossible to take three wins?

1204
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,400
- No, it's impossible for us.
- That's a little...

1205
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,829
Maybe later after we figure out
who has what.

1206
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:16,170
- But we should rather...
- If we're to bet huge in the beginning,

1207
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,369
we may have a chance...

1208
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:21,210
as long as they play safe.

1209
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:24,210
But we can't be sure about that
until the game begins.

1210
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,210
Goodness.

1211
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,050
- You look...
- Did you take the cards?

1212
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,150
We're darn lucky with cards.

1213
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:31,920
- Really?
- It's over again.

1214
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,719
- For real?
- Our cards are darn good.

1215
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,230
- This doesn't make sense.
- What the...

1216
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,789
- Yes.
- How can this be?

1217
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,730
Yes.

1218
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,099
- This is over for sure.
- Our cards...

1219
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,199
- are darn good.
- Goodness.

1220
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,969
- We have all the good ones.
- How nice.

1221
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,500
We don't have 6, 7, 8, and 9.

1222
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:49,500
- I love we don't have any middle numbers.
- It's over.

1223
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,769
We have 2 of 16.

1224
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:55,340
Which color should we go
with the 0 and 100 cards?

1225
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,679
We only have three red cards,

1226
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,510
so that should be the best choice...

1227
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,650
for us probabilistically.

1228
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,690
I'm wondering if we should
push it a little to the back...

1229
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,789
because if we do it in the beginning,
they might follow us.

1230
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,420
We also have to consider...

1231
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:10,260
that we have 2 cards of 1.
This is very good, you know.

1232
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,530
We may bring 2 cards of 1...

1233
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,900
along with something else.

1234
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,429
This move may be for someone
who can attack and play simple...

1235
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,940
while Steve and I bring uncertain cards...

1236
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,369
and play mind games with the other teams.

1237
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,769
Should we go...

1238
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,380
with 6 or 7 wins in total?

1239
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,280
I think our cards are good enough
for us to go with seven wins.

1240
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,179
- Let's go with seven wins.
- Got it.

1241
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,380
There are a total of 18 rounds.

1242
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,690
If we were to say
the three teams take wins evenly,

1243
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,449
the average number would be six.

1244
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,219
But we were very lucky with cards,

1245
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:43,289
which got us to think
we could control the number of wins.

1246
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,190
So we decided to go with 7,
a win higher than 6.

1247
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,199
Please name your player...

1248
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:50,300
for the first round each...

1249
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,829
in the order of Team Paradise,
Team Mansion, and Team Remaining.

1250
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,639
Choi Hye Seon.

1251
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,239
Chungju-Man.

1252
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:56,670
MJ Kim.

1253
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:57,940
Joo Eon Kyu.

1254
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,170
Kim Min A.

1255
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:00,710
Si Yoon.

1256
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,679
- Steve Yea.
- Lee Gina.

1257
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,849
Acau.

1258
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,650
Your player for the fourth round each.

1259
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,780
- Hong Jin Ho.
- Kim Kyung Ran.

1260
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,920
Jang Dong Min.

1261
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,949
- Lim Hyun Seo.
- Lee Gina.

1262
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,420
- Heo Seong Beom.
- Pani Bottle.

1263
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,659
- Kim Min A.
- Jang Dong Min.

1264
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,760
Now,
you'll predict a total number of wins.

1265
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,800
All teams,
please reveal your cards at the same time.

1266
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,869
Open the cards now.

1267
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,670
Team Paradise, seven wins.

1268
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,369
Team Mansion, six wins.

1269
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,679
Team Remaining, seven wins.

1270
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,480
You've now predicted
a total number of wins.

1271
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,880
(Team Paradise, Team Mansion,
Team Remaining)

1272
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,150
(A total of wins predicted:
7 wins, 6 wins, 7 wins)

1273
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,050
Dong Min will play twice.

1274
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:48,590
For this team,
Min A and Gina will play twice.

1275
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,260
All the players are
the former members of "The Genius."

1276
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,829
I wonder whose brain melted down.

1277
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,230
- Let's see whose brain...
- This will be...

1278
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:59,099
- lost touch along with time.
- about who aged more.

1279
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,440
A match about who aged more.

1280
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:03,610
I'll encounter them
during the fourth round.

1281
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,309
Everyone thinks
the fourth round is important.

1282
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:07,840
- Wait.
- This may be harder.

1283
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,010
- Let's check their characteristics.
- All right.

1284
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,780
- MJ...
- Considering this order of players,

1285
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,219
- I doubt they'll ever bring 100.
- They might play safe.

1286
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:20,920
I think the 3rd to 5th rounds
will be very fierce.

1287
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,389
There will be Steve, Acau,

1288
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:25,829
Jin Ho, Kyung Ran, and Dong Min.

1289
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,659
There will be Hyun Seo and Seong Beom too.

1290
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,800
The way I see it, we should...

1291
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,230
go with no wins for the first round.

1292
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:35,869
We've predicted seven wins,

1293
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:39,969
so it should be very unexpected
to have a zero-win strategy.

1294
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,739
We may be the only team that earns points
in the first round.

1295
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,980
We better bring a big number.

1296
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,949
It's a way to play the first round...

1297
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,619
with 16, 1, and 1.

1298
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,559
I think we can save 16 and use 14.

1299
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,260
It's the highest
unless they play green 16.

1300
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,730
- Shouldn't it be better to play this?
- Right.

1301
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,059
Since it's a must-win.

1302
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,000
Fourteen, three...

1303
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,000
For the first round.

1304
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,739
- Let's go with these.
- We can say it's a strong combo.

1305
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,170
We'll be safe as long as
we don't come across this variable.

1306
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,409
If one of the other teams...

1307
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,940
plays green 16...

1308
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,880
or plays 100 to win.

1309
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,820
I keep telling you
that nothing is for sure in this game.

1310
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,349
In any case, we have to make a move...

1311
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:25,190
that has 90 or 80 percent of winning.

1312
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,960
There will be nothing we can do
if we're unlucky.

1313
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,019
Victory or Defeat Prediction
will now begin.

1314
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:33,429
The first-round player in each team,
please gather at the Main Hall...

1315
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:34,829
with your cards for the first round.

1316
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:38,099
(Choi Hye Seon, Chungju-Man, MJ Kim)

1317
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:40,969
I was carrying such good cards,

1318
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,809
so I thought
there wouldn't be a second option...

1319
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,070
and that this was the best strategy
we had.

1320
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,639
Honestly speaking,
I didn't know much about them.

1321
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,750
I thought I was up against...

1322
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,349
quite the easy opponents.

1323
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,980
I was thinking that my team...

1324
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,219
would win this round.

1325
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,789
Let me tell you the order
for the first round.

1326
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:02,960
MJ Kim, you will go first...

1327
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,289
since you have the lowest number.

1328
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,329
I will reveal the open card.

1329
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,030
(The first open card)

1330
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,730
It's yellow 16.

1331
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:14,940
Please predict the number of wins
for the first round.

1332
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,769
Reveal the cards at once.

1333
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:22,679
Team Paradise, one win.

1334
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,280
Team Mansion, two wins.

1335
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:25,510
Team Remaining,

1336
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,050
no wins.

1337
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,849
I felt so lost to begin with...

1338
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,789
because MJ predicted no wins.

1339
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:37,559
Our strategy was
to have 1 win and 2 defeats.

1340
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,530
Predicting no wins...

1341
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,800
meant their numbers were very low
and that they were meaning to lose.

1342
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,429
I wondered if I could lose two times
with what I had.

1343
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,900
(Team Remaining is highly likely
to have 3 low numbers.)

1344
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,000
I did exactly what we agreed to do.

1345
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,170
We've predicted a total of 7 wins,

1346
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,980
so I think it's very unlikely
for us to predict zero wins.

1347
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,750
Let's see
if you're going to use the double item.

1348
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:02,019
Please place the coin on the table
and cover it with your hand.

1349
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:06,250
(Green: To use the double item)

1350
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,789
Reveal them at once.

1351
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:14,260
Team Mansion has used the double item.

1352
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,230
We agreed to play for high stakes
no matter what,

1353
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,730
earn many points in the beginning,

1354
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,099
and play safe in the later rounds.

1355
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:23,440
Let's begin the first round.

1356
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:26,409
MJ Kim, you're first to play.

1357
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:28,110
Please submit one of your cards.

1358
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:34,420
You've submitted green one.

1359
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,420
(Paradise's cards: 14, 3, 3)

1360
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,920
Choi Hye Seon,
please submit one of your cards.

1361
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:40,219
We'll be safe as long as
we don't come across this variable.

1362
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,889
If one of the other teams...

1363
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,730
plays green 16 or plays 100 to win.

1364
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,539
It's green 14.

1365
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,670
Chungju-Man,
please submit one of your cards.

1366
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,920
It's green 16.

1367
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,019
Its color is the same
as the first player's card.

1368
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,619
Chungju-Man, you have submitted...

1369
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,059
the highest number, 16.
Thus, the 1st win goes to you.

1370
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:22,059
The only case of losing with green 14...

1371
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,369
was to have another player
submit green 16.

1372
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:28,469
But he submitted that very green 16 card.

1373
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,340
I was so lost.

1374
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,510
Let's move on to the next turn.

1375
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,750
The open card is green eight.

1376
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,820
The winner of the previous turn,
Chungju-Man,

1377
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,280
submit your card.

1378
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,849
(Mansion's cards)

1379
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,989
It's red 13.

1380
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,530
MJ Kim, please submit your card.

1381
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,130
It's red two.

1382
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:01,340
Choi Hye Seon, please submit your card.

1383
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,570
It's yellow three.

1384
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,510
Of the same-colored cards
as the red card...

1385
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,739
that the first player submitted,

1386
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,650
Chungju-Man's card is the highest.

1387
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,880
Thus, he is the winner of this turn.

1388
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,079
(Chungju-Man, 2 wins)

1389
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,480
Let's move on to the next turn.

1390
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,789
I needed to win once somehow...

1391
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:21,889
with the cards I brought to lose.

1392
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:24,889
And Chungju-Man already submitted
two high-numbered cards...

1393
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:27,460
while MJ predicted zero wins.

1394
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,599
I thought I had a chance to win
with blue three.

1395
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:33,230
The winner of the previous turn,
Chungju-Man,

1396
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,639
submit your card.

1397
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:37,409
(Chungju-Man's turn)

1398
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,639
It's 100.

1399
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:39,710
(He plays the 100 card.)

1400
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,639
(Hye Seon has lost.)

1401
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,210
He played the 100 card again.

1402
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:47,480
Things went terribly wrong.

1403
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,550
MJ Kim, submit your card.

1404
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,789
It's a blue one card.

1405
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,420
Choi Hye Seon, submit your card.

1406
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,289
It's a blue three card.

1407
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,599
Chungju-Man who submitted the 100 card...

1408
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,760
wins this turn.

1409
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,099
(Round 1, Mansion,
Prediction: 2 wins, Current: 3 wins)

1410
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:09,400
Anyone would think
it was right to take three wins.

1411
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:10,639
It's a shame.

1412
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,710
Choi Hye Seon took 0 wins
after predicting 1 win.

1413
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:18,380
Chungju-Man took 3 wins
after predicting 2 wins.

1414
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:22,219
MJ Kim took 0 wins
after predicting 0 wins in Round 1.

1415
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,920
Your prediction was correct.

1416
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,519
You've earned ten points.

1417
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,090
Round One has ended.

1418
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,289
- Oh, my.
- Only our team has earned points.

1419
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,059
- Yes! I told you.
- Be quiet.

1420
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,630
- Hurry up.
- I told you. Darn it.

1421
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,829
They even lost the double item.

1422
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,739
- Which team?
- They lost the double item.

1423
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,840
- Mansion.
- They lost the double item?

1424
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,170
They even used the 100 card.

1425
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,239
- They used the 100 card?
- Yes, they did.

1426
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,409
They used the 100 card. Okay.

1427
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:50,039
Our strategy for Round One...

1428
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:51,409
was to take zero wins.

1429
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,550
We predicted that Team Paradise
would do their best in Round One.

1430
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,389
We thought
Team Mansion would also do their best.

1431
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:01,590
And we thought we would take zero wins
in the meantime.

1432
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,829
These novices took the bait.

1433
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:07,829
These jerks are dead today.

1434
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,599
It's good that the relationship of the two
went sour.

1435
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,000
They must've argued.

1436
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:13,599
Chungju-Man must have a mental breakdown.

1437
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,610
- No?
- We took three wins.

1438
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,780
- I knew it.
- They all had cards with small numbers.

1439
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:24,280
There's nothing we can do as the strategy
failed. I'm having a mental breakdown.

1440
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:26,409
- We used the double item as well.
- Yes.

1441
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,019
We should've predicted
that we would take three wins earlier.

1442
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:32,519
Prediction is important in the end.

1443
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:34,360
- It's very disappointing.
- Yes.

1444
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,889
- But it was a nice try.
- Yes.

1445
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:36,960
- Right.
- It went wrong.

1446
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,630
In the end, the strategy was good,
but it didn't work out.

1447
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,800
It's very disappointing.

1448
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,000
It drained my energy.

1449
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:45,570
Anyway,
Paradise also got it wrong because of us.

1450
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,699
- Yes. That's true.
- You're right.

1451
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,739
We just died together.

1452
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,610
- It's not bad.
- Right.

1453
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,409
- Did it go well?
- How did it go?

1454
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,179
It must be ambiguous.

1455
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,949
Mansion lost 10 points.
We also lost 10 points.

1456
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:03,650
Team Remaining earned ten points.

1457
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,050
- But Mansion used the double item.
- What?

1458
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,019
They used the double item
and the 100 card.

1459
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:10,119
And we were so unlucky.

1460
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,130
They got a green 16 at 1st.

1461
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,760
And Team Remaining took zero wins.

1462
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,429
It's annoying that they had a green 16.

1463
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,639
A green 16 is really...

1464
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:23,039
It rarely happens.

1465
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,309
That's why we thought we would likely win.

1466
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:28,880
- Remaining predicted zero wins?
- Yes.

1467
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,440
And they kept losing?

1468
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,650
Yes. And they earned ten points.

1469
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,579
How can all their predictions be wrong
from the first round?

1470
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,750
That's why
those jerks shouldn't mess up with us.

1471
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:41,559
It's crazy.

1472
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,090
The difference in our scores is 20 points.

1473
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,889
We should just earn 20 points
in the next round.

1474
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,500
Let's put ourselves in their shoes now.

1475
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,829
I think...

1476
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:55,170
they would want to take one win at least
because they want to play safe.

1477
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,170
They might not want to take one win.
I think this is what they would think.

1478
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,739
They predicted six wins.

1479
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:03,639
And they already took 3 wins in Round 1.

1480
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:04,809
They're doomed.

1481
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,219
We can just think
they didn't earn 50 points.

1482
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:09,679
This is important.

1483
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,019
This will make a difference.

1484
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:13,150
Whether our overall predictions
are right or wrong will make a difference.

1485
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,190
Right.

1486
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,860
I think we will all try to play
to match the prediction in the end.

1487
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,789
We already won three turns.

1488
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,829
- We should take 3 more wins.
- We should aim to win 3...

1489
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:24,500
- out of five rounds.
- Yes.

1490
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,869
Honestly, we should think
we wouldn't get 50 points.

1491
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,000
Okay. What should we do in Round Two?

1492
01:04:30,469 --> 01:04:32,309
- I think we should bet safely.
- Yes.

1493
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,840
Let's keep predicting
we will take one win.

1494
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,940
Let's take 6, 7, and 8...

1495
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,309
- Let's do that.
- and try...

1496
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:39,480
to take one win.

1497
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,619
(Round 2, Remaining, Score: 110 points,
Prediction: 7 wins, Current: 0 wins)

1498
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,250
They shouldn't win.

1499
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,619
They shouldn't win anymore.

1500
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,949
So they will bring cards
with smaller numbers.

1501
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,989
- It's a fight against Paradise.
- We need to make their prediction wrong.

1502
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:50,320
It's a fight against Paradise.

1503
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,360
They will try to take two wins
no matter what.

1504
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,099
We could have 2 wins and 1 loss.

1505
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,429
If we have 2 wins and 1 loss,
it's 30 times 2,

1506
01:04:57,429 --> 01:04:58,969
so we can earn 60 points.

1507
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,000
It might be safe that way.

1508
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:04,539
- Then they will have two wins this time.
- But we should also think about this.

1509
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:06,639
We used cards with small numbers.

1510
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:09,940
So they might think
we'll play cards with big numbers.

1511
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:13,010
So they're likely to bring a card
with a small number at least once.

1512
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,119
So Team Paradise...

1513
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,949
- will play safe.
- No. It's not safe.

1514
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:20,860
They predicted seven wins.

1515
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,219
So they can't aim
to have 0 wins in 2 rounds.

1516
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,460
They would think
they must take two wins this round.

1517
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,800
All we have to do is to stop them
taking two wins.

1518
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,099
That's our strategy.

1519
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:34,699
- We should take two wins.
- Good.

1520
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,670
- Why?
- What are we going to do in Round Two?

1521
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,610
- We'll take this for Round Two.
- Isn't this one?

1522
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,610
Right away?

1523
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,380
So let's go with this in Round Two.

1524
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,179
- Yes.
- I'll bring this.

1525
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:45,110
We'll 100 percent lose with the 0 card.

1526
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,610
And we'll 100 percent win
with the 100 card.

1527
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,849
And we have a chance...

1528
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,250
to double our score.

1529
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,550
I think everyone will wait for the moment.

1530
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,889
But there might be a variable.

1531
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:54,260
The team that plans their strategy...

1532
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,389
with the variable in mind will likely win.

1533
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:57,860
So we're using the double item this time?

1534
01:05:58,059 --> 01:05:59,659
You're using the double item this time.

1535
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,260
- Yes.
- The double item.

1536
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,429
I think Dong Min...

1537
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:05,130
would want to bring the 100 card
in later rounds.

1538
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:09,170
He would think he'll be able to take
control after seeing the remaining cards.

1539
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,110
So are we using the double item?

1540
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:13,909
- No. Not now.
- No?

1541
01:06:13,909 --> 01:06:16,480
We should keep it as the last resort.

1542
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,309
In the next round,
if we play the 100 card,

1543
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,250
we'll win no matter what. After winning...

1544
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,150
We should play those cards
after we're done counting.

1545
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:28,960
If they all played the 0 card
until Round 3 or 4,

1546
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,159
with that assumption,

1547
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,699
we'll play the 100 card
and use the double item...

1548
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,500
to take two wins.

1549
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,670
I saw Team Mansion take out the 100 card
in Round 1.

1550
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:41,670
I thought Dong Min on Team Remaining...

1551
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:44,940
would play good cards in later rounds.

1552
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,010
I thought they would keep
100, 16, and 0...

1553
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,380
to have 2 wins and 1 loss...

1554
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,679
to play safe.

1555
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:52,909
We must not lose...

1556
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:54,750
the momentum to win this time.

1557
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:56,619
This time, we...

1558
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:58,050
We'll earn a lot of points.

1559
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:00,789
I'll turn the tables this time.

1560
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:03,719
Done. There's no more strategy.

1561
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,860
I still have a thirst to win.

1562
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:10,030
All players for Round 2 from each team,
please gather in the Main Hall...

1563
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,429
with your cards for Round Two.

1564
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:15,199
(Paradise: Joo Eon Kyu,
Mansion: Kim Min A, Remaining: Si Yoon)

1565
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,340
I should show them.

1566
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,610
I really don't like it
when my pride is hurt.

1567
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,309
We already have
the energy of the universe.

1568
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:26,250
Joo Eon Kyu will play first this turn...

1569
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,750
as he has a card with the smallest number.

1570
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:33,219
I will reveal the open card.

1571
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:34,519
(The first open card)

1572
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,320
It's a red 14 card.

1573
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,800
I brought 0, 100, and 16.

1574
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,400
The 16 card is red.

1575
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,699
So I thought...

1576
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,170
a red card should be put down...

1577
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,539
to take a win safely.

1578
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,570
When she revealed the first card,
it was red.

1579
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:52,969
I thought I would make it.

1580
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:56,639
Please predict the number of wins
for Round Two.

1581
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,179
Reveal the card.

1582
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,349
Team Paradise predicted two wins.

1583
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,920
Team Mansion predicted one win.

1584
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,320
Team Remaining predicted two wins.

1585
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,219
Let's see
if you're going to use the double item.

1586
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,760
Reveal them at once.

1587
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,300
Team Paradise has used the double item.

1588
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:27,109
(Round 2 Predictions, Paradise: 2 wins,
Mansion: 1 win, Remaining: 2 wins)

1589
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:28,680
Let's begin Round Two.

1590
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,779
Eon Kyu, submit your card first.

1591
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:37,949
It's a red 16 card.

1592
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,529
Min A, submit your card.

1593
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:49,899
It's a blue eight card.

1594
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:53,100
Si Yoon, submit your card.

1595
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,239
Wait. He put down 16?

1596
01:08:57,239 --> 01:09:00,510
(Si Yoon should stop Eon Kyu
from taking 2 wins.)

1597
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:02,979
The opponent brought the best card.

1598
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:08,649
We didn't have 16.

1599
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:14,789
(Team Remaining doesn't have 16.)

1600
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,260
It's a 100 card.

1601
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,600
(He submits the 100 card.)

1602
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:29,840
Si Yoon who submitted the 100 card
wins this turn.

1603
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,439
(Si Yoon has taken 1 win.)

1604
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:38,479
They will definitely use
the double item this time.

1605
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:40,579
They'll use the double item.

1606
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,079
I was 100 percent confident about it.

1607
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:43,880
The cards that make
the best combination...

1608
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,090
with the double item...

1609
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,890
are 100, 16, and 0.

1610
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:50,420
It's those cards.

1611
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,930
I thought they would bring those cards.

1612
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:55,630
The timing of when you play
the 100 card is important.

1613
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:58,000
Yes. But what if they don't bring
the 100 card?

1614
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,529
What if Team Paradise doesn't bring it?

1615
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,100
It can't happen.

1616
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:03,170
Because they must take two wins now.

1617
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,369
I was certain.

1618
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:09,439
You know what I mean, right?
If they submit 16, you must play 100.

1619
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,010
Got it?

1620
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,250
It's a red 16 card.

1621
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,020
Eon Kyu submitted the 16 card.

1622
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,750
It's one of Dong Min's scenarios.

1623
01:10:17,989 --> 01:10:20,020
They brought 16, 0, 100,
and the double item.

1624
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,420
It means they want to earn points
and take a win every time.

1625
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,529
How many moves ahead did he see?

1626
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:28,260
(Team Paradise had to win
with the 16 card.)

1627
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,659
Let's move on to the next turn.

1628
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,729
I will reveal the open card.

1629
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,470
It's a red three card.

1630
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:37,909
The winner of the previous turn,
Si Yoon, submit your card.

1631
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:46,710
It's a blue 14 card.

1632
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:49,680
Eon Kyu, submit your card.

1633
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,750
(Paradise's cards: 0, 100)

1634
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,829
When the red card was put down at first,
I thought I would make it.

1635
01:10:57,829 --> 01:10:59,829
So I submitted the red 16 card.

1636
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:01,760
But he put down the 100 card.

1637
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,260
"Gosh, Dong Min..."

1638
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:09,800
"thought of this."

1639
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:13,409
The remaining cards were 100 and 0.

1640
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,579
I had no other way.

1641
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:16,579
(Eon Kyu's prediction to take 2 wins
will be wrong no matter what.)

1642
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:19,909
I was like, "I'm doomed."
It was over at that moment.

1643
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:22,180
"We're better players."

1644
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,689
I wanted to break their momentum.

1645
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:29,989
I don't think
I've ever been that shocked before.

1646
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:37,430
It's a zero card.

1647
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:41,100
The moment Eon Kyu put down the 16 card,

1648
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,100
the result of the game was almost decided.

1649
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,369
I saw his face.

1650
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,210
There are six facial expressions
humans can't hide.

1651
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:52,750
He was making one of them. Sadness.

1652
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:57,020
Min A, submit your card.

1653
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,619
It's a blue seven card.

1654
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,359
None of the cards has the same color
as the open card.

1655
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:06,590
Si Yoon who submitted the red 14 card
wins.

1656
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,300
(Si Yoon has taken 2 wins.)

1657
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,859
Let's move on to the next turn.

1658
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I will reveal the open card.

1659
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,439
It's a yellow five card.

1660
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,039
Si Yoon, submit your card first.

1661
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,340
It's a blue 15 card.

1662
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,350
Eon Kyu, submit your card.

1663
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,119
It's a 100 card.

1664
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,229
Min A, submit your card.

1665
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,829
It's a six card.

1666
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:47,899
Eon Kyu who submitted the 100 card
wins this turn.

1667
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:50,199
(Joo Eon Kyu has taken 1 win.)

1668
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,869
We lost the double item.

1669
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:53,369
We lost the 100 card.

1670
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,680
We lost the 0 card.

1671
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,239
We lost the card with a big number.

1672
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:00,550
Gosh, my mind felt completely empty.

1673
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:04,590
And I just wanted to erase this moment
from my life.

1674
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:07,189
Joo Eon Kyu took one win...

1675
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:08,760
after predicting 2 wins in Round 2.

1676
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,489
Kim Min A took zero wins...

1677
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:12,930
after predicting 1 win in Round 2.

1678
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,159
Si Yoon took two wins...

1679
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:16,500
after predicting 2 wins in Round 2.

1680
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:20,100
Your prediction was correct.
You've earned 30 points.

1681
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:25,140
(Paradise: 80, Mansion: 80,
and Remaining: 140)
