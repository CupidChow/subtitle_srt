1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,940
All games of the day have ended.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,250
The Mansion players may return
to their survival ground.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,580
That was a good rest.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,880
- Didn't you have a fan?
- You want to go back down?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,880
They didn't give you a fan?

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,720
Do you want to have a meeting in prison?

7
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,019
Everyone's asleep, right?

8
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,050
Yes.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,190
We thought that yesterday was
our one and only chance.

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,890
And it turned out
that we only had to have...

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,260
the key on us when the 90 minutes ended.

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,359
The private funds are under the staircase,

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,199
so we can open the vault...

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,170
in the dealer's room with the key.

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,570
- We can get all the money out.
- Get all the money out of the vault,

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,170
and hold the money.

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,469
- Then, lock it.
- And lock the vault.

18
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,439
Here's the Hidden Rule.

19
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:44,320
(After the Deathmatch player has
been confirmed)

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,689
(The player can steal
from the safe boxes in the Paradise.)

21
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,460
There's a private funds key.

22
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,530
The winner of the first individual match
after the team match...

23
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,200
becomes the ultimate power holder...

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,500
and gets the right
to form the teams as they want.

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,400
The empty safe box in the Paradise...

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
will be filled with the private funds key
and a significant amount of funds.

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,379
And the players from outside
may steal them.

28
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,209
I thought that I was finally escaping
from this place,

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,680
and we went back to prison
and had a meeting.

30
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,920
I thought I was going insane.

31
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,980
"When can I get away from this place?"

32
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,590
When we hold the key after 90 minutes,

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,920
it becomes our money.

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,620
I was like, "Okay." I liked that.

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,459
"Money is good."

36
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,189
"Let's give it a try."

37
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,129
It's good that we played a game here.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,230
Steve rarely sleeps.

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,769
We don't want them to wake up.

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,569
The most important part is
that they don't wake up.

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
- Let's just go.
- They shouldn't wake up.

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Let's go.

43
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,510
No one should be around, right?

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,659
Don't make any noise.

45
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,989
No noises. Be careful.

46
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,629
Slowly.

47
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,430
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

48
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,439
Start.

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,610
Take it slow.

50
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:20,949
Slowly.

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,020
(Team Mansion splits up.)

52
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,050
(Gina goes under the 2nd-floor staircase.)

53
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,759
(Min A and Chungju-Man are
in the 2nd-floor pantry.)

54
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,759
Let's go.

55
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,629
- Go on.
- Okay.

56
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,469
(Xitsuh and Yurisa are on the 3rd floor.)

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
They won't mind us, anyway.

58
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,909
(Steve)

59
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,310
They're passed out.

60
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,240
(Hyun Seo, Pani Bottle)

61
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,960
(Beeping)

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It won't turn.

63
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,830
- Why doesn't it turn?
- Let's hold it up.

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Try again.

65
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,080
(But Hye Seon can't hear the sound
in her room.)

66
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,000
(100,000 dollars
in the 3rd-floor safe box)

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Let's go.

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
We've got time.

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,870
(100,000 dollars
in the safe box in the 2nd-floor pantry)

70
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,400
(Getting the private funds key)

71
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,539
Let's get out of here.

72
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,039
Come on.

73
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,389
Don't hold it in your hand.

74
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,899
Did you open it?

75
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,970
Did you open it?

76
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,040
It locks from the inside.

77
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,610
- We can take our time.
- Okay.

78
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,949
Here it is.

79
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,019
I felt like I was drunk.

80
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,220
There was so much money.
Every bundle was so heavy.

81
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,550
This is amazing.

82
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,360
It was such a rare experience,

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
so I was trembling.

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,889
I was nervous and excited.

85
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,689
But if we succeed,

86
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,629
we can steal all their private funds.

87
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,230
We were the best.

88
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,199
Open it.

89
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,970
- Come on in.
- Hurry.

90
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,709
We can lock it.

91
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,569
- It doesn't open once it's locked.
- It doesn't?

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,139
- It doesn't, but are there any risks?
- It doesn't.

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm sure they won't know.

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,480
What's considered as being caught?

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,519
(The meeting before the looting)

96
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,889
- Getting caught is fine.
- Yes, but they can take it away.

97
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:14,889
You can't let them take it.

98
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,589
Even if the alarm sounds,
notifying them of intruders,

99
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,660
they can't open the vault.

100
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,319
Right. They can't come in.

101
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,829
It did sound reasonable to me.

102
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,430
We didn't have to run with it.

103
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,959
We just had to hold on to it
for 90 minutes.

104
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,360
Then, we'd need a place to hide.

105
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,300
We thought they would think
that we ran away.

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,470
So, we decided to go into the vault.

107
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:31,769
This is so fun.

108
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,139
This is incredible.

109
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,410
It's 1,000 dollars per bundle.

110
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,279
These are ten bundles.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,550
Three, four, five, six...

112
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,180
- Please succeed.
- Let's see.

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
- How much is that?
- How much is that?

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,949
- It's 390,000 dollars.
- It's 390,000 dollars?

115
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,689
We're five people.

116
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,259
So, we can get 70,000 dollars each.

117
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,459
Are they all knocked out?

118
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,329
- Totally knocked out.
- Good.

119
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,569
(It's been 17 minutes
since the looting began.)

120
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,370
Hasn't it been almost 20 minutes?

121
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,040
- It's about time it went off.
- Yes.

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,310
But it hasn't gone off yet,

123
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,339
so it hasn't been 20 minutes.

124
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,540
I think it's almost time.

125
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,410
So, we have all the time in the world.

126
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,180
- Exactly.
- As long as we don't get caught.

127
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,420
If we do, they can come in because...

128
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,790
I noticed that they smashed everything
with a sledgehammer.

129
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,790
Oh, right.

130
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,060
They smashed everything
with a sledgehammer.

131
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,629
- And they can surely break this door.
- Right.

132
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,029
Should we have run away?

133
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,829
- It's too late now.
- Yes.

134
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,000
We need to secure it, no matter what.

135
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,529
- It's going off.
- Crap.

136
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,629
- Now, we need to pray.
- Let's pray.

137
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,839
- This is the textbook and best method.
- Right.

138
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't worry too much.

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,310
You don't often come into the vault.

140
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,410
So, I thought we had a shot.

141
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,779
The box was too heavy,

142
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,079
so they could have thought
that we had run away.

143
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,220
So, we decided to hide in the vault.

144
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,519
(It's been 20 minutes
since the looting began.)

145
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,800
They came back. Gosh.

146
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
As soon as the alarm went off, I got up...

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,269
and swore, "They're at it again."

148
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,639
I went to bed,
thinking that it wouldn't be today.

149
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,040
I actually...

150
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,579
yelled as I got up when the alarm sounded.

151
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,050
What?

152
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,689
I probably slept for about 2 to 3 hours.

153
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,389
And the siren started going off.

154
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,290
Hyun Seo and the others were...

155
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,319
already running outside.

156
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,759
(They start searching.)

157
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
What is it?

158
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,910
(Noises)

159
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,379
- They're searching.
- Whatever.

160
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,259
Did it go off
after the situation was over?

161
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,660
What could they have stolen? Money,

162
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,230
snacks...

163
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
But it's too...

164
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
This is too bizarre.

165
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,139
How did they make it look
like they actually robbed the place?

166
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,980
It's saying, "We robbed the place."

167
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,750
The chips were too...

168
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,350
Well, you could drop them.

169
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,450
But you don't drop them
like in "Hansel and Gretel."

170
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,620
I saw them on the ground,

171
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,289
so I knew it was a decoy.

172
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,519
I got the strong impression
that they were up to something else.

173
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,389
But there was no one,
however hard we looked.

174
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Did they rob the vault?

175
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,610
It's locked.

176
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,110
- It's locked?
- Yes.

177
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,960
It was so nerve-racking.

178
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,990
Not because I just got out of prison,

179
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,460
but I knew I couldn't live as a thief.

180
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Even if...

181
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,269
they pull harder...

182
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,539
Is there a key that locks it?

183
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,649
We can't open this, right?

184
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,309
I don't know anything about that.

185
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,029
We were inside,

186
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,000
and we were so nervous
about making the tiniest sound.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,570
It was so tense.

188
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,669
I was like, "Please."

189
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,039
"How could we endure
70 more minutes like this?"

190
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,740
We should have run away with it.

191
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,480
I was having a nervous breakdown.

192
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,289
(Hye Seon lives without any doubts.)

193
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,860
I'm worried about the alarm
that will go off at 40 minutes.

194
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,830
(It's been 31 minutes
since the looting began.)

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,299
They could just guard the vault,
thinking that our mission was...

196
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,200
to open the vault.

197
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,080
(Searching the vicinity again)

198
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,210
I went to look for them in the vault,

199
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,779
but I didn't see anyone there.

200
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,509
I'll go downstairs too.

201
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,750
I can't tell...

202
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:46,649
if they opened the vault or not.

203
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,389
It would have been open
if they had opened it.

204
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,559
(It's been 40 minutes
since the looting began.)

205
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,629
What?

206
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,899
What?

207
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:02,799
It's been 40 minutes now.

208
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,610
What?

209
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
What is it?

210
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Why did it go off?

211
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,110
Something's not right.

212
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,279
The vault?

213
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,730
(Jolting)

214
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,379
Guys.

215
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,809
There's a prisoner in the vault.

216
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,009
I think there's a prisoner.

217
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,450
- I think there's a prisoner inside.
- What?

218
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,059
I didn't see anyone through this earlier,

219
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,759
but I think I see
a prisoner's uniform now.

220
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,759
Let me take a look.

221
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,960
I was trying to wait...

222
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,059
without making a sound...

223
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,929
and looking through the crack.

224
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,429
But nothing was moving,

225
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,100
so I stepped out, thinking,

226
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,340
"It's a vault, so it must be locked."

227
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,970
I went back to take a look,

228
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:15,509
and there was a silhouette,

229
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,970
which I hadn't seen before.

230
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,580
I was certain that there was a person.

231
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,210
It's not actually moving.

232
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,309
It's still.

233
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,080
No, I didn't even see any clothes earlier.

234
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,679
I'll go and ask
if there's anyone in prison.

235
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,889
Is there anyone in prison?

236
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
- No.
- No, right?

237
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,389
I think they're in the vault.

238
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,159
I think it's a uniform.

239
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,399
I didn't see anything earlier
through the crack.

240
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,700
But there's an edge of a shirt now.

241
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
It's the color of the prisoner's uniform.

242
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,970
We heard people outside,

243
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,710
and every time the door rattled,

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,909
so did my heart.

245
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,779
It was just...

246
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,480
We tried to hang in there,

247
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,950
so we stayed still.

248
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,080
How did they...

249
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,320
Oh, gosh.

250
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,690
But without a key...

251
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,220
It won't move, right?

252
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,389
- No.
- It won't.

253
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,429
How can they sit still for so long?

254
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:10,529
Does it end when we catch them?

255
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,259
Are you sure there's someone inside?

256
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,330
I think so.

257
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,769
- Should we catch them?
- No, it's...

258
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,340
We can get the sledgehammer.

259
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,009
We could have done it so much better...

260
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,940
because we knew they had a sledgehammer.

261
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,610
We should have brought it in with us.

262
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,889
- Get out of the way.
- You already got it?

263
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,830
Move away.

264
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,070
I didn't know they were so primitive.

265
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,610
They were smashing the door, and...

266
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,179
"The sledgehammer is here, at last."

267
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,279
The heaviness of the sound...

268
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,080
made me realize what it would feel like...

269
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,820
if a shell blew up next to me
in the middle of a war.

270
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,149
The whole floor shook,

271
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,659
and I thought my eardrums...

272
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,259
and my heart were both exploding.

273
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,960
I had never experienced...

274
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,259
being in a situation
where someone was smashing...

275
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,529
the room I was in with a sledgehammer.

276
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,700
I literally felt a threat to survival,

277
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,840
and I was terrified.

278
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,379
It doesn't move.

279
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,350
- They're in here.
- They are?

280
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,679
- They're inside.
- Seriously?

281
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,649
- There's a white windbreaker.
- Yes.

282
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,690
A windbreaker?
That's not a prisoner, then.

283
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,090
- A prisoner isn't wearing a windbreaker.
- Should we pull it?

284
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,559
- Let's pull it.
- They're definitely inside.

285
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,029
They're sitting.

286
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,789
We're smashing the door soon. Get out now.

287
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,059
It's too late now.

288
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,299
Where should I hit to...

289
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,899
- Just smash the door itself.
- The door?

290
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,139
The whole team promised...

291
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,850
to stay still, even if the door broke.

292
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,350
They might not be able
to come in until the end.

293
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,549
I was terrified,

294
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,450
but I stayed still.

295
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,919
Gosh.

296
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,559
- Just come outside.
- Guys.

297
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,090
- Come outside.
- Who?

298
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,090
Who is it?

299
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,159
- They have their heads down.
- What?

300
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,629
- I see.
- And they stole all the money in a bag.

301
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,230
You should have come out with it.

302
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,570
What you saw was the end of a sack,
not clothes.

303
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,840
I'll keep smashing, then.

304
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,750
- Wait. We'll come out.
- Is that Chungju-Man?

305
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,049
- We'll come out.
- Come on out.

306
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,789
It was Chungju-Man.

307
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,019
Chungju-Man?

308
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,830
- Come out.
- Wait. The whole team is here?

309
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,429
Oh, everyone's here.

310
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,659
What are you guys doing?

311
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,730
He's totally...

312
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,669
She looks like an actual criminal.

313
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:04,840
I can't even see her face.

314
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,009
We should have run with it.

315
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,179
I just couldn't accept
that it was over like that,

316
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,840
so I held the box in my arms...

317
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,549
and stayed still.

318
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,179
You know what? Let's split it.

319
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,279
Our strategy failed,

320
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,549
so we were defeated.

321
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,950
But I didn't want them to take everything.

322
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,690
We took the money
that wasn't going to you,

323
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,620
so let's split it in half.

324
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,059
- Split it?
- Yes.

325
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,259
I'll tell you the truth,
so promise me you'll split it.

326
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,360
Otherwise,
there's going to be a physical fight.

327
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,330
- Sure.
- Do it if you're confident.

328
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,840
We definitely have the upper hand
right now.

329
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,240
You're in no position to give orders.

330
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,169
He's just asking for a negotiation.

331
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,610
Let's take the benefit
without Team Remaining.

332
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,909
Because you're not losing anything
in this deal.

333
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,539
- Hang on.
- I'm going to.

334
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,149
The 60-minute alarm hasn't gone off yet.

335
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,190
Go away.

336
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,159
Leave them.

337
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,289
They're making a deal.

338
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,329
No.

339
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,960
You can't just take it with brute force...

340
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,930
when we're talking.

341
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
We're telling them right now.
We've got all the time.

342
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,970
We can't even run away with it.

343
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,569
We can get 100,000 dollars per safe box.

344
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,109
And we stole from exactly two safe boxes.

345
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,980
- Two safe boxes?
- Yes, two.

346
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,779
- That's 200,000 dollars.
- You couldn't have opened them, anyway.

347
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:22,910
Only we could have opened it.

348
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,950
So, if you promise to give us
100,000 dollars,

349
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,920
which you weren't supposed to have,
in the first place...

350
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,390
So, we're getting extra money, right?

351
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,589
Exactly. A total of 100,000 dollars.

352
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,519
- So, you share the 100,000 dollars,
- Yes.

353
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,019
- Yes, 100,000 dollars each.
- and we share 100,000 dollars?

354
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,029
Yes, 100,000 dollars each.

355
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,190
Put them in for now.

356
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Gosh.

357
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,170
It's totally ruined.

358
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,200
- Hug it.
- Yes.

359
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:46,799
Chungju-Man and Xitsuh were...

360
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,369
negotiating with the other team.

361
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,710
We took some money in the meantime.

362
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:51,809
We put some...

363
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,450
- Why don't we...
- They're putting it in their pockets.

364
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,480
What?

365
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,650
- Exactly.
- Get them...

366
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,079
Get them up first.

367
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,180
We can only get up
once you agree to our terms.

368
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,819
We're going to end it
when you give us a go as a team.

369
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,150
We'll take all the money out.

370
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,589
You're acting like you're entitled
to this negotiation.

371
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,259
- But you got caught.
- They're taking the money.

372
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,160
You got caught, and you're...

373
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,630
You can count them.

374
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,940
Yurisa and Gina were hugging it,

375
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,740
and we knew when it would end.

376
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,480
So, I thought we had a chance.

377
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,009
I was hoping for that.

378
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,450
Chungju-Man wants to...

379
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,220
Chungju-Man.

380
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,750
Chungju-Man.

381
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,509
What...

382
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,420
Why would you...

383
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,890
- Why are you trying to guard it?
- This is my jacket.

384
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,420
Why would you...

385
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,490
They held on to it and didn't let go,

386
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,890
so they pulled us...

387
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,759
and ripped the box apart.

388
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,589
They tried more violently...

389
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,660
to take it away with brute force.

390
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,400
We were unable to communicate already.

391
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,799
When we catch a criminal red-handed,
we confiscate the stuff first.

392
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,440
We confiscate their belongings.

393
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,140
That's due process.

394
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,369
We can just clean it up.

395
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,569
I'll move when it's negotiated.

396
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,210
No, we should have this up there.

397
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,740
I'll move when it's negotiated.

398
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,079
They were talking loudly,

399
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,710
and I was staying like this.

400
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,119
I was just hoping
the time would pass as they did.

401
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,650
"Why isn't the 60-minute alarm going off?"

402
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,490
So, you're suggesting
to give us 50 percent...

403
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,660
Exactly. We'll keep our promise.

404
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,970
Can you guys stop him?

405
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,339
Don't be so violent. She'll get hurt.

406
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,700
Don't do it.

407
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,809
She'll get hurt. Don't be so violent.

408
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,980
(It's been 53 minutes
since the looting began.)

409
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,279
I feel a sudden sense of reality.

410
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:11,210
When is the negotiation going to end?
This is killing me.

411
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:12,750
I'm not worried about you guys running.

412
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,079
I was so annoyed.

413
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,049
Like, "What are we doing?
We're supposed to take it away."

414
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,019
They were resisting very strongly.

415
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,619
I realized once again
that we should tie them up.

416
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,059
Then, let's give them 50,000 dollars.

417
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,559
Yes, let's negotiate.

418
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,559
We're telling you the truth.

419
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,759
No, there are so many lies within.

420
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,069
There are obviously lies, but...

421
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,470
But you've got nothing to lose.

422
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,900
You give me your word,
and I'll make them stand up.

423
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,369
And we'll only take 50,000 dollars.

424
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,839
I'll get them up, pour the rest,

425
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,440
and only take 50,000 dollars.
You have my word.

426
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Let's just do that.

427
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,940
Bring that here first.

428
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,750
Let's do that if that's the whole truth.

429
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
- Let's count them.
- Yes.

430
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,180
You all agree, right?

431
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,450
Then, we'll take out everything
that we have on us.

432
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,019
- Yes, do that.
- Happy?

433
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,019
Let's just show them.

434
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,150
Show them.

435
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,319
- Did they agree to the terms?
- I think so.

436
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,829
This is so maddening.

437
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,859
They agreed to it?

438
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,359
Gina, get up.

439
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,900
I'll lift her
if she doesn't get up in ten seconds.

440
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,230
Did the negotiation go through?

441
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,799
Get up. We don't have a choice.

442
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,369
- Eight.
- We can't fight them.

443
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,970
- Seven.
- She's up.

444
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,710
- Six.
- Take this with you.

445
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,380
You can take it. Get up.

446
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,039
- Hyun Seo, bring that here.
- Good work.

447
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,410
- Good work.
- I'm so exhausted. Let me stay here.

448
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,809
Do what you want.

449
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,619
I had been guarding it for 30 minutes,

450
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:21,690
and they just want me to get up...

451
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,690
with only 10,000 dollars?

452
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,549
Is that 10,000 dollars?

453
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,619
- Yes.
- Right here.

454
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,160
- Darn it.
- Count them.

455
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,230
No, check that one.

456
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,589
- We need to get Min A.
- Oh, right.

457
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,759
- She's not here.
- She's not here.

458
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,829
She ran with some in her clothes.

459
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,599
- Who?
- Min A.

460
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Where did Min A go?

461
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,400
(10 minutes before the negotiation)

462
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:46,609
I wasn't sure
they were reaching a deal or not,

463
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,809
so I told Yurisa first,

464
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,950
"I think I got about 100,000 dollars."

465
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,049
"Should I just run?"

466
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,180
And she told me to go.

467
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,750
So, I just bolted.

468
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,359
Min A ran away
when we were reaching a deal.

469
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,829
Darn it.

470
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,670
I'm in trouble.

471
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,980
I got her!

472
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,809
- Let me hold your arm.
- Okay.

473
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,109
Sorry.

474
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,210
I got her!

475
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,650
(Min A ended up getting caught.)

476
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,349
The deal almost broke down
because you were gone.

477
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,150
I apologize.

478
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,059
I wanted to survive.

479
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,500
You give it to us,
and we'll leave it here.

480
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,660
Count 50,000 dollars and give it to us.

481
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,730
That was our deal
when we put this on the table.

482
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,730
I mean...

483
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,569
You're only trying to get
10,000 dollars each, right?

484
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,039
- But Min A just ran.
- Yes.

485
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,140
- Take her portion out.
- You didn't catch her?

486
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,440
We caught her. Take her portion out.

487
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,470
Take 40,000 dollars.

488
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,839
I took it with me.

489
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,309
- Don't come in yet.
- You must have hidden it somewhere.

490
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,779
We need to leave the amount that she hid.

491
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,809
- Right.
- That's why we only took 40,000 dollars.

492
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,279
No, you need to leave the amount
that she hid.

493
00:22:58,349 --> 00:22:59,420
We all could have calmed down.

494
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,789
But they got more enraged as time went on.

495
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,750
I thought,
"Why are they taking it so far?"

496
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,190
Don't shove me.

497
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,089
I'm standing here
to stay away from the money.

498
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,130
Okay. I understand.

499
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,460
You throw a fit
when we're close to the money...

500
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,430
and throw a fit when we're away
from the money. What do you want us to do?

501
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,700
When did I throw a fit? Watch your mouth.

502
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,369
- You want to see me actually throw a fit?
- You can take 14,000.

503
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,430
- I'm putting you in the corner.
- You want us to take 14,000?

504
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,970
- Yes. Because...
- You can...

505
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,700
- she ran with the money.
- stand here.

506
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,839
And we were going to give you 40,000.

507
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,269
Put yourself in my shoes.
Should I be doing something else?

508
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,880
I didn't do anything.

509
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,910
You don't think I can swear?

510
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,250
Stop.

511
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,279
Be quiet. Just stand still.

512
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,250
Seriously.

513
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,819
I'm dumbfounded.

514
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,549
Who do they think they are
to take 40,000 dollars?

515
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,359
It's fair that we give them nothing.

516
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,319
Giving those clumsy thieves
that much money was just...

517
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,960
I find such situations tiring.

518
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,690
It wasn't like they were family enemies.

519
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,660
I was the oldest among them,

520
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,869
so I didn't want to let it go too far.
I suggested that we take the benefit,

521
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:51,700
provided that there aren't any risks.

522
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,000
I said, "Though you've failed,"

523
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,240
"we'll take the money
and give you some of it."

524
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,109
That was the settlement.

525
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,809
So petty and despicable.

526
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,480
Gosh.

527
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,349
Those psychopaths.

528
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:11,619
I wish I could burn all the money.

529
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,559
- Let's move.
- Yes.

530
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Let's go.

531
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,359
The looting has ended.

532
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,430
I'm furious.

533
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,859
I thought I took...

534
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,269
almost 100,000 dollars.

535
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,170
I counted it,
and it was only 21,000 dollars.

536
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,170
- Take the private funds out.
- Private funds.

537
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,470
- I had zero, so...
- Right.

538
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,539
It's not even 0.
It's negative 30,000 dollars.

539
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,640
- You can pay him back now.
- I took a private loan.

540
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,079
Now, you have the money to pay him back.

541
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:35,950
That's a total of 160,000 dollars.

542
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,309
And we're six people.

543
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,680
- Yes.
- That's...

544
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
We're left with 3,000 dollars.

545
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,890
Okay. We'll give it to...

546
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,990
Hyun Seo, who worked the hardest.

547
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,160
And Pani
for having the least amount of money.

548
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,990
You have a lot of money,
so you can have it.

549
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,829
(Pani Bottle: 22,000, Eon Kyu: 59,000,
Hye Seon: 57,000,)

550
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,259
(Jin Ho: 40,000, Hyun Seo: 27,000,
and Steve: 145,000 dollars)

551
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,059
(Chungju-Man: 10,000, Min A: 80,000,
Xitsuh: 70,000)

552
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,700
(Gina: 50,000, and Yurisa: 47,000 dollars)

553
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm fine unless we have to run
outside in this sweltering heat.

554
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
Let's cheer up today, everyone.

555
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

556
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,109
- Drink up.
- Thanks.

557
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

558
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,650
- Good luck today.
- Good luck.

559
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,710
Good luck.

560
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,019
It's not easy for soju
to taste refreshing.

561
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,829
I think we're the only team
that rarely has...

562
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,559
- a drinking party.
- Right?

563
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,400
Should we have a party tonight if we win?

564
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
We should.

565
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,769
No, let's party
on the day we beat Dong Min.

566
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,970
Sounds good.

567
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,269
- That will be today.
- Today.

568
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,700
We'll drink today and crush them.

569
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,440
That sound. It even sounds refreshing.

570
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,680
- Good work today.
- Good work.

571
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
- I hope we win today.
- You did so well.

572
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,150
- Let's cheer up.
- Let's have a drink.

573
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,349
Good luck, guys.

574
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:50,890
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

575
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,660
It's refreshing and smooth.

576
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,230
That's the swallowing sensation I want.

577
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,269
It's neat.

578
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,099
Sugar-free drinks are...

579
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,470
- in trend nowadays.
- Indeed.

580
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,569
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

581
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,309
- Cheers.
- Let's go.

582
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

583
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,279
What are we doing today?

584
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,849
(Remaining Living Space in the meantime)

585
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:17,980
But...

586
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,650
when Yurisa first said...

587
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,789
that she met Young Kwang in prison,

588
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,319
- Yes.
- if she had a proper conversation...

589
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,660
- Yes.
- He said that he played against Jin Ho.

590
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,690
And that was true
because it was a 2-on-2 team match.

591
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,690
- Right.
- Right.

592
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,200
If only she had asked
if it was 1-on-1 or 2-on-2,

593
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,829
we would have known
that Jin Ho was the spy.

594
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,829
As far as I know Yurisa,
she must have asked.

595
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,869
- And she kept it from us?
- Yes.

596
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,769
That's the type of person I think she is.

597
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,670
Back in Season Two,

598
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,609
she realized...

599
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,609
that information was her weapon.

600
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:49,950
No, Seasons 2 and 3 are the same.

601
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,849
She was isolated
for playing too individually.

602
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,490
But you can't fight individually.
You fight as a group.

603
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,490
I don't know. Whatever she did,

604
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,390
I know that she and I can't get along.

605
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,960
We didn't even say a word in our room.

606
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,059
But there's only one person...

607
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:07,460
who isn't compatible with me
among the whole cast.

608
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,599
Who?

609
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,799
- Was it Steve?
- Yes.

610
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,839
It seemed like a lot of people
were incompatible with him.

611
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,140
What is this sound?

612
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,769
I think it's going to rain.

613
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,579
Am I hearing thunder?

614
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:19,609
Yes.

615
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,680
Some rain would rather be better.

616
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,880
Look at the sky.

617
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,849
It's covered with clouds out of nowhere.

618
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,980
(The same thing happens in the Paradise.)

619
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,220
- What...
- There's even thunder.

620
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,619
- There's rain and thunder.
- That's insane.

621
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,789
This is getting crazy.

622
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,789
There's lightning.

623
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,460
I should head in.

624
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
- There's even lightning.
- Yes.

625
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,269
I know, right?

626
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,700
- It's like the calm before the storm.
- Yes.

627
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,039
There must be heavy rain coming.

628
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,369
Gosh.

629
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,039
It's raining. Raindrops are falling.

630
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,839
One would think there's a war.

631
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:59,019
(Meanwhile, Team Remaining is...)

632
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,859
- Awesome.
- The ground just shook.

633
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,789
My ears hurt.

634
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,630
Gosh.

635
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,430
Man. That's insane.

636
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,200
(It's a heavy rain accompanied
by strong winds and lightning.)

637
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,279
The raindrops are coming in.

638
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,940
What if there's a landslide?

639
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,150
Why don't we move in?

640
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,950
Si Yoon, let's move inside.

641
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,980
Okay.

642
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,619
- This is crazy.
- Scooch in.

643
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,750
There's too much water.

644
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,390
Is this actually happening?

645
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:44,029
Wait. It's flying away.

646
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,430
(Rolling)

647
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,859
No way.

648
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,299
- No!
- No way.

649
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,000
That's dangerous.

650
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,569
- Don't go.
- Careful!

651
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,140
Should we stay where the Casino is?

652
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,779
Okay.

653
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:00,039
The Ghost Casino building.

654
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,079
Sure.

655
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,849
The water's coming in here as well.

656
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,619
(They take shelter in the Ghost Casino.)

657
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,390
Goodness.

658
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,819
This is unbelievable.
I've never seen anything like it.

659
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,890
This is horrifying.

660
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,960
It flooded where we were.

661
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
What on earth?

662
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,099
It could have been bad if we hadn't moved.

663
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,170
- No way.
- Our house is flooding.

664
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Is it a typhoon?

665
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,339
Was there a forecast of a typhoon?
while we were gone?

666
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,869
- This is getting too serious.
- Yes.

667
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,579
- Seriously.
- What is this alarm, though?

668
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,420
It's a flood warning.

669
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,119
- Right. You're a civil servant.
- A civil servant!

670
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,220
It means a few things,

671
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,890
but it's likely to be warning us
of the downpour.

672
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,319
The other one is war,
but it's less likely to be that.

673
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,829
You said such a scary thing
without even flinching.

674
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,490
It's like a disaster alert.

675
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes, to tell us to evacuate.

676
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,440
This is an announcement
from the Disaster Response Headquarters.

677
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,279
Weather conditions are worsening
significantly,

678
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,150
and river water levels are rising rapidly.

679
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,849
An evacuation alert has been issued.

680
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,650
Please evacuate to a safe area...

681
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,890
or return home immediately.

682
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,190
It's terrifying out there.

683
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,329
It's scarier than the Deathmatch.

684
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:24,359
Right. What is happening?

685
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,160
Is there a war or something?

686
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,569
- This is too serious.
- That's the sound of a cannonball.

687
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:30,769
Gosh.

688
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,269
That sounded like dynamite.

689
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,470
(Blinking)

690
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,009
We lost electricity and water downstairs.

691
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,109
I'm scared.

692
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,910
(Rain rushes into the Mansion.)

693
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,279
Gosh.

694
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,119
Darn it.

695
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,160
(We've decided to bring
all the players to the Paradise...)

696
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,930
(due to the evacuation alert.)

697
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
It's cold.

698
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,269
Oh, my.

699
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,369
It's bad...

700
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,640
over there, isn't it? It's flooded, right?

701
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,710
We almost died.

702
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,509
- What?
- Hi.

703
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,779
- Hi.
- Hello.

704
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

705
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,150
Team Remaining is also here?

706
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,920
Gosh. Everyone's here.

707
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,390
(Reading the room)

708
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:36,069
It doesn't make sense.

709
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,299
- The women should...
- This line should be...

710
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,769
He's not willing to speak to me.

711
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:55,789
(The two quietly leave the room.)

712
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,789
The Immunity Pass...

713
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,369
I was excited about meeting new members.

714
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:20,180
But they were completely different...

715
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,750
from the members
of Team Paradise and Team Remaining.

716
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,720
They weren't so good
at manipulating people,

717
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,549
and I could see right through them.

718
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,420
There were only naive people.

719
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,089
I believed...

720
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,890
that they lacked competence
compared to other teams.

721
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,490
I did the math...

722
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,059
and decided...

723
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,799
that I had a better shot at surviving
by helping Team Remaining...

724
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,140
than by risking things
to help our team win.

725
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,740
(While Yurisa has a secret rendezvous
with Team Remaining...)

726
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,779
What's your status in your team?

727
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,220
- Any issues?
- Why do you ask?

728
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,480
You know we're having
a team match tomorrow,

729
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
- right?
- Yes.

730
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,849
But is Team Paradise...

731
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,390
divided?

732
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,859
Or are they one team?

733
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,630
Why are you asking?

734
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,660
I believe
that there's an imbalance of information.

735
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,329
(Jang Dong Min)

736
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,900
We know more things
as we're the ones who struggled.

737
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,069
That's our team's privilege.

738
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,380
I've been with them for a long time.

739
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,240
Long enough to observe their styles.

740
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,049
If you were to ask me
who I want to keep playing with,

741
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,180
it's undoubtedly Dong Min.

742
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,650
He's an outstanding player,

743
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,490
and he's very responsible.

744
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,450
It's also peaceful in our team.

745
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,089
The older guys are of similar age,

746
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,460
and I'm slightly different from them.

747
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,500
But I did think...

748
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,230
that they wouldn't ask me...

749
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,930
to play with them...

750
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,539
when it was time for an individual match.

751
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,700
This is cold-hearted of me to say,

752
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,769
but if there's a voting tomorrow,

753
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,079
there's no guarantee...

754
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,750
that you won't end up in the Deathmatch,
whether you make a mistake or not.

755
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,450
I am worried, to be honest.

756
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,219
What's your purpose here?

757
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,960
- My purpose?
- Yes.

758
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,059
Playing with the people that I like.

759
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,559
(Dong Min came to the pantry.)

760
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,599
Playing with the people
whom I can trust...

761
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,599
for as long as I can.

762
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,570
I've been on many survival shows,
so I can be the one to say...

763
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,570
that the core concept
of a survival show is...

764
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,010
surviving.

765
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,010
You need to survive today
to be there tomorrow.

766
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,179
And we're going to guarantee...

767
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,280
your survival tomorrow.

768
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
What do you say?

769
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,989
I'd like that.

770
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,030
- You would?
- Yes.

771
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,730
Then, let me break it down for you fast.

772
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,599
When you say yes,
it means we're in the same boat.

773
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,369
What does it mean to be in the same boat?

774
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,139
It means that you must carry out
your responsibilities and obligations.

775
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,280
When you fail to do so,

776
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,050
you need to be...

777
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,210
- Responsible.
- responsible for that as well.

778
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,679
You're risking your life for this.

779
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,219
Do you understand?

780
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,400
What do you think? It's fun, right?

781
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,300
(Sighing)

782
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,070
It suddenly hits me.

783
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,170
- That this is a survival show?
- Yes.

784
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,559
One, two, three, four, five?

785
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,760
- Are we picking up paper?
- There are so many.

786
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,030
There's something in the pool.

787
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,559
We need to go in and pick them up.

788
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, boy.

789
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,900
What is this now?

790
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,070
There's paper inside, and we need to...

791
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,900
- check its content.
- Right.

792
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,039
All right, guys.
We're placing first today.

793
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,409
- Good luck.
- I'll crush all of them.

794
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,179
This is a bloody battle of revenge.

795
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,579
Welcome!

796
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,289
- Hey.
- Hi.

797
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,449
- Hey.
- Hey.

798
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,519
Come on over.

799
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,820
It's the people I can't stand.

800
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,530
Other teams would think...

801
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,800
that we were the weak ones.

802
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,630
That irritated me.

803
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,869
It hurt my ego.

804
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,469
We had...

805
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,239
Yurisa and Xitsuh,

806
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,969
who had experience
in the Bloody Game series.

807
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,139
I'm determined to prove
that we're not the weak ones...

808
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,980
by starting over...

809
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,079
with new members and a new mindset.

810
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,150
That's my determination.

811
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,380
At first,

812
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,019
I resented Jin Ho as well.

813
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,849
So, I was going to play hard.

814
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,289
I was full of spite.

815
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,389
Wait. Why are we entering last?

816
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,889
The hero always appears last.

817
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,630
Team Remaining is here.

818
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

819
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,900
Why does that team look so dull?

820
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,570
- Welcome.
- Because they're Team Remaining.

821
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,110
Their dress code is black.

822
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,539
- That team looks merciless.
- Right?

823
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:20,579
- They look merciless.
- Hi, Acau.

824
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,780
What is it?

825
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:29,019
Today, there will be
the second team match...

826
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,050
between Team Paradise, Team Mansion,
and Team Remaining.

827
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,920
All players of the winning team will be...

828
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,530
provided with 20,000 dollars
of private funds and Immunity Passes.

829
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:40,199
The teams in 2nd and 3rd places
must vote...

830
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,329
and choose one elimination candidate.

831
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,769
The two voted players will have...

832
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:47,699
a 1-on-1 Deathmatch.

833
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,969
The loser will be eliminated.

834
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,809
Unless we place 1st, placing 2nd or 3rd...

835
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:53,880
is pointless.

836
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,110
I want to aim at first place
by playing aggressively,

837
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,210
whatever the game may be.

838
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,909
Today's Money Challenge is...

839
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,750
(Expression Link)

840
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,920
Expression Link.

841
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:05,619
Expression Link will be a team match.

842
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:06,690
Another Expression Link?

843
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,860
It's a game where players
maximize their calculation skills...

844
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,960
and physical abilities...

845
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,860
within the time limit...

846
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,699
to connect various cards
with numbers, symbols, and suits...

847
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:19,139
to complete an equation
with a value of 100.

848
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,400
The cards used for Expression Link are...

849
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,039
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts,

850
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,679
and Bloody Game symbols.

851
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,710
There are two-box cards
of a number and an operation symbol...

852
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,050
and single-box cards with only a number.

853
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,889
The numbers are from 1 to 10,

854
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,420
and the operation symbols are
1 of the 4 arithmetic operations.

855
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:43,389
On the surface of the envelope
that holds a card...

856
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,730
is the suit of the card.

857
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,329
If it's a two-box card,

858
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:50,800
only the mark of the first box
is indicated.

859
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,940
Find the cards scattered around...

860
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,269
and create an equation on a 9-by-9 grid
with a total of 81 squares,

861
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:59,579
ensuring that as many matching suits
as possible are connected.

862
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,079
Complete the equation
to achieve a total value of 100.

863
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:02,909
As many matching suits as possible?

864
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,510
There will be five rounds,

865
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,750
and you can find and bring the cards...

866
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,820
from Round 1 to Round 4,

867
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,690
while the other teammates complete
the equation.

868
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,159
In Round Five,
you may arrange the collected cards...

869
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,960
to get the cards...

870
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,559
thrown out by other teams or your team.

871
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:26,269
The time limit is 15 minutes
from Round 1 to Round 3.

872
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:30,269
It's 30 minutes from Round 4 to Round 5.

873
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,739
Only two players in each team
can search the cards...

874
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,110
in one round.

875
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,480
There are rules you must follow
when completing the equation.

876
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:45,250
The cards must be placed within the board,

877
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,230
and the calculation must be done
from left to right...

878
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,260
and from the first row.

879
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,230
The starting point and endpoint are fixed.

880
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,829
You can put the number cards together,

881
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,269
but you cannot rotate the cards.

882
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,840
After achieving a total value of 100,

883
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,340
if you connect six or more cards
with the same suit,

884
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,679
you can earn additional points
equivalent to five times...

885
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,679
the number of connected squares.

886
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,809
If you connect 11 or more cards,

887
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,150
you can earn ten times
the connected squares.

888
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,219
And for 16 or more cards,

889
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,619
you earn 15 times the connected squares...

890
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,320
as additional points.

891
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,559
Additionally, for the special card,
the Bloody Game card,

892
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,030
if you connect six or more,

893
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,530
eleven or more,

894
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,530
or 16 or more of these cards,

895
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,329
you will earn twice the points
you would receive...

896
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,869
for linking regular cards.

897
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,039
Each team is allocated 20 coins...

898
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,739
to use during the game.

899
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,510
Unused cards can be discarded...

900
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,480
without using coins up to Round Four.

901
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,650
However, in Round Five,

902
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,789
discarding a card requires
three coins per card.

903
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:52,889
If there are cards to discard
but no coins available,

904
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:56,429
five points will be deducted
from the team's score...

905
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:57,989
for each coin.

906
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,500
Cards discarded by other teams...

907
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,570
can be picked up without using coins.

908
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,900
The winning team will convert...

909
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,840
any remaining coins into money
after the game ends.

910
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,610
Every 5 coins are converted
to 10,000 dollars,

911
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,280
and the amount should be divided
among team members...

912
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,409
as they see fit.

913
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,619
Expression Link will begin soon,

914
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,250
so submit the list of the searchers...

915
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:25,820
after a 30-minute strategy meeting.

916
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:29,760
I studied math more than others,

917
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,559
looked at more math formulas,
and was more used to numbers,

918
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,199
so I thought I'd be able
to play this with ease.

919
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:37,000
SNU and medical school is
definitely above KAIST.

920
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,239
We have a higher CSAT score, after all.

921
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,940
You go to KAIST after you're rejected...

922
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,510
by all the medical schools and SNU.

923
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,010
That's a fact.

924
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,179
I've watched the previous season,

925
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,250
and Xitsuh's capability stood out
in this game.

926
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,420
I have experience
in playing the Expression Road...

927
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
in Season Two.

928
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,219
I would be lying to say
that there was no pressure at all.

929
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,630
But I was really confident.

930
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,690
The point of this game is...

931
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,400
throwing out all the cards in Round Four.

932
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:08,860
We need to discard them in Round Four.

933
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,230
We can't spend the entire 30 minutes
of Round 4 in searching the cards.

934
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,400
We need to search for 15 minutes
and return...

935
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,900
to decide which cards to throw out
in the remaining 15 minutes.

936
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,610
That's true. Even if we discard them,
we can get them back.

937
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,909
We need to be focused and find as
many cards as possible in Rounds 1 and 2.

938
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:23,650
You find most of the cards
in the early part of the game.

939
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,710
So, I said that we should find
as many as possible first.

940
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:26,449
I'll search in Rounds 1 and 2.

941
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,780
Rounds 1 and 2?

942
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,789
We won't be able to do the math
until Round Two, anyway.

943
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:31,090
- Right.
- That's true.

944
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,489
I think I should search
in the later rounds...

945
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,489
since I'm not such a fast runner.

946
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,860
- And you can look thoroughly.
- The two of us should go first.

947
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,130
Chungju-Man and Min A in Round Three?

948
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,630
- Chungju-Man and Min A.
- Chungju-Man and Min A.

949
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,800
Okay. And Min A.

950
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,269
- Okay.
- Okay.

951
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:46,539
I'm going to run toward prison,
and he'll run to the Paradise.

952
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,599
- The upper floors.
- I'll go inside.

953
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,269
If you have energy left after Round One...

954
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,179
- Then, I can go again.
- No, it means you didn't run hard enough.

955
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:55,440
Darn it.

956
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,780
- That's the correct answer.
- Correct.

957
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,820
I'm just saying that we should run so hard
that we need to rest in Round Two.

958
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,989
I know that.

959
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,050
Xitsuh and Yurisa are...

960
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,960
such trustworthy additions to the team.

961
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,860
This is our best opportunity to win.

962
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,489
We thought that we'd be able...

963
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:16,170
to find our way to victory
rather than relying on luck.

964
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,699
I wanted to win first place.

965
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,670
Our priority is getting the value of 100.

966
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,340
And when we complete the equation,
there were additional points.

967
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,440
- Those points are...
- The same suits.

968
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,610
The more cards we use, the better,

969
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,510
because we'll have a higher chance
of linking the same suits.

970
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,639
Let's do that.

971
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,750
And it doesn't really work
when we all chip in with the equation.

972
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,880
Right.

973
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,650
Who was it? Steve.
You should be the leader.

974
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,190
I was in charge
of overseeing the whole board.

975
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,460
Hyun Seo was in charge
of reviewing the numbers with me.

976
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,400
Most of the cards are in Round One,

977
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,960
so the combatants of our team,

978
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,900
- Pani and Hyun Seo, should go.
- The fast ones.

979
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,400
Eon Kyu and I could go in Round Two.

980
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Or Hye Seon could go.

981
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,940
Where's a place that only we know about?

982
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,539
I had the upper hand...

983
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:59,780
because I spent more time in the Paradise.

984
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,039
Team Mansion had...

985
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,880
no knowledge of the 2.5th floor,

986
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,710
so I wanted to check that out first.

987
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,719
I was a pretty fast runner,

988
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,219
so I wasn't really worried.

989
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:11,849
From an objective point of view,

990
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,389
our team has the best members.

991
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:16,030
I believed we were a good team.

992
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,559
I wanted to win first place,
and I was going to.

993
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,030
Is there anyone who's confident...

994
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,329
in calculation and mental arithmetic?

995
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,199
The leader of this calculation...

996
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,300
- should be you.
- Okay.

997
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,210
And the two of you should assist him.

998
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,280
I'm not too bad at mental arithmetic.

999
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,280
Then,
we'll have the two of you do the math.

1000
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,980
And the other three will collect
the cards.

1001
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,349
We'd still win, even without a strategy.

1002
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,289
But to make it more certain and easier,

1003
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,730
I plan on using spies.

1004
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,329
The calculation is important,

1005
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,130
but we have...

1006
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,969
Yurisa and Hye Seon on other teams.

1007
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,599
Controlling them is also crucial.

1008
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,510
Yurisa joined Team Mansion.

1009
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,409
(The night before)

1010
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,409
It would have been better
if you had joined Team Remaining,

1011
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,820
- but you couldn't.
- Right.

1012
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,750
We need you to survive in that team.

1013
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:21,260
First off,
our team is going to place first.

1014
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,190
I don't know what the game will be,

1015
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,659
but if you manage...

1016
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,760
to cause a disturbance on your team,

1017
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,900
I'll take responsibility...

1018
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,369
- and save you with my funds.
- Okay.

1019
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,840
I thought that she was
almost 90 percent our team.

1020
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,510
So, I gave Yurisa a mission.

1021
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,449
(He quietly calls for Yurisa.)

1022
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:49,949
I'll give you the cards
based on the suits.

1023
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:51,550
No, give us everything.

1024
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,550
- Everything?
- Yes.

1025
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,320
Give them to us
and tell them that we took them.

1026
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:55,760
Do you understand?

1027
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:58,159
I ordered her to cause a disturbance.

1028
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,500
I told her to bring...

1029
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:02,929
all the cards that she finds.

1030
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:04,699
And for Hye Seon,

1031
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:06,840
Seong Beom said...

1032
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:09,969
that he had built some trust
with Hye Seon.

1033
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,539
He claimed that they could communicate,

1034
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,880
so I trusted him...

1035
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,449
and told him to reach out to her.

1036
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,179
At this rate, we hold the power...

1037
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,320
to manipulate all three teams.

1038
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,289
I was glad.

1039
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,119
I'll go in Rounds 2 and 3.

1040
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,630
- Oh, Rounds 2 and 3.
- Rounds 2 and 3?

1041
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,429
Finding them is important,
but I need to oversee things.

1042
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:34,929
Sure.

1043
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,400
Run upstairs as soon as it starts.

1044
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,039
- I'll go through the back door.
- Sure.

1045
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:43,909
I'll give you a signal to tell you
if other teams went...

1046
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,110
- into the 2.5th floor.
- Okay.

1047
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,710
If I signal an X, don't go in.

1048
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:53,179
I'm the type to pursue a 100-percent win,

1049
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,380
so I told them all the strategies
in detail.

1050
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,019
I obviously think that we'll win.

1051
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,820

(All the teams get 20 coins.)

1067
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,599
Thank you.

1068
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,070
(Expression Link Searchers' List)

1069
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,739
(Paradise, Mansion, and Remaining)

1070
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,769
Round One will begin now.

1071
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,010
Find the cards in the Paradise
for 15 minutes.

1072
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,610
- Let's go.
- It's starting.

1073
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,050
(Round 1 of Expression Link,
Remaining cards: 200)

1074
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,920
(Round 1 of Expression Link begins.)

1075
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,050
(As soon as it begins,)

1076
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,989
(Si Yoon dives into the pool.)

1077
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,760
As I planned,

1078
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:09,420
I took over the pool.

1079
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,690
Okay. One.

1080
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,099
I dove into the pool without hesitation.

1081
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,929
I saw...

1082
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,670
how interested Si Yoon was
in the pool before the game.

1083
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:22,599
It was such a large pool,
so I couldn't let them have all of them.

1084
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,170
(Hyun Seo holds Si Yoon in check.)

1085
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,539
I got one...

1086
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,610
and another one and started searching.

1087
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,650
(Hyun Seo leaves the pool
after keeping Si Yoon in check.)

1088
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,909
After I took over the pool,

1089
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:36,789
I kicked the rocks under the pool
to pick up the cards.

1090
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,190
And Dong Min called...

1091
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:41,389
Si Yoon, come here!

1092
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,030
Si Yoon, over here!

1093
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,159
I thought,
"But I didn't get all of them yet."

1094
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,460
No, you can't bring it here.
Go over there and search.

1095
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:50,230
Over there.

1096
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,730
He went into the pool for no reason.

1097
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,599
They used rocks
to make sure that the cards...

1098
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:57,110
were underwater.

1099
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,139
I judged that it was better
to search other places.

1100
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,949
The pool was a decoy.

1101
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,420
I came out of the pool,

1102
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,090
and I was so puzzled.

1103
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:11,619
What is he doing over there?

1104
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:13,059
Don't stay in one place for too long.

1105
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,119
Si Yoon, come here.

1106
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:15,860
This way.

1107
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,260
Why are you biting it with your mouth?
You can't breathe that way.

1108
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,929
Why are you holding it in your mouth?
You can't breathe.

1109
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,230
Why does he have the envelope
in his mouth?

1110
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,570
Who would be able to breathe like that?

1111
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,440
It was chaos.

1112
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:35,280
I forgot to give MJ the signal
because of him.

1113
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,949
(MJ is the ace searcher
on Team Remaining.)

1114
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:44,949
(She collects the cards
at incredible speed.)

1115
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,190
(She doesn't stop running.)

1116
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,730
She's really athletic.

1117
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,099
Everywhere I looked, there were cards.

1118
00:49:58,369 --> 00:49:59,800
On the ground,

1119
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,199
between cracks,

1120
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,739
and in the bushes.

1121
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,050
Finding more cards gives
Seong Beom more options,

1122
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,710
so I ran as much as I could.

1123
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,679
I can always run for 15 minutes.

1124
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:15,380
So, I didn't stop running.

1125
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:24,929
(Current Number of Cards,
MJ: 13, Si Yoon: 6)

1126
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,230
(Pani Bottle and Chungju-Man ran
into the Paradise as soon as it began.)

1127
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,800
I went to the 2.5th floor
as soon as the round began.

1128
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,949
(Pani Bottle knows the structure
of the Paradise inside and out.)

1129
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,250
No one was on the 2.5th floor,

1130
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,219
so I ran by the whole place
and went to the third floor.

1131
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,559
And it was like...

1132
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:04,869
no one was on the third floor.

1133
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:07,539
There were cards in the refrigerator
and on the floor.

1134
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:10,510
I had a feeling
that I found a lot of cards.

1135
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:13,639
(Chungju-Man entered
the 2nd-floor pantry.)

1136
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,780
We had a plan.

1137
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,110
I'll run to prison,
and he'll run to the Paradise.

1138
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,179
The upper floors.

1139
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,750
As we established beforehand,
I followed our plan.

1140
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:25,489
Okay. Here.

1141
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,699
But I was relieved
that I found more cards than expected.

1142
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,699
Where? Okay.

1143
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,800
(Xitsuh is in charge
of the Underground Prison.)

1144
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:52,110
(He collects 4 cards
on the way to prison.)

1145
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,159
It was good that I stayed in prison.

1146
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,889
(Current Number of Cards, Xitsuh: 10)

1147
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,500
Five minutes remain in Round One.

1148
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,400
Go and register them.

1149
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,030
Register them now.

1150
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,599
We're running out of time.

1151
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,210
I didn't even have time
to check the suits.

1152
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,010
All I could do was get
as many as possible.

1153
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,840
(Current Number of Cards, Pani Bottle: 24)

1154
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,250
(Current Number of Cards, Xitsuh: 15)

1155
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,780
(Current Number of Cards, Si Yoon: 11)

1156
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,980
(Current Number of Cards, Chungju-Man: 20)

1157
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,719
Three minutes remain in Round One.

1158
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,889
(Round 1 of Expression Link)

1159
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,460
(Current Number of Cards, MJ: 32)

1160
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:35,659
(Current Number of Cards, MJ: 33)

1161
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,460
Hey. I mean...

1162
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,730
I'll register them first.

1163
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,829
I'll register them. Give them to me.

1164
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,530
- I have more.
- Okay.

1165
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:45,429
Okay.

1166
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,500
(Current Number of Cards,
Pani Bottle: 24, Hyun Seo: 14)

1167
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,699
Register them under Team Paradise.

1168
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,210
(Pani Bottle registers the cards
for Team Paradise.)

1169
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,210
Team Paradise collected
27 two-box cards...

1170
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,579
and 17 single-box cards.

1171
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,980
(Team Paradise's cards after Round 1:
A total of 44 cards)

1172
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:04,320
Fine.

1173
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,920
(Team Mansion's Xitsuh...)

1174
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,389
(and Chungju-Man register their cards.)

1175
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:12,190
Team Mansion collected 29 two-box cards...

1176
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,900
and 12 single-box cards.

1177
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,769
(Team Mansion's cards after Round 1:
A total of 41 cards)

1178
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,610
(Team Remaining also registers its cards.)

1179
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,510
Team Remaining collected
29 two-box cards...

1180
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,340
and 18 single-box cards.

1181
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:32,610
(Team Remaining's cards after Round 1:
A total of 47 cards)

1182
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,250
Seventeen.

1183
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,880
- Nice.
- That's a lot.

1184
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,889
I probably got everything
in the Underground Prison.

1185
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,789
That's a lot.

1186
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,820
- We have too many.
- Let's organize these first.

1187
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,829
Okay.

1188
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:47,230
We found six cards
with the Bloody Game symbol...

1189
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,699
in the first round.

1190
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,369
We were so happy.

1191
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:53,739
We were going to place them,
no matter what,

1192
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:55,269
and do the math from there.

1193
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:56,670
I don't think we'll be short of cards.

1194
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,110
- Over here.
- Okay.

1195
00:53:58,769 --> 00:53:59,769
That's a lot.

1196
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:00,909
Great.

1197
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:04,579
There were many vertical cards,

1198
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:07,949
so they were going to affect
the equation...

1199
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,619
and make it completely wrong.

1200
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:11,150
It was tougher than I expected.

1201
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,090
(Team Remaining has found the most cards.)

1202
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:15,989
I got 36.

1203
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:17,760
- What?
- She got 36? No way.

1204
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,360
I think they found 50 cards.

1205
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:21,900
- Hold on.
- Your guys aren't back yet?

1206
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,300
- Please put the Diamonds here.
- Seriously?

1207
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,570
And put the rest of them off the board.

1208
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,230
Take out the cards that aren't Diamonds.

1209
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,469
Here you go.

1210
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,969
Achieving a value of 100 is crucial,

1211
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,510
but so is linking the suits.

1212
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,010
I checked if any of them were apart...

1213
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,579
as I approached it.

1214
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:36,380
We will begin Round Two.

1215
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,679
It's starting. Go!

1216
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,849
- Take this.
- Give me that.

1217
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,820
Pace yourself.

1218
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,559
I'll check out the third floor.

1219
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,960
As soon as Round Two began,

1220
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,429
I checked where Hye Seon was going.

1221
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,369
Hye Seon, hurry.

1222
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Hurry up.

1223
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,610
- Hye Seon.
- No way!

1224
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,070
Hye Seon, come here.

1225
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,170
I'll check this area first.

1226
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,610
No, come here. Just for a second.

1227
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:10,849
I kept calling her,

1228
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,449
but she ignored me and left.

1229
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,250
Gosh.

1230
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,219
I thought,
"Oh, she doesn't want to get caught,"

1231
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:22,619
and followed her into the pantry.

1232
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,190
Hye Seon, when you find them...

1233
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,760
- When you find them,
- Yes.

1234
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,329
meet me back here
when there are five minutes left.

1235
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,329
- All right?
- Okay.

1236
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:34,039
And you need to interfere
with their calculation.

1237
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,670
- You get what I mean, right?
- Yes.

1238
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,469
(Gina is the searcher
for Team Mansion in Round 2.)

1239
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:50,250
I had to place first this time.

1240
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,690
I felt that the cards must be...

1241
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,559
important or necessary...

1242
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,860
if the crew went so far
as to use rocks to keep them underwater.

1243
00:55:56,989 --> 00:56:00,760
I thought they would be better cards.

1244
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,570
So, I thought, "Fine. I'll get wet."

1245
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,900
"I'll jump into the pool."

1246
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,469
But I got five cards from the pool,

1247
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:12,269
and one of them had
the Bloody Game symbol.

1248
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:13,440
(Current Number of Cards, Gina: 5)

1249
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,039
The sacrifice was worth it.

1250
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,349
- Acau!
- Yes?

1251
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:27,719
Take those away.

1252
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,230
The stairs. Take them away.

1253
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,730
Take them from her.

1254
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:34,329
Hurry.

1255
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:36,329
Take it. Run.

1256
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:37,730
That one.

1257
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,769
Take what?

1258
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,440
- The rocks? Take them.
- Take them all.

1259
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,139
Gosh. They're rocks.

1260
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,269
They're rocks.

1261
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,909
- What?
- They were rocks.

1262
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,480
You tricked your own teammate.

1263
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,010
They were all rocks?

1264
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,920
(Current Number of Cards,
Gina: 5, Acau: 0)

1265
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,679
(Xitsuh is searching consecutively
in Rounds 1 and 2.)

1266
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,920
I told you they'd be here.

1267
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,119
(Current Number of Cards, Xitsuh: 6)

1268
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,150
Okay.

1269
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,489
(Current Number of Cards, Xitsuh: 7)

1270
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:02,989
That's a strange place to hide it.

1271
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,190
(Current Number of Cards, Xitsuh: 8)

1272
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,760
Okay. There's a ton.

1273
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,630
That's a lot.

1274
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,230
I keep seeing them.

1275
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:16,739
Super easy.

1276
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:19,210
Super easy.

1277
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:21,309
Super easy.

1278
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,480
Super easy.

1279
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,050
I found a ton of cards on the third floor.

1280
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,280
That's right.

1281
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,489
Super easy.

1282
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,449
(He sees envelopes everywhere he goes.)

1283
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,989
(Current Number of Cards, Dong Min: 20)

1284
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:35,690
(Current Number of Cards, Dong Min: 21)

1285
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,989
Super easy.

1286
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:39,789
I thought, "We're good to go now.
I found a ton of cards,"

1287
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:41,030
"and if I get Hye Seon's cards..."

1288
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,929
Things were looking good.

1289
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,869
There's no way.

1290
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,840
Oh, gosh.

1291
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,480
I had overlooked one thing.

1292
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,349
Since high school,

1293
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,849
I've been famous for being bad
at finding things.

1294
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,090
I thought I'd be able to find
at least one,

1295
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,320
and I couldn't even find one.

1296
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,260
Is it just me?

1297
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,230
I had zero cards,

1298
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,559
and I saw Gina in front of me.

1299
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,670
I charged at her before I realized,

1300
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:21,769
trying to take away her cards.

1301
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:23,769
I almost succeeded,

1302
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:26,710
but she put them under her shorts.

1303
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:28,639
I'll try linking the Diamonds.

1304
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,039
Yes, fix them there.

1305
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,750
When we collected the cards in Round One,

1306
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,150
I realized that most of them were
Diamonds.

1307
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,690
So, I decided to link the Diamonds.

1308
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,420
Give me a number.

1309
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,420
(Team Remaining focuses
on linking the Diamonds.)

1310
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,260
These shouldn't be here.

1311
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,530
I need all the Diamonds linked.

1312
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,760
It's cut off now.

1313
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,230
Wait. This is...

1314
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,429
This is so challenging.

1315
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:55,300
There are so many vertical cards.

1316
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,539
There are more vertical cards
than I thought.

1317
00:58:57,539 --> 00:58:59,039
It's tough to make the equation this way.

1318
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,610
(The vertical cards make it hard
to complete the equation.)

1319
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,980
So it's acceptable
as long as the cards are touching.

1320
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:07,449
Do you have more?

1321
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:08,650
It will be accurate with more cards.

1322
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:13,619
(These two teams are not even close.)

1323
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,389
(But Steve Yea has already started
to come up with the expression.)

1324
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,730
I saw a lot of vertical expressions.

1325
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,130
So considering the cards we had,

1326
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,269
I thought making a simple expression
was important.

1327
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,170
(Steve Yea begins from the bottom
to come up with the expression.)

1328
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,340
I could see that he was quickly
forming the expression.

1329
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,239
After seeing that,
I knew that we were on the right track.

1330
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,570
We've got 45 and 12.

1331
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:35,309
- That's 33.
- It's 33.

1332
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,780
With these cards, we already have
over ten cards of Hearts.

1333
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,780
I couldn't find any cards there.

1334
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,179
If you look at the expression we have now,

1335
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:41,679
we got lucky with the numbers.

1336
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,219
Actually, making an expression
for 100 is quite easy.

1337
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,619
The deciding factor of the game...

1338
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:47,119
will be the number of connected cards
sharing the same symbol.

1339
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,690
Steve is a fast thinker.

1340
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,460
With him, it's not
about getting good grades on exams...

1341
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,789
or having mathematical intuitions.

1342
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,460
He can quickly make decisions in his head.

1343
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,230
He's very used to that given his career.

1344
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,739
It'd be nice to multiply a number with 48
and get our answer.

1345
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:02,639
We can connect the Heart cards.
Then we'll multiply it with 48.

1346
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:04,070
If we can get an addition...

1347
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,739
in one of these boxes...

1348
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:06,739
Here.

1349
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:08,039
(He offered a solution right away
when Hyun Seo wasn't sure.)

1350
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:11,579
Then up to this point,
our answer is 100. That's confirmed.

1351
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,750
We've got 13 Heart cards.

1352
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,179
We have to register the cards now!

1353
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:15,250
So let's look at these cards.

1354
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,449
But we still have some cards we can use.
Cards like this.

1355
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,050
We have another Heart card.

1356
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,789
We should see
what they bring in this round.

1357
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,059
We're running out of time.

1358
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,289
He didn't come out
when we had three minutes left.

1359
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,599
- We have way too many cards.
- Yes.

1360
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:28,599
Not at all.

1361
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,130
- We must start making it in Round Four.
- Yes.

1362
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,130
We found a lot of cards,
so we can take it easy.

1363
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,139
Right.

1364
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,639
For this type of game, having many people
wouldn't necessarily be an advantage.

1365
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,309
The rest of us
didn't have to distract him...

1366
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,380
with the numbers.

1367
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,750
We just decided to leave it up to Xitsuh
to come up with the expression.

1368
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:47,280
They're already trying
to make the expression.

1369
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,650
- We'll pray.
- Let's pray.

1370
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,280
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1371
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,320
Bring your hands together.

1372
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
I'll pray...

1373
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,559
for our wish.

1374
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,960
Please give us good cards.

1375
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,030
Give us the Sharingan.

1376
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,530
We believe in the Sharingan.

1377
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,429
Please.

1378
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:02,730
- Xitsuh, not there.
- Please.

1379
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,000
Xitsuh, I don't think that's the spot.

1380
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,599
Gina. That's the one.

1381
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:07,599
Not there, Xitsuh.

1382
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,099
- Please.
- A little more.

1383
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:10,809
- Let's keep trying a little more.
- I hope they all fail.

1384
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:13,710
I hope they all fail.
Please trip over something.

1385
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,710
You're cursing our team.

1386
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,610
Great. That was a great session.

1387
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,250
We'll leave it up to the skies and pray.

1388
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,849
There are only 5 minutes
remaining in Round 2.

1389
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:27,519
(Round 2 of Expression Link)

1390
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,190
We have five minutes left.
Hurry, Hye Seon.

1391
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,929
Hye Seon, what are you doing?

1392
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,699
Hye Seon. Come on!

1393
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,630
Hye Seon. Where is she?

1394
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Where did she go?

1395
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:41,969
She's coming.

1396
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,210
Hye Seon. Hey.

1397
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,780
- I couldn't find even 1.
- Not even 1?

1398
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,280
I already searched this room.

1399
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:55,750
How could I not find even one card?

1400
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,190
- Not even one?
- No.

1401
01:01:57,719 --> 01:01:59,750
I was quite shocked at that moment.

1402
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:03,789
I found 24 cards in that round.

1403
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:06,960
I thought, "No way."

1404
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,059
Eon Kyu, did you find some cards?

1405
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,769
- Yes.
- I couldn't find even one.

1406
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:11,769
- Really?
- Yes.

1407
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,630
- Let's go inside.
- I found a few.

1408
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,170
(Current Number of Cards)

1409
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,739
We have about two minutes left.

1410
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:17,969
We must register them now.

1411
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:19,369
(Team Paradise, Joo Eon Kyu: 8 cards)

1412
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,539
(Team Paradise, Choi Hye Seon: 0 cards)

1413
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,780
Let's go inside.

1414
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,050
(Dong Min and Acau of Team Remaining
enter to register the cards.)

1415
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,050
Here you go.

1416
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,050
Team Remaining,
you registered 13 2-box cards.

1417
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:30,590
You registered 12 single-box cards.

1418
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,519
(Team Remaining's cards after Round 2)

1419
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:34,190
(Team Remaining: A total of 72 cards)

1420
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:36,360
Team Mansion,
you registered 12 2-box cards.

1421
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:38,059
You registered five single-box cards.

1422
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,059
(Lee Gina: 8 cards, Xitsuh: 9 cards)

1423
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,460
(Team Mansion's cards after Round 2)

1424
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,829
(Team Mansion: A total of 58 cards)

1425
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,400
Team Paradise,
you registered 8 2-box cards.

1426
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,429
(Team Paradise's cards after Round 2)

1427
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,739
(Team Paradise: A total of 52 cards)

1428
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,670
- I couldn't find any cards.
- What?

1429
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,670
I couldn't find any cards.

1430
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,469
Dong Min just said he found 24 cards.

1431
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,739
- Right. That's a lot.
- So they have over 50 cards.

1432
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,280
- He found 24 cards?
- Where did you go?

1433
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:58,179
- Where did he go?
- Which area did he search?

1434
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,050
- I really don't get it.
- Who's going next?

1435
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:01,449
Is it those two?

1436
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,219
We will begin Round Three.

1437
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:08,219
(Round 3 of Expression Link,
remaining cards: 18)

1438
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,219
You got this!

1439
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,460
- I'll go downstairs.
- You'll do it?

1440
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,099
- You go inside the building.
- Okay.

1441
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,440
(Team Remaining has
the highest number of cards.)

1442
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,239
Wait,
they shouldn't be connected like this.

1443
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,280
Where's the multiplication card?

1444
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:31,050
I need to have a number after this.

1445
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,210
No. I need an operation symbol.

1446
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,579
I need a subtraction card.

1447
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,019
No. Let's connect the path again.

1448
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,050
There must be a way to connect them.

1449
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,559
I watched Seong Beom...

1450
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,429
putting together
the expression like AlphaGo.

1451
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:47,159
I thought that I shouldn't even touch
the expression he was creating.

1452
01:03:47,429 --> 01:03:49,860
Making a small change to the expression...

1453
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:51,869
could jeopardize everything.
It will be a disaster.

1454
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,639
(Team Paradise has
the lowest number of cards.)

1455
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,670
Anyway...

1456
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,809
I separated the expressions
with multiplication and division cards.

1457
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:03,949
I thought that using addition
or subtraction cards to them...

1458
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:06,050
was the most important.

1459
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,780
So I had already finished...

1460
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,550
the 2nd half of the expression
with the answer as 100.

1461
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,789
Our strategy was
to fill in the first half later.

1462
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:13,920
That's 100 now.

1463
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,690
Check one more time.

1464
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,920
Nine minus nine is zero.

1465
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:19,460
Subtract 72 from 72. Then we have...

1466
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,900
It's 48 minus 48. And this is 100.

1467
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:23,329
- That's 100.
- Yes.

1468
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,099
We can make 100 then.

1469
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:27,199
My strategy is
not to break the second half.

1470
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,639
Here's the problem.
We must keep connecting the Heart cards.

1471
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,710
(For now, they connected 14 Heart cards.)

1472
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,440
It'd be amazing
if we could get a few more Heart cards...

1473
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,480
to connect those.

1474
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,650
(Team Mansion just starts
connecting the cards.)

1475
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,210
They already formulated the expression.

1476
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,650
- This one.
- Which symbol do we have the most of...

1477
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:43,650
in our entire collection?

1478
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,219
For now,

1479
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,059
- this is what we have.
- We have six cards in the show's symbol?

1480
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:50,059
- We must use them first. Where are they?
- We have six of them? Okay.

1481
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,230
We must focus on them first.

1482
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,460
- The times-ten card is great. Amazing.
- Yes, that's great.

1483
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,159
I thought that symbol of the show
was the most important.

1484
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,769
I thought that we had to treat it
as our key symbol.

1485
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,699
These cards must be connected.

1486
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,469
- The times-ten card...
- We can connect 88...

1487
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,139
with 11 or such numbers.

1488
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,309
Then we need an operation symbol here.

1489
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:08,510
Like this.
Then we can put this card here too.

1490
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,409
We can do this.
Then we connected all six cards.

1491
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,280
- One, two, three, four, five, and six.
- My gosh. That's amazing.

1492
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,349
When we divide it by nine...

1493
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:15,420
- One hundred isn't divisible by nine.
- No.

1494
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,489
Then we can put eight
in front of the expression.

1495
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,090
Now, there's a Heart card.

1496
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:20,320
There's a Diamond card too.

1497
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,860
Afterward, I took an aggressive approach.

1498
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,989
I wanted to review
the symbols we had on our cards...

1499
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,059
and expand our expression.

1500
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:28,329
We needed to connect 11 or 16 cards...

1501
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:29,659
of the same symbol in addition.

1502
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,500
All right. Up to this point...

1503
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,369
We have to subtract 4 from 148,

1504
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:35,500
so we have 144.

1505
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,170
That's 12 squared. That's beautiful.

1506
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,170
Yes, it is.

1507
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,440
We already had so many cards on our board.

1508
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:44,110
I thought that he was really good at math.

1509
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,250
I was impressed by Xitsuh.

1510
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,210
Is there a card here?

1511
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,219
(Only 18 cards remain now.)

1512
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,550
- Gosh, there's none.
- I can't even find one. Right?

1513
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:58,429
Darn it. I looked everywhere.

1514
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,960
I don't see any cards here.

1515
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,329
Gosh, come on.
They did a good job at hiding the cards.

1516
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,300
No. This isn't good.

1517
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:13,969
Darn it. Round Three.

1518
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,539
My gosh. I was looking
for the cards in Round Three.

1519
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,510
Maybe, it was because
they already found so many cards.

1520
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,050
There were barely any cards left.

1521
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:23,679
I was shocked that
I couldn't even find one.

1522
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,420
No.

1523
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:30,019
That stings!

1524
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:32,059
I got stung by a bee.

1525
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:33,630
I thought someone shot me in my leg.

1526
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,599
I was like, "A sniper was hiding
somewhere in the mountains over there."

1527
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,869
"To stop me from running."

1528
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:40,969
Darn that bee. Come on.

1529
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,099
I got stung by a bee.

1530
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,670
- What's wrong with him?
- Darn it!

1531
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,139
What's wrong?

1532
01:06:47,409 --> 01:06:48,710
Darn it. I got stung by a bee.

1533
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:50,809
Darn it!

1534
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,409
You got stung by a bee? Seriously?

1535
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,550
Come on!

1536
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:57,119
Good grief.

1537
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,619
It hurt like crazy.

1538
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,019
I had to hurry and look for cards.
I had to run, you know?

1539
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,619
Seriously. I couldn't even walk.

1540
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,460
I'm going to kill all the insects here.

1541
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:09,130
Doctor!

1542
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,800
Darn it. I'm going to kill them all.

1543
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,170
Darn it.
I'm declaring war on insects today.

1544
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,269
Darn it.

1545
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,340
Come on. Are they laughing?

1546
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:24,750
Why did everyone laugh? Seriously.

1547
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,280
Why... My gosh.

1548
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,179
How many minutes...

1549
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,119
You have five minutes.

1550
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:34,260
Darn it. Time is moving so slowly.

1551
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,659
Come on. I couldn't find anything.
It's all because of that bee.

1552
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,559
There are only 3 minutes
remaining in Round 3.

1553
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,360
Jin Ho.

1554
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,570
You should register what you have
and bring them here.

1555
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,070
- So they get a head start.
- Okay.

1556
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:49,340
I only have a few, anyway.

1557
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:52,170
Team Paradise,
you registered 3 2-box cards.

1558
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,440
You registered one single-box card.

1559
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:55,679
(Team Paradise's cards after Round 3)

1560
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:56,909
(Team Paradise: A total of 56 cards)

1561
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:58,809
Team Remaining,
you registered 1 2-box card.

1562
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:00,110
You registered one single-box card.

1563
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,519
(Team Remaining's cards after Round 3)

1564
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:02,949
(Team Remaining: A total of 74 cards)

1565
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,820
Team Mansion, you registered 1 2-box card.

1566
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,190
You registered one single-box card.

1567
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,519
(Team Mansion's cards after Round 3)

1568
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:08,820
(Team Mansion: A total of 60 cards)

1569
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,929
There was nothing left.

1570
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,760
- Did you find any?
- I couldn't.

1571
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:14,900
I couldn't find anything.
Where did you find yours?

1572
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,760
- Hey, all the cards are gone now.
- No more cards?

1573
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,170
I think they did a great job
at hiding the cards.

1574
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,899
We found about 80 to 90 cards.

1575
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:24,000
If we combine all the cards
from other teams,

1576
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,909
it must mean
we probably found close to 200 cards.

1577
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:29,140
Here's what I think.
We're done looking for the cards.

1578
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,050
We should wait and dump the cards.

1579
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:32,750
Come back when we have
five minutes left to dump the cards.

1580
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,720
- Can we do that?
- We can dump the cards then.

1581
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
- Then I'll go far.
- Sure.

1582
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,619
We will begin Round Four.

1583
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,550
You will get 30 minutes for Round 4.

1584
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:45,890
(Round 4 of Expression Link,
remaining cards: 10)

1585
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,260
- We have an hour left. It's okay.
- Okay.

1586
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,199
We have a lot of time.

1587
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,829
Multiply 810 by 10.

1588
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:54,699
What? Multiply it by ten?

1589
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:56,300
(Team Mansion's current expression)

1590
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,640
It was 810 times 10?

1591
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,170
That's 8100 now?

1592
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,140
What? Why is that number so big?

1593
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,479
Did you know we have 810 times 10?

1594
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:05,779
Yes. That's right.

1595
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,380
The number is really big right now.

1596
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,420
- So we have to divide 8,100 by 9?
- Yes.

1597
01:09:10,949 --> 01:09:12,920
- Then... It's 900?
- We have 900. Yes.

1598
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,260
- Let's do it again.
- Let's review it.

1599
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,390
Take your time.

1600
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,659
- The number is big...
- This is good, but...

1601
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:17,960
because we're trying to connect
these Diamond cards.

1602
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,189
We can divide it by four with this card.

1603
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,800
- Will that work?
- Nine hundred is divisible by four.

1604
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,130
We'll get rid of this.

1605
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,569
Place it here.

1606
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,329
It might work if we change it like this.

1607
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,569
- This is fun.
- Do you get why I said it was beautiful?

1608
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:31,439
- Yes.
- Numbers are beautiful in this game.

1609
01:09:31,909 --> 01:09:34,880
We can make 69 or 65 with the Heart cards.

1610
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,739
- We have to add ten here.
- Actually...

1611
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:37,810
So we have 49 now.

1612
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,949
It's 49. So we can add 23 to 49.

1613
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:41,050
Then we have 72.

1614
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,479
- We can add 69 to it.
- Right.

1615
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,520
- We have 141.
- Right.

1616
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,149
If we add 10 to it, we have 151.

1617
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,689
We also have six.

1618
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,260
- Six. Four. That's better.
- Six works better.

1619
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,359
Our Diamond cards...
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1620
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,390
Six of them are linked.

1621
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,829
- We still have a lot of boxes left.
- Okay.

1622
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:54,859
We can totally link 11 cards.

1623
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,600
We can also link six Heart cards.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1624
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,600
We already linked so many cards.

1625
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,140
- Let's link as many cards as we can.
- Our expression is the killer.

1626
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,600
- Okay.
- Great.

1627
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,609
- We're doing well.
- Great.

1628
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:05,810
Did we make a lot of progress?

1629
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,109
So this is what we have for now.

1630
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,479
We need two more Heart cards.

1631
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:10,609
But it will be really difficult
to include two more Heart cards.

1632
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:12,250
It'd be great
if we can link them like this.

1633
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,380
Where is she?

1634
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:19,949
I wanted to give a mission to Yurisa.

1635
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:22,920
I had to tell her...

1636
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,659
to distract her team...

1637
01:10:25,659 --> 01:10:28,729
and bring all the cards she found to me.

1638
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:30,800
Hurry.

1639
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,300
When you run into Yurisa,

1640
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,140
tell her to give us signals with her eyes
whether or not...

1641
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,500
they finished the expression.

1642
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,340
- Tell her to give us signals.
- I see.

1643
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:44,979
My gosh.

1644
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:48,520
- Signal us if your team is close...
- What?

1645
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,850
to finishing the expression.

1646
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,750
- Okay?
- Okay. But we're far from it.

1647
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:57,859
I had to talk to Hye Seon too.

1648
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,060
Come back if you don't have any.

1649
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,470
You can just come back.

1650
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,869
(Dong Min approaches Hye Seon.)

1651
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,569
Gosh, Hye Seon.
You should've seen me there.

1652
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:15,239
How could you miss that? Come on.

1653
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:18,609
(Hitting)

1654
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:28,390
(He fails again.)

1655
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:30,560
Give me a pen.

1656
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:34,159
I wrote a message on a piece of paper.
Then...

1657
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,869
(He secretly gives her a note.)

1658
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:51,279
Well, we were in the middle of a game.

1659
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:54,010
I had to trust my players.
I decided to trust her.

1660
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:57,050
When I got that offer from Dong Min,

1661
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:58,649
I didn't feel good about it.

1662
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,119
I didn't want to do what he wanted.

1663
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:03,090
I didn't see any reason...

1664
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,060
to join Dong Min's alliance.

1665
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,760
First of all, I had to stay...

1666
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,560
in that hot and humid place from day one.

1667
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,670
Those guys and I struggled together
and had to put up...

1668
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,229
with that environment as a team.

1669
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:17,140
The biggest reason for not leaving was
I wanted to play a good game with them.

1670
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:20,609
I didn't have any reason
to accept Dong Min's offer.

1671
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,279
There are only 10 minutes
remaining in Round 4.

1672
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,579
(Round 4 of Expression Link)

1673
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,819
Pani.

1674
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:29,850
Did you find any cards?

1675
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,350
If you do, go and register them.

1676
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,489
Team Paradise,
you registered 2 2-box cards.

1677
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:36,920
(Team Paradise's cards after Round 4)

1678
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,329
(Team Paradise: A total of 58 cards)

1679
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:40,960
Team Mansion, you registered 1 2-box card.

1680
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,859
(Team Mansion's cards after Round 4)

1681
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,430
(Team Mansion: A total of 61 cards)

1682
01:12:44,729 --> 01:12:46,630
Team Remaining,
you registered 6 2-box cards.

1683
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,840
You registered a single-box card.

1684
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,039
(Team Remaining's cards after Round 4)

1685
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:51,640
(Team Remaining: A total of 81 cards)

1686
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:56,409
Subtract 137.

1687
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,680
- Seong Beom.
- Yes.

1688
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:01,119
Do you want us to help or leave you alone?

1689
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,579
Calculate it in your head.
You can't move the cards.

1690
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,619
- Don't move them?
- No.

1691
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:05,619
Okay.

1692
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,890
I used up most
of the Diamond cards we had.

1693
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:11,930
I kept switching the places
for two rounds.

1694
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,590
I got our answer close to 100.

1695
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,899
The answer I had was 102.

1696
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,130
They're all connected.

1697
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,170
(Team Remaining is almost done
with the expression.)

1698
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:21,199
They're all linked.

1699
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,369
Seven. I need a single-box card for seven.

1700
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:28,310
A single-box card.

1701
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,340
A single-box card for seven.

1702
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,380
Okay. I can do this.

1703
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,250
I got it.

1704
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,619
I got it. It's 100.

1705
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:39,689
Let me calculate it again in my head.

1706
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,590
It's 111.

1707
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:42,819
No. I don't have it yet.

1708
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,890
I miscalculated. Seong Beom, stay sharp.

1709
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,729
I just need to do it right one time.

1710
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,829
My gosh. Seriously.

1711
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,100
Toward the end of the round...

1712
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:53,930
I've got 111. And add...

1713
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,109
When I was checking my work,
I couldn't add those numbers.

1714
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:01,409
I was in a hurry.

1715
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:03,710
The sun was beaming down on me
for two and a half hours.

1716
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:05,010
I was getting cooked out there.

1717
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:07,350
It's 112.

1718
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,350
(Seong Beom kept changing the numbers.)

1719
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,489
Darn it. Why can't I calculate
these numbers? This is driving me crazy.

1720
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:16,390
There are only 5 minutes
remaining in Round 4.

1721
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,619
(Round 4 of Expression Link)

1722
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:20,689
I can't link more than 14 cards.
I think 14 is the maximum.

1723
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,430
Okay. Dump the cards.

1724
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:24,430
I'll dump them now.

1725
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:27,369
- All right. Let's go and dump them.
- Wait. This subtraction card is good.

1726
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:28,369
We'll dump them now?

1727
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:29,699
- My gosh. What do we do?
- If we don't dump them now,

1728
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,239
- we'll have to use the coins.
- But how will you decide what to dump?

1729
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:32,810
- We'll keep number ten.
- I see.

1730
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,180
- This is all.
- Or should we keep...

1731
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,239
- single-box cards for numbers?
- I'm going.

1732
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,279
- Okay, go ahead. We'll pick cards later.
- My gosh. Yes.

1733
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:41,380
- All right. We have 25 seconds left.
- Run.

1734
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:42,550
Twenty-four.

1735
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,289
I'll dump these cards.

1736
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:46,689
- Will you discard the cards?
- Yes.

1737
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,560
(2-box cards: 15, single-box cards: 15,
a total of 30 cards for Team Mansion)

1738
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:51,189
You can keep them.

1739
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:53,329
(2-box cards: 17, single-box cards: 8,
a total of 25 cards for Team Paradise)

1740
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,060
- Will you discard the cards?
- Yes.

1741
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,100
(Lastly, Team Remaining
also dumps the cards.)

1742
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,970
(2-box cards: 16, single-box cards: 8,
a total of 24 cards for Team Remaining)

1743
01:14:58,029 --> 01:14:59,029
Okay.

1744
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,930
- Is it going well?
- Yes.

1745
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,369
- We linked the Heart and Diamond cards.
- That's 51.

1746
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:04,340
- Heart and Diamond cards.
- We linked the Heart and Diamond cards.

1747
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:07,239
If you need anything, tell us.
He and I will go and get it.

1748
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:08,479
(Team Mansion linked the most symbols.)

1749
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:11,039
Add 23 to 49.

1750
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,510
That's 72.

1751
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,750
- Things are going well for us.
- I checked your work.

1752
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,750
- Our answer up to this point is 44.
- Yes.

1753
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,020
We can pick up whatever card we need
during Round Five.

1754
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:22,819
All right.

1755
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,659
The six symbols of the show are linked.

1756
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:27,260
Next. If we divide them,
our answer will be one.

1757
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,600
Yes. We need a division card.

1758
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,430
It'd be great if we can find
a division card with a Diamond symbol.

1759
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,500
Did you finish?

1760
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:35,470
No. We're close, though.

1761
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,500
I just want to finish it fast.

1762
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,539
I bet they finished it.

1763
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:41,010
We already finished ours a while ago.

1764
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,640
(Team Paradise
already filled up their board.)

1765
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,350
But linking the symbols will be the key.

1766
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:48,420
I don't know how many cards
the other teams linked.

1767
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,989
Round Five has begun.

1768
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:53,850
(Round 5 of Expression Link)

1769
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,659
(Retrieving the number card for 7)

1770
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,399
Let's bring the board inside.

1771
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,800
To make it simple, a horizontal...

1772
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,069
- You know what?
- But this...

1773
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,279
Submitting our work early would be better.

1774
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,479
If we're tied,

1775
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:17,609
- whoever submits it first will win.
- Let's go.

1776
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:18,850
- They're already heading in.
- Hide it well.

1777
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,479
- That shouldn't matter, right?
- It's better to submit it early.

1778
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,350
Submitting it second is better than last.
You won't change it now, right?

1779
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,550
I'm worried that
the cards might slide down.

1780
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,890
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1781
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:25,949
Yes. Hold that.

1782
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:33,229
Where is everyone going?

1783
01:16:33,829 --> 01:16:34,859
To pick up cards.

1784
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:36,529
They're taking their board.
Should we take ours too?

1785
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:38,000
- Should we move too?
- They're taking the board?

1786
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
- Yes.
- Should we go?

1787
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,100
- Let me carry it.
- Yes.

1788
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,369
- Please move it as it is.
- Okay.

1789
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:43,369
- Be careful.
- Move it as it is.

1790
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:45,210
- Great. I won't drop the cards.
- Be careful.

1791
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,649
We'll dump the number card for 7
and take the number card for 3.

1792
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,579
Team Remaining,
you paid 3 coins to dump 1 card.

1793
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:59,119
- We're the first one.
- Dong Min, come in. It's done.

1794
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,420
If it's wrong, there's nothing I can do.

1795
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,890
We'll submit our answer.

1796
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:09,500
(Team Remaining's submitted answer)

1797
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,670
We'll register our answer.

1798
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:16,369
(Team Paradise's submitted answer)

1799
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:19,310
- They're registering their answers.
- We have 20 minutes left.

1800
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,739
- We have a lot of time.
- We must do it now.

1801
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:23,140
We just have to make sure
our answer is 100 now. Hold on.

1802
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:25,149
If we can't,
we can just give up on the symbols.

1803
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,079
- We can just add up numbers.
- Yes.

1804
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,920
- We have plenty of additional points.
- This is a lot of points.

1805
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,590
- Right? It's 43 up to this point.
- Yes.

1806
01:17:31,649 --> 01:17:33,319
- Can you review it 1 more time?
- I'll review it 1 more time.

1807
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,560
It's important that
our answer is 43 up to this point.

1808
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:37,920
It's 43, right?

1809
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:43,159
Darn it. I calculated it several times.
This is so hectic.

1810
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,199
We're good as long as we complete it.

1811
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,699
We have more than half of the cards
with the pyramid symbol.

1812
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,869
- We can double our additional points.
- Right.

1813
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:51,640
My goal is to make sure
our expression's answer is 100.

1814
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:52,810
- Let's just complete our expression.
- Yes.

1815
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,409
- Then it's over.
- Even if we give up on the Diamond cards,

1816
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,140
let's complete our expression.
We don't have much time.

1817
01:17:56,279 --> 01:17:59,109
By then, we linked a lot of cards
for the additional points.

1818
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:02,350
(Team Mansion's current additional points,
290 points)

1819
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:05,619
Let's see. Five.

1820
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,619
I'll take this card.

1821
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:10,789
Team Mansion, you obtained one card.

1822
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:12,789
I think this will be the best card
for our expression.

1823
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,960
Subtract 1 from 43.

1824
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,460
Yes.

1825
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,100
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1826
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:21,369
Do you want to check again?

1827
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:22,970
Our answer up to this point is 43.

1828
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,100
- Check.
- Okay.

1829
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,539
One of us should go...

1830
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,409
and write down operation cards...

1831
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:33,850
and other useful cards
among discarded cards.

1832
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,180
Mark if they're vertical or horizontal.

1833
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,550
We should forget about the symbol.

1834
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,050
- Let's just add.
- Let's focus on completing it.

1835
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:40,890
- We have more than ten minutes.
- Yes.

1836
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:56,869
(Yurisa goes back without doing anything.)

1837
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:04,039
If your team ends up
with a long expression...

1838
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,109
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

1839
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,560
- We can just move this.
- There are so many cards.

1840
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,789
- I don't know much about our expression.
- I see.

1841
01:19:17,789 --> 01:19:19,359
You can just write them down.

1842
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:21,260
- Write down the cards they have.
- There are over hundreds of cards. How?

1843
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:22,859
Should I go and find addition cards?

1844
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,029
- Should I get addition cards?
- No. Hold on. Give me that.

1845
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:28,470
I don't know much about our expression.

1846
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,340
We should just add.

1847
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,340
Add?

1848
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:34,739
Eleven minutes.

1849
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:40,149
Let's just add them up
and complete the expression with 100.

1850
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:43,180
I see. If we were to go with this...

1851
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:52,260
(They have 10 minutes left.)

1852
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:56,560
(Thinking)

1853
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,140
Plus five.

1854
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:08,739
Minus four.

1855
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:10,680
Then the addition card...

1856
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:12,510
Add 102.

1857
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,649
Then it's 144.

1858
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,319
Subtract 44. We got it.

1859
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,520
We got it.

1860
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:23,090
If we add them, we get 102.

1861
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:24,119
Then we'd have 144.

1862
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,260
- Yes. It's 144.
- Subtract 44. We got it then.

1863
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:26,989
- What?
- We got it.

1864
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,159
- My gosh. Wait.
- That's it, right?

1865
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,260
- Hey.
- Let's hurry.

1866
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,260
- Okay.
- That's right.

1867
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:31,899
- Let's take it to the room.
- Slowly.

1868
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:33,029
- Let's review it.
- Slowly.

1869
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:34,529
- Let's review it.
- Let's do it in front of the room.

1870
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:35,899
Hey, bring the remaining cards.

1871
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:37,500
We have eight minutes left.

1872
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,510
- Right here. Go inside after you check.
- Let's review it here.

1873
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,109
- Let's review it and go inside.
- Let's check it first.

1874
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:42,180
Let's do it here together.

1875
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,409
- We have eight minutes left.
- Do it here.

1876
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,250
- Don't shake it.
- Do it here.

1877
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:46,909
All right. Let's check.

1878
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:49,180
Divide 8,100 by 9. Then we have 900.

1879
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,920
- Divide 900 by 4. So we have 225.
- I'll hold it.

1880
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,720
Then we have to subtract 36 from 95.

1881
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,250
Subtract 36 from 95. Then...

1882
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,789
we have 51.

1883
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:57,220
Plus... We can ignore that.

1884
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,560
Subtract 7 from 51.

1885
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,260
- Wait. This is 51?
- So 1...

1886
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,260
Yes, it's 51.

1887
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:02,630
But we subtracted 36 from 95.

1888
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,600
Hold on.

1889
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,039
The ones-place must be nine.

1890
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:10,170
- I see. Really?
- Yes, nine.

1891
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:11,399
It's nine?

1892
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,869
- Hold on. What...
- Yes, it's nine.

1893
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:13,909
Yes, it is.

1894
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:15,279
But you said you checked the calculation.

1895
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:18,350
- Right? It's 43 up to this point.
- Yes.

1896
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,010
It's 43, right?

1897
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,949
(Team Mansion has been formulating
the expression with the wrong value.)

1898
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,350
- What? You miscalculated it?
- Darn it.

1899
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,420
- Toward the end...
- We have...

1900
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,289
- It's 50 up to this point, right?
- It's 50.

1901
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:31,960
- Then we added 101.
- Add that.

1902
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,029
- So it's 152.
- It's 152.

1903
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:34,689
- Then subtract...
- After that,

1904
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:36,460
- we can subtract...
- We're doomed.

1905
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,500
We're doomed. Hold on.

1906
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,300
- Subtract 43...
- Did you miscalculate it?

1907
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,329
- Subtract 43.
- Wait, no.

1908
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,170
- We need the vertical minus-5 card.
- We need to subtract 5.

1909
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:43,340
- Let's find that.
- Minus five?

1910
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,510
- We need that and the number card for 2.
- That and the number card for 2.

1911
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,170
We need the minus-five card.
It can be vertical or horizontal.

1912
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,310
It doesn't matter which one.

1913
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:50,609
My goodness.
We made a calculation mistake.

1914
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:54,880
I can't find the minus-five card.
Look for another way.

1915
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:56,250
Can you find a plus-nine card?

1916
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,350
This is crazy.

1917
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,220
There's a plus-7 card.
Wait, there's a plus-9 card.

1918
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,189
There is? Then is there
a number card for one?

1919
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,260
Just a number card for one?

1920
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,789
It has to be a minus-one card.
Darn it. The horizontal one.

1921
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,630
No, I don't see it here.

1922
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:09,260
- It's 153.
- If we can't complete it,

1923
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,359
we won't even get our additional points?

1924
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:11,869
No. We won't get anything.
We'll be doomed.

1925
01:22:11,869 --> 01:22:13,970
A plus-8 card or a minus-63 card.

1926
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,000
- Minus 6? I found a minus-6 card.
- A plus-8 card or a minus-6 card.

1927
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,470
- Then we need a number card for 3.
- A number card for 3.

1928
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,409
- We need both cards.
- I found it. Take them.

1929
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:20,609
- Here.
- Hurry.

1930
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,909
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1931
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,680
It's okay. Go and find a horizontal one.

1932
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,109
(The orientation of the minus-6 card
doesn't match.)

1933
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,850
Find a horizontal minus-six card.

1934
01:22:29,949 --> 01:22:31,649
Find a minus-six card.

1935
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:35,260
- We have two minutes left.
- Okay.

1936
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,020
Two minutes and three seconds.

1937
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,260
Please be here.

1938
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,930
I can't find the minus-six card.

1939
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:40,930
Come on.

1940
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,659
Is there a vertical minus-seven card?

1941
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:43,899
A vertical minus-seven card?

1942
01:22:43,899 --> 01:22:44,899
- Or...
- Yes, there is.

1943
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:46,829
Bring the vertical minus-seven card.

1944
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,439
Okay. Then what happens?

1945
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,170
- It's 161 now.
- Yes.

1946
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,369
Place the minus-seven card here.

1947
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,069
We can make 71 then.
Can we add 10 to this expression?

1948
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:55,279
We just need to add ten. That's it.

1949
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:56,840
There must be a number card for one.

1950
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,210
Do you have a minus-one card?

1951
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,380
No, just a regular number card.

1952
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,680
I see a regular number card for one.

1953
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,750
- Slow down.
- We just need to add ten. And we're done.

1954
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,579
My gosh, but I can't find
a horizontal plus-ten card.

1955
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,319
Darn it. Come on.

1956
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:10,220
- Is there a horizontal plus-five card?
- The plus card...

1957
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:12,760
- Hold on. Step out. Let me take a look.
- Darn it.

1958
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:15,229
We were too greedy.

1959
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,500
- Why was our calculation wrong?
- Right.

1960
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,989
Gosh, no. It's not going to work.

1961
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:49,029
Round Five is over.

1962
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,859
- Let's go with this.
- Yes.

1963
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:51,899
We failed.

1964
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,899
When we checked it halfway through,
we miscalculated it.

1965
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:00,810
Gosh, what a bummer.

1966
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:05,310
Team Mansion, you submitted your answer.

1967
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:15,119
(Team Mansion's submitted answer)

1968
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,489
I guess "deplorable" would be
the right word to describe it.

1969
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,260
I could hear...

1970
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,260
something breaking down in my head.

1971
01:24:23,699 --> 01:24:25,800
We were playing this game
based on an incorrect expression,

1972
01:24:25,869 --> 01:24:27,630
to begin with.

1973
01:24:27,699 --> 01:24:30,069
We made a calculation error,
but we had no idea.

1974
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,640
Here's what the saddest part of this was.

1975
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,239
I returned to Team Mansion.

1976
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:39,750
We were bonding together as a team.

1977
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:42,520
Everyone was motivated
to work hard as a team.

1978
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,350
But of all games,

1979
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,619
we failed the game I did well
in the last season.

1980
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:50,319
The fact that I couldn't lead
our team to victory...

1981
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:52,260
when I was a key player...

1982
01:24:53,829 --> 01:24:54,859
made me feel...

1983
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,159
It was embarrassing.

1984
01:25:03,539 --> 01:25:09,539
(Lee Gina made
a critical calculation error.)

1985
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,680
- Gina has been the one checking the work?
- Yes.

1986
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:16,350
She only reviewed his work.

1987
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:18,989
Darn it. Then how could she get it wrong?

1988
01:25:19,649 --> 01:25:21,819
Well, we trusted that
we calculated it correctly.

1989
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:23,760
Right. Gosh, this is so upsetting.

1990
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,260
As soon as we came out,
I threw the remaining number cards.

1991
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,670
I also tossed the notebook.

1992
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:35,170
I sat on the staircase
and felt sorry for our team.

1993
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,600
We were really desperate for a win...

1994
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,010
because we lost five games in a row.

1995
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:41,880
We really thought
we had this one in the bag.

1996
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,010
So it was even more shocking.

1997
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:50,149
- I'm so sorry.
- No. We were close.

1998
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:51,890
- We were so close.
- My gosh.

1999
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,520
I'm so sorry.

2000
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:56,489
I could've made it work.

2001
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,229
If there were no errors...

2002
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:00,359
Forget it.

2003
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,560
We would've completed the expression.
Darn it.

2004
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,699
- We would've gotten it.
- Right. We linked so many symbols.

2005
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:05,699
That really annoys me.

2006
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,369
If we couldn't complete the expression,
a calculation error...

2007
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:08,369
wouldn't have upset me this much.

2008
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:10,069
Did she keep checking my work?

2009
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,739
- She continued with 51, not 59.
- She kept doing it with the wrong number.

2010
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:14,409
My hands and feet are shaking.

2011
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,409
I've never been this upset
after we started filming.

2012
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,109
Checking your work was
all she did for an hour.

2013
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,680
But how could she make
a calculation error?

2014
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,949
Darn it. Our survival depends on this.

2015
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,689
Gosh, I'm going to drink a lot tonight.
Darn it.

2016
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,789
Please gather at the Main Hall.

2017
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:34,960
I will announce the results
of the Money Challenge.

2018
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,159
My gosh.

2019
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,130
Team Mansion's answer came out...

2020
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,270
to 88.

2021
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,399
As your answer didn't come out to 100,

2022
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,770
you failed to earn additional points.

2023
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,149
Team Remaining's answer came out to 100.

2024
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,109
You earned...

2025
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:57,250
an additional 110 points.

2026
01:26:57,819 --> 01:27:00,390
The total score is 210 points.

2027
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,920
(Team Remaining's answer)

2028
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,930
(They linked 11 Diamond cards
and earned 110 points.)

2029
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,699
Team Paradise's answer came out...

2030
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:11,930
to 100.

2031
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:15,600
You earned...

2032
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:24,109
an additional 140 points.

2033
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:26,810
The total score is 240 points.

2034
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,750
(Team Paradise's answer)

2035
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,090
(They linked 14 Heart cards
and earned 140 points.)

2036
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,550
The winning team
of today's Money Challenge is...

2037
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,060
Team Paradise.

2038
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:40,930
As this was a team match,

2039
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:43,800
everyone on our team fulfilled their role.

2040
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,699
Thanks to that, we had good results.

2041
01:27:45,699 --> 01:27:47,369
Steve who was in charge of...

2042
01:27:47,369 --> 01:27:48,970
formulating the expression was the MVP.

2043
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,270
I have an exceptional
mathematical intuition.

2044
01:27:53,869 --> 01:28:01,510
(Steve took a leadership role
regarding their strategy and calculation.)

2045
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:02,750
It's 100.

2046
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,020
So I had a huge advantage with this game.

2047
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:06,550
I was confident.

2048
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,220
I knew that I would...

2049
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,189
contribute a lot to my team's success.

2050
01:28:10,289 --> 01:28:12,289
Every player on Team Paradise...

2051
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:14,229
will receive 20,000 dollars...

2052
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,460
and the Immunity Pass.

2053
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,130
The remaining 20 coins...

2054
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:20,300
will be converted to 40,000 dollars.

2055
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:23,270
Steve gets four since he formulated
most of the expression.

2056
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,840
- Hyun Seo gets four too.
- Thank you.

2057
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,039
- Here you go.
- You gave me a bonus.

2058
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:27,640
- The rest of us will get three.
- Okay.

2059
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:28,840
I think that's fair.

2060
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,479
It feels great to have more money.

2061
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:33,510
- My gosh.
- How much is this?

2062
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,090
My goodness.

2063
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:43,359
The first win.
It was nearly the first win.

2064
01:28:43,859 --> 01:28:45,460
So it felt really nice.

2065
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:47,960
Oh, my gosh.

2066
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:52,399
The unity between the team members
was very solid.

2067
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:53,729
It was very nice.

2068
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,229
It was so much fun.

2069
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:57,270
Mentally,

2070
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,840
I'm so happy.

2071
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,439
It put me in a great mood.

2072
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,750
I expected the result,

2073
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:07,149
so I was satisfied.

2074
01:29:07,149 --> 01:29:08,310
Leaving the Mansion...

2075
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,550
became a winning move.

2076
01:29:11,149 --> 01:29:12,220
One of them should go home.

2077
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:14,489
Hello.

2078
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,319
One, two, three.

2079
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:19,489
Team Remaining went around...

2080
01:29:19,489 --> 01:29:22,159
saying that they'd place first
before the match began.

2081
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:24,430
They were so arrogant...

2082
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:26,500
and cocky.

2083
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,300
I wanted to crush them.

2084
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,800
In any case, we placed first today.

2085
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,970
The elimination candidate
will need to come from that team.

2086
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:34,310
"It serves them right.
I hope they struggle emotionally."

2087
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,409
I had that thought.

2088
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:37,840
I had a pretty rewarding day today.

2089
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,489
The teams that lost in Money Challenge,

2090
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,289
Team Mansion and Team Remaining...

2091
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,689
must have a vote to pick...

2092
01:29:51,689 --> 01:29:53,460
the elimination candidate
among the members.

2093
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:55,760
To be honest,

2094
01:29:56,899 --> 01:29:57,899
I wanted to go.

2095
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,600
I should've done better.

2096
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:03,399
Because I failed to do my best,

2097
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:05,569
my team faced the danger
of sending away a member.

2098
01:30:05,569 --> 01:30:08,470
So I thought
that I'd feel at ease if I went.

2099
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:12,149
It was a game we couldn't lose in,

2100
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:14,210
but we lost.

2101
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,149
I was angry at myself.
But to be completely honest,

2102
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:21,050
I blamed the team members...

2103
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,119
in my mind.

2104
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:24,359
Couldn't they check properly?

2105
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:27,460
The fact that we failed to win...

2106
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,060
made me so angry.

2107
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:32,199
What's upsetting...

2108
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:34,100
is that someone needs to go
to the Deathmatch.

2109
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:37,270
The two players
who are chosen by the vote...

2110
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:39,970
will participate in the 1-on-1 Deathmatch.

2111
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,439
The loser of the match...

2112
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,810
will become the eliminated player.

2113
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,449
Each team will stay here...

2114
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:48,649
and vote for the player
who will head over...

2115
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:50,050
to the Deathmatch.

2116
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,149
Voting will end in an hour.

2117
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:00,060
(Voting begins.)

2118
01:31:10,039 --> 01:31:12,170
Let's just go and vote.
There's no need to talk.

2119
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:14,170
We could talk before voting.

2120
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,109
We should just do what we want to do.

2121
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:21,510
I think the votes
should be focused on Gina.

2122
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,380
She was in charge of calculation,
but she messed up.

2123
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,850
How could she get it wrong?

2124
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:27,250
You could get it wrong
by calculating it once.

2125
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,649
But she did it 7 to 8 times.

2126
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,989
It's addition and subtraction.

2127
01:31:30,989 --> 01:31:32,590
Darn it.
Even an elementary schooler can do it.

2128
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:35,430
I thought, "We'd look like fools."

2129
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,930
It was the most crucial mistake.

2130
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,800
It was a very crucial mistake.

2131
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:42,939
I was angry, to be honest.

2132
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,640
Our failure came...

2133
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:47,770
from a calculation mistake in one part.

2134
01:31:47,909 --> 01:31:49,380
So I think...

2135
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:51,609
that Gina should go.

2136
01:31:53,149 --> 01:31:56,220
If you want to say anything, go ahead.

2137
01:31:56,449 --> 01:31:58,649
I have no thoughts.

2138
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,119
I have nothing to say...

2139
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,789
since I haven't done anything.

2140
01:32:04,989 --> 01:32:06,060
Gina, do you have something to say?

2141
01:32:08,829 --> 01:32:10,300
Do you have something to say?

2142
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:15,869
To be honest, Gina seemed to know.

2143
01:32:17,069 --> 01:32:18,600
So I decided to tell her...

2144
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:22,039
that I'd vote for her.

2145
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,010
I think...

2146
01:32:25,649 --> 01:32:26,949
I'll vote for you, Gina.

2147
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,220
Why?

2148
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,520
To be honest,

2149
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,260
you were the one who took on
the responsibility...

2150
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:37,689
of checking.

2151
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,460
You feel like...

2152
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:43,699
that's worse than doing nothing,

2153
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,829
right?

2154
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,569
Things would've been better...

2155
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:49,539
if I hadn't helped with anything...

2156
01:32:49,539 --> 01:32:51,100
during the game, right?

2157
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,109
Here's what I'm saying.

2158
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,539
Not doing anything...

2159
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,510
is putting faith in your teammates.

2160
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:01,510
It's putting the result
in the hands of your teammates.

2161
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,850
There were two members
who took the initiative.

2162
01:33:06,189 --> 01:33:09,819
But I don't think
I can vote for myself in this case.

2163
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:10,819
I can't continue doing that.

2164
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:12,359
I can't always say,

2165
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:13,659
"I'll vote for myself."

2166
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:18,130
To be honest,
he was being seriously uncool...

2167
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:20,029
in order to survive.

2168
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:22,500
I don't know if he realizes it.

2169
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:25,539
If Xitsuh and I were
the ones who took the initiative,

2170
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,640
why does he get to be the one...

2171
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,840
to evade this fate?

2172
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:33,649
I think everyone is responsible
for the loss.

2173
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:35,949
We could've checked with our eyes,

2174
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:37,550
but we didn't do that.

2175
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:39,649
That's a fault too.

2176
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,390
We're at fault too.
Had we each checked the calculation,

2177
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:46,090
it would've been easier
to see what was wrong.

2178
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:50,260
But Gina took on the responsibility
from the very start.

2179
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:51,930
Since she was in the middle
of checking the calculation,

2180
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:53,170
I trusted her.

2181
01:33:53,229 --> 01:33:55,369
No one is free from blame.

2182
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,039
But in terms of who contributed the most
to the loss,

2183
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:58,739
I think it's Gina.

2184
01:33:58,739 --> 01:33:59,869
I still think that.

2185
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:01,939
But...

2186
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,279
I was annoyed
that she didn't take responsibility.

2187
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:06,750
How does that make any sense?

2188
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,149
They should've done something.

2189
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:11,680
Even if they thought
that they were bad with calculations,

2190
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:14,750
we weren't doing anything grand.

2191
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:18,289
They could've calculated
if 8 divided by 1 was 8.

2192
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:19,729
They could've done that.

2193
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,229
When you have
a group project in university,

2194
01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:23,930
It's the freeloaders
who complain the most.

2195
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,199
They ghost other group members...

2196
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:27,899
without doing anything.

2197
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,340
When someone does all the work
and submits the assignment,

2198
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,840
they yap about not getting A plus.

2199
01:34:33,369 --> 01:34:35,510
They had no conscience.

2200
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:37,680
No one did politics after the game.

2201
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,079
I can say that with certainty.

2202
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:42,680
No one did that. However,

2203
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,250
everyone knew...

2204
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:48,189
who to vote for.

2205
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,359
You said that you didn't do politics.

2206
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:55,390
But earlier, you took Yurisa outside.

2207
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,560
Then you took Chungju-Man outside.

2208
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,329
You also called over Min A for a smoke.

2209
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,569
You behaved in the most obvious way.

2210
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,300
Honestly speaking,

2211
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,500
I apologized to them first...

2212
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,270
because I was the one who took the lead.

2213
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,369
"I'm sorry."

2214
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:09,109
"How did we make a mistake?"

2215
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:11,109
The conclusion we reached...

2216
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:12,649
was that the checking process
was the most detrimental.

2217
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,880
That was how the conversation went.

2218
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,220
We didn't call names first.

2219
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:20,520
It just happened that way. I'm serious.

2220
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,319
We didn't do politics.

2221
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:26,359
The conversation went like this.

2222
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:28,260
Xitsuh came to me and apologized.

2223
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,199
"Chungju-Man, I'm sorry." But...

2224
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,729
I felt like...

2225
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:36,500
I was in no position
to receive an apology from Xitsuh.

2226
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,270
I'm sorry.

2227
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,409
- Why would you be sorry?
- The one who did calculations,

2228
01:35:40,409 --> 01:35:41,869
Gina should be sorry.

2229
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:43,239
- You know,
- We had so much time.

2230
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:45,479
it's really aggravating.
Why isn't she apologizing?

2231
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:47,149
- What?
- Why isn't Gina apologizing?

2232
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,750
All of us were at fault,

2233
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:51,020
but she should've said,
"I'm sorry I messed up the calculation."

2234
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,220
- It's really annoying.
- Okay.

2235
01:35:53,689 --> 01:35:55,020
Why isn't Gina apologizing?

2236
01:35:56,489 --> 01:35:57,489
I don't know.

2237
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,789
All of us were at fault, but...

2238
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:01,989
She did say
that the calculation was wrong.

2239
01:36:02,859 --> 01:36:04,500
- But...
- But she seemed to imply...

2240
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,659
that it wasn't her fault.

2241
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,069
Why... Had it been me,

2242
01:36:09,069 --> 01:36:10,100
I would've kneeled on the floor.

2243
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,100
I would've kneeled on the floor
and asked people to vote for me.

2244
01:36:13,409 --> 01:36:15,069
She gave us so much trouble.

2245
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:16,739
For goodness' sake.

2246
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:19,850
After the match, we didn't go,
"We're ruined."

2247
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:21,449
"Whom should we vote for?"

2248
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:24,149
We sat down and apologized to each other.

2249
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:29,489
Since all of us sweated and worked hard,

2250
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:32,420
an apology should've come first.

2251
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:36,430
Everyone makes a mistake.

2252
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:39,430
When you take the lead,
you put yourself at risk.

2253
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,399
Xitsuh claimed that he apologized...

2254
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:42,739
and Chungju-Man backed him up.

2255
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:46,010
He said that the one who was in charge
needed to take responsibility.

2256
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:49,409
Why does apologizing free Xitsuh
from taking responsibility?

2257
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,180
I really hope...

2258
01:36:51,609 --> 01:36:53,979
they'll put their hands on their chests
and think about it.

2259
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:57,149
Here's what I think about the game.

2260
01:36:57,149 --> 01:36:59,590
Those who contribute the most
should take the biggest reward...

2261
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:00,890
when they're successful...

2262
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:03,090
and the biggest penalty when they fail.

2263
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:07,329
I apologized to other people...

2264
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,800
because I was the one who led the team.
I thought I had a big part...

2265
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,899
in the team's loss.

2266
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:19,869
I was too scared to apologize. I'm sorry.

2267
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:31,720
I know that Xitsuh and I took...

2268
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,649
the main positions.

2269
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:37,659
After making a careless mistake,

2270
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,659
I felt incredibly guilty.

2271
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:43,659
But I couldn't voice it...

2272
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,470
because it felt like
agreeing to go to the Deathmatch.

2273
01:38:00,579 --> 01:38:02,279
My goodness.

2274
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:07,149
So...

2275
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:09,689
I thought...

2276
01:38:09,689 --> 01:38:11,189
that you'd feel hurt...

2277
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:13,430
if your name showed up on the screen
without a warning.

2278
01:38:14,659 --> 01:38:15,930
That's the thing.

2279
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,000
I could see what was happening.

2280
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,029
You should've told me.

2281
01:38:20,529 --> 01:38:22,229
I asked you.

2282
01:38:22,869 --> 01:38:24,640
I asked you to tell me.

2283
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,939
No one told me anything.

2284
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:29,380
It was obvious
that everyone wanted to vote for me.

2285
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,840
You guys whispered among yourselves.

2286
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:33,609
I...

2287
01:38:35,649 --> 01:38:36,720
As soon as the game ended,

2288
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:39,350
they made things very obvious.

2289
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,619
They hung out...

2290
01:38:42,619 --> 01:38:44,319
by themselves...

2291
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:45,819
and talked.

2292
01:38:46,189 --> 01:38:47,359
Did you do it?

2293
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:49,859
There's no reason not to vote for her.

2294
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:51,229
- We have to vote for her.
- I know.

2295
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,430
We should volunteer to go.

2296
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,899
Seriously. We don't need to use money.

2297
01:38:56,899 --> 01:38:59,100
- We just need to stick to this decision.
- Yes.

2298
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,409
Let's stay together before we go.

2299
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,750
It's so freaking annoying.

2300
01:39:11,149 --> 01:39:13,720
I guess that could happen
if you're out of sorts.

2301
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:17,119
For goodness' sake. This is the worst.

2302
01:39:20,289 --> 01:39:22,659
I acted like everything was okay...

2303
01:39:22,659 --> 01:39:25,199
and talked to other people.

2304
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:28,229
It was the correct answer. We had 100.

2305
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:30,199
- It was the correct answer.
- We had the operation symbols.

2306
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,199
That's why I'm so annoyed.

2307
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:32,909
Had we failed to complete it,
I wouldn't have been upset...

2308
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:33,909
by the wrong calculation.

2309
01:39:33,909 --> 01:39:35,739
Was it checked in the middle?

2310
01:39:35,739 --> 01:39:37,939
- She calculated it as 1, not 9.
- I guess so.

2311
01:39:38,539 --> 01:39:40,609
I thought to myself,

2312
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:44,119
"I don't know who startled it,"

2313
01:39:44,949 --> 01:39:47,619
"but they already reached an agreement."

2314
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:50,989
I could sense it.

2315
01:39:53,189 --> 01:39:54,229
I...

2316
01:39:55,989 --> 01:39:57,529
I'm sorry for everything.

2317
01:39:57,529 --> 01:40:00,430
I said we should talk
even though it was belated.

2318
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:03,199
You finally told me after stalling.

2319
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,710
We did that because we were weak.
I'm sorry.

2320
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,649
We couldn't say to your face,

2321
01:40:13,649 --> 01:40:15,409
"We're going to send you away,
so good luck."

2322
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,119
It wasn't easy to do that.

2323
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:27,859
I had no intention to talk.

2324
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:29,460
Who isn't scared of that?

2325
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,300
Had I made that kind of a mistake,

2326
01:40:32,529 --> 01:40:34,000
I would've told people to vote for me...

2327
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,829
even though it might not have been enough.

2328
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,600
I thought Xitsuh did...

2329
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,000
what he did...

2330
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,270
to lighten the burden of his heart.

2331
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:44,979
I thought he was pretending to be nice...

2332
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,180
by explaining why
we decided to vote for her.

2333
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:06,869
Of course,
Gina isn't the only one at fault.

2334
01:41:07,229 --> 01:41:09,640
But if she had apologized...

2335
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,699
for the calculation mistake,

2336
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:13,840
I wouldn't have been so angry.

2337
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:18,239
(Kim Min A votes for Lee Gina.)

2338
01:41:22,449 --> 01:41:23,750
Had she come...

2339
01:41:24,279 --> 01:41:27,319
to the teammates first
and talked about her mistake,

2340
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:30,420
I might've chosen differently.

2341
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,159
(Chungju-Man votes for Lee Gina.)

2342
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,699
Everyone is angry,

2343
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:40,399
so there's a chance
that our decision isn't totally rational.

2344
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:44,970
Min A will vote for me as well, right?

2345
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:47,770
I think so. I think she will.

2346
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:51,010
The two of you voted for me.
You'll vote for me too.

2347
01:41:56,180 --> 01:42:00,189
For making you take the fall for our loss,

2348
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:04,659
I'm sorry.

2349
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:09,529
I turned a blind eye and...

2350
01:42:15,369 --> 01:42:17,500
No. Xitsuh cornered her first...

2351
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,970
to avoid going to the Deathmatch.

2352
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,409
I didn't apologize either.

2353
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:24,180
Did Chungju-Man and Min A apologize?

2354
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:26,609
I think it was...

2355
01:42:26,609 --> 01:42:28,880
just an excuse.

2356
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,949
It actually makes no sense.

2357
01:42:30,949 --> 01:42:32,989
If you punish someone for working hard...

2358
01:42:33,449 --> 01:42:36,420
after the loss,
who will want to work for the team?

2359
01:42:36,689 --> 01:42:38,659
It was just one of the tactics...

2360
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,029
Xitsuh used...

2361
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:41,859
in order to survive.

2362
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,600
Please vote on the ballot.

2363
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,130
Since she took the initiative
and made a mistake,

2364
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:50,100
it became easier for Xitsuh to corner her.

2365
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:53,140
The blame that could've fallen on me...

2366
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,939
went to her.

2367
01:42:54,939 --> 01:42:59,140
(Yurisa votes for Lee Gina.)

2368
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,779
In the process,

2369
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:03,520
Gina's feelings got seriously hurt.

2370
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,420
But it wasn't my business.

2371
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:12,420
Gina kept crying...

2372
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,189
and told me that she was scared.

2373
01:43:14,189 --> 01:43:16,090
It made me feel bad.

2374
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,630
In a sense, it was everyone's failure.

2375
01:43:20,029 --> 01:43:23,670
We had no choice
but to make her take responsibility.

2376
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:25,500
It was honestly upsetting.

2377
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,479
I'll purchase an extra vote.

2378
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:36,420
(Lee Gina)

2379
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,850
(Xitsuh uses 2 votes on Lee Gina.)

2380
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:55,170
(Gina is the last one
to enter the voting room.)

2381
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:09,210
It'll be me anyway.

2382
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:12,220
But it'll be funny to vote for myself.

2383
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,750
For goodness' sake.

2384
01:44:14,619 --> 01:44:15,949
I want to vote for everyone.

2385
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:17,659
They're so mean.

2386
01:44:26,329 --> 01:44:28,229
I'll put a stamp next to my own name.

2387
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:30,699
(Lee Gina)

2388
01:44:30,699 --> 01:44:31,970
I'll have to go anyway.

2389
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:35,039
(Lee Gina votes for Lee Gina.)

2390
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:04,170
(Gina calms herself in the restroom...)

2391
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:06,470
(for a while.)

2392
01:45:11,909 --> 01:45:13,680
Now, let's talk.

2393
01:45:15,579 --> 01:45:18,779
Every operation comes with responsibility.

2394
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,520
I'm sorry to interrupt,

2395
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:22,989
- but...
- Don't do it. No.

2396
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:25,789
It's okay. I want to go to the Deathmatch.

2397
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,560
- No.
- It's okay.

2398
01:45:27,689 --> 01:45:28,960
- No.
- No.

2399
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,159
- None of us did badly.
- That's right.

2400
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:33,029
I agree with her. None of us did badly.

2401
01:45:33,069 --> 01:45:36,229
There isn't anyone in here
we can afford to lose.

2402
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,100
If I survive and come back,

2403
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:41,039
it'll be a good opportunity...

2404
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:43,109
to prove myself once more. And...

2405
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:47,909
I failed to take an active part
in the game.

2406
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,649
Si Yoon placed last.

2407
01:45:49,649 --> 01:45:51,479
- Did Si Yoon place last?
- Yes.

2408
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:53,289
And...

2409
01:45:53,989 --> 01:45:57,789
because my opponent was someone big,

2410
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:01,029
I became intimidated.

2411
01:46:02,359 --> 01:46:04,829
I was upset that I couldn't show...

2412
01:46:04,829 --> 01:46:06,329
what I could do.

2413
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,899
If I go to the Deathmatch...

2414
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:10,439
and come back alive,

2415
01:46:10,569 --> 01:46:13,409
it'll be a way to prove myself.

2416
01:46:13,569 --> 01:46:15,210
I thought it was only right...

2417
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:17,579
to go there confidently and fight.

2418
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:19,949
I didn't think that I'd lose.

2419
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:24,119
If you want to give it a go...

2420
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:25,779
Okay.

2421
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,649
I think it's...

2422
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,289
a valuable action.

2423
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:32,319
Go and win.

2424
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:34,630
I won't cry. I won't cry, okay?

2425
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:37,800
I became so attached to him.

2426
01:46:37,829 --> 01:46:39,159
He also struggled for a long time.

2427
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:42,100
We started out in Team Paradise
and stayed together.

2428
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:45,800
There was a chance he couldn't come back,

2429
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:49,409
so I really didn't want him to go.

2430
01:46:51,909 --> 01:46:56,079
(Si Yoon votes for Si Yoon.)

2431
01:46:56,210 --> 01:46:58,920
Warrior, seize victory and come back.

2432
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:01,050
(Jang Dong Min votes for Si Yoon.)

2433
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,619
(Heo Seong Beom votes for Si Yoon.)

2434
01:47:02,619 --> 01:47:03,960
(MJ Kim votes for Si Yoon.)

2435
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,489
(Acau votes for Si Yoon.)

2436
01:47:07,489 --> 01:47:09,130
Voting is over.

2437
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:14,199
By result, the players
who will participate in the Deathmatch...

2438
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:17,500
are Lee Gina of Team Mansion...

2439
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,239
and Si Yoon of Team Remaining.

2440
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:25,409
(Lee Gina: 6 votes, Si Yoon: 5 votes)

2441
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,079
Deathmatch players,
please gather at the Main Hall.

2442
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:36,350
Two players, Lee Gina and Si Yoon,

2443
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,930
will have the 1-on-1 Deathmatch.

2444
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,460
I was certain that I'd win.

2445
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,199
I thought, "Let's win."

2446
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,270
We were playing this game for survival.

2447
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:49,500
I really wanted to win.

2448
01:47:49,939 --> 01:47:51,270
Today's Deathmatch is...

2449
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,310
the Blind Bet.

2450
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:54,640
(Blind Bet)

2451
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:57,979
In Blind Bet, you'll look
at your opponent's blind card...

2452
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,279
and predict your blind card.

2453
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,949
If the sum of your open card
and blind card is greater,

2454
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:05,949
you'll succeed in the bet.

2455
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:08,250
The game consists of two rounds.

2456
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:10,359
Before the game, each player...

2457
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,090
will receive a set of open cards
from 1 to 10...

2458
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,760
and 30 betting chips.

2459
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,130
Once the game begins,
the butler will pick a card...

2460
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:20,829
from 2 sets of blind cards from 1 to 12...

2461
01:48:20,829 --> 01:48:23,670
and place it in front of each player.

2462
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:26,300
You can't look at your own blind card.

2463
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,840
You'll look
at the opponent's blind card...

2464
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:31,039
and guess your own blind card.

2465
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:33,750
Then you can bet chips or give up.

2466
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:37,279
Once the bet closes after the two players
bet the same number of chips,

2467
01:48:37,479 --> 01:48:40,020
each player will pick an open card...

2468
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,020
and submit it.

2469
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:44,460
The two cards,
the blind card and the open card,

2470
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:46,319
will be revealed at the same time.

2471
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,630
The player with the bigger sum will win...

2472
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:51,529
and take all the chips that were bet
during the turn.

2473
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:55,529
If a player who gives up on betting
has the blind card...

2474
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,140
that's 11 or 12,

2475
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:00,739
he or she will need to give...

2476
01:49:00,939 --> 01:49:02,869
ten additional chips...

2477
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:04,840
to the opponent as a penalty.

2478
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:10,180
The player who wins
with the open card that's 1 or 2...

2479
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:13,079
will receive ten additional chips...

2480
01:49:13,289 --> 01:49:15,250
from the opponent.

2481
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:19,119
Once the player uses up
their ten open cards,

2482
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,689
the round will end.

2483
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,529
After the two rounds,

2484
01:49:22,529 --> 01:49:25,329
the player with more chips will win.

2485
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,239
I was there
because I was discarded by my team.

2486
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:32,100
I had to go back for a bloody revenge.

2487
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,170
I couldn't get eliminated then.

2488
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:37,140
I was incredibly nervous.

2489
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:40,079
It was the most nerve-racking moment
of my life.

2490
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:42,409
I stood in front of the mirror
and said, "You're the best."

2491
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:45,649
"You're smart. You can do it."

2492
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,649
I did that repeatedly...

2493
01:49:47,649 --> 01:49:49,720
and breathed in and out.

2494
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,789
I made a big fuss
with the breathing technique...

2495
01:49:51,789 --> 01:49:53,890
before entering the Deathmatch.

2496
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,930
When we played Expression Link,

2497
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,729
she hid behind the answer board.

2498
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,840
She tried everything to shield herself...

2499
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,100
from the sun.

2500
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,710
I had seen that,

2501
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:10,180
so I judged her to be someone
who'd react in an obvious way...

2502
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:12,739
if she was feeling uncomfortable.

2503
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,510
I thought hard about...

2504
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:18,680
how to use her psychology to my advantage.

2505
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,920
Good.

2506
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:24,659
So the opponent can see my card...

2507
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:26,420
- and I can see the opponent's card.
- Yes.

2508
01:50:26,619 --> 01:50:28,789
We will begin Round One.

2509
01:50:29,090 --> 01:50:31,130
I will reveal the blind card.

2510
01:50:31,829 --> 01:50:33,569
(Si Yoon's blind card is a 7.)

2511
01:50:35,029 --> 01:50:37,039
(Lee Gina's blind card is a 10.)

2512
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:41,670
Why did she get a good card right away?

2513
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:43,239
She's lucky.

2514
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,439
Please bet one chip each to open.

2515
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,979
Si Yoon, please bet first.

2516
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,819
I'll bet one chip.

2517
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:59,760
Lee Gina, please bet.

2518
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:02,260
I'll bet one chip.

2519
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,859
The betting is closed.

2520
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:06,399
Please submit one open card each.

2521
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,100
Gina's blind card was ten...

2522
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:16,010
and my blind card was a mystery.

2523
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:19,109
I had to save...

2524
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:22,510
the important cards, 1 and 2,

2525
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:25,550
in order to make her give me coins
as a penalty.

2526
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,520
So I chose and submitted three.

2527
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,060
The rules were simple.

2528
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:41,800
So I decided to follow my feelings...

2529
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:44,039
for betting chips and submitting cards.

2530
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:46,069
I decided to focus and play.

2531
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:48,739
(Lee Gina submits an open card.)

2532
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:51,140
I will reveal the blind card first.

2533
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:54,409
Si Yoon's blind card is seven.

2534
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:57,880
Lee Gina's blind card is ten.

2535
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:01,050
I will reveal the open card.

2536
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:03,189
Si Yoon's open card is three.

2537
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:06,119
Lee Gina's open card is four.

2538
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:07,359
(Lee Gina's open card is 4.)

2539
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:09,229
Si Yoon's total is ten...

2540
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:11,859
and Lee Gina's total is 14.

2541
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,729
Lee Gina has won.

2542
01:52:14,229 --> 01:52:16,600
Si Yoon's chips will go to Lee Gina.

2543
01:52:26,409 --> 01:52:28,850
(Touching)

2544
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:31,550
I don't know
what he's doing with his legs.

2545
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,289
Is he counting...

2546
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:35,750
- the opponent's cards?
- Seriously.

2547
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,760
I thought...

2548
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,329
that it'd be hard to remember...

2549
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:42,159
all the cards.

2550
01:52:42,189 --> 01:52:44,760
So I thought about how to count the cards.

2551
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,470
I folded my toes one at a time.

2552
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,770
I began with my big toe.
It was like counting with my fingers.

2553
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:51,500
One, two, three, four, five.

2554
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:53,239
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2555
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:54,840
When the number was past that,

2556
01:52:54,869 --> 01:52:57,180
I made a nail mark for 1 and 2.

2557
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:59,409
If something came out twice,
I unfolded my toe.

2558
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:02,409
For Gina's cards, I used my fingers.

2559
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:05,520
I couldn't count in a way
that was visible to her,

2560
01:53:05,649 --> 01:53:08,619
so I made a nail mark. I did it hard.

2561
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:12,220
Every time we did something, he got down.

2562
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,859
I was like, "What is he doing?
Is he writing on the floor?"

2563
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:16,899
"But there isn't a pen.
It can't be allowed."

2564
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,460
I will reveal the next blind card.

2565
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:21,729
(Lee Gina's blind card is 4.)

2566
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,840
(Si Yoon's blind card is 1.)

2567
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:28,039
Si Yoon has a high chance
of losing in this turn.

2568
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:30,069
Lee Gina, please bet first.

2569
01:53:30,109 --> 01:53:31,210
Please bet.

2570
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:35,850
(Si Yoon's blind card is
the lowest number.)

2571
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,119
I'll bet one chip.

2572
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:40,119
I'll bet one chip.

2573
01:53:40,119 --> 01:53:41,689
The betting is closed.

2574
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:44,619
Please submit one open card each.

2575
01:53:44,659 --> 01:53:46,619
I will reveal the open card.

2576
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,960
Si Yoon's open card is five.

2577
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:52,829
Lee Gina's open card is one.

2578
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,930
Lee Gina's total is five...

2579
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:57,039
and Si Yoon's total is six.

2580
01:53:57,069 --> 01:53:58,340
He won.

2581
01:53:58,369 --> 01:53:59,640
It was a fluke.

2582
01:54:00,039 --> 01:54:02,210
Si Yoon has won.

2583
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:05,210
She used one of the most important cards,

2584
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:07,880
one and two.

2585
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:09,680
It made me think,
"She didn't understand the rules."

2586
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,819
"She didn't understand them
by 100 percent."

2587
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:12,920
"Since she didn't understand them
by 100 percent,"

2588
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:15,289
"she can't be counting cards.
Let's take my time."

2589
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,090
I will reveal the next blind card.

2590
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,130
(Si Yoon's blind card is 5.)

2591
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:25,630
(Lee Gina's blind card is 3.)

2592
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:27,569
I will bet one chip.

2593
01:54:28,199 --> 01:54:29,329
I will bet two chips.

2594
01:54:31,069 --> 01:54:32,100
I will match her bet.

2595
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,739
The betting is closed.

2596
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:36,840
Please submit one open card each.

2597
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:39,180
(Si Yoon submits an open card.)

2598
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:42,079
(Lee Gina submits an open card.)

2599
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:44,180
I will reveal the open card.

2600
01:54:45,449 --> 01:54:47,649
Si Yoon's open card is four.

2601
01:54:48,619 --> 01:54:51,159
Lee Gina's open card is seven.

2602
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,829
For goodness' sake. He lost by one.

2603
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:55,789
Si Yoon's total is nine...

2604
01:54:56,029 --> 01:54:58,300
and Lee Gina's total is ten.

2605
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,270
Lee Gina has won.

2606
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,869
It was a nice win.

2607
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:03,529
It was the best.

2608
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:06,840
It's okay.

2609
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:08,170
He's more than capable of winning.

2610
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:09,640
- He's counting the cards.
- He can win.

2611
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:11,939
I will reveal the next blind card.

2612
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:16,350
(Si Yoon's blind card is 6.)

2613
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,420
(Lee Gina's blind card is 8.)

2614
01:55:20,989 --> 01:55:22,520
I'll bet one more chip.

2615
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:26,760
Most of the numbers were out.

2616
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,630
I had to make a winning move
in this round.

2617
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:31,430
When I saw eight,

2618
01:55:32,359 --> 01:55:33,560
I decided to bluff.

2619
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,300
Without betting too many chips,

2620
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:38,640
I decided to make a move...

2621
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:41,539
that would bait her.

2622
01:55:41,609 --> 01:55:43,909
What? He's betting many chips.

2623
01:55:44,609 --> 01:55:46,140
I'll bet four more chips.

2624
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:48,850
Si Yoon has bet a total of five chips.

2625
01:55:49,079 --> 01:55:51,180
Lee Gina, would you like to bet more?

2626
01:56:01,689 --> 01:56:03,829
(Touching)

2627
01:56:12,970 --> 01:56:14,010
I'll bet more chips.

2628
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:15,510
The betting is closed.

2629
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,539
Please submit one open card each.

2630
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:21,380
I didn't think
that Gina would match the bet.

2631
01:56:21,449 --> 01:56:24,279
She didn't know what her blind card was,

2632
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,649
so such a move seemed unlikely.

2633
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,250
Si Yoon must be thinking, "I'm ruined."

2634
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:33,189
"I bluffed when her card was eight.
I'm ruined."

2635
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,989
(Thinking)

2636
01:56:46,439 --> 01:56:50,270
(Si Yoon submits an open card.)

2637
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:53,439
(Lee Gina submits an open card.)

2638
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:55,210
I will reveal the open card.

2639
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:58,550
Si Yoon's open card is eight.

2640
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,850
Lee Gina's open card is nine.

2641
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,890
Lee Gina has won.

2642
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:07,689
Si Yoon's chips will go to Lee Gina.

2643
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:11,359
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2644
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:14,729
That was when I thought,
"Something isn't going right."

2645
01:57:14,869 --> 01:57:17,439
"Is my data flawed?"

2646
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:20,439
Confusion began to fill my head.

2647
01:57:24,739 --> 01:57:27,180
I will reveal the next blind card.

2648
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:30,979
(Lee Gina's blind card is 9.)

2649
01:57:30,979 --> 01:57:32,850
Si Yoon, please bet first.

2650
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:35,319
(Touching)

2651
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,090
I'll bet more.

2652
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:43,630
(Si Yoon bets 5 more chips.)

2653
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:45,960
Si Yoon, you've bet five more chips.

2654
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,600
To be honest, it was another bluff.

2655
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:50,739
It isn't easy...

2656
01:57:50,739 --> 01:57:52,869
to bluff twice in a row.

2657
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,640
There's a total of seven chips.

2658
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:56,510
Would you like to bet more?

2659
01:57:56,539 --> 01:57:57,710
Please.

2660
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:00,279
I'm getting goosebumps.

2661
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:09,149
One, two, three, four...
There are five of them.

2662
01:58:09,289 --> 01:58:10,420
One, two, three,

2663
01:58:10,989 --> 01:58:13,520
four, five, six, seven.

2664
01:58:14,729 --> 01:58:17,229
Lee Gina, you bet seven chips in total.

2665
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,199
The betting is closed.

2666
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:21,329
Is she a shaman?

2667
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:22,630
Does she see something?

2668
01:58:22,899 --> 01:58:25,369
Did she hear something from ghosts?

2669
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:28,810
Please submit one open card each.

2670
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:40,380
I will reveal the open card.

2671
01:58:41,689 --> 01:58:44,090
Si Yoon's open card is a ten.

2672
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,220
Lee Gina's open card...

2673
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:48,060
is a ten.

2674
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:49,430
Lee Gina has won.

2675
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:52,460
Lee Gina takes all the chips Si Yoon bet.

2676
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:55,470
I will reveal the next blind card.

2677
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,130
I will reveal the open card.

2678
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:59,140
Lee Gina has won.

2679
01:58:59,869 --> 01:59:01,970
I will reveal the next blind card.

2680
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:03,880
Lee Gina has won.

2681
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:06,539
Lee Gina takes all the chips.

2682
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:08,409
(Current number of chips, Lee Gina: 52)

2683
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:11,520
(Current number of chips, Si Yoon: 8)

2684
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:12,850
Oh, my.

2685
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:14,250
The difference is quite big.

2686
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:15,890
Bluffing from the beginning...

2687
01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:16,890
He's doomed.

2688
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:17,960
is too risky.

2689
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:21,029
The moment I saw my chips were gone,

2690
01:59:21,189 --> 01:59:22,430
I thought it was dangerous.

2691
01:59:22,789 --> 01:59:24,899
"Let's hold out.
Let's have a war of attrition."

2692
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:26,199
"Let's slow it down."

2693
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,229
For now, when you have bad cards,
you should give up quickly.

2694
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:31,439
When you have good cards,

2695
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,109
you should bet big,

2696
01:59:34,109 --> 01:59:35,109
hoping your opponent makes a mistake.

2697
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:36,439
If the opponent calls, you will win.

2698
01:59:36,869 --> 01:59:38,779
- That's the only way.
- So you should just pray?

2699
01:59:38,779 --> 01:59:41,079
- It's something like that.
- He's losing...

2700
01:59:41,079 --> 01:59:42,649
to someone who isn't even counting.

2701
01:59:43,479 --> 01:59:45,520
I will reveal the blind card first.

2702
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:47,949
(Si Yoon's blind card is a 5.)

2703
01:59:48,489 --> 01:59:50,449
Lee Gina, please bet first.

2704
01:59:51,489 --> 01:59:52,590
I bet three.

2705
01:59:52,989 --> 01:59:53,989
I fold.

2706
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:56,029
Si Yoon has given up betting.

2707
01:59:56,029 --> 01:59:58,229
I will reveal the next blind card.

2708
01:59:58,960 --> 01:59:59,960
I fold.

2709
02:00:00,829 --> 02:00:03,029
Si Yoon has given up betting.

2710
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,600
Lee Gina takes the chips Si Yoon bet.

2711
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,600
(Current Number of Chips,
Si Yoon: 6, Lee Gina: 54)

2712
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,109
"Let's not take the risk.
Let's not bluff."

2713
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:10,810
"Let's drag it out..."

2714
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:13,079
"and win the pot only when I can."

2715
02:00:13,079 --> 02:00:15,649
I will reveal the next blind card.

2716
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:19,279
(Si Yoon's blind card is a 9.)

2717
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:23,550
(Lee Gina's blind card is a 11.)

2718
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:26,220
Lee Gina will bet first.

2719
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:28,930
If Gina folds,

2720
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,329
she should pay ten chips as a penalty,
right?

2721
02:00:30,329 --> 02:00:31,329
Right.

2722
02:00:31,329 --> 02:00:32,960
If Si Yoon wants to take the risk
to win now,

2723
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:33,970
he should go all-in.

2724
02:00:34,670 --> 02:00:35,930
His blind card is a nine. She might fold.

2725
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:39,539
(It's a perfect time to bluff.)

2726
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:42,010
One, two, three, four...

2727
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:45,239
Do you have seven chips left?

2728
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,449
Do you have seven chips left?

2729
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:51,149
Can you count, please? Should I count?

2730
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,680
You're right. It's seven.

2731
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:58,619
I bet five chips.

2732
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:01,529
Lee Gina bet five more chips.

2733
02:01:01,529 --> 02:01:02,760
She bet six chips in total.

2734
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:05,529
Darn it. It means she will call
even if he goes all-in.

2735
02:01:05,529 --> 02:01:07,000
She bets big from the beginning.

2736
02:01:07,329 --> 02:01:10,130
- Yes. She calls even when he goes all-in.
- She's aggressive.

2737
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:11,170
Certainly.

2738
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,939
Si Yoon, would you like to bet more?

2739
02:01:13,239 --> 02:01:14,239
I fold.

2740
02:01:14,369 --> 02:01:16,369
Si Yoon has given up betting.

2741
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:18,810
Lee Gina takes the chips Si Yoon bet.

2742
02:01:19,039 --> 02:01:21,109
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

2743
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:24,180
There's no hope now.

2744
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,350
I will reveal the next blind card.

2745
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:31,260
(Si Yoon's blind card is a 12.)

2746
02:01:33,859 --> 02:01:34,930
Si Yoon got a 12.

2747
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:35,930
- He got a 12?
- Yes.

2748
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:40,970
(Lee Gina's blind card is a 2.)

2749
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:42,100
It's 12 versus 2.

2750
02:01:43,069 --> 02:01:45,439
He can use her tendency.

2751
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:47,640
She never folded.

2752
02:01:48,039 --> 02:01:51,039
Si Yoon should bet big...

2753
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:52,710
to make her call without folding.

2754
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:55,779
It'll give her a signal
that he wants to give up.

2755
02:01:56,279 --> 02:01:57,279
"This is my chance."

2756
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,279
Si Yoon will bet first.

2757
02:02:05,659 --> 02:02:06,789
I set out a bait.

2758
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:08,329
Holding the chips,

2759
02:02:08,329 --> 02:02:10,930
I was contemplating
if I should bet big or not.

2760
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:13,329
I thought she would bet more...

2761
02:02:13,329 --> 02:02:15,699
when I bet a moderate number of chips.

2762
02:02:15,699 --> 02:02:16,869
I bet one chip.

2763
02:02:16,869 --> 02:02:19,770
Si Yoon has bet 1 more chip.
He bet 2 in total.

2764
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:22,010
Lee Gina, would you like to bet more?

2765
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:28,979
(Touching)

2766
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:31,949
She's bluffing.

2767
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,260
I fold.

2768
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:42,260
Lee Gina has given up betting.

2769
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:44,729
Darn it. She was bluffing.

2770
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:48,600
When she had a bad card,

2771
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,130
she bet more.

2772
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:52,869
"Why did she give up now?"

2773
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:55,039
I just...

2774
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:58,779
couldn't understand her play.

2775
02:02:59,239 --> 02:03:01,409
As Lee Gina gave up betting,

2776
02:03:01,409 --> 02:03:03,909
Si Yoon takes all the chips Lee Gina bet.

2777
02:03:04,119 --> 02:03:06,720
I will reveal the next blind card.

2778
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:09,720
(Si Yoon's blind card is a 4.)

2779
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,020
(Lee Gina's blind card is a 1.)

2780
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,760
Lee Gina will bet first.

2781
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:15,159
Si Yoon might earn a lot of chips now.

2782
02:03:15,159 --> 02:03:16,630
Because she will go first.

2783
02:03:16,630 --> 02:03:18,229
And she's aggressive too.

2784
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:21,229
Gina, bet big.

2785
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:23,329
Please bet big.

2786
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:40,949
- I fold.
- Lee Gina has given up betting.

2787
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:44,989
- She's ridiculously good.
- This is legendary.

2788
02:03:44,989 --> 02:03:46,119
- What?
- She's unbelievably good.

2789
02:03:46,119 --> 02:03:48,229
- I guess she's counting too.
- Yes.

2790
02:03:49,029 --> 02:03:50,130
She's counting in her head?

2791
02:03:51,399 --> 02:03:53,329
What? She isn't even using her toes.

2792
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:56,500
Actually, I was counting perfectly.

2793
02:03:56,729 --> 02:03:59,100
Memorizing the numbers...

2794
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:02,239
wasn't as hard as I had thought.

2795
02:04:02,239 --> 02:04:04,180
I knew how many 1s or 2s...

2796
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:06,409
there were.

2797
02:04:06,409 --> 02:04:10,779
I was thinking
based on the remaining cards.

2798
02:04:10,779 --> 02:04:13,619
When there were 2 cards left
at the end of the 1st deck,

2799
02:04:13,619 --> 02:04:14,819
I saw that his card was a four.

2800
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:16,489
Since I was counting everything,

2801
02:04:16,489 --> 02:04:18,890
I knew my card was a one, so I folded.

2802
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:21,159
How can she count 36 cards?

2803
02:04:21,689 --> 02:04:23,989
- I guess she's counting in her head.
- She's counting.

2804
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:25,060
- She is.
- Lee Gina.

2805
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:26,829
As there's no blind card left,

2806
02:04:26,829 --> 02:04:28,100
I will re-shuffle the cards again.

2807
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:35,970
(Wriggling)

2808
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:38,109
He's getting a cramp in his toes.

2809
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:41,550
I will reveal the next blind card.

2810
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:44,220
(Si Yoon's blind card is an 11.)

2811
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:48,220
(Lee Gina's blind card is a 9.)

2812
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:50,550
Now, we got a new deck of cards.

2813
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:51,789
So I didn't know what I had anymore...

2814
02:04:51,789 --> 02:04:53,060
because they were re-shuffled.

2815
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:54,090
We got a new deck.

2816
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:56,789
I didn't know what I had,

2817
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:59,060
so I thought I would definitely win...

2818
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,229
if I don't make a mistake
and count correctly.

2819
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,199
Please bet one chip each to open.

2820
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:04,199
(The blind cards are reset.)

2821
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:06,869
(Lee Gina's blind card is a 9.)

2822
02:05:08,909 --> 02:05:10,909
(Marking on his 9th toe)

2823
02:05:10,909 --> 02:05:12,539
Si Yoon will bet first.

2824
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:13,979
Yes. Bet big.

2825
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:15,909
Please go all-in...

2826
02:05:15,909 --> 02:05:16,979
and earn chips this time.

2827
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:24,420
I fold.

2828
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:27,590
Si Yoon has given up betting.

2829
02:05:29,289 --> 02:05:30,659
- Why?
- He's doomed.

2830
02:05:30,829 --> 02:05:31,960
He got an 11, but he's doomed.

2831
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:35,029
- He bet 10 chips?
- If he loses with an 11...

2832
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:37,640
I will reveal the blind card.

2833
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:41,409
Lee Gina's blind card is a nine.

2834
02:05:42,569 --> 02:05:45,579
Si Yoon's blind card is an 11.

2835
02:05:45,579 --> 02:05:47,850
(Si Yoon's blind card is an 11.)

2836
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:50,510
It was ridiculous.

2837
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,319
Right after the deck has changed,

2838
02:05:54,149 --> 02:05:57,220
I got an 11.

2839
02:05:57,819 --> 02:05:58,920
I couldn't believe it.

2840
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,029
(Current Number of Chips,
Si Yoon: 0, Lee Gina: 60)

2841
02:06:01,029 --> 02:06:04,090
Lee Gina takes Si Yoon's ten chips.

2842
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,430
The Deathmatch has ended.

2843
02:06:13,899 --> 02:06:17,439
(Sighing)

2844
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:18,510
I should've gone.

2845
02:06:19,609 --> 02:06:23,010
I realized I wasn't good enough...

2846
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:26,979
to survive here for a long time.

2847
02:06:29,619 --> 02:06:31,859
It was a clean sweep...

2848
02:06:31,859 --> 02:06:34,289
in conclusion.

2849
02:06:34,789 --> 02:06:36,229
I was so proud.

2850
02:06:36,229 --> 02:06:37,659
"I'm smarter than I thought."

2851
02:06:37,659 --> 02:06:39,859
I was very proud of myself.

2852
02:06:39,859 --> 02:06:42,569
Recently, I've been losing...

2853
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:45,140
when I played as a team.

2854
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:46,840
I was like,

2855
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:49,109
"I might not be good."

2856
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:51,810
Then I had a 1-on-1 Deathmatch...

2857
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:53,939
and had a clean sweep.

2858
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:56,449
It gave me confidence, which is nice.

2859
02:06:56,779 --> 02:06:59,920
"You threw me away. Did you see this?"

2860
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:01,819
"The one you threw away..."

2861
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:04,520
"is back after winning the Deathmatch."

2862
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:06,489
"Look forward to it."

2863
02:07:07,489 --> 02:07:10,189
The winner of the Deathmatch
has been decided.

2864
02:07:10,189 --> 02:07:13,000
Players, please gather at the Main Hall.

2865
02:07:15,069 --> 02:07:17,270
I will announce
the result of the Deathmatch.

2866
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,500
The eliminated player is...

2867
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:23,369
Si Yoon.

2868
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:34,989
Si Yoon, please pack your bags...

2869
02:07:34,989 --> 02:07:36,520
and leave Bloody Game immediately.

2870
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:40,659
Eliminated players cannot return
to Bloody Game again.

2871
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:45,560
If I were to list...

2872
02:07:45,899 --> 02:07:48,000
what I regret about,

2873
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:51,569
the list could go on forever.

2874
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:54,000
I loved the show.

2875
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,810
And I loved the games I played here.

2876
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:58,909
I can do it.

2877
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:01,279
(Si Yoon was a dedicated team player...)

2878
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:05,380
(who was genuinely committed
every moment,)

2879
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:09,189
(to the point of not sparing himself.)

2880
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:13,020
I learned a lot of lessons.

2881
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:14,390
It's correct.

2882
02:08:15,829 --> 02:08:17,029
Yes!

2883
02:08:17,029 --> 02:08:19,260
It was meaningful.

2884
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,100
I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity.

2885
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:26,939
I'll remember this
for the rest of my life.

2886
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:35,880
(The eliminated player is Si Yoon.)

2887
02:08:37,819 --> 02:08:39,949
It's so funny
that Jin Ho and I are on the same team.

2888
02:08:40,649 --> 02:08:42,720
I'm not doing much this time, though.

2889
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:45,590
Steve and Hyun Seo
are doing everything for me.

2890
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,619
I'm just saying it's funny
that we're on the same team.

2891
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:48,960
Oh, it's funny?

2892
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:50,689
I thought you said I was reliable.

2893
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:53,260
You are reliable.

2894
02:08:54,199 --> 02:08:56,229
Jin Ho, when playing individually,

2895
02:08:56,569 --> 02:08:58,300
is it better to be on a larger team
or a smaller team?

2896
02:08:58,500 --> 02:08:59,699
- When playing individually?
- Yes.

2897
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:02,069
Being on a larger team
would be a little bit better...

2898
02:09:02,539 --> 02:09:03,539
at least.

2899
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:06,479
Seong Beom came yesterday.

2900
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:08,380
He said we would play individually
in the next match.

2901
02:09:08,949 --> 02:09:10,079
- Did you know?
- How did he know?

2902
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:11,619
We didn't know,

2903
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:14,250
but it seems Team Remaining found out
because of their privilege.

2904
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:16,989
- After winning the game?
- So they all know...

2905
02:09:16,989 --> 02:09:18,189
we'll be playing individually
in the next game.

2906
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,689
And the winner of the individual match...

2907
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:22,529
can reallocate all teams.

2908
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:25,329
- Really?
- The winner can reorganize all teams...

2909
02:09:25,329 --> 02:09:28,029
and decide on where they live.

2910
02:09:28,829 --> 02:09:29,869
That's an important piece of information.

2911
02:09:29,869 --> 02:09:31,399
So Seong Beom came to me...

2912
02:09:31,399 --> 02:09:33,770
and suggested I join Team Remaining.

2913
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:35,470
The condition...

2914
02:09:35,869 --> 02:09:37,670
is that I help them as a spy.

2915
02:09:37,670 --> 02:09:40,340
- That's...
- He asked me to help his team.

2916
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:43,010
If he had suggested...

2917
02:09:43,449 --> 02:09:46,949
we trust each other...

2918
02:09:46,949 --> 02:09:50,220
while playing individually,

2919
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:52,119
I would've cooperated.

2920
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,989
But that's not what he suggested.

2921
02:09:54,989 --> 02:09:57,390
He wanted me to play on Dong Min's team...

2922
02:09:57,390 --> 02:09:59,029
while breaking them up.

2923
02:09:59,029 --> 02:10:00,529
That was the mission.

2924
02:10:00,529 --> 02:10:02,670
It was completely different...

2925
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:04,699
from what I had thought.

2926
02:10:04,699 --> 02:10:06,369
Dong Min came later.

2927
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:07,739
The atmosphere was...

2928
02:10:08,069 --> 02:10:09,609
It was like we had a third party.

2929
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,510
And I couldn't say,

2930
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:14,710
"I don't want to do it now."

2931
02:10:15,079 --> 02:10:16,109
He didn't give you a chance to say no.

2932
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:17,609
I couldn't refuse.

2933
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:19,850
- It was like, "yes or yes."
- "Yes or yes."

2934
02:10:19,949 --> 02:10:22,149
"Hey, it's a good offer. Think about it."

2935
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:24,350
"If your team decides to abandon someone,"

2936
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:26,020
"you'll be the first one."

2937
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:27,090
- Why did he think so?
- "We..."

2938
02:10:27,090 --> 02:10:28,159
"We will take you."

2939
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:30,260
"Join us."

2940
02:10:30,359 --> 02:10:32,199
"But we want you
to interrupt them a little."

2941
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:33,199
That's what happened.

2942
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:34,500
It must've been confusing.

2943
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:35,630
Yes. I felt heavy.

2944
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:36,869
I even received a note earlier.

2945
02:10:37,699 --> 02:10:38,770
I thought you saw it.

2946
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,939
- Oh, my.
- You didn't see that?

2947
02:10:40,199 --> 02:10:41,909
- Can you show it to us?
- I received a note.

2948
02:10:42,510 --> 02:10:44,210
I didn't know
they tried to trick us so much.

2949
02:10:44,210 --> 02:10:46,340
Gosh, they're playing dirty.
I had no idea.

2950
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:48,810
"Let me know
if they completed the expression."

2951
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:49,850
Gosh.

2952
02:10:50,149 --> 02:10:52,050
They gave it to you during the game.

2953
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:53,380
If you let them know,

2954
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:54,750
- Even if you let them know...
- would it make a difference?

2955
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:56,949
- My gosh.
- They should just play games.

2956
02:10:56,949 --> 02:10:58,159
Should we have to trick them too?

2957
02:10:58,159 --> 02:10:59,560
I thought Dong Min would just play games.

2958
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:00,760
But he's playing dirty.

2959
02:11:01,289 --> 02:11:03,659
Their assumption is completely wrong.

2960
02:11:03,659 --> 02:11:05,399
They thought
Hye Seon would be thrown away...

2961
02:11:06,229 --> 02:11:07,970
if one of us were to leave.

2962
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:09,699
They made the wrong assumption.

2963
02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:13,239
I think they said it to threaten her.

2964
02:11:13,369 --> 02:11:14,810
- But it's a completely wrong assumption.
- Yes.

2965
02:11:15,239 --> 02:11:17,109
Hye Seon said...

2966
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:19,579
they had talked to her secretly.

2967
02:11:19,609 --> 02:11:21,279
She could've not said it,

2968
02:11:21,609 --> 02:11:23,680
but she told us first,

2969
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:24,680
which is fortunate.

2970
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:27,880
- Team Remaining...
- Yes.

2971
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:30,390
- tried to win Hye Seon over.
- They tried to win her over.

2972
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:31,789
- Why?
- To disturb us.

2973
02:11:32,659 --> 02:11:33,659
I guess they're scared.

2974
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:35,329
"Are you scared?"

2975
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:37,960
- "Are you scared?"
- "Are you scared?"

2976
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:41,729
They already won Yurisa over.

2977
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,970
But nobody knows what she's thinking.

2978
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:48,369
So we don't know.
She only takes her own side.

2979
02:11:48,569 --> 02:11:51,279
I thought it was quite weird yesterday.

2980
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,479
Yurisa and Team Dong Min
have nothing to talk about.

2981
02:11:54,779 --> 02:11:57,880
Yesterday, I was going to tell Xitsuh,
but I didn't.

2982
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:00,279
Yurisa, Dong Min, and Si Yoon...

2983
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:02,720
gathered and kept talking.

2984
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:05,260
I thought it was weird,
so I was going to tell him, but I didn't.

2985
02:12:05,319 --> 02:12:07,060
So Yurisa...

2986
02:12:07,359 --> 02:12:08,930
is definitely a spy working for them.

2987
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,560
Things are more suspicious than I thought.
Gosh.

2988
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:14,329
It's complicated. We should attack
and defend at the same time.

2989
02:12:14,329 --> 02:12:16,229
We should steal from them
and stop them from stealing.

2990
02:12:16,569 --> 02:12:17,630
- We should keep them in check too.
- We should keep them in check too.

2991
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:18,800
We should protect the vault too.

2992
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,000
- What's this?
- We should protect our teammates too.

2993
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:21,840
What's going on?

2994
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:26,979
Who made the expression?

2995
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:28,710
- It's mostly done by me.
- You did everything?

2996
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:30,380
Why didn't you make Yurisa do it?

2997
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,020
I don't understand.

2998
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:35,590
She said she couldn't do it.

2999
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:36,619
What did she say?

3000
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:37,920
It's just...

3001
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:39,819
- Did she say she was bad at math?
- It's something along the lines of it.

3002
02:12:39,819 --> 02:12:42,189
- Her IQ is 156. She can't be bad at math.
- Rather...

3003
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:44,560
Rather than math... I don't know.

3004
02:12:45,029 --> 02:12:47,260
There's a reason I'm asking you this.

3005
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:50,369
Dong Min...

3006
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:52,270
tried to win her over as far as I know.

3007
02:12:52,270 --> 02:12:53,840
I'm 100 percent certain
he tried to do that.

3008
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,210
Because he tried to win one of us over.

3009
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:57,470
Hye Seon told us everything.

3010
02:12:58,909 --> 02:13:00,710
Thinking about it,
many things were suspicious today.

3011
02:13:01,239 --> 02:13:03,710
I asked her to draw the discarded cards.

3012
02:13:04,149 --> 02:13:07,520
But she said she couldn't do it
as it was too hard.

3013
02:13:07,649 --> 02:13:10,520
She said she wasn't good with numbers.

3014
02:13:10,949 --> 02:13:12,659
I'm bad at calculating.

3015
02:13:13,090 --> 02:13:14,119
- That's nonsense.
- You do it.

3016
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:15,590
If you're bad at calculating,

3017
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:17,390
how could you become a member of Mensa?
You're unbelievable.

3018
02:13:17,390 --> 02:13:19,529
I thought I would let you do it.

3019
02:13:19,529 --> 02:13:21,729
Did you give money to Mensa
to become a member?

3020
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:24,399
I was so stupid...

3021
02:13:24,569 --> 02:13:26,100
that I didn't notice.

3022
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:28,069
Yurisa...

3023
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:30,670
was never on our team.

3024
02:13:30,869 --> 02:13:32,180
None of us are humans.

3025
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,640
You guys locked us in here.

3026
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:35,579
We've been saying
this is a social experiment,

3027
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:36,779
not a game.

3028
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:39,449
Everyone is like a crazy hyena.

3029
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:43,420
- Come to think of it,
- Yes.

3030
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:45,319
did Hye Seon bring 0 cards in Round 2?

3031
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:46,560
Yes.

3032
02:13:46,689 --> 02:13:49,630
She might be faking then.

3033
02:13:49,729 --> 02:13:51,600
- I don't think so.
- We can't be sure, though.

3034
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:52,760
We can't.

3035
02:13:52,829 --> 02:13:54,829
It's possible. She brought nothing.
It doesn't make sense.

3036
02:13:54,829 --> 02:13:56,100
Right. It was Round Two.

3037
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:57,899
She might've told us everything...

3038
02:13:58,069 --> 02:13:59,939
so that we don't suspect her.

3039
02:13:59,939 --> 02:14:00,939
Yes.

3040
02:14:01,810 --> 02:14:04,510
For now, we should keep an eye on her.

3041
02:14:04,739 --> 02:14:06,640
I'm not saying we should suspect her.

3042
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:09,779
I'm just saying we should think
it's possible to suspect her.

3043
02:14:09,779 --> 02:14:10,810
Okay?

3044
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:13,680
You're right.

3045
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:15,350
The three of them were talking.

3046
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:18,020
- With MJ and Yurisa.
- Yes.

3047
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:19,859
It didn't look natural.

3048
02:14:25,529 --> 02:14:26,729
They're talking again.

3049
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:28,729
Over there.

3050
02:14:29,369 --> 02:14:31,439
What is it? Why do they keep talking?

3051
02:14:31,569 --> 02:14:33,899
- It's suspicious.
- Those people.

3052
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,069
What are they plotting?

3053
02:14:42,109 --> 02:14:43,180
You're right.

3054
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:45,279
What you said is right.

3055
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:47,250
- Yes.
- Get it together.

3056
02:14:47,579 --> 02:14:50,289
Which team is it?

3057
02:14:50,289 --> 02:14:51,789
Team Paradise or Team Remaining?

3058
02:14:51,789 --> 02:14:53,760
Si Yoon is on Team Remaining.
What are you talking about?

3059
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,430
- Who?
- I'm talking about Hye Seon, not Si Yoon.

3060
02:14:56,229 --> 02:14:57,260
That one.

3061
02:14:57,460 --> 02:14:58,960
- Team Paradise.
- Team Paradise?

3062
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:00,130
On our team.

3063
02:15:00,130 --> 02:15:01,529
- Is that so?
- Yes.

3064
02:15:02,199 --> 02:15:04,270
- Get it together.
- It's because I drank. I didn't know.

3065
02:15:04,270 --> 02:15:05,399
- My gosh.
- Cheers.

3066
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:06,640
We're playing the Bloody Game.

3067
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:08,470
What are you talking about?

3068
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:16,409
Well... Something...

3069
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:18,380
- is suspicious.
- Why?

3070
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:19,819
It's strange somehow.

3071
02:15:19,949 --> 02:15:22,819
Of course, it's a game. So here,

3072
02:15:23,649 --> 02:15:26,260
we can't help but suspect others a little.

3073
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:28,560
During the Expression Link,

3074
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:31,460
there were...

3075
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:32,560
suspicious situations.

3076
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:35,569
So I talked about it with Jin Ho.

3077
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:53,550
The problem is...

3078
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:56,090
We're suspecting
that Hye Seon is cooperating with them.

3079
02:15:56,949 --> 02:15:58,420
She didn't have to tell us
about their offer then.

3080
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:59,560
No.

3081
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,760
She was lying. It's possible.

3082
02:16:02,529 --> 02:16:03,989
I think she was lying...

3083
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:06,229
because she said she had gone
to the same place with Dong Min...

3084
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:08,600
and she had found zero cards...

3085
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:10,699
while he had found more than 20.
I think it was a lie.

3086
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:13,369
Dong Min found 25 cards in Round 2.

3087
02:16:13,739 --> 02:16:14,800
I saw it.

3088
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:17,270
I wondered how he found them...

3089
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:18,479
because it was a lot.

3090
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:20,479
Thinking about it now,

3091
02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:22,750
Hye Seon said she had found zero cards...

3092
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:25,119
because she gave her cards to him.
Then it makes sense.

3093
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:26,819
It makes more sense.

3094
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,520
As time has passed, I was confused,

3095
02:16:29,819 --> 02:16:31,720
thinking about what Hye Seon did.

3096
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:32,959
During the Expression Link,

3097
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:34,590
she got zero cards.

3098
02:16:34,819 --> 02:16:36,489
She found 0 cards for 15 minutes.

3099
02:16:36,489 --> 02:16:38,500
Fifteen minutes isn't short.

3100
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:41,229
- I found nothing.
- You found nothing?

3101
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:42,299
- Nothing?
- Yes.

3102
02:16:42,299 --> 02:16:44,170
Did you check the security camera?

3103
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:46,469
- You found nothing there?
- Okay.

3104
02:16:46,670 --> 02:16:48,809
At that moment, I was like, "It's a pity.
But there's nothing we can do."

3105
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:51,040
"I guess she couldn't see anything."
Then I moved on.

3106
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:54,180
But thinking about it, Dong Min...

3107
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:55,549
I found 24 cards.

3108
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,450
- My goodness.
- Let's hurry.

3109
02:16:58,649 --> 02:17:01,520
"What? It doesn't make sense."

3110
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:03,350
"Even though he's a good player,"

3111
02:17:03,350 --> 02:17:05,719
"is it possible that he found cards nearly
three times as many as what we found?"

3112
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:08,290
The moment I thought of it,

3113
02:17:08,659 --> 02:17:10,690
I started suspecting her a lot.

3114
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:11,860
"What was that?"

3115
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:14,899
Hye Seon found nothing.

3116
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:16,729
- I found nothing.
- Really?

3117
02:17:16,729 --> 02:17:17,899
- Yes.
- Let's go inside.

3118
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,399
I was surprised.

3119
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:22,469
Because I saw
there was a card in front of her,

3120
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,709
but she didn't grab it.

3121
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,579
It was right on the table.

3122
02:17:28,579 --> 02:17:31,719
Compared to the number of cards...

3123
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:33,479
other people found in that round,

3124
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:36,250
she found nothing.

3125
02:17:37,219 --> 02:17:39,989
"Even I, with my poor observation skills,
found this many cards."

3126
02:17:41,219 --> 02:17:42,489
Then I started...

3127
02:17:43,559 --> 02:17:45,100
not trusting her.

3128
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:47,829
"Did she tell us about their offer
on purpose..."

3129
02:17:47,829 --> 02:17:50,870
"to reassure us once more..."

3130
02:17:51,229 --> 02:17:53,340
"and confuse us?"

3131
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:56,110
As I started thinking like that,

3132
02:17:57,069 --> 02:17:58,340
I was very confused.

3133
02:17:58,340 --> 02:18:01,209
I talked with my teammates
and asked for their opinions.

3134
02:18:02,079 --> 02:18:06,280
I didn't know what to do
in that situation.

3135
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:10,489
We don't know what Hye Seon is thinking.
It's ambiguous.

3136
02:18:11,149 --> 02:18:13,559
She might've not joined them.
Or she might've.

3137
02:18:13,559 --> 02:18:14,620
Yes.

3138
02:18:15,059 --> 02:18:18,629
Anyway, why don't we ask her?

3139
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:20,459
- Shall we?
- I think it's the right thing to do.

3140
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:23,200
- Because we don't know.
- Right. She might be falsely accused.

3141
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:26,200
What if she told us
without any other intentions?

3142
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:28,040
It's possible
that she just made a judgment on her own,

3143
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:29,540
but we thought it was suspicious...

3144
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:31,040
and misunderstood her.

3145
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:32,909
If we throw her away
without hearing anything from her,

3146
02:18:32,909 --> 02:18:35,010
it's not right, is it?

3147
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:37,510
If she really is the spy,

3148
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:39,319
we might be fooled.

3149
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,920
But if she's not, we might exclude her...

3150
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,850
and let her be eliminated...

3151
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:47,989
without giving her...

3152
02:18:47,989 --> 02:18:49,629
any chance.

3153
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:51,290
We thought it wasn't right...

3154
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:52,959
and it was morally right
for us to give her a chance at least.

3155
02:18:53,059 --> 02:18:54,399
That's why we talked with her.

3156
02:18:55,799 --> 02:18:58,229
Anyway, that's what we're suspecting.

3157
02:18:58,229 --> 02:19:00,069
We should hear your thoughts...

3158
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,840
before organizing our thoughts.

3159
02:19:07,809 --> 02:19:10,180
I understand logically.

3160
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,649
But for me,

3161
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:15,920
I took the risk...

3162
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,350
to tell you guys.

3163
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:21,520
Because I didn't help them in the end.

3164
02:19:21,659 --> 02:19:24,729
Then it means nothing actually happened.

3165
02:19:24,729 --> 02:19:26,100
- Right.
- Yes.

3166
02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:29,100
Anyway,

3167
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:31,840
I told you about it...

3168
02:19:32,069 --> 02:19:36,069
to say that I'm definitely...

3169
02:19:36,069 --> 02:19:38,270
- You're not on their side?
- not on their side.

3170
02:19:38,340 --> 02:19:39,979
That's what I'm saying.

3171
02:19:40,709 --> 02:19:42,209
You're right.

3172
02:19:42,209 --> 02:19:44,610
I totally understand.
But it was an ironic situation.

3173
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:47,020
And it made us nervous,
so we wanted to talk again.

3174
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,920
We just wanted you to tell us...

3175
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:52,290
if that was the case. That's why.

3176
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:56,860
It would've been nice
if you had told us about Yurisa earlier.

3177
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:58,799
Earlier?

3178
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:01,700
People would normally say
something like that before the game.

3179
02:20:01,729 --> 02:20:04,969
Let's say
someone gave me an offer like that.

3180
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:09,110
Then I would've told
1 of my teammates 1st, whoever it is.

3181
02:20:09,239 --> 02:20:13,440
I would've told someone
I can talk to easily.

3182
02:20:13,709 --> 02:20:15,950
It might mean...

3183
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:17,950
there's no one you trust that much.

3184
02:20:18,049 --> 02:20:20,219
That's partially right.

3185
02:20:20,549 --> 02:20:22,719
I...

3186
02:20:24,049 --> 02:20:26,290
wasn't 100 percent sure.

3187
02:20:28,829 --> 02:20:29,930
What I'm saying is...

3188
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:31,860
One of the reasons...

3189
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:35,370
I couldn't refuse the offer
right away is...

3190
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:36,930
When Seong Beom said,

3191
02:20:36,930 --> 02:20:39,899
"The guys..."

3192
02:20:39,969 --> 02:20:42,969
"are already close.
They have a strong bond."

3193
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:47,139
"Don't you think it's easy for them
to throw you away?"

3194
02:20:47,409 --> 02:20:50,209
"That's not true."

3195
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:53,450
"We have a strong bond as a team."

3196
02:20:53,479 --> 02:20:56,350
I couldn't say that with confidence.

3197
02:20:56,889 --> 02:20:58,989
That's why...

3198
02:20:59,190 --> 02:21:02,889
I couldn't tell them
right after I got an offer like that.

3199
02:21:04,159 --> 02:21:08,000
That's why...

3200
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:10,530
I was touched and thankful.

3201
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:13,739
After they heard what I said...

3202
02:21:14,370 --> 02:21:15,739
- Dong Min lost...
- Yes.

3203
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:17,809
because he didn't know...

3204
02:21:17,809 --> 02:21:19,180
- what she wanted.
- Right.

3205
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:20,680
She wants nothing now.

3206
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,350
Her picture is hanging
in Central of Hong Kong.

3207
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:24,879
- She has over 1.7 million followers.
- She has over 1.7 million followers.

3208
02:21:24,879 --> 02:21:26,049
He went to the wrong person.

3209
02:21:26,049 --> 02:21:27,549
How many followers does Dong Min have?

3210
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:32,690
They said it was ridiculous.

3211
02:21:32,719 --> 02:21:35,090
They said I was 1 of the 6 members...

3212
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:36,760
just like everyone else.

3213
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:37,860
They were like, "Why..."

3214
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:40,600
"do you think..."

3215
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:44,129
"you're excluded?"

3216
02:21:44,329 --> 02:21:46,399
When they said it,

3217
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:48,500
I was very touched.

3218
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:52,479
So I felt much better
after telling them about it.

3219
02:21:52,809 --> 02:21:56,750
But when they said they became suspicious
after thinking about it again,

3220
02:21:58,079 --> 02:21:59,549
I...

3221
02:22:01,149 --> 02:22:02,319
was upset.

3222
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:05,420
If you think about it,

3223
02:22:05,719 --> 02:22:07,319
I joined Team Remaining
on the first day...

3224
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:09,329
because Jin Ho picked me.

3225
02:22:09,459 --> 02:22:12,659
The player voted for the Deathmatch
is Choi Hye Seon.

3226
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:15,399
On the second day when we make raid,

3227
02:22:15,469 --> 02:22:18,569
they were like, "She's on that side.
Let's do it by ourselves."

3228
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:20,600
Then when I came here,

3229
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:22,809
they said I was close to Team Mansion.

3230
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:26,040
I thought you might want me
to betray you...

3231
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:29,450
and join Team Mansion.

3232
02:22:29,450 --> 02:22:30,979
No, we didn't.

3233
02:22:31,379 --> 02:22:33,549
This is what I think.

3234
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:36,920
I don't want to cling to any team
to survive.

3235
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:40,420
So if you let me join you
because you have no other choice,

3236
02:22:40,420 --> 02:22:43,030
I don't want to go with you today.

3237
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:44,430
Do you know what I mean?

3238
02:22:44,459 --> 02:22:46,799
It doesn't matter if I can play my part...

3239
02:22:46,899 --> 02:22:49,000
as a teammate just like everyone else.

3240
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,030
That's not what it is.

3241
02:22:50,129 --> 02:22:52,500
Please calm down.

3242
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:54,340
Don't be emotional.

3243
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:58,110
I don't know what to say
when you're crying.

3244
02:22:58,809 --> 02:23:01,639
Don't do that.
Please hold it in for a moment.

3245
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:06,319
If I were to talk in that situation,

3246
02:23:07,379 --> 02:23:09,319
I would've explained
the overall situation...

3247
02:23:09,319 --> 02:23:11,649
to make them understand.

3248
02:23:13,190 --> 02:23:15,260
But she cried
in the middle of the conversation.

3249
02:23:16,090 --> 02:23:17,260
So...

3250
02:23:21,729 --> 02:23:23,530
I didn't want to talk anymore.

3251
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,139
That's not what I think.

3252
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:33,010
The biggest risk I see isn't you,

3253
02:23:33,239 --> 02:23:36,409
but our team being dismantled...

3254
02:23:36,409 --> 02:23:38,049
by that single note.

3255
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:42,290
I just want to keep us together.

3256
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:47,260
How do you feel after the conversation?

3257
02:23:48,889 --> 02:23:49,959
Do you think what she said is true?

3258
02:23:49,959 --> 02:23:53,629
It's better after talking with her.

3259
02:23:53,899 --> 02:23:54,899
Okay.

3260
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:57,770
But I don't think
we can rule it out completely.

3261
02:24:00,170 --> 02:24:03,340
I think we can just keep going
like we've done before.

3262
02:24:04,610 --> 02:24:06,139
I'm just not 100 percent sure.

3263
02:24:06,610 --> 02:24:10,110
Eon Kyu also said it.
If one of us makes up their mind,

3264
02:24:11,049 --> 02:24:14,020
they can betray others in this system.

3265
02:24:14,450 --> 02:24:17,420
Well, I don't know.

3266
02:24:18,090 --> 02:24:19,520
I saw it several times.

3267
02:24:19,719 --> 02:24:22,559
I think you trust others too easily.

3268
02:24:22,659 --> 02:24:24,659
- You think so?
- You trust others too easily.

3269
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:26,399
I trust women when they cry.

3270
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:29,729
That's nonsense.

3271
02:24:29,770 --> 02:24:31,100
I trust them at least once.

3272
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:35,299
When something happens,

3273
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:37,610
everyone responds differently.

3274
02:24:37,610 --> 02:24:41,110
Whether the other team
succeeded or failed,

3275
02:24:42,149 --> 02:24:44,709
the impact of the attempt...

3276
02:24:44,709 --> 02:24:46,750
- is this significant.
- Right.

3277
02:24:46,819 --> 02:24:49,090
It's the butterfly effect.

3278
02:24:50,290 --> 02:24:53,120
Human nature is truly frightening.

3279
02:24:54,059 --> 02:24:56,090
Even if you get along well,

3280
02:24:56,090 --> 02:24:58,260
the moment a small seed of mistrust...

3281
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:01,500
is planted...

3282
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:05,100
due to a certain reason or situation,

3283
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:08,500
suspicion spreads to others...

3284
02:25:09,209 --> 02:25:10,969
in an instant.

3285
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:12,940
Because we were already suspecting her,

3286
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:16,479
even when she went to get some water...

3287
02:25:16,649 --> 02:25:19,879
and sit with Team Remaining,
even though it could happen,

3288
02:25:19,879 --> 02:25:22,319
we were like, "Why is she not coming here?
She's on our team. Why is she over there?"

3289
02:25:23,319 --> 02:25:24,920
That's what we thought.

3290
02:25:25,889 --> 02:25:28,719
I don't think we can't suspect her at all,

3291
02:25:29,059 --> 02:25:30,360
but we decided to go until the end.

3292
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:31,959
We thought it was not right for us...

3293
02:25:31,959 --> 02:25:34,100
to exclude her
when we couldn't be 100 percent sure.

3294
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:36,969
Yes. We should trust people.

3295
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:41,840
(4 hours ago)

3296
02:25:42,770 --> 02:25:44,010
- Guys.
- Yes.

3297
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:47,379
Team Paradise...

3298
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:49,549
still...

3299
02:25:50,079 --> 02:25:53,280
thinks...

3300
02:25:53,850 --> 02:25:55,180
Hye Seon is the spy.

3301
02:25:56,190 --> 02:25:58,790
Because I found 24 cards before.

3302
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:01,559
I think she really couldn't find anything.

3303
02:26:01,819 --> 02:26:05,229
That's why they think
she gave all the cards to me...

3304
02:26:06,129 --> 02:26:08,159
and she's the spy.

3305
02:26:09,069 --> 02:26:10,270
They're suspecting her.

3306
02:26:11,930 --> 02:26:15,139
So I want you...

3307
02:26:15,239 --> 02:26:17,610
to talk with her privately.

3308
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:20,909
You're saying
I should make her look like...

3309
02:26:20,909 --> 02:26:22,450
- she's still the spy.
- Yes.

3310
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:24,250
- Even though she isn't anymore.
- Right.

3311
02:26:24,250 --> 02:26:25,309
I see.

3312
02:26:26,079 --> 02:26:28,989
We should use their suspicion. Okay?

3313
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:30,489
Get along with her.

3314
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:33,319
"He kept calling for her."

3315
02:26:33,319 --> 02:26:35,459
We should make them think like that.
Do you understand?

3316
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:40,899
This is Bloody Game.

3317
02:26:41,059 --> 02:26:42,729
If they have suspicion,
we should use that.

3318
02:26:43,469 --> 02:26:45,430
She has nowhere to go now.
