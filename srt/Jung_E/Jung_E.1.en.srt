Ma'am.

she was considered a legendary mercenary.

Did you see how many robots it destroyed
on its way to the fail point?

[man 1] Seriously.

the enemy's been poorly programmed?

90
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,135
[man 2] Oh, we should tweak
how the simulation starts next time.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

92
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,097
Listen, we have to keep
the start the same.

93

The simulation has to match the real life
situation in order to map the brain.

Oh, Team Leader Yun, you're here.

128
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,634
[dramatically] Thank you
for your hard work.

Director.

130
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,472
Is all of this
preparation really necessary?

They're a different generation.

132
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,935

more than you think.

134
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,232
I hope you aren't nervous. Are you okay?

135
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,818
Or did you not sleep well?

136
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,027
I'm fine.

137
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,322
Should I be concerned?

138
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,074
Because you seem to be on edge.

139
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,117
This guy?

140
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,618
Me?

[scoffing dramatically]

142
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,248
Presentations need showmanship,

143
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,418
so what you're sensing is my focus,
Team Leader Yun.

144
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,380
I won't be blandly reading
like some presentation amateur.

145
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,467
I intend to be humorous also.

146
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,847
And treat our honored guests
with cocktails and delicious food as well.

147
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,517
This guarantees our company
their full support.

148
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,353
You get it, right? Hmm?

149
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,907
[nervously] Hello, Mr. Kro… [gulps]

150
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm the proud director of… of Kronoid.
Kim Sang-hoon is my name.

151
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,880
Please enjoy the show.

-[Sang-hoon in video] Year 2135.
-[dramatic music playing]

155
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,566
The rising sea level, depletion
of resources, and the pollution of Earth

156
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,903
forced mankind
to look for a new way to survive.

157
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,115
Humankind found refuge from
the uninhabitable environment

158
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,409
in shelters they built in space.

159
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,453
However, only a short time later,

160
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:14,502
space shelters number 8, 12, and 13
declared themselves the Adrian Republic,

161
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,673
which started a civil war that threatened
Earth and peaceful life in the shelters.

162
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,051
I did the narration on this myself.

163
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,680
[narration] And this war
between the Allied Force

164
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,851
and the Adrian has been
going on for the last 40 years.

165
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,772
I put this edit together
and I also picked the music.

00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,066
-Whoo-whoo!
-[narration] …combat AIs for the war.

167
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,444
Founded in the year 2130 CE,

168
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,030
with a team of top researchers utilizing…

169
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,158
We know this already.
How about we get to the point?

170
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,243
All right.

171
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,120
Just go on, skip it. Skip it.
Skip to the end.

172
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,043
[narration] …legendary mercenary
of the Adrian Civil War.

173
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,336
The pride of Korea.

174
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,963
Captain Yun Jung-yi.

175
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,677
Captain Yun Jung-yi
led Team 45 to victory in Squadron 8.

176
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,137
After countless successful missions,

177
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,641
she secured her place
as the war's greatest hero.

178
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,435
Shall I fast-forward more for you?

179
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,773
[narration] Thirty-five years ago,

180
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,692
Captain Yun Jung-yi joined the mission

181
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,821
to blow up a fuel rod
in Adrian's Shelter B-25.

182
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:28,158
But the mission was a failure
and she ended up in a coma.

183
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,495
Kronoid, with permission from her family,

184
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,457
spared no expense on state-of-the-art
treatments to keep her alive,

185
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,044
then mapped her neural cortex
and converted it to data.

186
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,674
With this, we will develop
the most advanced combat command AI ever,

187
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,468
equipped with the tactical
and combat skills of Jung-yi,

188
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,471
as well as her great loyalty
and determination.

189
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,431
Yes.

190
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,727
This new program is aptly named "JUNG_E."

191
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,020
[dramatic music ends]

192
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,398
We developed it so that
the spirit of Captain Yun would live on.

193
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,071
Ah. The daughter of Captain…
The daughter of legendary Captain Yun,

194
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,866
Dr. Yun Seo-hyun,
is leading the project's team.

195
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,494
And now,
I'll allow the team leader to explain.

196
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,954
You're up.

197
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,707
Don't be nervous, okay?

198
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,209
Whoo! Whoo! [coughs awkwardly]

199
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,935
I'd like to show you the data
copied from Ms. Yun's brain.

200
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,687
We are developing an AI

201
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,982
comprised of the real-life Captain Yun
on her final mission,

202
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,902
focusing on her combat skills
and experience

203
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,197
using the data collected from her brain.

204
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,950
[beeping]

205
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,035
[panting]

206
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,828
To achieve this,

207
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,874
the android operating from the collected
brain data completes a simulation.

208
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,211
The behavioral pattern
is stored and analyzed.

209
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:11,136
From our simulations, we have activated
the network of neural pathways shown here.

210
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,599
[inhaling] Hang on.
The pathways should be in green instead.

211
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,019
Because our projects are so easy
to green-light. You know?

212
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,020
[mimics bell ringing]

213
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,689
Can you be serious?

214
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,234
That was one of my jokes.

215
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,280
We will use a simulation
to isolate these areas of the brain,

216
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,033
and extract the combat memory data.

217
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:38,789
The goal here is to create an AI
with unmatched performance.

218
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,999
So, how did it do?

219
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,918
Did the robot escape in the simulation?

220
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,505
Not at the moment.

221
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,340
We have to remember,

222
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,552
if Yun Jung-yi completed
the final mission,

223
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,387
we would have won the war.

224
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:59,059
Her failure is why the Adrian Civil War
is still going on after 40 years.

225
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,353
The Korean mercenary…

226
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,064
She was popular at the time.

227
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,734
But sentiments have changed.

228
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,694
A lot of citizens
think she's the main reason

229
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,031
the Adrian Civil War
has dragged on for so long.

230
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,825
Ah, that is still up for debate.

231
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,162
Still, our combat AI is an improvement.

232
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,290
We are only taking the greatest parts
of Captain Yun

233
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,751
and extracting it all to be used--

234
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,588
Then why does it keep failing to escape
when it's in the battle simulation?

235
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,468
Why on earth would you model
a combat AI off her?

236
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,345
I would prefer a soldier
who can complete the mission instead.

237
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,263
[Dr. Yun] She will.

238
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,892
I am certain.

239
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,437
Captain Yun Jung-yi will succeed in her
original mission very soon.

240
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,565
On that, you have my word. Furthermore…

241
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,611
Her lost glory as an Allied Forces hero

242
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,820
will be reclaimed.

243
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,365
[sighs deeply]

244
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,623
[classical string music playing]

00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,641
[beeping]

246
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,354
Whoo!

247
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,690
That's an original Park Ho.

248
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,526
Yun Jung-yi warrior edition.

249
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,819
Beautiful, right?

250
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,239
Speaking of beautiful,
look at that sunset.

251
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,281
[sucks in breath]

252
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,699
[gasps]

253
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,494
You came early.

254
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,247
It's adorable.

255
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,543
I learned that the people of the past

256
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,380
thought that a product's design
was just as valuable as its usefulness.

257
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,800
And that would make sense
in a time of such abundance.

258
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,426
Right.

259
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,680
I really admire the passion
you showed them.

260
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,931
[exclaiming proudly]

261
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,975
Unbelievable passion, really.

262
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,061
Those geezers were overwhelmed.

263
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,439
You pretty much sealed the deal
for the project.

264
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:14,611
They pulled me aside and said it's
a green light if we clear the simulation.

265
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,155
That's good news.

266
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,866
Please, have a seat.

267
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,286
Cold brew, Doctor?

268
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,496
Only the best from the past.

269
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,497
No, thank you.

270
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,001
I'm processing 17
before we destroy the data.

271
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,544
Processing them?

272
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,461
Hmm.

273
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,214
Do you find that that's valuable,

274
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,757
Team Leader Yun?

275
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,094
Does it help us define the brain analysis?

276
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,305
Good question.

277
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,641
Having more information
improves our chances.

278
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,186
Mm-mm-mmm.

279
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
For you.

280
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,401
I hope you feel accomplished.

281
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,237
The greatest thing we've built
is in your mother's name,

282
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,365
and it might bring an end to the war!
[chuckles]

283
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,285
It's the chairman's victory.

284
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,247
[sighs]

285
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,544
Wow, he truly is a great man.

286
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,215
The chairman and you
go back a long time, right?

287
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,177
It's only been ten years
since I've started working for him.

288
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,097
You've known him since you were young
because of the history with your mother.

289
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,644
Well, it's more like
he's looked after me since I was young.

290
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,980
The JUNG_E project is definitely back on.

291
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,899
Forget what that old fart said before.

292
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:40,197
Captain Yun Jung-yi was easily
the greatest combat soldier in her day.

293
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,201
She only failed in that one
measly mission. [mimics people blabbing]

294
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,495
He's just jealous.

295
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,247
He wants to be beloved.

296
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,126
The only reason your mother is still alive
is because of our great chairman,

297
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,837
who has expectations for the project
that are so high

298
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,715
that I…[exaggerated crying]
I get emotional.

299
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,177
You have my full support.

300
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,138
Don't worry, Director.

301
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,101
And now… I really must go.

302
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,436
-To begin processing.
-Oh yes, of course.

303
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,021
Uh.

304
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,399
The chairman will be visiting any day.

305
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,858
So keep up the good work.

306
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,485
Go get 'em!

00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,564
What am I? I can't feel my body.

327
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,068
Listen, just stay calm, okay?

328
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,029
-Um, uh, Ms… Ms. Yun?
-Where… Where am I? Where am I?

329
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,115
What have you done?
I don't… I don't understand!

330
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,867
[shouting] Who the hell are you?

331
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,327
WILL TO FIGHT INCREASING

332
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,996
Let me go, you monsters!
What in the hell have you done?

333
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,083
I think she's unresponsive. [chuckles]

334
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,211
I'll get you bastards!

335
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,253
DEACTIVATE

336
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,547
[screaming] I'll kill you all!

337
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,512
[sighs]

338
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,223
Destroy the brain. Unable to process.

339
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,476
[clunking, powering down]

340
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,252
[electronic trilling]

341
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,275
[man] It seems like a waste
to destroy them every time, though.

342
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,736
You did well, for your first time.

343
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,656
[chuckles modestly] Really?
I didn't really do all that much.

344
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,824
[laughs]

345
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,126
[Dr. Yun] So I hear
you wanted to move to our team.

346
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,294
Ah, yes.

347
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,963
Truth be told,
I'm a big fan of Captain Yun.

348
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:29,050
[laughs] When I was young,
she was a real-life superhero.

349
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,094
[Dr. Yun chuckles] Superhero?

350
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,141
The real reason
that my mother kept fighting in the war,

351
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,893
it was to help me.

352
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,311
Sorry?

353
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,522
When I was young,

354
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,692
they found a tumor in my lungs.

355
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,988
The treatments were expensive, and…

356
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,491
we were poor.

357
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,745
To help pay for my treatments,

358
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,747
my mother became a mercenary.

359
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,499
[sighs]

360
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:05,212
I was terrified that one day,
my mother would die fighting in the war,

361
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,632
trying to save my life with hers.

362
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,134
Every time she fought, I cried.

363
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,719
Hmm.

364
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,263
The day I got the surgery…

365
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,434
was the last day she went into action.

366
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,102
Ah…

367
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,896
I always wondered…

368
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,818
does my mother regret
sacrificing her life to save her daughter?

369
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,905
And does she resent me because of it?

370
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,034
[inhaling sharply]
So why haven't you asked?

371
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,536
[melancholy music playing]

372
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,037
What?

373
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,039
There in processing, you could ask.

374
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,792
If it fails a simulation,
you could ask it then.

375
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,710
If it ever resented its daughter.

376
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,420
[inhaling sharply] You're right.

377
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,965
I could do that.

378
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,007
Yeah.

379
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,846
Excuse me, Jae-kyung,
I have the ethics test today.

380
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,933
So please finish up the report
on 17's processing.

381
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,936
[groaning] Oh, the ethics test.
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,563
Hm.

383
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,610
Thank you, ma'am. For sharing your story.

384
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,488
Honestly, she really was my hero!
[laughs awkwardly]

385
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,615
Don't be scared to tell me more!

386
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,742
Hoo!

387
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,494
[chuckles excitedly]

388
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,081
[automated announcement]
Train approaching.

389
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,251
Please watch out.

390
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,504
The doors are opening.

391
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,475
The Central 09 train is self-driving.

392
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,353
The doors are closing.

393
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,897
The train is now departing.

394
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,571
[melancholy music playing]

395
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,087
Thank you.

396
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,089
-Thank you.
-Here.

397
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,175
[civilians continue chattering]

398
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,204
[girl] Mom, you'll come back. Right?

399
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,083
Of course. Now you be good,
and listen to auntie while you're there.

400
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,085
[sniffles]

401
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,255
[mother] Don't cry, it's nothing.

402
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,884
-Come on. Don't cry.
-[train braking]

403
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,887
[mother] It's not like
you won't see me again.

404
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,639
Okay?

405
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,104
Seo-hyun.

406
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,482
Mommy has to go on another mission.

407
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,695
So I can't be at your side
when they perform the surgery, honey.

408
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,614
You have to stay strong, okay?

409
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,241
You're mom's brave girl, right?

410
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,242
Yeah?

411
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,327
[melancholy music continues]

412
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,413
Ma…

413
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,999
will you hurry back?

414
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,377
After the surgery, will you be here?

415
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,963
Oh, of course.

416
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,633
I'll be gone, but honey,
I swear I'll come back in no time.

417
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,345
When I finish the mission,
I will be right by your side.

418
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,305
All right, sweetie?

419
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,853
Now give me a lucky cheek rub, okay?

420
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,147
[chuckles] Yeah.

421
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,274
[sighs] I love my girl.

422
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,485
-[laughs]
-My baby.

423
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,239
[both sigh]

424
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,243
[both laugh contentedly]

425
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,126
We'll take good care of her.

426
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,216
[playful growl]

427
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,426
[both laugh]

428
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,095
[Captain Yun] I'll see you soon.
You can do it. Okay? Okay?

429
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,805
[blowing kisses]

430
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,831
[music fades out]

431
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:57,545
[woman] This is the eighth ethics test of
Team Leader Yun Seo-hyun of Kronoid Lab.

432
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,757
Ms. Yun, have you ever had a pet?

433
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,884
I have not.

434
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,429
[woman] Have you ever felt attached
to a product or an object?

435
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,517
-Yes.
-Have you ever named the object?

436
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,476
Yes.

437
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,561
[woman] Have you ever composed poetry

438
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,272
longer than three lines
looking at the sunset?

439
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,524
Yes.

440
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,859
Have you ever bought an original artwork

441
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,696
at a price that is
too expensive for your means?

442
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,740
I have not.

443
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,536
[doctor] Okay, the test results will be
sent to the company in two to three days.

444
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,248
More importantly, the cancer has
metastasized from the location

445
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,167
where you previously had surgery.
I'm afraid it's not good news.

446
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,963
Ms. Yun, the cancer
has spread to your major organs.

447
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:44,467
As I told you before, this area here
will inevitably continue to spread.

448
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,803
It's impossible
to perform surgery at this point.

449
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,720
[hollow laugh]

450
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,139
It was always going to happen.

451
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,935
That surgery I got as a kid
was for nothing.

452
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,019
[doctor] Pardon?

453
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,646
It's nothing.

454
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,481
Doctor…

455
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,568
how much time do I have now?

456
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,695
You have three months.

457
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,240
The best course of action

458
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,117
would be to copy your brain right away

459
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,160
and transfer over to a prosthetic body.

460
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,290
These days,
the law guarantees equal human rights

461
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,375
to those who choose this procedure.

462
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,085
Assuming you choose Type A.

463
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,921
But it does come at a steep price.

464
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,047
Type A.

465
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,842
It's too steep for me.

466
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,304
It includes a cerebral storage backup
before we transfer the brain.

467
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,641
Also secures your human rights
and covers a single body prosthetic.

468
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,811
There are other options available,
like Type B,

469
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,480
but rights like marriage,
freedom of movement,

470
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,482
and adoption are prohibited.

471
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,528
With Type B, the government requires
compliance that you will allow them

472
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,030
to access your brain data.

473
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:51,659
And then, if both of those options
are too much, there's Type C.

474
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,202
-And that--
-With Type C,

475
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,663
you don't get treated
as a human being at all.

476
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,874
Honestly, it's really not all that bad.

477
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,584
The main difference with Type C

478
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,961
is you surrender ownership
of your brain data,

479
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,922
allowing certified companies to own it.

480
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,133
And since countless clones
will be created with it,

481
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,637
you will no longer be an individual,
so that is…

482
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,598
The main upside being,

483
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,185
the Type C prosthetic
is free of charge though.

484
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,938
A data use credit
covers the transfer amount.

485
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,900
The contract your mother,
Captain Yun Jung-yi, signed with Kronoid

486
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,234

Let me think about it.

488
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,533
Since I'm here,
I hope to see my mother before I go.

489
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,369
Yeah, please, of course.

490
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,579
And I'm always close by
if you have any questions.

00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,081

[man] Ms. Yun barely made it out alive.

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,490
She's in critical condition.

497
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,118
But you must decide right away,

498
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,870
before her cerebral cortex is damaged.

499
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,874

If you choose to sign the agreement,

we'll cover Ms. Yun's treatment

503
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,471
and her daughter Seo-hyun's
education and living expenses.

With Ms. Yun's brain data,

00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,742
we can make a product
that will end this war, once and for all.

509
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,370
We'll let the company know that you agreed
to go forth with the project.

510
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,833
And I'll make sure that the money
for your living expenses is sent soon.

However, I'm excited to see it.

653
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,455
He said he'll be
visiting the lab very soon.

654
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,416
Don't worry. No need to be nervous, hm?

655
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:42,971
[hissing]

656
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,767
[tense music playing]

657
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,749
Such simple minds.

658
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:16,380
After all the money the chairman invested
in developing a combat AI,

659
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,758
they're going to downsize
weapons development now?

660
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,679
I will keep his dream alive.

661
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,808
Don't you agree?

662
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,603
That vapid woman knows nothing.

663
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,150
Knows nothing about the chairman.

664
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,820
Nothing at all.

665
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,165
[tense music ends]

666
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,687
It's pretty cool, right? Look.

667
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:18,525
Yes. This latest version is a marked
upgrade from the previous test body.

668
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,362
So how well
do the AI implement the yellow area?

669
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,282
The test version mapped it well.

670
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,451
After today, we'll know more.

671
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,454
I'm so excited! So excited!

672
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:34,958
Director!

673
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,170
The chairman has just arrived.
He's in your office.

674
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,963
He's here? I'm on my way.

675
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,632
Oh…

676
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,010
Is it okay if I take this one?
I think the chairman would like it.

677
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,179
Go ahead. Of course.

678
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,263
Team Leader.

679
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,101
Team Leader Yun.

680
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,355
When did you last take the ethics test?

681
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,774
The ethics test?

682
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,111
You know, the test that
identifies humans from our friend here.

683
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,823
A couple of days ago.

684
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,158
I make it a point to never skip it.

685
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,535
[laugh]

686
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,245
The chairman was wondering.

687
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:15,582
He must be worried about it
because Yun Jung-yi was your mother.

688
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,168
He's very thorough man.

689
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,004
The chairman as alway--
[electronic beeping]

690
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,924
[whirring]

691
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,136
[gasping softly]

692
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,686
[giggling] Surprise.

693
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,979
[giggling]

694
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,898
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

695
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,110
What brings you here?
We weren't expecting you.

696
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,322
I came to check on the operations
of our lab, among other things.

697
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,283
And I have news for you.

698
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,619
The JUNG_E AI is close to being completed.

699
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,707
We are currently verifying
previously unknown neural sectors.

700
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,668
-A final simulation will--
-Yeah, yeah, the combat AI.

701
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,213
HQ has the combat AI data already.

702
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,799
Our head researchers
have made improvements.

703
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,593
[Dr. Yun] Oh…

704
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,595
Of course, sir.

705
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,264
We'll do our best here as well.

706
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,974
[chairman] Seo-hyun.

707
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,603
It's not necessary anymore.

708
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,274
-Sir?
-The age of weapon contracting is over.

709
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,319
It looks like
the Adrian Civil War is coming to an end.

710
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,407
There's a treaty between the Allied Force
and the Adrian Republic.

711
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,994
I remember the old munition companies.

712
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,996
They all did the same thing.

713
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,999
They made heaters
from all their raw materials.

714
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,294
[sighs] We will do now as they did then.

715
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,924
Our research up to this point
wasn't useless.

716
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:52,554
The massive strides in brain replication
allowed us to explore other sectors.

717
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,599
Combat AI?

718
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,894
[chuckles] Won't serve us
on the road ahead.

719
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,106
We need to develop housekeeping
and service worker AIs now.

720
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,067
Tell me…

721
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,695
was Captain Yun experienced
at something other than combat?

722
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,739
Because that would prove useful.

723
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,451
So our time here at the lab…

724
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,370
is coming to an end?

725
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,538
Uh-huh, so use your time wisely.

726
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,545
It's depressing.

727
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,049
I know it all too well.

728
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,011
I used to be obsessed
with brain replication.

729
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,016
[groans] Rich people like me
seem to think about nothing else.

730
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,270
The moment that brain replication
was discovered,

731
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,981
my first thought was…

732
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,318
"Yeah, now I can live forever."

733
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,612
I really thought so.

734
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,657
So my first experiment

735
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,575
was brain replication.

736
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,286
To create a version of me
that was immortal.

737
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,624
It led to my first robot.

738
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,712
Prototype Sang here.

739
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,338
[laughs]

740
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,258
And then it happened.

741
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,427
After the brain replication,

742
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,221
I had to transfer over and couldn't do it.

743
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,181
You know why?

744
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,439
This guy right here. This wire shell.

745
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,649
It didn't feel real.

746
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,194
It's alien.

747
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,282
It just ends up being hollow.

748
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,117
No matter how close we get.

749
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,205
It's like…

750
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,667
having your mom's voice
on an electric rice cooker.

751
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,878
[imitating steam]

752
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,131
"Honey, come get your rice.
I made it just for you."

753
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,888
A robot can't make it like Mom's rice,
I can guarantee you that.

754
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,723
Huh?

755
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,684
It's not funny?

756
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,314
I'm just joking. Joking. [laughs]

757
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,527
Sir, if I may,

758
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,238
allow my mother's project to go on.

759
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,075
-Give us the opportunity to finish--
-There's no need.

760
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,994
The project is already done.

761
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,539
After you wrap it all up,

762
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,543
switch over to household android AIs.

763
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,630
I'll tell Sang-hoon that too.

764
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,132
He'll most likely be a wreck.

765
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,804
He's the type
who won't easily admit to failure.

766
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,723
I know that better than anyone.

767
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,062
Be nice to him, even if he's on edge.

768
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,943
I'm going to dispose of him anyway,
once the project is wrapped up.

769
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,113
I'm going to talk to Sang-hoon all right.

770
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,448
Understand? Hm?

771
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,120
Seo-hyun, give up this obsession.

772
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,874
…always two steps--

773
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,044
Hello, chairman, when did you arrive?

774
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,797
Did my portrait birth you here?

775
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,717
[stifled laughter]

776
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,472
[laughing hysterically]

777
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,767
Sang-hoon,
your sense of humor is the best.

778
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,144
In all of Adrian.

779
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,146
[continues laughing]

780
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,358
-That is all. Goodbye. [laughing]
-Aren't you going to speak to both of us?

781
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,861
Oh, I saw her. That's good enough.

782
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,904
Now, enough joking around.

783
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,158
-Fill me in on JUNG_E.
-Yes, sir. This is our latest prototype…

784
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,494
-Yes, you did well, you did.
-[Sang-hoon mimicking robotic beeping]

785
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,955
[grunting]

786
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,302
[grunting]

787
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,512
-[buzzer sounding]
-[yelling] Why!

788
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,643
How come she always dies in the exact
same place! [shouting hysterically]

789
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,067
During the simulation,
did the brain show any yellow?

790
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,736
[clears throat]

791
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,695
No, sir.

792
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,157
Sorry. It hasn't showed up
since that first time.

793
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,076
After all these tries,
you've failed to isolate the area?

794
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,455
We are limited by the current technology.

795
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,791
It will take a while.
The process is complicated.

796
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,418
Team Leader Yun.

797
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,130
Are you happy with
how the AI is progressing?

798
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,091
[man] Um, Director, uh…

799
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,677
[clears throat] Sir, uh, Kronoid HQ,

800
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,305
they seem satisfied with how the current
combat AI is performing…

801
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,225
Well, I'm not, all right?
[yelling] I'm not satisfied!

802
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,522
Did you know HQ is trying to
haphazardly wrap up our project?

803
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,025
[sighs] They're clearly
disappointed in us,

804
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,236
and now all of you want
to prove them right?

805
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,617
Get it to Termination Advisory.

806
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,204
We will isolate this mysterious area
at any cost.

807
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,540
Ah.

808
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,253
Keep the arms and legs. I want 22 whole.

809
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,588
Yes, sir.

810
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,466
[Sang-hoon muttering] Unbelievable.

811
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,968
[door closes]

812
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,057
Hello, Director.
