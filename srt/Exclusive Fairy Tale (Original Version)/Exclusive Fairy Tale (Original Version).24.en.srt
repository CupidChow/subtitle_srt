00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,350
The meal is ready.

5
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,830
You finally got up.

6
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,150
I don't think you two cook very often.

7
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,190
The pot is too thin.

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,950
The fire is too strong.

9
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,750
The knife is too blunt.

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,150
The seasoning is almost expired.

11
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,080
Nothing useful.

12
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,480
Just make do with it.

13
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,310
You are acting like my mom.

14
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,950
How can you ask a guest to cook?

15
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,800
I didn't ask him to come.

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,789
Well. I wanted to come.

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,750
It's because

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,710
someone brazenly said he would treat me to home-cooked dishes.

19
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,990
But now,

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,070
I bought the ingredients.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,110
I cooked the meal.

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,590
And someone wouldn't get up.

23
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,890
I don't know what he wanted to treat me to.

Sorry. Sorry.

29

You guys eat first.

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,370
I have something to deal with.

It's been so many years.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,630

33
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,950
Still as annoying as before.

But you seem to have improved.

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,870
You seem to have aged.

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,910
No way.

39
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm still handsome.

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,510
I didn't expect you to be a star

41
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,810
considering your previous dance level.

42
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,800
That was all because of you.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,070

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,270

57
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,550
My ideal type is actually very ordinary.

58

But

59
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,350
she was also the first person

60

61

It was for my public persona.

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,550
If I didn't say that,

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,750
wouldn't it seem that I have no stories?

64
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,670
Besides,

66
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,630
An idol can't date anyone.

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,630
Yes.

82
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,550
In terms of relationships,

What's there to compare?

88
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,750
I'll get more endorsements.

89
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,430
I'll endorse whatever you buy.

90
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,550
My posters will be all over the streets.

91
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,390
If you turn on the TV, you'll see my face too.

92
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,380
I'll make you annoyed like that.

93
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,470
Alright.

94
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,190
Honey,

95

can we not buy a TV in our house?

96
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,550
Aren't you ashamed?

97
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,910
Your wife works at a TV station.

98
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,570
And you won't let her watch TV?

99
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,510
So you know

100
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,190
she is my wife.

101
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,750
Enough.

102
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,070

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,030
What's wrong?

108
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,510
I'm on the trending topic.

109
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,750
I was there too.

110
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,610
Why did they remove me?

111
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,770
Am I not worth mentioning?

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,830
They used "seeing a pretty girl" in previous reports.

113
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,960
But in this report, they used "a girl".

114
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,590
Am I nobody?

115
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,270
Hello. Yin Zihan.

116
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,910
We're on the trending topic.

117
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,070
I saw it.

118
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,830
These unscrupulous media.

119
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,550
I'll ask Jiang Juanjuan

120
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,150
to write reports for me from now on.

121
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,420
Wait.

122
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,110
Sister.

123
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,690
Can we not remove the trending topic now?

124
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,790
Is this the girl whose program

125
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,790
you insisted on joining?

126
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,670
I knew there must be a reason

127
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,470
why you suddenly wanted to accept that interview.

128
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,430
It's great to be on the trending topic.

129
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,350
It's good.

130
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,450
I'm saving money for the company.

131
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,010
I think you're just doing this for yourself.

132
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,550
Look.

133
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,270
The photo is good.

134
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,230
So romantic like idol dramas.

135
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,870
I think

136
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,260
a producer will ask me to film soon.

137
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,190
Don't contact him too often in the future.

138
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,120
It's been several years since we last saw each other.

139
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,270
Chatting is not okay either.

140
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,270
Why?

141
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,080
Understand?

142
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,710
What is this?

143
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,630
You still don't understand?

144
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,710
I will make you understand today.

145
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,190
Close your eyes.

146
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,950
Time for Mr. Ling's class.

147
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,620
Should I get up

148
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,220
or keep pretending to sleep?

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,550
Don't go.

150
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,280
Get some more sleep.

151
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,630
Aren't you hungry?

152
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,450
I'm hungry.

153
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,000
But I don't want breakfast.

154
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,270
I want to eat...

155
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,070
Please don't do this.

156
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,510
What?

157
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,750
Well, I...

158
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,470
I'm thinking what to wear today.

159
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,230
I made an appointment with Jiang Juanjuan

160
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,030
to go shopping this afternoon.

161
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,560
No need to think.

162
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,970
You only have one suit of clothes.

163
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,080
It got dirty last night.

164
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,830
You'd better not wear it.

165
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,950
Then how should I go out today?

166
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,630
Then don't go out.

167
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,630
But Jiang Juanjuan...

168
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,440
Someone will take care of Jiang Juanjuan.

169
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,230
As for you,

170
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,000
you have plenty of time to think

171
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,510
about what you want.

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,120
[Nice Bar]

173
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,670
Hi.

174
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,590
I'm here. Sorry, I'm late.

175
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,030
One more chair.

176
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,510
I thought this is a get-together for the girls in our dorm, right?

177
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,750
I don't think he is one of us

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,750
in Room 404.

179
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,070
He has legs.

180
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,390
I can't control him.

181
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,630
You should have told us that you would take your boyfriend here.

182
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,070
We are all alone here.

183
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,830
I'm sorry for not telling you in advance.

184
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,030
It's my treat today.

185
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,510
Consider it a celebration of your graduation.

186
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,790
That's more like it.

187
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,630
Really?

188
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,150
Then add all of these we just ordered.

189
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,830
Okay.

190
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,670

Is it that obvious?

196
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,630
It's all my mom's fault.

197
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,190
She said it was good for health.

198
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,590
I ate a lot of pig's feet these days.

I was forced to be the lead dancer.

202

I didn't have time to eat.

-I'm so jealous.
-She just doesn't gain weight.

206

I didn't expect that after four years in college,

207
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,520
I didn't even make it to the graduation performance.

208

Don't be sad.

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,670

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,430
