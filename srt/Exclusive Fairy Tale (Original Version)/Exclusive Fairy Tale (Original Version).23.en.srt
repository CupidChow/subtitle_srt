If I interview you this time,

Why did you choose to major in journalism?

208

Xiao Tu has a boyfriend, okay?

380
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,500
Her boyfriend must be nobody.

381
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,050
Can you not be so harsh?

382
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,740

Then I'll leave it to you.

407
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,860

413
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,100
Oh my god.

414
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,980
So Xiao Tu's boyfriend is him.

415
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,740
Who?

416
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,380
When we made the episode featuring Ye Jun,

417
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,940
I searched his company.

418
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,820
I have a deep impression of Ling Chao in his team.

419
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,540
He is handsome.

420
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,660
And he has been a straight A student since he was little.

421
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,940
He got many national scholarships

422
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,340
and is a computer genius.

423
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,780
Xiao Tu must have saved the galaxy in her previous life.

424
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,020
Oh my god.

425
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,620
Why were you so exaggerated today?

426
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,480
I think you scared my colleagues.

427
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,580
You mean my suit or the desserts?

428
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,700
So you know.

429
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,890
How did you know Yin Zihan

430
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,460
and I were together filming the program?

431
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,540
Yin Zihan told me.

432
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,630
He bought the desserts.

433
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
I came here after I met the investor.

434
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,460
It was actually credited to him.

435
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,590
That was indeed something he would do.

436
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,620
About your work,

437
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,490
you always talk to me casually.

438
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,060
You didn't tell me when you faced challenges.

439
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,320
It makes me feel

440
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,140
that I'm not a good boyfriend.

441
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,500
They didn't really bully me.

442
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,380
Didn't you tell me

443
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,540
it's normal to encounter difficulties?

444
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,820
So I told myself

445
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,980
these are precious experiences.

446
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,580
They will be useful in the future.

447
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,900
Brave Rabbit.

448
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm not afraid of difficulties.

449
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,980
I'll keep going no matter what.

450
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,990
I regret saying those words to you all of a sudden.

451
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,010
Why?

452
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,640
I think you are more independent.

453
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,610
You are less dependent on me.

454
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,620
Who said that?

455
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,700
You are driving for me, right?

456
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,140
If something like this happens again,

457
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,480
you must tell me first.

458
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,940
I want to help you too.

459
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,330
I know.

460
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,100
Why do I feel like

461
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,740
I'm the heroine in idol dramas?

462
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,340
Alright, get some sleep.

463
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,180
You can have everything in your dream.

464
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm really going to sleep.

465
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,460

467
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,380
OK. Come on.

Slow down. Too fast.

469

You can't take it now?

470
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,300
Didn't you say I was too slow?

471
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,700
I thought you were slow because I was afraid it would be burnt.

472
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
Now you're too fast.

473
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm afraid the oil will burn me.

474

Let me do it.

475
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,580
You said you would teach me, right?

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,500
and drank together.

566
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,900
It's settled then.

567
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,820
Am I right?

568
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,460
Yes.

569
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Look at us.

570
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,580
Wenhui, show him.

571
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,340
Come on.

572
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,620
Xiao.

573
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,500
Ling Chao looks smart.

574
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,700
But he's just a kid when he's in a relationship.

575
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,980
He likes Xiao Tu.

576
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,510
He has no other intentions.

577
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,020
Being in a relationship and getting married

578
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,780
are not the same.

579
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,180
Ling Chao

580
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,700
is smart.

581
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,980
Right?

582
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,460
He's handsome too.

583
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,780
-Right?
-Yes.

584
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,940
He's down-to-earth.

585
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,380
Then is there anything about him that you are still not satisfied with?

586
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,540
Being not dissatisfied means you are satisfied.

587
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
I understand.

588
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,500
You just don't want your daughter to get married.

589
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,660
Ling.

590
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,290
I keep thinking

591
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,700
when Xiao Tu was just born,

592
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,380
she was only this little.

593
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,420
It felt soft and chubby when I held her in my arms.

594
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,180
She was like a piggy.

595
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,140
Now she has grown up.

596
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,540
She's going to get married.

597
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,220
Calm down.

598
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,030
Stop mentioning marrying off and marrying into.

599
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,890
We'll be a family after they get married.

600
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,540
It's our fate.

601
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,660
Right, Xiao?

602
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,980
A family?

603
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,900
A family.

604
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,630
A family speaks with one voice.

605
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,460
Xiao, it's a deal then.

606
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,020
Be nice to my daughter.

607
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,260
Of course.

608
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,580
So much for my father's ambition.

609
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,060
He betrayed me just like that.

610
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,660
It was more of a surrender.

611
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,180
Anyway, we have to

612
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,150
go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

613
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,890
You acted so well just now.

614
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,540
It would be a pity if you didn't become an actor.

615
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,980
Forget it.

616
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,940
If I become an actor,

617
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,060
Yin Zihan will have to change his career.

618
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,100
I should be merciful.

619
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,240
What time is it now?

620
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,390
It's over 11:00 a.m.

621
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,220
Oh no.

622
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,990
I asked Yin Zihan to come here at 11:00 a.m.

623
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,960
I was wondering why he came here so early in the morning.

624
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,180
Don't walk barefoot.

625
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,340
And

626
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,880
get changed before you go out.

627
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:59,190
[Exclusive Epilogue]

628
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,500
Hello? What?

629
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,460
Guess where I am.

630
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,500
On the Earth.

631
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,140
Why are you so perfunctory?

632
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,240
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

633
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,060
What are you busy with?

634
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,660
Is there anything I can help?

635
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,340
I'm busy with an interview.

636
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,140
It's crucial to my career.

637
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,060
That's great.

638
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,040
I just came back to Yunhai.

639
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,900
Interview me.

640
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,380
At your service.

641
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,260
I'll contact you when I finish my work.

642
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,860
Be good.

643
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,380
Hello?

644
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,820
Xiao Tu.

645
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,300
Sister.

646
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,660
Can you write something awesome about me

647
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,220
in tonight's article?

648
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,380
My classmate

649
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,420
just won't believe that I'm already popular.

650
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
I want to show her.

651
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,140
Okay.

652
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,200
I'll make you a trending topic, okay?

653
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,140
Okay.

654
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,620
Thank you.

655
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,010
Be nice to my daughter.

656
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,140
Of course.

657
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,580
Help me deliver my appreciation to my father.

658
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,020
Both fathers.
