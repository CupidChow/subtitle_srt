You just gave your dad the scarf?

390
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,380
Are you sure you are going to Ling Chao's birthday empty-handed?

391
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,930
He doesn't need gifts.

392
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,530
There are birthdays every year.

393
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,860
I'll give him next year.

394
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,780
What did you prepare?

395
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,780
We can't both go to the birthday dinner empty-handed.

396
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,460
Jia Siwen picked a computer book for me.

397
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,420
It's very practical.

Jia Siwen is quite reliable.

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,270
Ling Chao is also reliable.

401
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,020
Didn't he reject Xu Linglong?

402
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,620
He didn't say he liked me.

403
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,180
What if he rejected me too?

404
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,900
How is that possible?

405
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,660
He was so fierce

406
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,980
but turned out to be unreliable.

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,660

No way.

I came empty-handed.

457

our birthday boy is particularly not afraid of cold

460
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,140
that he doesn't need a scarf at all.
