00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,340
You denied you are married

562
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,090
and you said you wouldn't be living together, right?

563
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,820
What?

564
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,180
Now you are acting like you are his wife.

565
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,300
Go get changed.

566
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,980
Go get changed.

567
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,220
Everyone.

568
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,730
After we go into the mountain,

569
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,770
there might be no signal.

570
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,220
You must hold onto the walkie-talkie.

571
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,340
Follow the team closely.

572
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,960
[Buckle up on the bus.]

573
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,420
Don't act alone.

574
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,220
Got it?

575
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,460
Yes.

576
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,860
We're going to stay in the mountain for two days.

577
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,100
There might be no signal.

578
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,520
[Jiang Juanjuan]

579
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,970
Don't worry.

580
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,010
[Jiang Juanjuan]

581
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,730
[Jiang Juanjuan]

582
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,730
[Don't worry.]

583
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,620
Okay. Everyone.

584
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,520
[Buckle up on the bus.]

585
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,780
It will be mountain roads ahead.

586
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,980
We can't drive in.

587
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,460
Pack your things

588
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,660
and get off with me in an orderly manner.

589
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,140
Come and get your stuff.

590
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,660
So cute.

591
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Look at that bear.

592
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,430
What do you want for your birthday?

593
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,000
It shouldn't cost more than ten yuan.

594
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,530
Don't worry.

595
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,220
I don't expect much from you.

596
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm looking forward to Jia Siwen's gift.

597
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,340
After all, this will be the first birthday

598
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,800
since we became official.

599
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,940
Fine.

600
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,030
[Jia Siwen]

601
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,490
[This is the same as the globe you gave me.]

602
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,110
Has your virtual boyfriend replied to your messages?

603
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,130
[Jia Siwen]

604
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,140
No.

605
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,700
It's okay. Let's go.

606
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,620
Shuang.

607
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,570
Check it first.

608
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,540
Sir.

609
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,870
Can I ask to leave the team for an hour?

610
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,580
I came in a hurry.

611
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,340
I didn't have the time to tell my family.

612
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,620
So I want to go up the mountain to look for the signal

613
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,140
to see if I can send a message.

614
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,220
But you can't go out now.

615
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,440
They'll pick us up tomorrow morning.

616
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,580
Okay, thank you.

617
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,620
Do you remember that chemistry teacher?

618
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,880
In junior high school.

619
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,110
Siwen, where are you going?

620
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,100
I'm going up the mountain to look for the signal.

621
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,140
Don't go.

622
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,660
The weather forecast says there will be showers tonight.

623
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,460
It's not safe.

624
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,700
It's okay.

625
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,580
I'll be back soon.

626
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,620
Rest early.

627
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
Be careful.

628
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,930
Master.

629
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,940
Look.

630
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,460
We're going to Shile for internship soon.

631
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,740
Shouldn't we show

632
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,900
team spirit?

633
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,860
Zhu.

634
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,700
Help me remember.

635
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,660
Are the master and his three disciples in Journey to the West

636
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,860
always together

637
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,100
when they eat, sleep, drink, and walk?

638
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,700
Yes.

639
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,460
Monsters come to capture me frequently.

640
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,180
It's normal that I don't live with you.

641
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,940
That's not true, Master.

642
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,180
If you can share your room with me in your apartment,

643
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,060
I would be willing to be taken away by monsters.

644
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,860
Me too.

645
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,660
OK.

646
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,820
I'll find you

647
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,260
a realtor in a few days.

648
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,950
You can rent a house too.

649
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,820
Master.

650
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,580
No need to bother with it.

651
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,720
Think about it.

652
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,620
Madam is busy with her studies.

653
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,860
She can't move in soon.

654
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,010
Why don't you let us live in the new house first

655
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,700
to liven it up?

656
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,940
You're too noisy.

657
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,300
You'll only make me angry.

658
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,180
What about me?

659
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,420
I promise I'll lie in my bed as soon as I get home.

660
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,090
I'll be invisible.

661
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,740
You snore.

662
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,820
You can't live there either.

663
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,020
We don't sleep together.

664
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,550
What's wrong with snoring?

665
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,810
Among you guys,

666
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,300
Sha is the only one I can accept.

667
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,940
He doesn't talk much.

668
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,640
He is quiet.

669
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,540
Master.

670
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,460
It's decided then.

671
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,420
I recorded it.

672
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,940
Good for you, Sha.

673
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,460
You've learned.

674
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,810
Master,

675
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,620
I will pay the rent on time.

676
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,100
Don't act like a good boy.

677
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,760
You're acting like a good boy.

678
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,020
Rabbit.

679
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,880
Is it okay if I wear this today?

680
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,820
Rabbit.

681
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,980
Where did she go the whole day?

682
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,080
[Ms. Jiang Juanjuan, Yunhai Bank wishes you a happy birthday.]

683
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,180
You all disappeared.

684
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,230
Does anyone remember my birthday?

685
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,460
Okay, everyone.

686
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,780
Take your small bags with you.

687
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,040
Come with me to put large bags in that bus.

688
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,260
Come on, give me your large bags.

689
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,940
Put them together.

690
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,780
You didn't find any signal last night

691
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,740
and got wet in the rain.

692
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,820
You've caught a cold.

693
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,020
I have cold medicine.

694
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,860
It's okay. I've taken it.

695
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,740
Really?

696
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,840
Still looking for the signal?

697
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,100
Today is my girlfriend's birthday.

698
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,580
We'll arrive in the town in a few hours.

699
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,980
It doesn't matter if you contact her later, right?

700
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,570
What?

701
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,300
Are you afraid your girlfriend will be angry?

702
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,860
No.

703
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,340
It's just that it's been two days since she last contacted me.

704
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,470
I don't want her to be worried about me.

705
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,700
Fine. You just showed your love to each other.

706
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,820
Forget what I said.

707
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,090
Juanjuan.

708
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,460
Happy birthday.

709
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,340
That's it?

710
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,940
Nothing concrete?

711
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,340
How about treating you to candlelight...

712
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,580
Malatang?

713
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,940
I'm just kidding. I'm not going.

714
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,260
No, you have to go.

715
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,770
-I'm not going.
-Let's go.

716
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,500
-You have to go.
-Malatang.

717
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,900
Go. Hurry. Change your shoes. Hurry.

718
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,860
Come in.

719
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,020
No need to change your shoes.

720
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,580
Here.

721
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,770
No wonder you didn't reply to my messages.

722
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,940
So it was all planned.

723
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,940
I'm giving you a big surprise.

724
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,620
So many dishes.

725
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,980
Tell me

726
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,730
who made all these

727
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,140
delicious dishes.

728
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,300
I

729
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,270
ordered takeaways.

730
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,660
Considering your behavior just now,

731
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,340
I thought you made them.

732
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
What I made is here.

733
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,280
You threw them all.

734
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,660
Coming.

735
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,300
I'm carrying too many things. I can't get my key.

736
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
Long time no see, Xiao Tu.

737
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,580
Hello, Senior...

738
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,540
Hello, Madam.

739
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,710
What's going on?

740
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
I don't know.

741
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,580
Come in first.

742
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,900
Xiao Tu.

743
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,770
Let me explain.

744
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,500
No, I don't want to hear it. Let me explain.

745
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,180
Well.

746
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,540
I left the cake I bought for Jiang Juanjuan at the gate.

747
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,000
It's an ice cream cake. I forgot it. Let's go.

748
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,860
This is my Big Brother.

749
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:17,860
Sun Shibo.

750
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,570
-Hello.
-This is my

751
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,420
junior brother, Guan Jiu.

752
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,180
Your Guan Jiu?

753
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Yes.

754
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,580
We're a team of four.

755
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,700
Ling Chao is not here now.

756
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,580
This is my high school classmate,

757
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,940
Yin Xinlan.

758
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,780
So this is

759
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,300
the pretty girl you've been thinking of?

760
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,620
If I met a beautiful girl like her

761
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,940
in high school,

762
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,300
I wouldn't have been single till now.

763
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,050
[Jia Siwen]

764
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,050
[Why haven't you replied to my messages? Do you know what day it is today?]

765
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
How did you get in touch again?

766
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,900
Tell us about it.

767
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,530
I'll give you a video call every day to let you know I'm safe.

768
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,340
Don't worry.

769
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,980
I won't make you worried anymore.

770
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,290
[Jia Siwen]

771
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,290
[Why haven't you replied to my messages? Do you know what day it is today?]

772
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm looking forward to Jia Siwen's gift.

773
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,310
[Jia Siwen]

774
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,260
After all, this will be the first birthday

775
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,660
since we became official.

776
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,060
My phone will be always on.

777
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,920
You can call me or text me anytime.

778
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,180
You still remember

779
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,140
what day it is in several days, right?

780
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,060
Your birthday. I won't forget.

781
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,520
[Jia Siwen]

782
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,520
[Why haven't you replied to my messages? Do you know what day it is today?]

783
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,940
Let's wish Jiang Juanjuan

784
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,130
a happy birthday, okay?

785
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,380
Happy birthday!

786
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,820
Happy birthday!

787
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,460
In my opinion,

788
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,620
the takeaways Madam ordered are so delicious.

789
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,100
It would be great

790
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,620
if I can eat the takeaways ordered by Madam every day.

791
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,460
-Every day?
-Yes.

792
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
How dare you

793
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,740
say that!

794
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,900
Today, I will beat you

795
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,740
-on behalf of Master.
-Enough.

796
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,180
You don't understand.

797
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,730
Well.

798
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,460
Master.

799
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,660
This is what I mean.

800
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,420
If I can live in the guest bedroom,

801
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,580
I can eat the takeaways

802
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,780
ordered by Madam every day, right?

803
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
It belongs to me. Master promised to let me live here.

804
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,500
You sleep on the floor.

805
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,100
-Turn off the lights.
-I sleep in the bed.

806
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,460
-Okay.
-You wish.

807
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,940
-That's mine. Don't try to compete for it.
-Add a bed.

808
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,980
Line up.

809
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,680
First come, first served.

810
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,020
-Come on.
-I'll be the first. You guys line up.

811
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,090
It's time.

812
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,730
Come on.

813
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,770
Come on. Junior Sister.

815
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,820

Whatever you want.

817
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,420
You're saying like you'd know how to sing them.

818
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,060
Of course.

819
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,700
Show us.

820
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,420
Really?

821
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,620
-Happy birthday to you.
-What is this?

822
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,300

Wait.

828
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,380
How about

829
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,980
calling Jia Siwen?

830
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,420
Ask him to join us remotely.

831
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,860
Good idea.

832
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,110
Senior Brother, can I request a song?

833
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,620
What I sang was not good.

834
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,250
No problem.

835
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,300
Just give me a name. I can sing a lot of songs.

836
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,340
