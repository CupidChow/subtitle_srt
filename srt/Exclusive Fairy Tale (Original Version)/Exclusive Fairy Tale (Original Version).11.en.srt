00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,100
She won't go missing.

191
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,460
Let's go.

192
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,680
[Xianyun Street]

193
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:38,660
[Exit]

194
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,540
He always says he is busy,

195
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,020
so he doesn't have time to take care of my mother and me.

196
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
He also said that he would find a way to make it up to us

197
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,620
and try his best to give us a better life.

198
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,940
People always say that father's love is like a mountain.

199
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,860
Maybe father's love is just so deep.

200
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,060
Who would have thought that

201
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,580
those are all his excuses?

202
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,940
Calm down.

203
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,180
Maybe it's not like what you think.

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,200
You don't have to explain for him.

205
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,700
I only blame myself for being useless.

206
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,950
Due to my bad performance in study,

207
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,420
he and my mother

208
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,780
always quarrel with each other because of me.

209
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,500
It leads to this ending today.

210
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,250
Don't belittle yourself.

211
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,980
This is what you told me before.

212
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,140
But I will never

213
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,300
let this bad woman who has ruined my family

214
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,860
have her way like this.

215
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,340
What?

216
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,600
This is their privacy.

217
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,230
We need to get some evidence for an affair like this, right?

218
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,140
You look very pretty.

219
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,190
Why are you here?

220
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,740
You're doing this so openly.

221
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,540
Yes.

222
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,580
I'll inform Mr. Xue.

223
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Jiang,

224
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,900
though you're not young anymore,

225
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,220
you're still good at

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,700
all these tricks.

227
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,870
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,930
I'm doing this for you.

229
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,900
For me?

230
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,620
You let this woman join your family.

231
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,100
You said it was for me?

232
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,780
How could you talk to your father like that?

233
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,460
I don't have a father like you.

234
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,590
-You... -Mr. Jiang.

235
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,660
Since your daughter doesn't understand,

236
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,620
just forget it.

237
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,060
Bao Bei, wait.

238
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,340
Let me deal with it.

239
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,100
Baby?

240
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,660
How dare you call her baby?

241
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,860
Okay.

242
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,020
Whom are you going to deal with?

243
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,950
How are you going to deal with this?

244
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,020
I finally found someone I like.

245
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,260
You scared her away.

246
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,140
Are you satisfied now?

247
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,180
How shameless!

248
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,580
Are you Mr. Jiang?

249
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,740
I have an appointment with you

250
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,000
to see you here at 6 p.m.

251
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,700
Would you please tell me whether we should continue the interview?

252
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Interview?

253
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,900
Now people have to compete for the position of mistress?

254
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,780
Mistress?

255
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,540
What?

256
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,820
Do you want to say that he cheated you?

257
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,580
Shut up!

258
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,460
Listen to me.

259
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,220
How dare you do such a thing with the excuse of

260
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,300
looking for a tutor?

261
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,760
How dirty and disgusting!

262
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,060
Listen to me!

263
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,060
Listen to me.

264
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,900
Tutor?

265
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Stop right there!

266
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,700
Something like this happened,

267
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,020
because I was negligent in disciplining you.

268
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,250
But you also have to reflect on yourself carefully.

269
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,250
Don't do it again.

270
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,990
You'll be a student in Senior 3 next semester.

271
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,700
I just wanted to hire a tutor

272
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,060
to help you with your study.

273
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,460
But it was in a mess in the end

274
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,320
because of you.

275
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,460
You could have told me about it.

276
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,890
Since you wanted to hire a tutor for me,

277
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,340
why didn't you ask me about my opinion?

278
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,060
I just wanted to hire someone who had strong ability

279
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
and had no common interest with you.

280
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,700
Well,

281
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,540
you and mom...

282
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,340
Both your mom and I

283
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,380
agreed to hire a tutor.

284
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,730
Please enjoy.

285
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you.

286
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,420
Just eat.

287
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,340
Let's go home.

288
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,540
Wait.

289
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,180
Haven't you seen enough?

290
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,340
I want to eat cakes, too.

291
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,860
Where's Yin Zihan?

292
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,760
How come he's missing after we found her?

293
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,180
Hello, Mr. Xue.

294
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,180
Jiang Juanjusn is with her dad.

295
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,100
She's safe.

296
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,260
Don't worry.

297
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,780
Are you a pervert?

298
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,900
If you keep following me, I'll call the police.

299
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,030
You misunderstood.

300
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,580
The general manager of Yiqi Entertainment?

301
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,180
No talent scout

302
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,140
would find artists in the bathroom.

303
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,090
Right.

304
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,380
The meaning is not good.

305
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,010
He stinks before his debut.

306
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,660
If this is a new way of swindle,

307
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,360
should we call the police?

308
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,220
Did you call the police just now?

309
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,340
Yiqi Entertainment.

310
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,220
Its main business includes these four fields of music, brokerage,

311
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,700
films and television programs, and variety shows.

312
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,180
Their general manager looks like this.

313
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,290
[Yiqi Entertainment]

314
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,210
It's him!

315
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,580
But even if it's true,

316
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,060
it has nothing to do with me.

317
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,420
I won't be a trainee.

318
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,380
Why?

319
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,980
Hasn't it been your dream

320
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
to be a dancing singer?

321
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
As you said, it's only a dream.

322
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,910
It's fine for me to only dream of it.

323
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,380
Just give it a try.

324
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,780
You sing so well.

325
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,620
Your dancing

326
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,220
is very unique.

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,660
Maybe you'll be chosen.

328
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
There are

329
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,540
many possibilities in life.

330
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,620
Stop it.

331
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,340
It'll get cold if you don't eat.

332
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,060
Don't eat my cake.

333
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,140
I'm back.

334
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,950
You're back.

335
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
I have something to tell you.

336
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,700
Sit.

337
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,160
The college entrance exam is coming.

338
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,700
I want to know your plans for the future,

339
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,500
and see if there's anything

340
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,060
I can help you with.

341
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,260
I want to study Computer Science at Yunhai University.

342
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,500
Yunhai University?

343
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,500
With your grades, it’s not hard for you to go to Qingbei University.

344
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,020
Why do you want to apply for Yunhai University?

345
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,540
Although Qingbei University ranks the first

346
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,940
in the whole country in terms of comprehensive capacity,

347
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,500
I've checked the introduction of teachers and teaching directions

348
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,760
in Yunhai University.

349
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,550
There's something I'm interested in.

350
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
You've been interested in computers

351
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,460
since childhood.

352
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,900
If you can engage in related professions

353
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,770
and turn your hobby into a career,

354
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,820
this will be a good choice.

355
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,180
Look at that.

356
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,540
What? You don't like it?

357
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,660
No.

358
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,100
Do you think

359
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,060
I want to force you to major in finance

360
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
so that you can inherit the company?

361
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,460
If you want to inherit the company,

362
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,540
it's okay.

363
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,330
I'm just kidding.

364
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,100
I've been working hard outside

365
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,300
for so many years

366
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,700
so that you and your mom

367
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,780
can live a carefree life.

368
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,500
Now, my original dream has come true.

369
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,750
It'll be your turn next.

370
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,040
Study hard.

371
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,940
I will.

372
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,740
Son, can you work harder

373
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,940
and help me with this?

374
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,260
Okay.

375
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
So stupid.

376
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,140
Come on. Have some water.

You can drink mine.

381

Forget it.

382
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,400
I'll buy it for you.

383

How did you know?

387
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,220
Though I'm not good at other things,

388
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,460
I'm indeed quite capable of collecting

389
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,980
and tracking information.

390
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,420
It means I was born to be an entertainment reporter.

391
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,620

the videos I shot

401

Actually, it's not just my parents.

Although I've always wanted to be a dancing singer,

418

I haven't learnt any basic dancing skills.

I'm really nothing.

Let me tell you a secret.

431
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,220
Ling Chao is out of tune when he sings.

432

has changed his career and become an actor.

437
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,740
He was invited to be the leading actor in many idol dramas.

438

His fans are looking forward to it very much.

439

440
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,540
I also don't think he should rush it.

441
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,700
After all, he's quite famous now.

442
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,170
He should cherish his reputation more.

443
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,700
Instead of playing the role of a handsome and domineering boss,

444
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,260
it's better to spend time selecting a better script.
