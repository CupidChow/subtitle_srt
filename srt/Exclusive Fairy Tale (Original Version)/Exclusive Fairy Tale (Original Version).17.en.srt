That's not what I meant.

192
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,260
It's just dating…

193
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,100
You two should have more interactions

194
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,460
in a relationship.

195
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,100
Ms. Jiang is right.

196
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,580
Right?

197
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,180
Right, well…

198
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,300
How can we interact while we're eating?

199
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,740
That's enough.

200
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,700
You can't eat this much.

201
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,780
How about this, Ms. Zhu?

202
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,660
Let's

203
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,820
show them.

204
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,620
Okay, tell me.

205
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
What should I do?

206
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,540
Babe.

207
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,900
Try this.

208
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,580
I like

209
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,300
whatever you give me.

210
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,820
Is it delicious?

211
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,700
Yes.

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,780
Babe.

213
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,460
I can't open this bottle.

214
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,140
Can you open it for me?

215
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,060
Let me do it.

216
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,860
Babe, you're amazing!

217
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,420
You're good at opening the bottle.

218
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,340
I want to hit you.

219
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,540
By the way,

220
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,220
neither of you had a relationship before, right?

221
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,100
Right.

222
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,140
Why should I listen to you two

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,730
teaching me how to date?

224
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,180
Babe, she's mad at me.

225
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,980
Protect me.

226
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,570
You...

227
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,140
What are you doing?

228
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,290
I'll send it to Jia Siwen.

229
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
Well, you...

230
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,220
Sorry, I was wrong.

231
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,860
Hurry up. Delete it.

232
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,580
-Delete it. -I already sent it.

233
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,740
-Delete it. -Just sent it.

234
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,170
Recall it.

235
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,900
Shouldn't we hand in the photography homework?

236
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,500
Let's find a place to take photos tomorrow.

237
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm done.

238
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,540
When?

239
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,820
I took some pictures at the meet-and-greet

240
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,410
a few days ago.

241
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,700
Well…

242
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,140
Just come with me.

243
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,300
I'll buy you milk tea.

244
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,620
Please.

245
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,010
You have a boyfriend now.

246
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,460
Don't let me accompany you for everything.

247
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,940
You should learn to grow up.

248
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,140
You should ask Ling Chao

249
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,500
to take pictures with you.

250
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,180
It's tiresome.

251
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,900
That's not what I meant.

252
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,220
I mean you and Ling Chao

253
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,660
should go out more often

254
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,020
and see the outside world.

255
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,380
Don't always date

256
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,540
in the library or a canteen.

257
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,420
It's boring.

258
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,490
You're young.

259
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,580
You should broaden your horizons.

260
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,740
Broaden.

261
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,340
Look.

262
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,100
Learn how others date.

263
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,490
Look at these high heels.

264
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,500
The skirt. Learn it.

265
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,690
Don't always wear these.

266
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,300
What's wrong with this?

267
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,210
Boy.

268
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,140
New trend.

269
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,020
You got it.

270
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,100
Don't move.

271
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,660
Give me your bag.

272
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,540
It's okay. Let's go.

273
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,780
One, two, three. Cheese.

274
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,860
Let me help you carry it.

275
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,940
It's okay. It's not heavy.

276
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,900
This is not good.

277
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,260
What pictures are these?

278
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,860
Miss.

279
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,860
You must be a photographer.

280
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,100
You look professional.

281
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,020
Could you please

282
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,220
take some photos for us?

283
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,580
Okay.

284
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,490
Okay, okay.

285
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,140
Thank you.

286
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,860
Here, thank you.

287
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,820
Come here.

288
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,700
Let's take a photo together.

289
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,690
She's professional.

290
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,420
Come on.

291
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,770
Two, three.

292
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,220
Cheese.

293
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,980
Okay.

294
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,900
Another pose.

295
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,340
Another pose.

296
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,610
Face the wind.

297
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,980
Cheese.

298
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,700
What do you think?

299
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,020
It looks good.

300
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,660
Let me see.

301
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,460
Let me see.

302
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,580
Nice.

303
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,220
Great.

304
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,820
Thank you.

305
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,500
Thank you.

306
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,540
-Miss. -You're welcome.

307
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,940
Miss.

308
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,300
He's so handsome.

309
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,860
Is he your boyfriend?

310
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,740
What's wrong with your eyes?

311
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,820
If they are a couple,

312
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,660
would the girl carry her own bag?

313
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,340
Of course, I can tell that.

314
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,980
The way he looked at the girl just now

315
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,420
sold himself out.

316
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,340
Madam.

317
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,900
We're here for a visit.

318
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,420
Can you take a photo for us?

319
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,180
Sure.

320
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,090
It's a good background.

321
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,500
I'll take a good picture for you.

322
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,580
One, two, three.

323
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,340
I feel something is missing.

324
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,260
It's okay.

325
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,660
It looks good.

326
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,700
Are you okay?

327
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm fine.

328
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,540
If it's not convenient for you,

329
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,060
you don't have to wear a skirt next time.

330
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay.

331
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,140
I can't open it.

332
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,780
Thank you. Amazing.

333
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,460
That's enough.

334
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,820
It'll be too over if you keep acting.

335
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,220
Ling Chao.

336
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,340
Do you think

337
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,980
we don't look like a couple?

338
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,420
I don't know,

339
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,180
but there's no rules

340
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,740
about what a couple should do.

341
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,500
You're right,

342
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,140
but

343
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,260
the couples in those dramas

344
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,530
are not like us.

345
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,210
Like this.

346
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,300
Or...

347
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,260
How about this?

348
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,340
Or...

349
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,100
What?

350
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,740
It requires a vibe to kiss.

351
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,780
Xiao Tu.

352
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,100
What I like is the real you,

353
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,620
so there's really no need to do anything on purpose.

354
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,140
No matter what others say,

355
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,540
we just need to be ourselves.

356
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,540
I suddenly feel that I'm quite lucky.

357
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,339
My first boyfriend

358
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,020
is such a familiar person

359
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,940
whom I can get along with so naturally.

360
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,770
Your first boyfriend?

361
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,619
How many more boyfriends do you want?

362
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,410
That's not what I meant.

363
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,380
No, I...

364
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,460
What do you mean?

365
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,900
I, I want to say

366
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,300
this is my first time dating.

367
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,860
Maybe we can't be like other couples,

368
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,900
but if I do anything wrong,

369
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,980
just tell me.

370
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,180
Since we're familiar with each other,

371
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,020
there's no need to hide it.

372
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,100
What are you talking about?

373
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,700
I understand.

374
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,290
You mean…

375
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,450
Nice to meet you.

376
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,900
Nice to meet you.

377
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,700
Give me your bag.

378
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,940
Go back and rest early. See you tomorrow.

379
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,830
[Women's Dormitory]

380
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,340
Master.

381
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,020
if you want to find a new tourist spot,

382
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,380
you can ask the local, Sha.

383
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,810
Sha.

384
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,140
He's a living GPS.

385
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,220
He can find a good place.

386
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,260
I recommend

387
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,860
Quantum Design Science Centre.

388
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,580
There are many…

389
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,460
Master is going on a date,

390
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,340
not to study.

391
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,140
Change another one.

392
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,460
I think the provincial library…

393
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,860
The park next to the provincial library is also good.

394
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,820
There are many projects inside.

395
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,500
Master.

396
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,100
Let's just search online.

397
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,290
Let's search it.

398
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:14,900
Wait.

399
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,740
I remember when I was in middle school,

400
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,940
my teacher took me to a forest park.

401
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,980
It takes three hours to take the bus there.

402
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,530
You may need to stay there for one night ahead.

403
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,620
It sounds good.

404
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,100
Master.

405
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,020
Just this one.

406
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,180
Just this one.

407
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,780
Master.

408
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,250
If you only stay for one night,

409
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,060
should you book one room

410
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,100
or two?

411
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,860
Two rooms.

412
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,580
Two rooms?

413
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,220
Didn't you already sleep together the night before the competition...

414
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,940
I see.

415
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,050
Wait for me.

416
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
Master.

417
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,940
Five T.

418
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,620
Not enough.

419
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,700
I have more.

420
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,660
Ridiculous.

421
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,450
What are you going to do during the holidays?

422
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,660
I haven't decided yet.

423
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,980
Then we can go…

424
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,940
Hello.

425
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,730
Xiao Tu, is Jiang Juanjuan beside you?

426
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,420
Yes.

427
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,780
Do you want me to put her on the phone?

428
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,620
No.

429
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,340
I have something to tell you in private.

430
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,060
Is that okay?

431
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
My connection is bad.

432
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,020
Wait a second.

433
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,420
I have to go.

434
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,540
Go ahead.

435
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,020
It's just a date.

436
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,460
Why is she hiding?

437
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,530
The kid has finally grown up.

438
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,050
Hello, the number you have dialed is busy.

439
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,540
Please try again later.

440
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,700
Is he calling another girl?

441
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,540
Weird.

442
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,380
Why should I care about that?

443
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,700
Here.

444
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,580
Eat more.

445
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,580
Let's hang out during the holiday.

446
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,170
Sure.

447
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,540
There's a forest park nearby.

448
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,660
I heard it's good.

449
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,700
No, I have an appointment during the holiday.

450
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,810
Well...

451
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,940
We can go there next time.

452
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,180
Do you have an appointment with Jiang Juanjuan?

453
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,300
No, no.

454
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,260
Then who is it?

455
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,780
I...

456
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,820
I can't tell you yet.

457
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,580
At least I have the right to know whether it's a man or a woman.

458
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,380
A man,

459
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,140
probably.

460
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,180
What do you mean by "probably"?

461
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,210
I can't tell you now.

462
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,140
I have class.

463
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,060
I'm going to class.

464
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,810
A man?

465
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,130
She can't even tell me yet.

466
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,020
Look at the female stars nowadays.

467
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,340
They turn bad after they get rich.

468
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,740
I saw the gossip too.

469
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,980
She dated another young man

470
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,940
even when she had a boyfriend.

471
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,740
Exactly.

472
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,180
Women are unreliable.

473
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,580
Yes.

474
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,020
We'd better stay single.

475
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,770
It's good to be single.

476
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,820
Staying single is safe.

477
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,780
I'll seal my heart with cement.

478
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,380
Cheers.

479
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,060
Jianghu?

480
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,140
Probably not.

481
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
Ye Jun?

482
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
Isn't he on a business trip?

483
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,510
[Ling Chao]

484
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,900
Hello.

485
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,820
Ling Chao.

486
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,780
Yin Zihan.

487
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,300
Are you coming back during the holiday?

488
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,090
I'm busy studying.

489
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,020
I don't have time for vacation.

490
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,780
I don't even have time to eat or sleep.

491
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,180
I don't deserve a vacation.

492
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,060
Fine.

493
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
That's good.

494
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,020
Take care.

495
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,100
Hello?

496
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,260
Hello?

497
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,100
I...

498
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,060
He really took me as a tool

499
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,540
and threw me away after using me?

500
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,060
Why is he still

501
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,460
so ruthless and unreasonable?

502
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,350
[Youwei Canteen]

503
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,860
What's your plan during the May Day holiday?

504
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,540
I'm going to Wenhui's meet-and-greet.

505
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,500
I'll leave tonight.

506
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,020
No, you can't go.

507
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,020
Why?

508
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,140
It's dangerous to go alone.

509
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,700
It's okay.

510
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,140
It's just in the nearby city.

511
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,460
Besides, it's not my first time

512
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,340
fangirling.

513
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,940
Don't worry.

514
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,210
Then you mustn't go.

515
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,530
Think about it.

516
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,540
You've been to Wenhui's meet-and-greet

517
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,730
many times.

518
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,410
As the saying goes,

519
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,490
distance brings beauty.

520
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,660
You need to create a sense of mystery for Wenhui

521
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,260
to make him curious about you.

522
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,860
You have a point,

523
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,620
but I've bought the ticket.

524
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,540
Besides,

525
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,820
Wenhui won't remember who I am.

526
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,780
So you'd better save it

527
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,340
for next time.

528
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,380
Juan.

529
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,900
Actually,

530
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,860
I just want you to accompany me.

531
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,540
Come on.

532
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,540
Ask your boyfriend to accompany you.

533
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,220
At this point,

534
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,460
I can only tell you the truth.

535
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
Actually,

536
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,770
there are some problems

537
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,020
in my relationship with Ling Chao

538
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,220
Maybe

539
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,140
it's what people call

540
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,260
the burnout phase in a relationship.

541
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,620
How long have you been dating

542
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
and you're already entering the burnout phase?

543
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,780
Isn't it too early?

544
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,180
I don't know.

545
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,060
Maybe

546
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,140
we've known each other for too long,

547
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,010
so he has lost

548
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,980
his curiosity about me.

549
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,580
Anyway,

550
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,060
I'm not interested in doing anything recently.

551
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,580
Life is boring.

552
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,500
If you could accompany me,

553
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,580
I would feel better.

554
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,770
Okay.

555
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,980
I'll return the ticket.

556
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
I'll stay with you.

557
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,900
Great.

558
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,460
Will it affect you

559
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,140
deepening your relationship with Wenhui?

560
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,420
It's okay.

561
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,100
Wenhui will understand.

562
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,020
After all,

563
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
friends are the most important.

564
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,180
Buy me a cup of milk tea.

565
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,890
Okay.

566
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,260
Hello, what would you like to order?

567
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,380
A cup of milk tea.

568
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,780
One red bean double skin milk

569
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,620
and two ice cream cones.

570
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,060
Okay.

571
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,660
What about you?

572
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,060
You don't look like

573
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,740
upset at all.

574
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,980
It's because you're with me.

575
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,940
That's too greasy.

576
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,940
I want a cup of milk tea without sugar.

577
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,500
Okay.

578
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,100
Thank you.

579
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,100
Fine.

580
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,220
Men are all bad.

581
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,460
Ling.

582
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,580
What are you doing here?

583
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,770
Didn't we agree to go to the library?

584
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,820
I don't want to go.

585
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,980
Let's go eat first.

586
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,740
I'm not hungry yet.

587
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,060
Shall we go for a walk?

588
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,260
No.

589
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,220
It's boring.

590
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,500
What happened?

591
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,380
Master.

592
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,940
I heard you and your girlfriend are getting into the burnout phase in a relationship.

593
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,340
See you at the sports field at 6 p.m.

594
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,180
I have something important to tell you.

595
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,660
Ling Chao.

596
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,060
I think it's a mistake for us to be together.

597
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,180
I'm really

598
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,420
not interested in you.

599
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,980
Holding your hand is like holding my own hand.

600
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,380
Let's break up.

601
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,420
[Seven-year Itch]

602
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,260
Hurry up.

603
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,060
What's wrong?

604
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,340
I saw Ling Chao

605
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,780
walking with another girl on Wutong Avenue.

606
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,580
What?

607
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,250
How could he do that?

608
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,900
Wait. I'll help you teach him a lesson.

609
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,820
Okay.

610
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,780
Scum.

611
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,860
You want to change your taste

612
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,460
after getting tired of dating a short girl?

613
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,220
Men really like women with long legs.

614
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,340
Today, I'll let others see

615
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,300
what kind of shameless cheaters you are.

616
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,340
Shameless cheaters!

617
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,220
Shameless cheaters!

618
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,500
-Shameless cheaters! -Jia Siwen?

619
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,540
-Shameless cheaters. -Turn it off.

620
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
-How can I Turn it off? -Shameless cheaters.

621
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,420
-Well… -Shameless cheaters.

622
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,450
-Well… -Shameless cheaters.

623
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:02,980
Shameless cheaters.

624
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,660
Well…

625
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
All right.

626
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,100
What is this?

627
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,180
Well…

628
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,540
Fine.

629
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,660
Jia Siwen, tell me.

630
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,820
Is he trying to confess to me?

631
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,860
Jiang Juanjuan.

632
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,300
What's going on?

633
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,340
He's going to confess his love.

634
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,980
Tonight…

635
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,460
There's going to be a once-in-a-century meteor shower tonight.

636
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,780
We may not be able to observe it

637
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,700
for various reasons

638
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,810
like the weather, visibility and the phase of the moon.

639
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,860
But it's about to happen

640
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,820
in this time and space.

641
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,340
Even when we can't see each other,

642
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,620
he still loves me deeply.

643
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,780
It's 18:12 now.

644
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,220
Even if it's still daytime in UTC-5

645
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,660
and it's winter in the southern hemisphere,

646
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,780
this minute

647
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
is the best summer dusk for me.

648
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,220
Is he trying to say

649
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,900
no matter what the world is like,

650
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,220
he only cares about me?

651
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
Actually,

652
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,580
I didn't think about what I'm going to say before I came here.

653
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I just want to talk about meteors

654
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,940
and sunset

655
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
at this special time.

656
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,300
What is he talking about?

657
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,020
I don't know.

658
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,380
But…

659
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,020
It's not only about meteors,

660
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,060
but also…

661
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,260
I like you too.

662
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,700
That's it.

663
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,340
This must be your first time coming to our campus, isn't it?

664
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,340
Let me show you around.

665
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:46,940
Okay.

666
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,770
I also want to walk on the road you usually walk on.

667
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,900
This is the romance and sense of ritual Jiang Juanjuan mentioned.

668
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,180
Jia Siwen.

669
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,820
When did you fall in love with me?

670
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,980
Be careful.

671
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,740
I...

672
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,660
Do you remember

673
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,460
the globe I gave you in high school?

674
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,020
Yes.

675
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,260
You said

676
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,140
the Earth is round

677
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,300
and people will meet,

678
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,260
so the long distance between us is not a problem,

679
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,020
right?

680
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,260
You can understand it this way.

681
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,580
But actually,

682
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,380
I engraved something under the globe.

683
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,740
Engraved something?

684
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
You've liked me since then?

685
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,580
Let me get the flowers.

686
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,180
I'll give it to you when you get to the dorm.

687
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,020
Okay.

688
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,980
Take it with another hand,

689
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,100
so I can hold your hand.

690
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,090
Why is their love happening

691
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,940
at the burnout phase in our relationship?

692
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,500
I promised Jia Siwen not to tell anyone.

693
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,740
Anyone?

694
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,100
Am I included?

695
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,860
I'm your boyfriend.

696
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,580
A boyfriend is also a human.

697
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,100
Don't look down on yourself.

698
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,620
What are you talking about?

699
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,050

Make it clear.

710
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,380
You'll make people misunderstanding.

711
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,780

00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,540
You two are quite romantic.

715

I won't disturb your date then.

We are just taking a walk together.

718
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,220
She said it was only for a walk.

719
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,060
Let me say something.

720
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,980

Okay, I've got to run.

725
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,740
Why didn't you admit

726

our relationship?

727
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,980
I haven't get ready for it.

728
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,970
I think you just don’t want to make it public

729
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,050
so you can date someone else secretly.

730
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,220
It's not like that.

731
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
You know my mom.

732
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,060
If my mom knew we are together,

733
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,140
she would urge us to get married immediately.

734
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,940
By then, we'll have only two options.

735
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,300
A, get engaged immediately.

736
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,780
B, get nagged by her.

737
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,810
You're right.

738
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,500
That’s why

739
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,820
I will tell her

740
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,500
at good timing. Don't worry.

741
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
I'll be responsible for you.

742
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,180
Come to think of it,

743
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,140
if my parents know

744
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,460
we are together,

745
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,780
I will be interrogated.

If we don't end up well,

747
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,260
I'll lose a lot.

748
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,660
It's scary just thinking about it.

749
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,730
Great, Ling Chao.

750
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,700
I think you're the one with ulterior motives.

You started it first.
