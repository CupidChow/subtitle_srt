What a boring question.

119
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,460
Well.

120
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,860

when I kept following you and Ling Chao.

140
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,180
I know.

141
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,540
It was the car following us.

142
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,820
Don't be shy.

143
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,940

What a coincidence.

146
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,700
I was about to visit you.

147
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740

What do you want?

150
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,620
Well, you...

151
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,020
You misunderstood. I...

152
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,420
I was just passing by today. I...

153
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,260
Is it fun?

154
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,150
Don’t disturb our life.

155
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,210
Chao, I...

156
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,540
I wanted to investigate something before.

157
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,460
But it doesn't matter now.

158
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,860
I will try my best

159
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,580
to get what I want.

160

to be friends with you.

163
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,060
Me too.

164
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,600

165

I want to sing a love song.

167
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,420
From now on,

168
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,620
don't dance too much.

169
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,060
How is that possible?

170
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
I dance so well.

171
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,500
Honey.

172
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,610
Ling Chao,

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,940
Juan's house is too far away.

174
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,170
It's getting dark.

175
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,380
Send her home.

176
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,790
Who will send me back after?

177
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,730
No need.

178
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,580
We are on the same way.

179
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,679
I can send her home.

180
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,820
What's wrong with him?

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,549
I don't know.

182
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,540
Maybe he was upset because we pulled out his leg hair just now.

183
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,490
Definitely.

184
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,260
You pulled the most out just now.

185
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,100
I...

186
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,740
He's unhappy about that.

187
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,660
Bye.

188
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,330
Bye.

189
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,370
Bye.

190
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,260
Yin Zihan, come often.

191
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,770
Why don't you ask Jiang Juanjuan to come often?

192
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,700
She came uninvited.

193
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Do I need to say anything?

194
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,590
You too. Come often.

195
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,470
I'm leaving.

196
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,710
You went out to play?

197
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,350
I went to Xiao Tu’s home.

198
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,380
Well,

199
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,180
how are you recently?

200
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,380
I'm fine.

201
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,600
What about you?

202
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
I'm fine. Everything is fine.

203
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,980
Go upstairs.

204
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,220
Your mom is cooking.

205
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,860
Okay.

206
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,740
Zheng.

207
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,380
You don't have to come in. I'll be out soon.

208
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Yes, we'll go straight to the venue.

209
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,500
Hurry up if you didn't hand in the form.

210
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,760
I have to hand it over to the teacher soon.

211
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
Help me check

212
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,140
whether Zhang Danian chose liberal arts or science.

213
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,300
Does it affect you?

214
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,660
Of course.

215
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,860
Except him,

216
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,500
who else can compete with me?

217
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,260
You're humiliating Zhang Danian.

218
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,570
Let me see.

219
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,460
Let me...

220
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,480
What are you doing?

221
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,070
[Academic Garden]

222
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,580
Juan,

223
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,260
help me take him down.

224
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,670
Consort Rabbit and Consort Jia,

225
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,030
[Academic Garden]

226
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,620
both of you are my favorite.

227
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,340
Thirty.

228
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,540
My family.

229
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,940
Are you going to choose science?

230
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,540
Yes.

231
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,540
After all, two tigers cannot share the same mountain.

232
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,900
-If the two of us were in the same class,
-Come closer.

233
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,140
it would only result in both of us being worse off.

234
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,540
Listen.

235
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,900
Everyone in the class is saying that...

236
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,700
-I'll miss you.
-Yin Zihan and Xiao Tu

237
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
-You can eat whatever you want,
-are not just friends.

238
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,900
but don't talk nonsense.

239
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,140
I'm afraid Yin Zihan would hit me.

240
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,060
What does it have to do with him?

241
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,940
I think Yin Zihan is a little weird.

242
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,580
But I'm not sure.

243
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,730
Jiang Juanjuan.

244
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,660
Was it you who spread rumors?

245
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,860
No.

246
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,780
I didn't.

247
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,420
It's true.

248
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,140
Mr. Xue, our class's subject division forms.

249
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,700
Okay.

250
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
I’m leaving.

251
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,740
Go ahead.

252
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,500
Jia Siwen.

253
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,650
[The diligent gardener; the noble teacher's grace]

254
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,940
After the/our class is divided,

255
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
I will still be

256
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,500
the head teacher of Class 4.

257
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,860
I’m glad that you chose liberal arts.

258
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,770
In this way, we can spend

259
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,570
two extra happy years together.

260
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,960
But have you discussed with your parents

261
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,230
about which subject you would choose?

262
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,300
The college entrance exam is the first obstacle in life.

263
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,660
If you get over it, you will be smooth sailing.

264
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,770
But before you start,

265
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,220
you must think carefully

266
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,180
whether to go left or right.

267
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
Based on your conditions,

268
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,100
I suggest

269
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,500
you should go back and think twice about it.

270
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,500
Although it's your life,

271
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,230
this is an important decision.

272
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,260
I think you should

273
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,920
discuss it with your parents.

274
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,980
How about this?

275
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,610
I'll give you one more day.

276
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,120
Go back and think about it.

277
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,670
Okay, I got it.

278
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,980
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

279
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,910
You're welcome.

280
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,980
Jia Siwen.

281
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,580
You didn't choose liberal arts

282
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,020
because

283
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,350
you can't bear to leave me, did you?

284
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,340
[Please turn off the lights when not in use and save every unit of electricity]

285
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,300
What a charm.

286
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,520
What are you doing?

287
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,300
Why are you hiding there silently?

288
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,140
You scared me.

289
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,020
I made a sound and you were still scared?

290
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,080
What are you doing?

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,180
My house is too dangerous lately.

292
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm here to find a safe home for my idols.

293
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,680
Keep it a secret for me.

294
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,220
What are you doing here?

295
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,900
You chose liberal arts.

296
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,220
But Xue didn't allow it, right?

297
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,420
Mr. Xue asked me to think twice about it.

298
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,180
If I were Xue, I would also ask you to think twice about it.

299
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,060
After all, you have good grades.

300
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,390
You'll have more advantage in the college entrance exam if you study science.

301
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
But I'm not Xue.

302
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,380
I’m your deskmate.

303
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,780
You like liberal arts so much.

304
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,900
You buy Geography World every week.

305
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,900
If you study science,

306
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,740
you would be so depressed.

307
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,580
You just said...

308
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,340
It's not like only studying science

309
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,060
can lead to getting into good universities.

310
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,660
You are just indecisive because you have too many choices.

311
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,620
For me,

312
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,100
I don't even have a chance to choose

313
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,020
since my science grades are so poor.

314
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,340
With such good qualifications,

315
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,460
of course you can choose the one you like.

316
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,210
What if I choose the wrong one?

317
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,340
Before you choose,

318
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,000
how do you know you were wrong?

319
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,380
Besides,

320
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,420
there are so few female students in science and engineering universities.

321
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,650
How can you compete with others

322
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,740
if you're such a passive guy?

323
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,400
By then, you won't even have a girlfriend...

324
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Did I hurt him?

325
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,770
[Please turn off the lights when not in use and save every unit of electricity]

326
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,660
Mr. Xue.

327
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,460
Mr. Xue, I've figured it out.

328
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,740
I like liberal arts.

329
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,820
I'll choose liberal arts.

330
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,780
-Well...
-Mr. Xue, don't worry.

331
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,500
My parents will agree to my choice.

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,380
-I...
-Mr. Xue.

333
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,410
Goodbye.

334
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,580
Is he so happy to be my student?

335
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,370
[Early Summer]

336
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,300
Look at the time. Why are you still sleeping?

337
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,340
Get up.

338
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,340
Let me sleep for five more minutes.

339
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,980
More?

340
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,700
Hurry up and do your homework.

341
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,580
Going to school is so tough.

342
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,100
It's the weekend. Just let her sleep.

343
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,540
Don't bother her.

344
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,500
Mr. Xiao.

345
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,760
She's here for you.

346
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,820
Mrs. Xu.

347
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,620
Mrs. Xiao.

348
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,700
What makes you so happy?

349
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,980
Come in and sit down.

350
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,980
No, thanks.

351
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,620
I have to go somewhere else.

352
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,740
It’s not a big deal.

353
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,340
My Linglong

354
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,670
took part in a national dance competition

355
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,080
and won the gold award.

356
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,820
That's a great thing.

357
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,890
These are the celebration sweets.

358
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,780
Thank you.

359
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,460
I heard that many great directors

360
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,820
are watching this competition.

361
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,140
If some director discovers her,

362
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,780
maybe she can be a star.

363
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,940
Your Linglong

364
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,020
has a celebrity face since childhood.

365
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,100
You're lucky.

366
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,700
Congratulations, Mom of a Star.

367
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,260
I'm just saying.

368
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,020
I don't expect her to be a superstar.

369
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
But after winning this award,

370
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,740
she has a fifty percent chance of getting into

371
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,340
the Dance Department at Yunhai University.

372
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,099
She can get special recruitment for colleges/universities?

373
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,260
Of course.

374
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,859
We can't help it.

375
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,900
The kid has to go to college anyway.

376
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,380
I couldn't make Linglong

377
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,700
be born intelligent.

378
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,619
I can only go other ways.

379
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,940
You can also inquire for Xiao Tu.

380
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,819

759
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,500
Wenhui!

760
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,860
Why won't you go to kindergarten?

761
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,580
Dad used to take me to kindergarten.

762
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,180
Don't be afraid. I'll hold your hand.

763
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,010
Mom told us to hold hands.

764
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,460
Don't cry.

765
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,340
Is it good?

766
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,739
Yes.
