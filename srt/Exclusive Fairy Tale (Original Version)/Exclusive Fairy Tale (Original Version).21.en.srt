00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,140
When you were together, you emotionally abused her and disappeared.

377
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,770
You've broken up. Now you start to care about your ex-girlfriend?

378
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,030
This is not necessary.

379
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,580
I didn't ignore her intentionally back then.

380
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,500
Actually...

381
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,500
Why can't I log into

382
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,900
Exclusive Fairy Tale on my new phone?

383
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,960
I can only register another account.

384
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,580
It must have been untied by the other party.

385
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,620
But my previous phone shows it's not untied.

386
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,460
The records are still there.

387
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,780
I can continue to write diaries.

388
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,820
Although

389
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
she won't read the diaries anymore.

390
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,180
This should be a bug.

391
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,839
I'll fix it for you after I go back.

392
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,940
Well.

393
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,700
Can you

394
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,380
not fix it now?

395
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,619
Thanks to this bug,

396
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I can continue

397
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,460
to write diaries every day.

398
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,980
What's the use of writing alone?

399
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Like you said,

400
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,220
she won't read them anymore.

401
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
I went to your university several times to see her.

402
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,800
She just didn't want to see me.

403
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
Later,

404
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,900
I thought

405
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,140
even if she could forgive me,

406
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,340
what's the use?

407
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,630
I can't even give her the basic sense of security.

408
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,660
So I thought

409
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,700
maybe I should

410
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,620
let her go.

411
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

412
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,770
I've been cursing you for her for over a year.

413
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,770
That was basically the first thing I did when I woke up.

414
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,380
It's fine.

415
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,060
No matter what the reason is,

416
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,500
I broke her heart.

417
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,540
Since you still like each other,

418
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
don't give up so easily.

419
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,460
Are you going to miss each other like this?

420
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,940
It's too late.

421
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,910
She must be disappointed in me.

422
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
Let me ask you.

423
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,620
What's the biggest obstacle in a long-distance relationship?

424
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,290
You.

425
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,940
Answer me.

426
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,060
The lack

427
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,020
of the sense of security?

428
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,500
You.

429
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,090
How should I know?

430
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
I've never been in a long-distance relationship.

431
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,500
The sense of security doesn't matter.

432
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,820
What you need is communication.

433
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,980
Between you and Jiang Juanjuan,

434
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,780
one was afraid that the other would be unhappy,

435
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,780
and one was afraid that the other would be disappointed.

436
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,010
Actually, you both got it wrong.

437
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,660
I hope you have a new relationship soon.

438
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,580
Never have a long-distance relationship again.

439
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,900
So insecure.

440
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,900
Actually, I think

441
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,540
the lack of the sense of security,

442
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
immaturity, and being unreasonable

443
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,900
are nothing.

444
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,660
In fact,

445
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,540
the most serious thing is

446
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,580
if I understand and care about him too much,

447
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,460
I'll lose balance in mentality.

448
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,300
I felt very uncomfortable,

449
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,060
but I had to put up with it.

450
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,660
And I would make a fuss about who cares more.

451
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,690
Sometimes I was wondering

452
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,180
if Jia Siwen took my understanding

453
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,900
for granted.

454
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,700
Then you should have told him.

455
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,620
I was afraid that if I told him, he would think I'm immature

456
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,660
and petty.

457
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,780
Besides, this kind of thing can't simply be explained

458
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,500
on the phone.

459
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,810
What if we got impulsive

460
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,780
and we quarreled and broke up?

461
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,900
Then it's better you tell him.

462
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,780
It's better to let him know what you think

463
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
than breaking up unclearly, right?

464
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,260
I think

465
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,820
he should understand.

466
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,100
Every time he finished his work,

467
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,420
he would try his best to make me happy.

468
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,060
And I would generously say it's okay.

469
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
And then

470
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,590
there would be more apologies between us.

471
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,300
One day, I suddenly realized

472
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,540
if I keep putting up with him,

473
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,700
there must be something wrong with our relationship.

474
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,940
Instead of this,

475
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,420
we'd better live separately.

476
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,540
Are you crying?

477
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,330
But it's been two years.

478
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,550
Will it be too late to pursue her again?

479
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,100
You have to be brave and take the initiative.

480
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
No matter what,

481
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,330
you have to fight for a chance.

482
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,260
How would you know if you don't try?

483
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,140
What if I choose the wrong one?

484
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,260
You haven't chosen yet.

485
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,900
How do you know you are wrong?

486
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,860
I know what to do.

487
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
You will help me.

488
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,340
Right?

489
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,500
Thank you, Xiao Tu.

490
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,010
You're leaving? Let me walk you out.

491
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,420
Bye.

492
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,050
Bye.

493
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,420
What do you mean by "all men are bad"?

494
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,220
Did I say that?

495
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,060
I said it because I was angry.

496
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,720
I was talking about Jia Siwen.

497
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,340
When did you

498
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,750
become a relationship expert?

499
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm not really an expert.

500
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,260
Truth is derived from practice.

501
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,290
You are very experienced?

502
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,440
I don't believe it.

503
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,020
I'm going to the toilet.

504
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,330
Why is he here?

505
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,570
I... I forgot.

506
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,060
He has been here the whole time.

507
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,180
Wait.

508
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,700
Why should I come in?

509
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,130
It's so late.

510
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,580
The dorm is closed.

511
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,010
You can't go back.

512
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,860
Of course you should sleep here.

513
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,580
But you only have one bed.

514
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,940
I can't let you sleep on the floor.

515
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,280
Who said I will sleep on the floor?

516
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,420
You want me to sleep on the floor?

517
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
Can't we

518
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,700
both sleep on the bed?

519
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,900
This bed is so small.

520
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,760
It's not big enough for us to sleep together, right?

521
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,660
The bed is indeed a little small.

522
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,980
I'll buy a bigger one some other day.

523
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,180
Make do with it today.

524
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,740
No.

525
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,900
I have poor sleeping habits.

526
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,420
I would roll around.

527
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,060
I know.

528
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,580
Don't worry.

529
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,100
I have good sleeping habits.

530
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,300
Just ignore me.

531
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,460
Come on.

532
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,980
Why are you so nervous?

533
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,180
I'm... I'm not nervous.

534
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,540
I just like this side.

535
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
What?

536
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,860
What can I do?

537
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,980
I only have one quilt.

538
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,380
Do you want to freeze me to death

539
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,380
so that you can find a new boyfriend?

540
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,040
Do you want to suffocate yourself

541
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,340
to let me die alone?

542
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,060
Come on.

543
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,170
What?

544
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,300
Aren't you...

545
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,710
Don't worry.

546
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,700
What I want is our future,

547
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,340
not now.

548
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,580
Sleep.

549
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,700
Have you

550
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,470
not completely recovered?

551
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,820
What?

552
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,700
I mean...

553
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,700
that.

554
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,830
You're back.

555
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,780
Yes.

556
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,860
Ling Chao, sit here and rest.

557
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,940
Be careful.

558
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,300
I'd better stand.

559
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,580
Okay.

560
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,940
Xiao Tu.

561
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,660
Yes.

562
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,700
Come out.

563
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,060
