This is my head.

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,620
Hello?

5
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,700
What?

You're awake.

9
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,130
Be careful. Don't get up.

10
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,220
What happened to my leg?

11
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,180
What happened?

12
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,460
Calm down.

13

Calm down.

-Xu Linglong, right?
-Calm down.

15
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,740
Don't move.

I can't feel my leg.

Don't worry.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,620
It's just an ankle fracture.

20
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,700
And a minor concussion.

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,140
A fracture?

22
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,500
No. I need to dance.

It's okay. We still have time.

-Take your time.
-Miss.

25

You can't even walk.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,380
Don't think about dancing.

27
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,580
Take a rest for two or three months

28

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,580
you must take a good rest.

35

It will be a serious problem if you can't fully recover.

36
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,040
I heard you fell from a high place.

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,690
Any other discomfort?

38
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,950
Like your limbs, joints, and your chest?

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,500
Doctor.

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,020
I suddenly feel

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,880
chest distress. And I'm short of breath.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,340
My heart is beating faster.

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,270
This is the psychological effect.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,060
How about this?

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,180
Take a rest for several days.

46
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,740
If you still don't feel well, do an overall physical examination.

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Call me if anything happens.

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,140
Okay, thank you. Doctor.

No.

Hurry back and practice.

How can you practice like this?

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,060
I'm asking you to hurry back and practice.

The teacher will have to choose a new lead dancer.

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,020
I'm okay with you being the lead dancer.

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,980
I can't accept others to be the lead dancer.

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,300
But if I go,

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,340
who will take care of you?

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,220
I will.

60
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,700
What?

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,370
After I received your call,

62
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,980
I came here without eating.

63
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,620
You didn't eat.

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,980
You think I ate?

65
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,620
Do you know how to take care of a patient?

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,340
You don't even know what food you should buy.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,780
Don't push your luck.

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,290
Do you think

69
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,290
I called you here because I like you?

70
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,140
My cousin is on a business trip.

71
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,400
Xia Mo has a rehearsal.

Jiang Juanjuan went to Beijing.

73
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,100
I have no choice. That's why I called you.

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,460
So you know you have no choice.

75
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,640
Look at your attitude towards me.

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,060
Don't worry.

77
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
I won't starve you.

78
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,450
Ling Chao went to buy food.

79
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,510
He'll be here soon.

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,220
Do you have any cosmetics in your bag?

81
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,820
A lipstick will do. Hurry up.

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,579
If I knew Ling Chao would come,

83
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,380
I should have put on full makeup.

84
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,260
Do you

85
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,700
really like Ling Chao that much?

86
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,780
He is so amazing.

87
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,340
It's hard not to like him.

88
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,500
Don't forget

89
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Ling Chao and I grew up together too.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,779
But after I started to date Ling Chao,

91
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,750
I don't think you hate me that much.

92
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,860
Who said that?

93
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,900
I hate you so much.

94
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,040
I don't know what's so good about you.

95
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,220
Ling Chao has only been willing to play with you since we were kids.

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,420
Getting closer to him is more difficult for me than winning a dance competition,

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,180
even just a little bit.

98
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,500
Then why do you still like him?

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,630
Are you a masochist?

100
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,060
I thought about this a long time ago.

101
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,540
Why did I fall into a fantasy

102
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,700
and keep doing things that will touch only myself?

103
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,580
Then I realized that

104
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,700
what I like

105
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,540
is just the feeling of liking him.

106
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
Actually, I realized the reality long ago.

107
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,340
But I wouldn't admit it.

108
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
I think if I admit I don't like him,

109
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,180
I would betray my past

110
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,260
and my persistence for so many years.

111
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,300
If one day,

112
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,910
you really get married,

113
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,580
I will still give you my sincere wishes.

114
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,460
But don't think about the money.

115
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,659
Without Ling Chao,

116
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,730
we would've become good friends who keep no secrets from each other, right?

117
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,900
Who said that?

118
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,900
I don't want to be friends

119
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,030
with simple-minded people with well-developed limbs.

120
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,900
Your limbs are quite simple,

121
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,300
but you're not smart.

122
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,500
Ling Chao.

123
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,900
You're here.

124
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,840
You must be hungry.

125
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,100
I bought some dishes with a light flavor.

126
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,430
I also bought bone soup.

127
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,460
Thank you.

128
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,950
Go prepare the food.

129
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,020
Ling Chao.

130
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,020
Can you carry me to the bathroom?

131
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,800
I need to wash my hands before eating.

132
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,820
I'm strong. Let me carry you.

133
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,620
No, my leg.

134
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,370
-Come on.
-Ling Chao, help!

135
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,030
You are so heavy.

136
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,380
Should we keep walking?

137
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,810
You need to accompany her, right?

138
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,140
Let's walk a little longer.

139
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,580
It's been a while since I took a walk with you.

140
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,980
You're going on another business trip tomorrow.

141
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,240
Just tell me if you don't want to leave me.

142
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,140
Then walk me back to the hospital.

143
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,460
And I'll walk you out.

144
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,180
I suddenly have this feeling.

145
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,540
Do you think

146
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,700
other people think it's easy for us

147
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,580
to be together?

148
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,409
Yes.

149
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,580
Having a relationship is different from what's in TV series.

150
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,470
Many things that can be explained clearly

151
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,760
eventually became misunderstandings.

152
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,340
Because

153
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,850
not all couples are like us.

154
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,860
We've been accumulating our love

155
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,220
since childhood.

156
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,660
You're right.

157
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,510
Because we both have given each other the sense of security.

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,020
Ling Chao,

159
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,100
how did you successfully pursue Xiao Tu?

160
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,900
Can you teach me?

161
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,020
You're asking the right person.

162
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,540
First,

163
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,700
you need to

164
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,659
come up with a perfect plan.

165
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,670
If you want to pursue a girl,

166
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,100
you have to start from

167
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,560
what she's interested in.

168
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,910
From what I know about Jiang Juanjuan,

169
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,580
giving her flowers is the right thing to do.

170
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,940
You put it in this basket.

171
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,940
The situation of you and Jiang Juanjuan is different.

172
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,270
You two have a relationship to start with.

173
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,860
So it's not enough

174
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,140
to just give her what she likes.

175
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,470
You need to create a feeling of freshness.

176
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
It's too simple.

177
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,350
It's done just by shuffling the cards, right?

178
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,060
Lastly,

179
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,900
and most importantly,

180
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,500
you need to write codes.

181
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,700
Write codes?

182
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,059
It's indeed difficult for you.

183
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,260
You can do something else

184
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,700
to show your personal charm.

185
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,340
Come on.

186
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,380
Thank you.

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,260
I've sent the first draft of the interview to your email.

190
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,500
I'd like to ask for your advice.

191
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,780
Please let me know

192
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
if there is anything that needs to be improved.

193
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,460
No.

194
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,020
Well.

195
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,220
I still want to ask you a few questions about this interview.

196
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,350
It's not necessary.

197
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,380
Your interview won't be used.

198
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,500
It's just the first draft.

199
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,380
I can modify it if it needs improvement.

200
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,460
You chose someone with no fame

201
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,620
to be your interviewee.

202
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,150
It will only lower the quality of our program.

203
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,980
I watched every episode

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,060
of the program.

It started with small potatoes.

206
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,340
According to the audience rating,

207
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,300
those touching little stories can better move the audience.

208
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,060
You also said it was in the past.

209
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,460
Are you going to reason with me

210
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,190
with outdated data and things?

211
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,020
That's not what I meant.

212
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,500
What I want to say is

213
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,020
maybe it's more touching

214
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,140
if we focus on the authenticity sometimes.

215
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,220
Am I the leader or are you the leader?

216
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,580

I'm the person in charge of this program.

218
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,910
You have to listen to me.

219
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,820
Stay if you can do your job.

220
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,880
Leave if you can't.

Hello, Jia Siwen.

222
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,380
Have you eaten?

223
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,470
You didn't take the initiative to call me.

224
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,420
Okay, I forgive you.

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,420
I learned a new recipe recently.

226
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,680
Xiao Tu taught me that.

228
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,970
At first, I thought

229
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,420
it was unsavoury.

230
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,740
But then I realized

231
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,070
it's really delicious.

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,740
You can try it later.

233
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,580
Trust me.

234
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,980
Try it later. Please.

235
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,260
Jia Siwen, listen.

236
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,620
There are many couples around here.

237
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,300
They are lovey-dovey here every day.

238
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,060
You see that?

239
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
We'll do the same next time you come.

240
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,060
They didn't see me.

Are you doing an experiment again?

Xiao Tu and I are hanging out the quilts.

244
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,980
Is it hot over there?

245
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,580
I'm free today.

246
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,740
So I hung this out.

Get in the car.

Where did you get the car?

256
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,140
I bought it.

So I made some money.

261

Great.

This time...

278
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,740
It was mainly my fault this time.

279
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,900
We are as competitive as others,

280
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,940

our project plan

is indeed not good enough.

I'm also responsible this time.

284
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,790
We agreed that Master would be the speaker

285
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900

But the files I prepared were not even used.

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,420

It has nothing to do with me that we failed, right?

I can't think of it now.

But I'm definitely responsible.

293
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,380

the number of failures

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,780
So serious.

378
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,700
I should have dressed up more formally.

379
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,940
Hello. Sir.

380
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,860
This is the blanket you asked for.

381
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,790
Okay, thank you.

382
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,300
You

383
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,780
don't like today's restaurant?

384
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,220
It's not that.

385
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,550
Why were you acting weird just now?

386
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,660
I...

387
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,740
I thought

388
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,500
you were going to propose to me.

389
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,150
What did you say?

390
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,430
I thought you were going to propose to me.

391
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,420
I didn't know you are so eager to marry me.

392
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,870
What are you talking about?

393
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,270
Luckily, you didn't propose to me.

394
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,380
Otherwise, I would have to consider

395
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,910
whether I should marry you.

396
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,210
You were walking so fast.

397
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,660
You want to go to my house as soon as possible?

398
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,460
Who said I'm going to your house?

399
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,100
But now,

400
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,460
the dorm is closed.

401
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,300
Good for you.

402
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,860
So much for comforting you.

403
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,390
I think you're up to no good.

404
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,040
The weather forecast says it's only ten degrees Celsius tonight.

405
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,260
The living room is too cold.

406
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,340
Wait a minute.

407
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,940
Here.

408
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,220
That's it?

409
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,260
Wait.

410
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,140
What do you mean?

411
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,820
Didn't you say this pig looks like me?

412
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,260
Then let it sleep with you.

413
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,990
It's like me sleeping with you.

414
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,940
Fine.

415
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,660
Tuck in the quilt.

416
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,280
Don't catch a cold.

417
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,700
Okay, good night.

418
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,820
I've been busy lately.

419
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,020
I was always sitting.

420
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,100
My neck is really uncomfortable.

421
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,820
Sleeping on the sofa makes me really uncomfortable.

422
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,950
You really want me to sleep on the sofa?

423
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,380
You sleep on the bed.

424
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,480
I promise I'll be good.

425
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm going to sleep on the sofa.

426
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,180
All right.

427
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,940
Do you want to hear a bedtime story?

428
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,980
It's about 2.23 cubic meters.

429
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,420
So we need materials of

430
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,980
2.238 cubic meters.

431
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,460
Next, we're going to talk about multivariable function of functions

432
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,720
and methods of derivation of functions.

433
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,700
You were pretending to sleep?

434
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,130
♫Shadows meet under the sunset♫

435
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,370
♫And form a pair♫

436
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,160
♫There's much ambiguity of love in the night wind♫

437
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,810
♫It's shaking and is about to fall♫

438
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,710
♫I blame my heartbeat for breaking the rule first♫

439
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,160
♫It exceeded its fixed position♫

440
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,030
♫You comforted me like starlight♫

441
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,130
♫And illuminated the darkness♫

442
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,120
♫This world♫

443
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,460
I... I just want to go to the toilet.

444
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,310
Just pretend you didn't see it.

445
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,430
I won't turn on the light when I go to the toilet in the future.

446
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,350
That's not what I meant.

447
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,300
In the future,

448
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,150
I'll drink less water before going to bed.

449
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,860
No, he meant

450
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,780
it was an accident.

451
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,770
It won't happen again.

452
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,810
Don't worry.

453
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,660
But I can't hold it back, right?

454
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,580
Forget it.

455
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,100
Sha,

456
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,150
you're still young.

457
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,320
Sometimes, when you can hold it back,

458
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,620
hold it back.

459
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,700
How can I hold it back?

460
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,980
Someone!

461
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,140
Jiang Juanjuan.

462
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,820
Why are you back?

463
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,660
I'm back for my thesis defense.

464
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,580
Why didn't you tell me you would come back in advance?

465
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,900
You should have told me so that I could pick you up.

466
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,700
I was afraid you're busy.

467
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Tell me

468
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,420
where you are now in your relationship.

469
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,060
Tell me.

470
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,860
Ling Chao and I just slept...

471
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,740
Slept?

472
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,900
Don't.

473
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,010
We just slept on the same bed.

474
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,340
It's not what you think.

475
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,170
You slept on the same bed,

476
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,220
and nothing happened?

477
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,020
Listen.

478
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,780
The atmosphere was not right.

479
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,420
You need to make it romantic.

480
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,220
Like

481
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,380
roses,

482
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,620
candles,

483
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,140
or some wine.

484
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,500
Stop.

485
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,780
What are you thinking?

486
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,300
Boring.

487
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,570
Look.

488
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,940
What era is it now?

489
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,200
I can't believe someone is confessing his love in this way.

490
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,960
You said roses and candles are romantic, right?

491
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,700
When did I say that?

492
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,500
Is my taste that bad?

493
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,220
Look.

494
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
The petals have rough edges.

495
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,140
I don't know which era they are from.

496
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,860
That's right.

497
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,900
People in my parents' era like this kind of things.

498
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,620
Right?

499
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:26,940
Let me tell you.

500
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,400
There is a heart set with candles over there.

501
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,460
Can it illuminate my heart?

502
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,140
It will only blind me.

503
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,580
I'm going to take a photo and send it to my best friend.

504
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,540
I can't be the only one blinded by it.

505
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
I'll take a photo too.

506
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,860
Maybe it will become a trending topic.

507
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,260
Right.

508
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,820
Let's go.

509
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,620
I'm going to take a photo over there. Let's go.

510
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,220
You...

511
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,810
Let's go too.

512
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,580
Okay.

513
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,530
There is really someone confessing his love.

514
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,540
Let's go.

515
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,100
She is here.

516
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,380
Ready.

517
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,020
-Okay?
-Yes.

518
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,340
What's wrong?

519
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,180
You like it lively.

520
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,460
You like it romantic.

521
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,890
You like the sense of ritual.

522
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,140
Do you like these things

523
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,060
today?

524
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,300
-Don't touch me.
-I have something to tell you.

525
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,540
It's been 632 days

526
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,940
since we broke up.

527
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,580
During the 632 days,

528
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,710
I've been counting the days every day.

529
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,260
It's the first time I feel that waiting for someone

530
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,740
is so painful.

531
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,440
You waited long for me in the past.

532
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,060
I think I've waited that long.

533
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,100
You are the one who always compromised,

534
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,260
whether on time or distance.

535
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,140
You always took the initiative to call me,

536
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,660
text me,

537
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,020
and share your life with me.

538
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,180
This time,

539
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,850
it's my turn.

540
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,830
Jiang Juanjuan.

541
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,300
I don't want to be separated from you.

542
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
I admit I'm not a brave person.

543
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,310
Jiang Juanjuan.

544
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,260
You can ignore me.

545
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,590
You don't have to see me.

546
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,500
I can wait for you forever.

547
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,340
I can wait until you forgive me.

you won't even find a girlfriend.
