Didn't you say I could find someone from our hometown?

11
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,170
Well…

12
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,020
Is this a matter of someone from the same hometown?

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,340
Even if you want to find someone,

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,260
you can find a stupid one.

Your dad invited an investor over for dinner.

It concerns a big project next year.

It's very important.

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,780
why don't you dine out?

Well, here's the thing.

48
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,810
Mr. Jiang, the investor,

that Master

140

Can you encourage her?

154

Then she can print it out

161

It's pretty much what Handuo wants,

192
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,300
so I have to fight for you no matter what.

193
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,820
Since it's a fight,

194
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,860
there must be some conditions.

195
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,500
Of course.

Two conditions.

198
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,780
First,

199
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,780
I want to form my own team.

200
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,820
I don't need too many members,

201
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,730
but I want to work with my roommates.

202
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,100
You just met them.

203
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,740
I’ll skip the introduction.

204

You're all top students from the Computer Department of Yunhai University.

You're professional.

206

You also get along with each other.

207
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,140
It's worth considering it

208
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,020
since it can help the company save the cost on team building.

209
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,740
Second,

210
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,920
stay away from Xiao Tu.

211
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,520
Don't get too close to her.

212
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,140
This condition is too harsh.

213
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,860
I need to think it over.

214

But Handuo is still at an early stage.

217
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I need to discuss it with my partner.

218
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,980
You don't even have the right to decide this?

219
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,510

220

222

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
by only asking some random people

about how they think of love?

479

Anyway, I think

480
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,820
love is really hard to control.

481
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,910
It's much harder than fangirling.

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,700
Then what's the meaning

of this topic?

484
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,260
It's just a homework.

499
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,520

502
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,660
People think he's on the guy's side.

503
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,980
He's scolded for being partial only because of one's good looks.

504
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,660
Look.

505
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,660
It's hotly debated in the comment section.

A random video

515
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,140
can trigger so many discussions about social problems.

516
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,180
It makes our topic more meaningless.

517
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,340
It takes fate to meet good news.

518
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,540
You can't force it.

519
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,650
Why does he look so familiar?

520
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,940
Rewind it.

521
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,900
Yes, right here.

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,900
So this man didn't avoid his responsibility.

523
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,090
That old lady and those old people

524
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,820
unified and blackmailed him.

525
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,740
I knew it.

526
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,380
He's handsome.

527
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,860
How can he be a bad guy?

528
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,580
It's said that appearance stands for one's personality.

529
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,180
The old saying makes sense.

530
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
Rewind it.

531
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,220
The more I look at him, the more handsome he looks.

532
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
So this thing

533
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,280

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,000
Call me sister.

751
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,250
Well…

752
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,290
Your helmet.

753
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,260
She's back.

754
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,500
Hurry up. She's back.

755
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,420
Master.

756
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,970
Master!

757
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,860
Master!

758
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,060
Master, you got cheated on.
