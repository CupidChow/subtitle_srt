00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,100
would suddenly get interested in computers?

375
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,370
I knew you wanted that book.

376
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,140
You knew that?

377
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,420
-If you knew it, why did you... -So what?

378
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,110
I could pretend that I didn't know. Then it would be fine, right?

379
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,820
It's just a book.

380
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,160
As long as she's happy, she can give it to anyone.

381
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,700
You don't have to always be like this.

382
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,230
You don't owe her anything.

383
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,380
That's not right.

384
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,420
I owe it to her.

385
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,540
In junior high school,

386
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,300
I was very fat.

387
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,980
Everyone laughed at me

388
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,460
and bullied me.

389
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,990
Only she didn't despise me.

390
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,380
She discussed with me about problems.

391
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,420
She smiled at me.

392
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,340
She even asked me if I wanted to drink yogurt.

393
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,780
She's always so perfect,

394
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,060
but she has never looked down on

395
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,500
such an imperfect me.

396
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,600
Therefore, since then, I've made up my mind.

397
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,940
I swore that

398
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,380
I would study hard enough

399
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,660
so as to become a better man.

400
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,860
Only then can I deserve to be her friend.

401
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,770
No one is perfect.

402
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,720
Don't think like that.

403
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,300
Besides, the key of being friends is sincerity.

404
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
It has nothing to do with whether you deserve it or not.

405
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,580
Sincerity?

406
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,140
Yes.

407
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,900
You're handsome.

408
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,010
You're also

409
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
smart.

410
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,589
Many people want to make friends with you.

411
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,839
If you want something,

412
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,540
others will give it to you voluntarily.

413
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,980
Isn't it too easy for you

414
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,440
to get others' sincerity?

415
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,260
It's so easy that you don't even want to take a look.

416
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,380
You even rejected other people's regard for you

417
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,020
so casually again and again.

418
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,579
So you think I consider my rejection to Yin Xinlan

419
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,140
as a pleasure?

420
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,410
Isn't it the fact?

421
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,180
Fine.

422
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,100
If you want to think like this, it's not wrong.

423
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,300
At least, I did everything for myself,

424
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,380
not for others.

425
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,360
What about you?

426
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,110
You did all these things

427
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,840
just in order to make yourself feel touched.

428
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Can someone like you understand how I feel?

429
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,340
You have no right to judge my life.

430
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,180
[Stadium]

431
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,700
[Eminem]

432
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,820
You are my superstar.

433
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,020
It's a little cold outside.

434
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,580
Wear a scarf.

435
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,130
No, no.

436
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,380
There are heaters in the mall and in the cinema.

437
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,620
I just need to stay at the entrance for a while.

438
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
It should be fine.

439
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,990
Hold my hand.

440
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,740
Coming.

441
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,460
You...

442
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,080
How come your face is injured?

443
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,820
Did you fight?

444
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,420
No.

445
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
I was hit by a basketball.

446
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,290
Did you really get hurt by a basketball?

447
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,100
You played shot-put, right?

448
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,200
Come on. Let me have a look.

449
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,300
Ma'am.

450
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,340
Can you be gentle?

451
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm trying to be gentle to you.

452
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,440

453
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,710

♫My fate♫

460
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,710
Did you catch a cold?

461
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,700
No.

462
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,320
My deskmate caught a cold.

463
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
Are you going to take that again?

464
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,700
You've been afraid of taking medicine since childhood.

465
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,460
You're a grown man now,

466
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,620
but you haven't made any progress at all.

467
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,460
It's a waste that you've grown so tall.

468
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,860
So don't waste your time.

469
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,160
I won't be tricked.

470
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,340
Just dream of it.

471
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,060
The price of a packet of Mylikes Chocolate has increased to three yuan.

472
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,860
It'll be a waste to let you eat it.

473
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,860
It costs three yuan now.

474
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
So expensive.

475
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,890
Should I...

476
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,940
You...

477
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,740
-give it a try? -No!

478
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,540
Let go!

479
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Don't spit it out.

480
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,780
You're as gullible as you used to be when you were a kid.

481
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
What's that look on your face?

482
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,340
I just fed you medicine.

483
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,070
Why do you have that expression as if I forced you to be a prostitute?

484
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,500
You pressed my wound.

485
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,350
It seems to be more swollen now.

486
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,270
I'll cook an egg for you so that you can apply it to your wound.

487
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,820
After eating this,

488
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,380
you'll get over your cold.

489
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,420
No!

490
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,380
Then eat this.

491
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,420
This is an elixir.

492
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,010
It's not bitter at all.

493
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,420
It's true. It's very sweet.

494
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,220
Taste it.

495
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,320
I didn't lie to you, right?

496
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
Eat another one.

497
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,740
It's so bitter.

498
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,300
Godmother.

499
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,330

[Yin Zihan]

501
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,020
[Yin Zihan]

502
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,630
[Yin Zihan]

503
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,620
Actually, I heard

504
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,860
the conversation bwtween you and Ling Chao

505
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,390
on the playground that day.

506
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,920
Thank you for caring about me and taking care of me all the time.

507
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,900
However,

508
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,060
I didn't expect that there was such a plot in the story previously.

509
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,920
I can't even remember it clearly.

510
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,500
Actually, I know

511
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,900
it was just a trivial matter

512
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,380
to you.

513
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,830
But it has really affected me a lot.

514
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,300
In fact, I've been praised a lot

515
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,820
since childhood.

516
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,740
But I know in most cases, people just praised me to show courtesy.

517
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,700
Therefore,

518
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

519
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,140
Am I really as good as you said?

520
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,290
No matter what others think of you,

521
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,500
you're the best.

522
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,140
Then why don't you think of yourself like that?

523
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,000
Actually, you're very good, too.

524
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
You don't have to envy the brightness

525
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,360
of the sunshine in summer.

526
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,100
Though the sunshine in winter lasts for a short time,

527
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,500
it's also very warm.

528
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,580
Actually, I've thought a lot these days.

529
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,140
The sun won't change its regular pattern

530
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,000
because of people's preference.

531
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,380
Therefore,

532
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,780
we shouldn't lose ourselves so easily

533
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,140
because of others.

534
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,380
Will the sun in winter

535
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,460
become the sun in summer one day?

536
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,610
Of course.

537
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,380
It'll be the deadline this weekend.

538
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,910
Do you want to see it with me?

539
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,850
I'll go.

540
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,660
The teacher in Yin Zihan's class delayed the time of ending the lecture?

541
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,380
I don't think so.

542
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,980
Just now I saw Zhang Danian

543
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,510
running faster than being chased by zombies.

544
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,760
Aren't they in the same class?

545
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,980
It took them so long to buy their lunch.

546
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,860
Have they gone to plant vegetables or kill pigs?

547
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,970
Will they be able to have lunch before the end of this year?

548
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,420
Yin Zihan is so pitiful.

549
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,380
He's sick, but no one even cares about him.

550
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,980
He's absent today, but poeple don't even know about that.

551
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm such a gossiper. I don't even know the news,

552
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,380
but you actually know it?

553
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,280
What happened?

554
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,770
When I went to the office to deliver the homework,

555
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,300
I heard it from their teacher.

556
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,430
His teacher said that he seemed to have caught a cold and a fever yesterday.
