They must be afraid

192
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,100
that Xiao's father can't accept it.

193
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
So,

194
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,500
I asked Ling to turn everything down today.

195
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,140
It took him a lot of effort

196
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,340
to trick your husband to play cards.

197
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,140
I just want to leave them more space

198
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,400
to spend more time alone with each other.

199
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,460
Great.

200
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,580
Well, it won't last long.

201
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,140
Well…

202
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,540
It's not a long-term plan for him to play cards all the time.

203
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,380
What about tomorrow? What about the day after tomorrow and so on?

204
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,060
Right?

Let the four of us take this opportunity

208
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,220
to go on a trip

209
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,420
without children.

210
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,060
What do you think?

211
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,380
Sounds great.

212
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,700
It's a deal.

213
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,230
Didn't you go shopping with my mom?

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,260
Why aren't you wearing new clothes?

215
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,390
Yes, I am wearing it.

216
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,580
Isn't this the one you wore in the morning?

217
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,540
I'm warning you.

218
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,420
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

219
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,060
I think Godmother knows something.

220
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,420

221
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,420
We can't hide it forever.

222
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,060
Or do you just want to have a secret relationship with me,

223
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,390
so you can dump me after you get tired of me?

224
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,980
Can you stop

225
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,780
talking about me like I'm a jerk.

226
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
Anyway,

227
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,300
let's keep some distance

228
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,180
in front of our parents.

229
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,310
It's safer this way.

230
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Fine,

231
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,090
but there's no one around now.

232
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,420
Okay.

233
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,180
What a coincidence.

234
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
You live in this neighborhood too?

235
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,580
Are you here to exercise?

236
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Yes.

237
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,030
I've been living here for almost 20 years.

238
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,340
You even want to hide it from your neighbors?

239
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,660
Of course.

240
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,180
The neighbors are all my parents' colleagues.

241
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,380
Rumors spread faster among them than the broadband speed

242
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,420

I'm farsighted.

248
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,100
The words are too small. I can't see them clearly.

249

250
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,380
You two can't play together.

Were you insulting me with those two Straights?

270
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,460
No.

271
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,360
You must have calculated.

272
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
It's so obvious. There's no need to calculate.

273
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,650
So what if you're good at math?

274
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,300
Tell me.

564
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,660
if you keep doing so?

565
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,900
Then I'll tell my godparents

566
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,380
that you abandon me.

567
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,100
Now you're blaming me.

568
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,900
Aren't you afraid your parents will find out?

569
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,580
I didn't tell them because I was afraid my dad would make things difficult for you,

570
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,700
then we would only be forced to elope.

571
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,300
How can I elope with you

572
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,760
if I don't know whether you like me or not?

573
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,260
I like you the most, okay?

574
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,700
Good.

575
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,380
Open the door.

576
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,580
What's the rush?

577
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,330
Open the door!

578
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,460
Open the door!

579
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,140
This door.

580
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,020
-What door?
-This door.

581
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,100
This door.

582
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,740
Yes.

583
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,870
Take it slow.

584
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,540
Xiao Haishan.

585
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,260
Wait for me!

586
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,060
-What's the hurry?
-The key.

587
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,340
It's in your hand.

588
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,570
Are you blind?

589
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,380
Go by yourself.

590
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,140
Xiao Haishan.

591
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,540
Why did I hear my mom's voice?

592
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,290
My parents won't be back so soon.

593
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,970
Why don't we...

594
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,160
What's in your pocket?

595
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,340
I don't have the key.

596
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,900
If you don't let me in,

597
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,260
I'll be homeless.

598
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,100
Scheming man.

599
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
You don't like it?

600
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,020
Why are you standing here?

601
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,260
Get in.

602
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,150
[Exclusive Epilogue]

603
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,900
Hi.

604
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,420
What's the best here?

605
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,420
I recommend you to try the special tiramisu.

606
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,620
Okay, I'll take this one.

607
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,260
Okay.

608
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,190
Two, please.

609
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,380
One to go.

610
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,530
Sorry, sir.

611
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,580
There's a limit to the number of Tiramisu you can order.

612
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,260
One for each table.

613
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,380
Okay. One to go please.

614
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,550
[Happy]

615
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,140
Okay.

616
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:15,940
For Rabbit?

617
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,060
Simp.
