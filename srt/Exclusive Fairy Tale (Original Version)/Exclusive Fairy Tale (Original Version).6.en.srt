190
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,980
Ling Chao, I'm done.

191
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,900
Take a look.

192
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,700
You did it right this time.

193
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,460
Really?

194
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,780
I've been solving this question for two days to no avail/and still couldn't solve it.

195
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,290
But I could solve it immediately after you taught me.

196
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,260
You're really good.

197
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,100
A straight A student? A talented girl?

198
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,630
You have to rely on others to solve the questions you don't know.

199
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,980
Those rumors are too exaggerated.

201
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,100
I have questions I am weak at too.

202
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,220
Ling Chao knows it, right?

203
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,330
You only solved one question after so long.

204
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,480
And the right answer is C instead of B.

205
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,700
If you don't know how to solve the question, just choose C.

206
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,740
You don't even know this?

207
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,780
You're so stupid.

208
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,150
Give it back!

209
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,780
Isn't this what we learned in middle school?

210
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,780
I heard that you were admitted through special admission because of Taekwondo.

211
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,940
Indeed, the academic level of specially admitted students

212
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,220
is not that high.

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,060
I didn't believe it when others said that before.

215
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,940
Let's go.

216
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,940
Didn't you say the coupon of the fried chicken restaurant

217
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,000
will expire today?

218
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,200
Let's go eat up and go home.

219
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,460
Okay.

220
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,660
Ling Chao.

221
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,900
Hey, Gum.

222
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,370
Ling Chao has left. Why are you still here?

223
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,620
Are you going to live here?

224
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,660
The coupon is for three people.

225
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,860
I'll take you with us.

226
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,300
But I don't eat fried chicken.

227
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,210
Are we really going to eat fried chicken?

228
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,470
Do we have any other choice?

229
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,700
Fried chicken is too oily. We'll gain weight if we eat too much.

230
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,340
There's no coupon.

231
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,180
Then why did you ask me here?

232
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Are you stupid?

233
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,660
Can't you see the atmosphere was awkward just now?

234
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,340
Then I should thank you.

Why aren't you home yet?

239
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,820
I just finished the training for competition.

What a coincidence.

241
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,430
The training hasn't started yet, though?

242

To get myself into the state ahead of time,

243
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,940

Not bad.

I haven't been exercising lately.

248
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,860
My muscles are not very obvious.

249
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,430
It was like this before.

250
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,860
So, I plan to ride a bike to school.

251
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,580
With your figure,

252
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,960
it's useless to train.

Don't listen to him.

255
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,380
A good figure can't be developed in a few days.

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,020
Right?

257
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,220
You go ahead.

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,500

I've done your monthly test.

264
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,820
I asked the teacher to read your paper.

265
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,620
I wrote 17 more words than you for the composition.

266
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,780
You're amazing.

267
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,210
Did you choose science because

268
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,890
you want to go to Qingbei University?

269
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,380
Do you want to study Math or Physics?

270
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,260
I haven't thought about it.

271
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,460
Why do I have to go to Qingbei University?

272
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,520
In that case... You want to go abroad?

273
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,260
Harvard? Yale?

274
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,620
Or MIT?

275
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,420

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,480

278
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,990
and turn left at the second intersection.

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,220

Don't be stubborn.

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,780
You just don't want me to meet the right person.

284
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,270
You're so careless.

285
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,000
Didn't you notice a car following us?

286
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,260
Which one?

287
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,990
You go first. I'll go check.

288
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,060
Which one? Did you see it?

289
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,940
What?

290
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,660
Is that your car?

291
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,540
No.

292
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,260
We don't drive this one on Wednesday.

293
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,940
That's too dangerous.

294
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,470
I have to protect Ling Chao.

295
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,940
What happened?

296
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,420
Nothing.

297
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,810
Let's go.

298
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,580
That man looks good at fighting.

299
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,840
Can Ling Chao beat him?

300
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,820
Don't worry.

301
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,060
Ling Chao is amazing.

302
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,340
You haven't been to my house, have you?

303
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,940
Let's go.

304
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,500
It's right ahead.

305
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,580
-Let's go.
-He's awesome?

306
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,740

Well, you...

314
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,330
You misunderstood. I...

315
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,340
I was just passing by today.

316
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,300
Is it fun?

317
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,980

I couldn't do anything about it when I was young.

320
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,550
And now I don't care.

321
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,020
Just come to me directly.

You're always like this.

330
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,900

331

Don't buy anything.

-It's full. It's everywhere.
- This...

-Yes.
-Dad, Mum.

356
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,290
Okay.

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,260
Wait a minute.

358
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,830
I'll get you a pair of slippers.

359
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,980
This pair belongs to Ling Chao.

360
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,820
This pair is too small.

Are you done?

362
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,020
I can't hold it any longer.

363
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,260
Wait.

364
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,580
Who did you bring?

365
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,460
Hello.

366
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,060
Hello, Dad and Mom.

367
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,940
What are you doing?

368
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Have an orange.

369
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,980
Okay.

370
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Thank you, Uncle.

371
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,060
Wenhui, where are you?

372
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,020
Let me tell you.

373
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,220
Rabbit brought a classmate home.

374
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,380
A boy.

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,860
What? Rabbit brought a boy home?

376
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,620
Is he handsome?

377
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,020
Not bad.

378
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,900
Not as handsome as Ling Chao.

379
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,870
He's about the same height as Chao.

380
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,900
What am I talking to you about?

381
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
I just want to ask you,

382
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,700
it's the first time she's bringing a boy home,

383
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,780
what should I do?

384
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,160
Don't worry. I'll be right there. Let's talk in person.

385
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,890
Okay, hurry up.

386
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,730
I'm hanging up.

387
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,060
Okay, I'll wait for you.

388
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,500
Xiao Tu,

389
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,100
I think your classmate is very tall.

390
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,540
He's more handsome than Ling Chao.

391
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,700
Have some apples.

392
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,490
His hair is curly.

393
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,860
He looks handsome.

394
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,980
Have an apple.

395
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,780
I'll add another dish.

396
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,890
He's handsome.

397
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,990
Have table manners.

398
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,010
Don't play while eating.

399
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,460
He has a good appetite.

400
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,590
He's already had two bowls of rice.

401
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,900
If you want to eat something,

402
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,820
help yourself.

403
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,300
Make yourself at home.

404
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,660
Okay, thank you, Dad.

405
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,220
Thank you, Uncle.

406
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,780
Eat up.

407
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,140
The food price

408
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,180
has gone up.

409
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,240
I can't even afford to eat scallion, ginger and garlic.

410
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,740
Yes.

411
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,780
So,

412
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,810
Rabbit,

413
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,460
don't be picky.

414
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,579
Do you hear me?

415
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,420
I... I have too much rice.

416
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,940
Ling Chao will help me.

417
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,660
You're eating just this little?

418
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,320
Too little.

419
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,010
Let me get you a bowl.

420
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,380
No, it's okay, Uncle.

421
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,340
I usually don't eat much.

422
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,700
Auntie's cooking is so good.

423
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,620
That's why I ate more.

424
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,220
I told you.

425
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,780
My mom is a good cook.

426
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,460
You should eat more.

427
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,620
You won't have such a good chance in the future.

428
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,060
You can come

429
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,740
whenever you want.

430
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,700
Okay.

431
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,980
We only need to add an extra pair of chopsticks.

432
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,590
Come...

433
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,980
He won't have time for a while.

434
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,910
He signed up for a competition.

435
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,860
He has training after school.

436
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,500
Right?

437
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,250
Ju...nior.

438
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,540
A competition?

439
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,620
Good.

440
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,940
A straight A student.

441
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,860
Xiao Tu, if you

442
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,340
have any questions,

443
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,670
you should ask him more.

444
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,260
Xiao Tu and I are deskmates.

445
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,020
It's my duty.

446
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,500
Okay.

447
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,220
In school,

448
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,460
don't bother your classmate.

449
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,900
We already have a tutor at home.

450
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,540
Yeah.

451
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,940
Ling Chao, do you hear me?

452
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,940
Chao is a good student, right?

453
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,580
If he tutors Xiao Tu,

454
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,900
to put it nicely,

455
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,460
it's more than enough.

456
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
But to be frank,

457
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,340
it's a waste of talent.

458
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,140
Mom.

459
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,260
You can chat with each other.

460
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,990
Why do you have to talk about me?

461
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,180
Sit down.

462
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
How can we let you do it?

463
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,220
Ling Chao, go.

464
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,140
Look, he knows where it is.

465
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,180
A man

466
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,380
should do more work.

467
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,740
Yes, Wenhui.

468
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,540
I envy you so much.

469
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,660
Look at Chao.

470
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,940
He's so sensible.

471
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,860
He also has good grades.

472
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,700
He can do housework too.

473
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,900
It's rare to see such a good boy

474
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,420
as Chao is.

475
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,380
Auntie.

476
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,660
Thank you for cooking so many dishes.

477
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,380
Later,

478
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,590
let me wash the dishes and clean up.

479
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,380
-You're quite diligent.
-No, no.

480
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,420
How can I let you do the dishes?

481
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:34,980
Uncle, Auntie.

482
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,860
You don't have to stand on ceremony.

483
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,260
Let me help you.

484
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,300
No, I can do it myself.

485
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm also good at housework.

486
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,700
I...

487
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,740
The toilet is over there.

488
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,180
Yin, you must be tired.

489
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,860
Come on, sit down and watch TV.

490
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,820
What are you talking about?

491
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,250
What time is it?

492
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,980
Let him go home.

493
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,100
Is it late?

494
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,970
His parents will be worried.

495
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,340
He has homework to do.

496
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,980
Yeah.

497
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,740
Get ready.

498
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,060
That's good.

499
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,300
Anyway, come often

500
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,380
when you have time.

501
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,180
Xiao Tu.

502
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,660
See your classmates off.

503
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,580
Ling Chao.

504
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,540
You go too. Hurry up.

505
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,740
You go with Rabbit.

506
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,940
Well,

507
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,820
Uncle, Auntie. Thank you for the food.

508
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,660
See you next time.

509
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,380
-Take care.
-You're welcome.

510
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,300
Bye. Take care.

511
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,180
Bye. Bye.

512
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,260
Bye.

513
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,780
Goodbye, Uncle.

514
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,180
Okay, take care.

515
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,660
Where is my bike?

516
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,580
You didn't lock it?

517
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,900
I forgot.

518
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,700
I usually park it in my yard.

519
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,940
I never lock it.

520
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Why did they only steal your bike?

521
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,590
There's discrimination among bikes too?

522
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,620
I...

523
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,020
Ask your family to pick you up.

524
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,480
Don't call.

525
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,860
It's quite suitable.

526
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,640
I think you should stay away from him.

527
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,290
Why?

528
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Didn't you know that he approached you with a purpose?

529
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,620
I know.

530
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,610
Ridiculous.

531
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Ling Chao,

532
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,020
do you think I should choose liberal arts or science?

533
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,420
Is there any difference?

534
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,980
It doesn't affect your placing at the bottom anyway./You will come in last place anyway.

535
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,620
You did it on purpose.

536
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,420
Ling Chao.

537
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,420
Morning.

538
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,300
Hello, Senior.

539
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,700
I brought it for you

540
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,930
when I passed by the breakfast shop today.

541
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,620
Thank you.

542
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,420
I've already had breakfast.

543
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,380
Junior,

544
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,500
I think you should choose liberal arts.

545
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,940
I chose science.

546
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,900
It is actually quite hard to learn.

547
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,580
But luckily, I have Ling Chao.

548
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,380
He taught me all the questions I don't know.

549
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,460
Thank you. Senior.

550
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,350
Let's go. We're being late.

551
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,250
You are so patient.

552
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,260
Why didn't you teach me how to solve questions?

553
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,320
Did I not teach you?

554
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
You can't be taught at all.

555
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
Is that called teaching?

556
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,380
How can you learn how to solve a math question at once?

557
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,900
When I taught you the second time,

558
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,580
you were already sleeping like a pig.

559
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,380
It's my fault?

560
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,790
Where's Senior?

561
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,180
Lan, good morning.

562
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,580
Why did you stop here?

563
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,540
It's nothing.

564
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,570
Let's go.

565
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,700
Yin Xinlan is jealous

566
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
because you and Ling Chao are close.

567
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,300
Why would such a beautiful senior

568
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,580
be jealous of me?

569
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,540
I have a better relationship with QQ gummies.

570
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,900
It's fine that she's stupid,

571
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,460
but she always troubles Ling Chao.

572
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,620
I'm speechless.

[Conserve every drop of water] [Be careful of scalding]

574
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,820
Is it that bad?

575
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,260
It's not like you didn't see what happened on the doomsday.

576
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,460
What a joke.

577
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,180
And she can't even solve middle school problems.

578
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,250
If Ling Chao hadn't been her neighbor  since they were kids,

579
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,660
he wouldn't be her friend.

Are you okay?

585
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,980
I'm normally not interested in other people's business,

586
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,860
but I think I should tell you.

587
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,820
Don't fill too much water.

588
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,220
Otherwise, you'll burn yourself.

589
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,290
Speaking ill of others is also like this.

I didn't watched those court intrigue dramas

597

for nothing.

598
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,380
Your Highness.

It's my first time acting such a role.

603

I was flustered too.

604
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,220
Right?

605
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,380
But this Yin Xinlan...

I thought she was my goddess.

607
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,200
I didn't expect her to have two faces.

608
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,940
She is more formidable than Ling Chao.

609
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,100
If they really get married,

610
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,290
it'll be bad.

611
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,010
They will quarrel every day

612

and won't have peace.

613

He doesn't care about seperating boys and girls.

643

Then I was caught for nothing.

What do you think it is?

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,180
Why would a turtle give me something?

Don't care about that.

744
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,220
It must be milk tea.

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,180
Did you make up this test?

753
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,980
When you were struggling in the sea of exercises,

754
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,140
Yin Zihan came to save you.

755
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,220
Were you happy?

756
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,220
Yes.

757
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,620
When Yin Zihan gave you milk tea,

758
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,660
were you happy?

759
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,420
Yes.

760
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,260
You still don't admit that you like Yin Zihan?

761
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,820
He took you to eat tiramisu once.

762
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,280
And you still remember it.

763
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,660
Then I guess I like him.

764
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,500
Generally, when it gets to Episode 8,

765
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,860

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,340
How come there's no progress

767
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,800
between you and Yin Zihan?

768
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,340
But I still don't know

769
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,220
what he likes about me

770
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,620

Didn't you hear him?

772
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,810
How can we figure out

773
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,200
something as complicated as love is?

774
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,740
You can't  figure out how to study.

775
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,200
Don't think about more complicated things.

776
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,860
I think Yin Zihan is good.

777
