Where are my parents?

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,860
They went for a checkup.

8
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,850
Why didn't you go?

9
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,580
Our department had a checkup last week.

10

I can do this. It's not a big deal.

It's the one on your birthday…

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,860
I know.

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,020

Yes.

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,400
What kind of feelings?

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,900
I want to raise a family with her.

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,730
Well.

61
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,980
Does Rabbit like you?

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,540
Right.

This is more important.

64
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,290
Probably.

65
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,270
What do you mean by "probably"?

66
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,400
Have you confessed your love?

67
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,579
Not yet.

68
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,100
When are you going to confess to her?

Really?

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,410
It's normal.

76
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,260
Rabbit is so cute.

77
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,260
You only bully her.

78
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,620
Besides,

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,340
your personality is weird

80
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,540
and unlikeable.

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,830
I don't know who you take after.

82
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,279
The biggest regret

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,540
for me

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,410
is that I don't have a daughter.

85
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,019
So,

86
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,500
I always treat Rabbit as my daughter.

87
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
In the past, they were young,

88
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,740
so I didn't think about that.

89
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,820
But that day,

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,860
that boy came to our house for dinner.

91
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,810
It was Yin...

92
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,740
Yin Zihan.

93
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Yes, that was him.

94
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,780
She brought a boy back.

95
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,740
It felt like I was losing her.

96
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,020
Also,

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,740
I met

98
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,620
Yin's mother

99
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,940
when I went to the parent-teacher conference for Rabbit.

100
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,460
She looked unreliable.

101
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,100
I can't imagine

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,820
Rabbit marrying into their family in the future.

103
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,420
Right.

104
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Your mother is right.

105
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,260
If Rabbit really gets married,

106
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,260
she won't come to our house often.

107
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,610
I'll also feel quite lonely.

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,780
Ling Chao, let me tell you.

109
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,740
You can do anything you want.

110
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,860
Be thick-skinned

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,140
and thoughtful.

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,340
If you can't do it,

113
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,780
you can even cry and make a scene.

114
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,500
I don't care.

115
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,900
You must marry Rabbit.

116
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,630
I'll try my best.

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,300
Go back first.

118
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,580
If you need anything,

119
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,860
just let us know.

120
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,060
Okay.

121
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,390
Don't worry.

122
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
I can do it.

123
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,620
Can he really do it?

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,860
Hello.

125

128
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,700
Don't you know I'm suffering from jet lag?

129
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,760
It's nine o'clock.

130
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,460
What's the matter?

131
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,020
Nothing.

132
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,060
Please thank your mother for me.

133
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,720
Good night.

134
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,300
Ling Chao, are you crazy?

135
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,300
You bought so many things.

136
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,100
This is the special tea from Yunhai.

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,300
The local students said it's very good.

138
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,460
Okay.

139
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,300
Okay.

140
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,460
This is dried fruit.

141
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,120
It's a good snack while you're watching dramas.

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,780
Try it.

143
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,260
And this is the sweet potato.

around my neck lately.

146
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,100
Let me find something to wrap it up.

147
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,860
This…

148
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,020
A scarf, right?

149
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,980
Let me find it for you.

150
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,820
A scarf.

151
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,880
-Is there any? -Sure, I must have one.

152
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,860
This.

153
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,700
It was my first time knitting.

154
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,020
I saw my classmates knitting.

155
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,180
It doesn't look good.

156
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,780
Why did you knit?

157
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,740
It's tiring.

158
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,910
It's well knitted.

159
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,940
This is so fashionable.

160
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,020
Yes, it is.

161
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,100
The ones sold in the mall

162
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,340
are designed to be ripped

163
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,070
Yours is much better than that.

164
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,020
Put it on.

165
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,780
Who do your classmates

166
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
knit scarfs for?

167
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,540
Their boyfriends.

168
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,700
That means

169
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,580
there must a lot of girls in your class who are dating.

170
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,660
Yes, there are a few.

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,990
I'm not sure about that.

172
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,659
Is there any boy

173
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,820
interested in our Rabbit?

174
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,380
Mom.

175
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,260
Are you asking if I'm in a relationship?

176
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,180
Can't I ask?

177
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,940
I'm just caring about you.

178
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,820
No.

179
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,820
It's not that I don't want you to date, right?

180
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,540
You're in college now.

181
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,820
I mean

182
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,290
you are likely to go back to Yidong after graduating.

183
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,020
If you find someone who lives too far away,

184
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,260
you'll be married far away, right?

185
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,900
Yes.

186
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,020
You won't marry far away, right?

187
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,580
We don't want you to marry far away.

188
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,290
Right.

189
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,260
That means

190
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,300
I can find someone from our hometown?

191
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,060
Yeah, it's great to date someone from the same place.

192
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,660
You'll know each other well.

193
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,980

Can you find the first draft?

383
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,770
I don't know where it is.

384
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,420
Let me do it.

385
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,380
My rehearsal is over.

386
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,980
Come over.

387
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,150
Let's have milk tea.

388
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,000
[Got it.]

389
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,900
Come on.

390
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,380
Have you

391
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,620
prepared well today?

392
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Almost done.

393
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,900
Will there be any problems tomorrow?

394
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,780
No.

395
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,900
Don't worry, Senior.

396
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,220
Even if the whole school is out of power tomorrow,

397
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,740
I'll get a generator

398
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,870
to complete this event successfully.

399
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,300
Okay.

400
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,660
Let's call it a day.

401
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,900
Thank you, everyone.

402
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Go back and rest.

403
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,900
Okay.

404
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,500
Xiao Tu, you stay for a while.

405
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,819
Let's check the manuscript.

406
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,420
Okay.

407
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,660
Dali.

408
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,349
It's too noisy outside.

409
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
Close the door when you go out.

410
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,740
Okay.

411
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,339
Senior.

412
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,220
Should we start from the beginning

413
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,300
or the interview part?

414
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,900
What's the rush?

415
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
Are you in a hurry?

416
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420
I am in a hurry.

417
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,680
I have an appointment.

418
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,310
An appointment?

419
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,940
Is it

420
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,780
Ling Chao?

421
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,290
No, no.

422
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,940
You're so funny.

423
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,580
You're with me,

424
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,800
but you always want to get involved with others.

425
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
Stop pretending to be surprised.

426
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,340
I know

427
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,820
you like me.

428
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,530
I knew it

429
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,620
when you asked me for my number.

430
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,680
You can't fool people with your eyes.

431
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,740
Did you misunderstand?

432
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,020
I'm slow-witted sometimes.

433
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,820
I'll apologize to you

434
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,770
if I did something to mislead you.

435
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,860
You know,

436
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,020
many girls like me.

437
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,740
In the past,

438
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,580
you

439
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,260
were really not my type.

440
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,700
Now there are just the two of us.

441
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,030
My patience is limited.

442
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,380
Stop playing

443
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,300
hard to get.

444
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,700
I really don't like you.

445
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,420
I just see you as my senior.

446
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,420
Hello?

447
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,340
Something happened.

448
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,140
Something happened.

449
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,380
You really don't like me?

450
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,920
Why did you ask me for my phone number?

451
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,260
I've explained it many times.

452
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,900
I lost a game.

453
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't believe it.

454
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,180
Are you mad at me

455
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,420
because you're shy

456
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,860
after I said

457
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,510
what's in your mind?

458
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,980
I'm gonna go.

459
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,220
If you leave,

460
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,540
I'll take this

461
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,510
as you giving up on credits for this event.

462
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,060
Senior, what's wrong?

463
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,860
What took you so long?

464
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,050
I was bullied by the book.

465
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,340
My fingers got cut

466
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,140
and are bleeding.

467
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,100
Ridiculous.

468
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,340
How dare you say that?

469
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,580
What if

470
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,220
Madam was bullied by something,

471
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,940
then…

472
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,500
Who can bully her?

473
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,230
It's good that she doesn't bully others.

474
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Suck it yourself.

475
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,540
Hey.

476
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,740
Think it over.

477
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,940
Are you

478
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,420
controlling yourself?

479
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,300
I know.

480
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,780
You can't control yourself

481
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,710
when you fall in love with someone.

482
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,380
If you don't like me,

483
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,420
why did you raise your hand

484
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,540
to sign up for this seminar?

485
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,670
I didn't mean to raise my hand. It was really an accident.

486
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,540
Accident?

487
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Every time you saw me,

488
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,990
you smiled so shyly.

489
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,780
Do you still want to deny that you like me?

490
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,820
Shy?

491
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,380
I smiled because I like to smile.

492
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,440
What does it have to do with being shy?

493
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,220
Then why did you treat me to dinner

494
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,620
and let me be your model?

495
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,380
Why did you give me hints

496
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,140
to tempt me to respond

497
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,060
every time you showed up in front of me?

498
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,260
Senior.

499
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,220
Don't you think you're thinking too much?

500
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,780
Do you think you're excellent

501
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,580
and every woman should like you?

502
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,790
Isn't it reasonable

503
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,580
for someone to like me?

504
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,230
Don't be shy.

505
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,260
I know.

506
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,090
Are you the scumbag from the Computer Department

507
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,060
in that post?

508
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,500
Yes.

509
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,140
Since you've found out,

510
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,940
can you be more honest?

511
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,970
Who is it?

512
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,470
Are you okay?

513
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,180
Let's go.

514
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,140
Hold on.

515
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,500
Let's go.

516
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,820
When did you become so smart?

517
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,180
Take a guess.

518
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,300
I want to be as manly as my master,

519
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,820
so that girls would like me.

520
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,050
Look at my spin kick.

521
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,180
Ling Chao.

522
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
What are you doing?

523
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,860
Why did the other candidate on the competition list

524
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,100
become you?

525
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,190
Didn't you say you weren't going?

526
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,140
I suddenly wanted to join.

527
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,780
You...

528
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,780
What?

529
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
What?

530
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,900
What do you mean by the other candidate changed into Master?

531
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,980
There was only me

532
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,660
on the list.

533
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,340
You were just a spare.

534
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,100
Ling Chao.

535
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,450
Haven't you gone too far?

536
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,860
Revealing the disgusting truth of the Prince Charming from the Computer Department.

537
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,340
We are all in the same department.

538
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,200
Do you really think we are stupid?

539
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,820
Haven't we already found

540
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,350
the IP address of the poster

541
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,100
and not made it public?

542
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,100
The first time, you framed me.

543
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,620
The second time, you harassed Xiao Tu.

544
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,660
You can try the third time.

545
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
I suggest

546
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,860
you behave yourself until you graduate.

547
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,660
Don't hurt other girls anymore.

548
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,540
Otherwise, I'll report you.

549
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,420

550
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,300
You won.

551
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,300

553
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,380
Don't you think

554
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,990
you looked so cool just now?

555
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,940
But I'm on duty today.

556
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,940
I'm on duty. I...

557
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,300
Master, check this post out.

558
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,810
Come on.

559
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,660
We grew up together.

[Yunhai University]

561
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,010
We are kind of like childhood sweethearts to each other.

562
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,100
Ever since you said I like him last time,

563
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:06,280
[I see him as my brother, but he...]

564
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,050
I've been confused.

565
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,140
I'm nervous and shy.

566
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
I think I've fallen in love with him.

[Nice Bar]

568
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,440
You've been working hard lately.

569
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,100
Eat more.

570
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
It's nutritious.

571
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,900
There are only two of us. You ordered too much.

572
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,250
What a waste.

Of course not.

Thank you.

I haven't seen you eat like this for a long time.

You kept busy recently

604
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,770
