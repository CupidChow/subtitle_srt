565
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,340
when they're together.

566
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,180
Yeah.

567
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,620
Ling Chao can take care of Little Rabbit.

568
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,340
Right?

569
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,300
Yes.

570
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,220
Xiao.

571
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,340
We are not familiar with

572
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,260
the university application process,

573
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,820
but the kids are familiar with it.

574
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,540
I think

575
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,000
we should let them make their own decisions.

576
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,260
Let her decide it.

577
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,740
Our Xiao Tu

578
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,860
has been following

579
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Ling Chao's steps since she was a child.

580
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,980
She will do whatever Ling Chao says.

581
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,300
I don't care

582
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,660
if it's anything else,

583
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,020
but applying for university is different.

584
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,300
I couldn't let her mess it up.

585
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,820
If we make a mistake on this,

586
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,620
who will regret for her?

587
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,700
Xiao Tu.

588
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,060
Let me ask you.

589
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,060
What do you think?

590
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,900
Don't be disturbed.

591
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,870
I want to apply for Yunhai University.

592
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,740
I did listen to Ling Chao's analysis and suggestions,

593
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,620
but I didn't make this decision

594
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,460
under his influence.

595
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,060
The decision was made through consideration.

596
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,620
I can fill in several applications anyway.

597
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,540
I want to take Yunhai as my first choice.

598
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,180
Also, Journalism is my favourite major.

599
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,060
Dad.

600
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,740
This is the first time

601
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,600
I've made a big decision on my own.

602
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,620
I want to give it a try.

603
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,380
Okay?

604
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
Why are you in such a hurry?

605
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,470
Are you in a hurry to go home?

606
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,820
Are you really going back home?

607
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,460
Yes.

608
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,300
The train is in two hours.

609
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,450
No wonder that you handed in exam paper early.

610
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,260
Master.

611
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,660
You made me anxious.

612
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,760
I didn't get the last question right.

613
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Where is Guan Jiu?

614
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,900
He won't come out

615
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,260
until the last minute.

616
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,340
Master is in a hurry to see his child bride.

617
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,700
What are you doing?

618
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,560
Are you in a hurry to reincarnate?

619
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,020
Child bride?

620
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,260
A beauty brings misfortune.

621
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,070
Beauty is overstated,

622
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,510
but misfortune is true.

623
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,020
I'm not at home.

624
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't know if she can handle it herself.

625
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,110
I'm leaving.

626
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,800
See you next semester.

627
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,140
Okay.

628
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,140
Bye.

629
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,800
Execuse me.

630
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,420
Where is Master going?

631
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Where is he going?

632
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,020
Come here, Sha.

633
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,340
Master was taken away by a demon.

634
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,500
Taken away?

635
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,750
[Yidong City]

636
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,460
So how's your application?

637
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Just so so.

638
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,740
What is so so?

639
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,900
Well,

640
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,860
my dad didn't agree.

641
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,820
Didn't agree.

642
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,740
Have you argued with him?

643
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,140
Didn't you apply for Yunhai University?

644
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,940
Why are you yelling suddenly?

645
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,420
Did you apply for other universities in Yunhai City?

646
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
Even if it’s not Yunhai University,

647
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,220
you could apply for another college there.

648
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,900
Why do you insist

649
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,360
on letting me go to Yunhai?

650
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,260
Because...

651
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,430
Because I want to see you every day.

652
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,310
Didn't we used to see each other every day?

653
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,300
Because we used to see each other every day,

654
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,900
I've already taken your company

655
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,260
for granted.

656
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,180
The past dozen years

657
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,220
have been wasted by us.

658
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,230
I want to cherish every moment from now on.

659
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,180
Rabbit.

660
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,520
Do you understand what I mean?

661
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,460
You're really weird.

662
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,740
To avoid me in high school,

663
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,420
you skipped a grade.

664
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,280
Now you want me to go to the same university with you.

665
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,620
Didn't you say we were gonna be together?

666
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,500
Even if we're not in the same university,

667
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
we can still meet during festivals.

668
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,140
Why festivals?

669
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,010
What if I say

670
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,340
I want to see you every day?

671
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,010
You...

672
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,290
I can't swim.

673
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,900
You...

674
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,660
You...

675
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,500
The water is shallow.

676
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,580
You can stand up.

677
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,980
You know this place too?

678
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,440
This place is really good.

679
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,180
What do you want to eat?

680
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,940
Help yourself. My treat.

681
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,580
Thank you so much.

682
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,540
The tiramisu is yummy.

683
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,700
The Dark Forest Cake looks good too.

684
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,940
Which one do you want?

685
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,350
You can order them both.

686
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,060
Both.

687
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,780
This is for you.

688
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
How do you know today is my birthday?

689
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,700
Isn't your birthday over?

690
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,140
June 20.

691
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Today is my lunar birthday.

692
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,340
How do you know that?

693
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,660
Let me see.

694
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,140
You give me a ball.

695
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,780
What do you mean?

696
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
This is the graduation gift for you.

697
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,660
I see.

698
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,580
You mean

699
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,500
although Yunhai and Qingbei are far away,

700
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,780
but as the earth is a ball,

701
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
we will finally meet again someday.

702
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,780
Yes.

703
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,500
One of my other friends

704
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,580
said that too.

705
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,700
I think it's so romantic.

706
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,010
Jia Siwen,

707
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,660
you're so thoughtful.

708
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Although I didn't get admitted by Sun Yat-Sen University,

709
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,540
but Yunhai is also good.

710
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,200
I can be together with Xiao Tu.

711
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,620
You don't need to comfort me.

712
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,900
I'm not sad at all.

713
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,300
This ball is really cute.

714
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,540
Thank you.

715
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,470
I like it so much.

716
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,380
Xiao.

717
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,900
Congratulations.

718
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Congratulations.

719
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,380
Congratulations. Why do you bring me gifts?

720
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,900
Just bring your mouth is fine.

721
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,260
Don't say that.

722
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,580
Rabbit is the prospective journalism student at Yunhai University.

723
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,540
We must celebrate it.

724
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,860
To be admitted.

725
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,060
To be admitted.

726
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,050
The admission letter hasn't arrived yet.

727
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,500
What's the difference?

728
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,660
It's already released online.

729
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,250
Who dares not to admit our Little Rabbit?

730
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,900
Exactly.

731
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,860
Xiao,

732
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Wenhui said

733
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,420
she wanted to hold a roadside banquet

734
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
in our community,

735
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,020
but I think

736
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,480
this is too ostentatious.

737
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,940
Too ostentatious.

738
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,140
There are many candidates in the community.

739
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,020
If you hold a roadside banquet,

740
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,460
won't you make a fool of yourself?

741
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,580
Change your shoes.

742
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,500
Okay.

743
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,860
Godfather, godmother.

744
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,920
Where is Ling Chao?

745
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,740
He caught a cold. I didn't ask him to come.

746
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,270
He didn't want to infect us.

747
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,940
Hasn't he had a cold for a while?

748
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,700
Exactly.

749
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,460
It's summer now.

750
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,060
How can he catch a cold?

751
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,420
But he's getting better.

752
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,620
At the end of a cold,

753
