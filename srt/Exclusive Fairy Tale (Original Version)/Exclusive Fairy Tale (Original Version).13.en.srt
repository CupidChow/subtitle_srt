194
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,470
Are there any pretty girls?

195
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,100
Except Xia Mo,

196
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,420
there is also a girl who learns dancing.

197
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,940
She's pretty too.

198
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,140
The other two...

199
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,980
are cute.

200
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,100
It's really hard for you

201
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,820
to go one on four.

202
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,220
As your brother, I can't bear it.

203
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,180
That's right.

204
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,700
I'll go with you.

205
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
But there's another problem.

206
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,340
Just the two of us

207
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,900
is not enough.

208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,860
You know

209
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,860
master never attends this kind of gathering.

210
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,700
No problem.

211
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,710
About master...

212
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,140
I'll take care of him.

213
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,380
Hello, Jia Siwen.

214
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,900
Have you arrived?

215
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,940
Yes, I am.

216

218
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,860
Well...

219
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,060
Forget it.

220
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,100
Let me video call you.

221
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes, video call.

222
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,820
Hi, Jia Siwen.

223
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,610
Surprised?

224
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,220
Jiang Juanjuan and I share the same dorm room.

225
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,280
There's also Xu...

226
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,220
Never mind, she's not important.

227
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,340

Are there many handsome guys?

Yes, after this round,

there's no room for me in this house, right?

We agreed to go to school together.

Why are you here alone?

Are you still angry?

00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,460
was thought to be...

386
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,220
Wukong!

387
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,680
That's enough.

388
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,460
Yes, master.

389
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,820
I'll make it short.

390
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,420
So my master was called

391
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,020
the Tang Monk.

392
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,420
My surname is Sun and his surname is Zhu.

393
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,140
We're a group of master and his disciples.

394
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,860
But this story

395
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,980
has nothing to do with Guan Jiu.

396
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,180
It doesn't matter.

397
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,220
Anyway, Sha thinks

398
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,940
other than reading,

399
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,860
everything else has nothing to do with him.

400
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,650
Right, Sha?

401
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,220
Read, Sha.

402
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,260
Are you ready to order?

403
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,220
I want a pan-fried steak

404
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,100
and a braised beef brisket.

405
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,660
Okay.

406
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,860
No cilantro, please.

407
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,660
And a bottle of coconut juice.

408
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,140
Okay, what would you like?

409
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,620
Junior,

410
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,780
it's such a happy day.

411
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,980
How can you drink coconut juice?

412
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,660
Waiter, a dozen of beer, please.

413
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,250
Okay.

414
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,830
Give her coconut juice.

415
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,590
If you want to drink,

416
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,870
I'll drink with you.

417
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,740
Master,

418
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,930
you care so much about her.

419
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,260
If madam knew,

420
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,020
won't she get jealous?

421
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,930
Ling Chao, do you have a girlfriend?

422
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,740
No, no.

423
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,420
He is kidding.

424
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm not joking.

425
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,520
What are you doing?

426
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,500
Why are you touching me like this?

427
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,380
I'm not joking.

428
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
I'm telling the truth.

429
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
You don't know.

430
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,180
Master actually has a child bride.

431
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,420
I didn't expect that after such a long time,

432
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,860
the gossip about the child bride

433
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,500
has spread to Yunhai.

434
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,580
Big brother,

435
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,700
do you know

436
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,220
who is the legendary

437
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,060
child bride?

438
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,660
I really don't know.

439
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,100
But I heard them talking on the phone.

440
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
That woman

441
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,370
was so fierce.

442
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,650
Oh, no.

443
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,660
So fierce?

444
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,300
This woman

445
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,900
is fierce.

446
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,100
Amazing. That's something.

447
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,980
Amazing.

448
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,980
[Welcome]

449
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,660
Let me repeat the rules.

450
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Each of us count in turn.

451
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,580
When the number is 7 and multiples of 7,

452
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,620
you need to tap the table and shout "pass."

453
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,420
The loser will perform a talent.

454
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,340
Let's change the punishment.

455
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,820
Okay.

456
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,980
Let's do dare.

457
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,400
Okay? This is good.

458
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,540
Sure.

459
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,070
Starting from me this time.

460
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,780
219.

461
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,860
220.

462
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,740
Pass.

463
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
I tapped the table.

464
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,700
What does 221 have to do with 7?

465
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,020
Right?

466
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,140
Let me show you taekwondo.

467
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,140
No.

468
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,060
Forget it.

469
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
Don't ruin the shop.

470
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,660
Sit down.

471
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay, go ahead.

472
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,710
What do you want me to do?

473
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,300
I suggest...

474
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,100
I agree.

475
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,540
I haven't said it yet.

476
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
What do you think?

477
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,220
Find a man

478
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,500
and get his contact information.

479
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,420
Good idea.

480
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,819
Well, besides our table.

481
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,140
I think it's okay.

482
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,700
It might even develop into something more.

483
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,420
After all, our top priority in university

484
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,099
-is to have a...
-To study...

485
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,619
A campus love!

486
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,140
A campus love.

487
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,980
It's inappropriate... we don't know each other.

488
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,020
Does it help if you know each other?

489
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
If you don't know him, you can try to know him.

490
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,140
Right?

491
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,290
Yes, yes, yes.

492
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,460
Okay?

493
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,340
Fine.

494
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Pick one.

495
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,490
That one. That one.

496
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,620
I think that's good.

497
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,180
Okay?

498
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,100
That one is really good.

499
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,820
Go!

500
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,860
Hurry up.

501
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,660
Go.

502
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,380
Xiao Tu. Xiao Tu. Xiao Tu.

503
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,740
Hello.

504
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,940
Can I add you on WeChat?

505
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,140
He is very popular.

506
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,780
Wait.

507
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,310
You can go after she's done.

508
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,980
Sorry, it's not convenient.

509
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,780
Okay.

510
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,380
Hurry up.

511
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,500
Your turn.

512
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,380
Go away.

513
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,030
This is social suicide.

514
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,820
Did you lose a game?

515
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,460
It's okay.

516
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,540
Tell me.

517
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,350
What do you want me to do?

518
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,260
Master,

519
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,860
this is vinegar.

520
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,920
Is there a problem?

521
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,480
This is what I'm drinking.

522
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,780
Phone.

523
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,100
Here.

524
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,420
It's out of battery.

525
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,900
It's okay.

526
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,140
Here.

527
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,060
Oh my god.

528
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,140
Master, are you alright?

529
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,460
Master.

530
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,220
Are you okay? What's wrong?

531
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,180
He was fine just now.

532
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,940
I don't know. I think he's drunk.

533
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,980
He needs some rest.

534
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,460
What are you waiting for? Send him back.

535
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,060
Go back.

536
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,940
Sha, let me do it.

537
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,540
Let's go.

538
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,380
[We are open]

539
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,860
Slow down.

540
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,610
Let's go.

541
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,240
[Welcome]

542
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,220
What happened?

543
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,760
What's wrong, Sha?

544
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,670
I think I ate something bad.

545
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,660
You...

546
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,560
Come with me to the infirmary.

547
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,170
Let's go. Wait.

548
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,660
Xiao Tu.

549
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,740
I'll leave master to you.

550
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,980
What are you talking about?

551
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,780
How could you leave master

552
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,060
to a weak girl?

553
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,700
Don't worry.

554
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,580
Leave master to me. Hurry up.

555
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,420
Big brother,

556
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,570
you have to send the other juniors back to the dorm.

557
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,380
Okay.

558
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,780
Juniors,

559
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,060
I'll send you back.

560
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,140
It's getting late.

561
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,940
It's not safe on the way.

562
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,060
Let me see you off.

563
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,460
Let's go.

564
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,590
How dangerous is it?

565
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,700
Are there any ghosts?

566
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,860
Can you tell us?

567
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
This, this, this.

568
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,770
Don't drink if you can't.

569
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,020
Don't throw me into the lake.

570
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,180
Again?

571
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,810
You can't leave me alone.

572
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,580
Okay.

573
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,260
I won't.

574
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,330
I won't.

575
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,020
I won't.
