00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,780
[Episode 5]

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Mr. Fang.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,680
The alcohol

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,200
made you a little bolder.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Mr. Xue.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,480
Are you okay?

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm fine.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,680
Mr. Xue, I didn't mean it.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,440
How about I drink for her?

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,560
No need.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,480
Mr. Xue.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,000
For the sake of my aunt,

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,160
spare me, please.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,480
Are you drunk, Mr. Fang?

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,560
Why are you talking nonsense?

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,200
Get him out of here.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,640
Mr. Xue.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,840
Please spare me.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Mr. Xue.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,480
Thank you for your help.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,680
You're welcome.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
How dare he mess with my family.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,760
He has a death wish, I see.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,280
What do you say, Dongfeng?

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,920
She's mine.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
Brother.

29
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,520
He is not an ordinary man.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,400
Look at his watch.

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,320
It's the only one in Jiang City.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,520
You better be careful.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Mr. Xue.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
Is it him?

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,080
So,

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,880
he helped you,

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
and you got hooked?

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,440
Yes.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,440
Who doesn't like a gentleman?

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
You just can't wait to throw yourself

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,200
at any man, can you?

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
No, I can't.

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Not for a single moment.

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Put it on.

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,080
Ji Lianyun.

46
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,640
Why on earth would you do this?

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
Didn't you say you would leave me alone?

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Fine.

49
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
My good brother.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
After so many years at the front,

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
you haven't changed at all.

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
But you've changed a lot.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really?

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,080
I thought you would not welcome me home,

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
just like before.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
What makes you say that?

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Congrats, Governor Xue.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, right.

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Well,

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,240
about Ms. Yun Lian,

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,040
do you have feelings for her?

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
So, I guessed wrong.

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,320
But I'm kinda interested in her.

65
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,880
Tsk.

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,440
I feel the tension between you two.

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,520
Fighting over a woman?

68
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Mrs. Fang Fei.

69
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,200
Dongfeng.

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
I have to warn you.

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
That woman

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,840
is filthy.

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,480
Mrs. Fang Fei.

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,360
Mind your own business.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,000
You men can't see it,

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
but we women can.

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,200
She's a lowly wench.

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,320
Never treat her like a treasure.

79
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,040
We're family.

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,400
There's no need to make a scene here.

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,360
Stop causing me trouble.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,280
So, Fang Fei has an affair
with Xue Zhihai.

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,120
No wonder Old Master Xue was provoked
to death.

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,520
Pin.

85
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,120
Where are you now?

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
Sold.

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,960
Congrats to Mr. Yang.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,960
Have you seen Pin?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,680
- No.
- No.

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
Thank you, Mr. Yang,

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,760
for your support of this auction.

92
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,800
We've raised 200,000 for the army...

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Have you seen Pin?

94
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,800
for our newly appointed Governor Xue.

95
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
Next, the last item is up

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
for auction.

97
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
Let's see

98
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,960
if you can give more financial support.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Isn't this from the Ji family?

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,880
You mean the traitor?

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,320
This painting is worth at least 500,000.

102
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Yes.

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
I guess you all know this item.

104
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,200
There's a story about it.

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,560
The donor

106
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
is Ms. Fang Fei,

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,080
a strong patriot.

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,040
To guard Jiang City,
she reported Ji Xianwen

109
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
and his family out of justice.

110
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,120
Without Fang Fei,

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,200
many more citizens
would have been harmed

112
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,880
by the opium they smuggled.

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,200
Thank you, Ms. Fang Fei.

114
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Yun.

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,360
When you grow up,

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,520
I will send you to study abroad.

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
You can introduce Chinese culture

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,040
to people from other countries.

119
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Ready for execution.

120
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
So, they can understand us better.

121
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,720
Was it you who reported the Ji family
for smuggling opium?

122
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
Yes.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,200
Although I'm Mrs. Ji's adopted sister,

124
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
I have to make the right choice

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
for my country and the people.

126
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,440
Miss.

127
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,920
Your parents are dead.

128
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,200
Before they were caught, they asked me

129
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,880
to tell you not to return home.

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
Fire.

131
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
Be good.

132
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
Don't move.

133
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,400
Someone asked me to do this.

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,520
Otherwise, who would dare
to offend Governor Xue?

135
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,960
You won't suffer any loss.

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,640
And you'll know how happy it'll be.

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,240
Governor.

138
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,200
Someone just said

139
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,080
a man took Ms. Yun upstairs.

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
You can go back to the ceremony.

141
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
We'll look for her.

142
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Shut up.

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
Go find her.

144
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes.

145
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,160
Is it working?

146
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,480
Do you need my help?

147
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,600
Relax.

148
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
I'll be very gentle.

149
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,720
Governor, I guess she's on this floor.

150
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,880
