00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Dongfeng.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Mrs. Fang Fei.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,600
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
I want to see Changlin.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,840
How did you know I have him?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,040
It doesn't matter, anyway.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,120
I know he's in the hospital
under your men's watch.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,040
Dongfeng.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,160
What on earth did he do?

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,760
Why treat him like this?

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,600
Mrs. Fang Fei.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,400
Fang Changlin knows something

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,480
that involves some important people.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,640
So

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,680
no one is allowed to visit him.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,440
Dongfeng.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,560
I've been worried about him.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,360
And now he's finally awake.

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,800
Please let me see him.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,280
- Fang Changlin is awake?
- We're all family.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Please.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Stop!

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,560
Why are you here?

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,800
I'm worried about Fang Changlin.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,240
So, I came to check on him.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
I failed to protect him.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,120
Someone killed him.

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
Your men have been guarding him.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,120
Has he never regained consciousness?

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
We'll find another lead.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680
Tomorrow, I'll take you to a place.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,040
One.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,240
Two.

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,520
Attention!

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,200
About face!

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
March!

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
Why do you take me here?

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,200
Are you angry about Qin Mengmeng?

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,760
I won't marry her

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
or any other woman.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
I promise.

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Alright?

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,480
Open it.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,720
I've been preparing this for long.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,800
As for Qin Mengmeng,

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
I'll figure something out.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
I can't always be there to protect you.

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,480
You need to learn to protect yourself.

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
Come on, give it a try.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,240
So,

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,720
isn't it great?

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Governor Xue.

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,560
Why did you lie to me?

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
Don't mess with it.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
It's dangerous.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
Do you think I'm kidding?

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,320
Nan.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
Step back.

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,120
Put your gun away.

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Get lost!

64
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,760
Why?

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
Why?

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,200
I want to know

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,480
how you face me every day without guilt.

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,480
Make it clear.

69
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Okay.

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,760
You wanted to protect Fang Changlin,

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,240
but he was killed under your guard.

72
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,400
He woke up,

73
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,760
but you lied to me about it.

74
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
What do you mean?

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,240
You have been protecting the reputation

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,080
of your family.

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,880
Isn't that true?

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
You look sneaky.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,040
I suspect you're plotting
against my family.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,400
That's why you were followed.

81
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Do you think

82
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm in league with Fang Fei

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,560
and the others?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,040
You never lied to me?

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
Yes.

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,240
I've lied before.

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,240
Put the gun down.

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,840
Let me explain.

89
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
