4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,120
Yun Lian.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,880
Zhihai wants to take you out.

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,800
You left in such a hurry last time.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,520
We didn't enjoy ourselves.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,120
Let me treat you again.

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,280
Some other day. I'm feeling unwell.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,560
Yun Lian.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Zhihai is my grandson too.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,400
It's good for you to go with him.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,520
Madam.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,880
If you allow him to take me away,

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,000
how will you explain it to Dongfeng?

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,280
Dongfeng will understand

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm doing it all for him.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,960
Take her away.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,520
We're leaving, Grandma.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
Okay.

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Xue Zhihai.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,880
I didn't make myself clear before.

23
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,120
Today, let's set things straight.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,360
If you lay a finger on her again,

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
I will shoot you.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,320
Xue Dongfeng.

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,000
Come on, just for a woman?

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
All of you.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,200
Especially you, Xue Zhihai.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,120
She's the one I'm going to marry.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
She's my fiancée.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,080
If any of you touch her again,

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,760
I will shoot you in the head.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Nan.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
Give out my order.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,480
From now on,
this guy is not allowed to get in.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
I will shoot

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,040
whoever lets him in.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,960
Yes.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Are you okay?

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm fine.

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,400
Didn't you go out for work?

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
Why did you come back?

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,880
After I went out,

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,520
I grew worried about you.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
He came as I expected.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Did he frighten you?

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,120
You scared me.

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,360
What is

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,360
all that nonsense?

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,840
What nonsense?

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
She's the one I'm going to marry.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
She's my fiancée.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,360
I was serious.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,240
You are now my fiancée.

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
You never asked for my opinion.

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
I haven't said yes.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
It doesn't matter.

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
You don't have to say yes.

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
So, you'll force me, huh?

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
They fear your gun, but I don't.

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,000
Why?

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,440
Your skull is hard enough

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,440
to be bulletproof?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,360
Madam Xue.

66
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,000
Mengmeng.

67
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,080
You just returned.

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
Why don't you get some rest
before coming over?

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,800
That's because I'm anxious to see you.

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
You don't fool me.

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,440
Come in.

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Come.

73
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,680
Madam.

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,560
How come Dongfeng hasn't come back yet?

75
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
Will I not see him today?

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,400
You'll see him.

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,120
Mengmeng, have some water.

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
Hey.

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,560
Come here.

80
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
Are you Mrs. Fang Fei?

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
No.

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Then who are you?

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,960
You don't look like a maid.

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,400
I am...

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,360
She's the concubine
Dongfeng's father should have taken.

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
I pity her.

87
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
So, I took her in.

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,680
You can treat her like a maid.

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,000
You are indeed young and beautiful.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,200
What's your name?

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Yun Lian.

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
May I ask who you are?

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
I'm Qin Mengmeng, the only daughter

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,680
of the Commander-in-Chief
of the Tri-City Coalition,

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Xue Dongfeng's fiancée.

96
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,600
Madam.

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,840
Her name sounds familiar.

98
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
She used to be a singer, right?

99
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,520
Yes.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
Madam.

101
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,360
You're so kind-hearted

102
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,520
to take her in.

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,840
I'll feel anxious

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,240
about keeping a beautiful girl here.

105
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Yun Lian.

106
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
Don't wear this dress again.

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
Why can't I?

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,080
It's ostentatious for a widow like you

109
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,760
to dress like this.

110
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,800
It's none of your business.

111
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
Go ahead and ask around about me.

112
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Is there anything
I can't do in Three Cities?

113
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,400
Madam.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
You should discipline your maid well.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,840
I'll skip the tea.

116
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Bye.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Mengmeng.

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,160
Mengmeng.

119
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,840
Mengmeng.
