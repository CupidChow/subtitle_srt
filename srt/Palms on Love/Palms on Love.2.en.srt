4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,480
Ma'am, look.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,840
Yun Lian is such a wench.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,400
She's hooked up
with someone else already.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,480
Xue Dongfeng.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
Ji Lianyun.

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,080
You know what?

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,640
I risked my life

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,760
at the front.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,640
I've been at death's door many times,

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,400
but I've survived.

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,200
Do you know how?

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,280
I don't want to know.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Whenever I was dying,

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
I would think

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,280
I must

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,880
see you live in terrible pain

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,360
before I die.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,760
Well, I'm doing pretty well now.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,320
Really?

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,280
Not anymore.

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
Now,

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,760
you have two choices.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,960
Either

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,520
I kill you

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
or...

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,440
You wretch, Xue Dongfeng.

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Kill me if you want.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,360
Otherwise, stay away from me.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
You'd better forget the past.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Be good.

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll buy it.

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,400
Stop.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Stop!

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,600
I didn't expect to see you here.

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,680
There's no time to explain to you now

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,480
because I have
something more important to do.

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
Follow that witch.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,640
Yes, Mrs. Fang Fei.

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,200
You're here.

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
This is what you wanted.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,200
Old Master Xue is useless.

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
He died when he caught her in the act.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,440
Now Fang Fei is relieved.

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
Luckily, I have this photo.

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,880
Once the Xue family sees it,

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,960
they will destroy Fang Fei.

54
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,440
It's too good for her.

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
So, what do you want?

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,800
I want her to lose everything,

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
including her hidden lover.

58
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,960
Mr. Xue.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,600
Please spare me.

60
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,760
It's Mrs. Fang Fei.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
She asked me to spy...

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,640
No,

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,480
to watch Mrs. Yun Lian.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
So, what did you see?

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,410
I saw nothing.

66
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,440
Nothing.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Seriously.

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,960
Spare me.

69
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
I warn you.

70
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,320
If you say anything,

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
you know what happens.

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Get lost.

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,560
Okay.

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
Is it appropriate for you to do this

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
for a man who's not your husband

76
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,520
in the middle of the night?

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
It doesn't matter.

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,600
I can do the same for anyone injured.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
Tell me.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,280
Why did Fang Fei send someone
to follow you?

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,320
You should ask her,

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
not me.

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Clever.

84
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,680
You look sneaky.

85
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,920
I suspect you're plotting
against my family.

86
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,320
You...

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
That's why you're followed.

88
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,360
Give it back.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Look at this.

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,400
What a lovely couple.

91
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,360
You can't get over my father, can you?

92
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,880
Enough, Xue Dongfeng.

93
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm about to be the new military governor
of Jiang City.

94

How dare you

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,960
say my full name?

96
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
Congratulations, then.

97
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
What is this, Governor Xue?

98
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Have you regretted

99
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,080
leaving me?

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,560
That's enough to last you a while.

101
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,240
Take it.

102
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,360
And leave.

103
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,280
I don't want to see you again.

104
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,880
It is not enough.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,760
I have never liked you.

106
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,120
You're an overseas student,
so I thought you were rich.

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,560
Turns out you're so poor.
