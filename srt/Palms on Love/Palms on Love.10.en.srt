[Episode 10]

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,760
What happened to you?

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,920
Who did this to you?

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
Too cruel.

7
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,680
I am just a maid now.

8
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,320
I can't help.

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,400
But they are too cruel.

10
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,720
You better tell Mrs. Fang Fei about it.

11
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
If they beat you again,

12
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
you'll suffer more.

13
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,120
Thank you.

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
I used to hurt you,

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
but you still try to help.

16
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,560
You do nothing wrong.

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
We are both a nobody.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
You can't help it.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
Take care of yourself.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,040
What's wrong with you?

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,520
You looked at that bastard more gently

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
than you looked at me.

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,280
Xue Dongfeng, can you please stop it?

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,440
You know I was just acting.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Are you crazy?

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,640
My hand is injured too.

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,200
Can you look at me that way?

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,280
I can't do that.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
They are my enemies.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,520
To achieve my goals,

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,480
I can cajole

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,200
and deceive them.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,880
But...

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,800
You are different.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,080
I can't fool you.

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,240
Auntie.

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720
Spit it out.

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,960
What is it?

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
Auntie.

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
Spit it out.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Auntie.

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,160
Can you give me 100,000?

43
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,160
You rascal.

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,600
No wonder you visit me.

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,040
Turns out you ask me for money.

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,640
Auntie.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,800
I will pay you back.

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,840
Is that okay?

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,680
No.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,920
No way.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
Auntie.

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
Auntie.

53
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,520
Can't you take some money
from the Xue family?

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
Just like before.

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,960
Do it secretly.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,880
You rascal.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,040
You haven't learned any lesson,
have you?

58
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Sooner or later, gambling will kill you.

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,600
Fang Changlin, let me tell you.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You'd better restrain yourself lately.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,920
Otherwise, I can't save you.

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
It's all about money.

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
All you can do is ask me for money.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,360
Figure it out yourself.

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,600
From now on,

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
don't come to me for money again.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,120
Do you understand?

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,320
Auntie.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
What do you mean?

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Why are you living a rich life

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,960
while I'm poor, chased by creditors?

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm telling you. I have no money.

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,680
Anyway, I won't give it to you.

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,600
It's 100,000.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,480
What do you think I am?

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,800
A money maker?

77
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,920
Well,

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
I warn you.

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Pin has just died.

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
If people know what we've done,

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,560
neither of us will escape.

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
It's just 100,000.

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,560
Don't try to threaten me.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,520
Besides,

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,880
I didn't kill her.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
Because of you...

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Shut up.

88
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
That's the truth.

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,400
I did it all for you.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
I do what you told me.

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
If you hadn't asked me to drug Yun Lian,

92
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,840
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,760
It's all your fault.

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Half of the money taken
from the Xue family

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,120
should have been mine.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,720
You jerk.

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
I'm telling you.

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,240
I must get the money in three days.

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,360
Otherwise, I don't know
what I might say.

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,320
You rascal.

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
How dare you threaten me.

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
Give me the money,

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
and we're finished

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
and even.

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,720
Otherwise, who knows what I will do?

106
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,560
I knew it.

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,280
Governor.

108
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,280
What's going on?

109
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,120
Hurry up.

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,760
Go.

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,520
Hurry up.

112
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Give me the money in three days.

113
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,200
Go.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Mrs. Fang Fei.

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
Have you seen enough?

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,480
Dongfeng.

117
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Mrs. Fang Fei.

119
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,960
Haven't you seen it?

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,160
Well,

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
when did you come here?

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,320
Do I need

123
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,920
to report to you

124
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
about that?

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,360
Come on.

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
I am your family.

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,080
I care about your personal life.

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
What's wrong with that?

129
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
Do you?

130
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Of course.

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,760
Dongfeng.

132
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,120
You're a Governor.

133
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,480
You must treat this girl well.

134
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,520
Come on.

135
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,680
Let me have a look at her.

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,120
No need.

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,320
Don't bother.

138
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,600
You...

139
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
You dog.

140
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,480
Have you prepared the money for me?

141
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,120
Are you going to give him the money?

142
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,880
Anyway, this is the last time.

143
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,480
Fang Changlin can't live.

144
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
What do you mean?

145
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,560
He's my nephew,

146
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,800
the only boy in my family.

147
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,160
He knows too much about us.

148
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,280
And he has a loose tongue.

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,240
I've been wanting to kill him.

150
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Zhihai.

151
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm begging you.

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,880
Give him one last chance, please.

153
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,640
I'll discipline him well.

154
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,920
You're the best.

155
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,880
Get me a cup of wine.

156
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,320
Why are you avoiding me?

157
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
I am not.

158
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,840
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

159
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
It's getting late.

160
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000
And I'm very tired.

161
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,760
I helped you again today.

162
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,040
How are you going to thank me?

163
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,080
I didn't ask for your help.

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,520
Besides, your man almost blew my cover.

165
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,880
Whether I helped or not

166
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
is up to me.

167
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,480
You just...

168
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,200
I've repaid you that way.

169
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
That's not enough.

170
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
Tell me what I can do

171
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,760
to pay for your help.

172
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,920
If you don't like the posture,

173
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,600
we can do it your way.

174
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,640
Do you like me being innocent

175
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
or seductive?

176
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,960
To get to where I am today,

177
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,040
I've spent several years
in the dance hall.

178
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,160
I've seen all sorts of men.

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,720
If you see me as an easy prey,

180
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,320
aren't you underestimating me too much?

181
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
Aren't you tired?

182
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,040
Go to your room.

183
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
What's her story?

184
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,560
Ever since she appeared,
a lot has happened.

185
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,160
She's always against me.

186
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,080
It's not good.

187
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
I have to ask Zhihai
to check her background.
