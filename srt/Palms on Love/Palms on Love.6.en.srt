Governor.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,000
Someone just said

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,880
a man took Ms. Yun upstairs.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,320
You can go back to the ceremony.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,200
We'll look for her.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,120
Shut up.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,200
Go find her.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,080
Yes.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,800
Relax.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,040
I will be very gentle.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,960
Governor, I guess she's on this floor.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,240
Split up and search.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,440
Shoot.

Are you alright?

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Stay away from me.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
But you don't look well.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
I'm fine.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,880
It's none of your business.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,080
Alright.

No, I don't want to know.

Ji Lianyun, calm down.

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
Since you could leave him before,

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,800
you can do it now.

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,520
Don't forget.

You think killing me

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,840
can cover up your dirty deeds forever?

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
Give up.

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,040
Be a good girl

93
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,400
and give me the film.

94
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Speak!

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,720
Where is the film?

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,320
I have many films about you.

97
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,360
I will never give them to you.

98
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll let everyone know your dirty deeds.

99
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Let's see if you'll ever get the chance
to tell them.

100
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,760
I warn you.

101
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
My patience is running out.

102
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,600
Speak!

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,480
Where is the film?

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,960
Hand it over,

105
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
and I'll kill you fast.

106
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,960
So, no one admits, huh?

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
Well, you asked for it.

108

We don't know anything.

111
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,440
We don't know
who kidnapped Ms. Yun Lian.

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,920
Two.

113
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,200
Please spare us.

114
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
One.

118
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,120
Mr. Xue.

119
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
Something is up.

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,160
Got it. You may go.

121
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,800
Yes.

122
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
Get Changlin here

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,800
