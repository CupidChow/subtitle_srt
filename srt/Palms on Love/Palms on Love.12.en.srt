00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,780
[Episode 12]

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,240
What was that for?

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,360
These flowers are beautiful.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,600
So what?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,240
Will you take them back,

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,040
water them,

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,000
and watch them?

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,360
Flowers are innocent.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,120
They're not.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,200
Why?

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,320
Because I said so.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,320
No particular reason.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,240
Why are you laughing?

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,800
Can't I laugh?

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,960
What?

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,600
Just a hint of jealousy.

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,680
You really love flowers.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,800
I must buy you some next time.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,360
You don't have to.

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,960
Watching flowers

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
isn't fun.

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,960
Mr. Xue.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
How come you're back home?

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,440
I got some pastries for Grandma.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
But she's away.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,640
By the way,

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,520
I also got some for you.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
Have a taste.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,920
Perhaps,

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,800
you might be interested.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,440
I hired this cook at a great cost.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,440
Previously,

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
he worked as a pastry cook
for the traitor, Ji Xianwen.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
He's good

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,880
at making pastries at home and abroad.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
That was rude of me.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,320
I have great respect for Mr. Ji.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,240
I think he's a gentleman
with a good taste.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,800
It's a pity

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,240
that his collections
have been scattered all over.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,520
I bought the painting

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,960
at the auction.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,440
That painting

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,320
is very beautiful.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,880
If you like it,

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
I'll give it to you.

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,000
Zhihai.

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
She knows nothing about paintings.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
You better keep it.

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,640
Dongfeng.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,120
I can tell

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
Ms. Yun knows
how to appreciate that painting.

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,120
She also likes it
from the bottom of her heart.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
Is that so?

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,120
How about this?

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,520
Ms. Yun, may I

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,440
have dinner and a drink

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,640
with you?

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,800
You wish.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,080
Dongfeng.

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,640
You are too overbearing.

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,560
Let Ms. Yun decide.

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,560
Okay.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,240
See you then.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
Tomorrow night,

69
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,040
I'll pick you up.

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,840
Why do you have to do that?

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,160
That's my father's favorite collection.

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,360
I want to get it back.

73
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,120
Xue Zhihai is up to no good.

74
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,720
Don't you think it's suspicious?

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
Even so, I will go.

76
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,200
No way.

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Could you please
stop making decisions for me?

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,960
I want to take back my stuff.

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,480
Even if it's dangerous,

80
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll still go.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
We'll see if you can leave here today.

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,760
Why, you'll handcuff me again?

83
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
That's what you think of me?

84
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,520
That's what you did to me.

85
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,600
Fine.

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
Do what you want.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,160
What are they here for?

88
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Why is Bei here?

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Ms. Yun.

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,880
Mr. Xue got you custom-made dresses.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,080
Pick your favorite one

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
and wear it to the dinner.

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
Please thank Mr. Xue for me.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,880
Okay.

95
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
Mrs. Fang Fei is here.

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Will they fight again?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mrs. Fang Fei.

98
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,720
What are you doing?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
You're so shameless,

100
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,600
flirting with different men.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Are you showing off?

102
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,280
Mrs. Fang Fei.

103
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
Mr. Xue did this

104
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
out of pity because I have no one.

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880
He just gave me some gifts.

106
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,040
Why are you so angry?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
I remember now.

108
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
I heard your allowance was deducted.

109
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,680
I suppose you're tight.

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
No money for new dresses, right?

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,040
How about this?

112
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll pick out a few dresses first,

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,480
and you can pick from the rest.

114
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,520
Mr. Xue is really generous.

115
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
You have lived here for so many years.

116
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,960
Has he ever been so generous to you?

117
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,920
You dirty bumpkin.

118
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,920
Just some cheap dresses.

119
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
Don't be smug.

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,840
Seems like you even never
received any cheap gifts.

121
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Yun Lian.

122
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,040
Some people are doomed

123
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
to live a bad life.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
They don't deserve

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,440
to have any good stuff.

126
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
But they're luckier

127
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,280
than those

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,520
who get nothing in the end.

129
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Just you wait.

130
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,720
Why are you here?

131
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Perfect timing.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
I got new clothes.

133
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
How do I look?

134
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,800
Xue Zhihai, what's the meaning of this?

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Why are you crying?

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,960
Xue Zhihai, you've gone too far.

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,840
I...

138
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,840
You bought that wench so many clothes.

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,600
I got it.

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,880
You're also obsessed with her, right?

141
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
You scared me.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
I thought someone bullied you.

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,720
Don't be petty.

144
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
Drop the act.

145
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
She's about to die.

146
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,880
Why are you jealous of her?

147
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,840
What's wrong with you again?

148
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,680
I am giving you advice.

149
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,560
It's so tacky to wear

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,400
showy stuff.

151
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Indeed.

152
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
I look better without it.

153
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,200
This dress is ugly.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,920
Change it.

155
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,080
Which one should I wear?

156
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,400
This.

157
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,920
But it's not from him.

158
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
Yes.

159
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,720
I allow you to go,

160
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,560
but you can't wear the dress

161
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
and the jewelry he gave you.

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
He gave them to me as gifts.

163
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,080
I have to wear them.

164
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,080
Stop being emotional about it.

165
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,680
I'm not being emotional.

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,520
I just think it looks bad on you.

167
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,200
You will embarrass my family
if you wear it.

168
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,800
It's okay as long as he likes it.

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Nan.

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,800
Burn these things.

171
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,920
You and I

172
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,520
have very similar tastes.

173
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
This outfit is also my favorite.

174
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,320
Thanks for your gift.

175
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,240
Have a taste.

176
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,360
These were made
by the cook I mentioned to you.

177
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,160
I guess they suit your taste.

178
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
Well,

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm known as a playboy in Jiang City,

180
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,960
but I am not a ruffian.

181
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,400
No worries.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Are you willing to be with me?

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,440
Mr. Xue.

184
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
Don't forget who I am.

185
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,240
If you can stay with Xue Dongfeng,

186
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,920
why you can't be with me?

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,080
