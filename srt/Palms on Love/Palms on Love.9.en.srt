00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,120
What is she

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,920
up to?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,480
Interesting.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,480
What?

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,920
Are you also hooked on her?

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't be petty.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
We're home.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,360
Don't get handsy.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,200
So, this is your plan?

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,920
You get close to him

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,280
and seduce him.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,240
Don't you have any other way?

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,120
Must you demean yourself?

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,960
Yes.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,920
I have to.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,200
I want to shoot him dead.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,960
But Fang Changlin is merely a pawn.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,520
Tell me.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,680
What are you up to?

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
Fang Fei is cautious,

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,040
while Fang Changlin is simple-minded.

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,720
When there's a rift
between the two of them,

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,520
I will get my chance.

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
So,

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,360
make them turn on each other?

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,600
As I know,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Fang Changlin owes money at the casino.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
I know

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
you have a connection there.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,320
I can help you.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
