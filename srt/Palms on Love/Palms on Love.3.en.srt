00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,780
[Episode 3]

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,840
Hey.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,800
Look who it is.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,840
Isn't this the jinx
who caused Master's death

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,320
and yet shamelessly stayed?

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,400
They're against each other already.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,960
Be quiet.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,000
They hate each other to the guts.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,840
Stop. Are you deaf?

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,880
What's going on?

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,240
She just slapped her.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,880
How dare you!

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,240
This

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,560
is the Xue Residence!

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Who do you think you are?

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,760
How dare you be so rude?

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,880
I can be ruder.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,800
You...

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,880
Do you want me to show you?

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,160
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Stop it.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,280
What's going on?

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,200
Look at you.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,240
Two shrews.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,440
Madam.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,760
Didn't you hear it?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
There are rumors

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
that she's a jinx.

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,960
She will get our family in trouble.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Master died because of her.

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,840
Besides,

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,720
I heard...

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
Go on.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Yes.

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,920
I heard

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,360
she was in Mr. Xue's room

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,400
last night.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,920
Madam, I wasn't.

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
Don't try to find excuses.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
Pan and I saw it.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Madam, I'm not lying.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640
We can ask Dongfeng

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,920
once he's back.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,120
Hmph.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,800
On the first-name basis already?

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,000
How dare you?

49
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,080
Ms. Zhang.

50
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,200
Right.

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,800
If my son hadn't married you,

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,640
he wouldn't have died.

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,240
And now,

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
you even want to seduce my grandson too?

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,800
Madam.

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,800
Master was...

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Madam.

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,920
Don't listen to her excuses.

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
She caused Master's death.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,880
Now she even tries to drag Mr. Xue down.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,840
She will ruin our family.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,520
No.

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,840
My poor Master.

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Give her a lesson.

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,400
Drive her out of my house.

66
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,370
Yes.

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
Get off of her.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,600
What are you doing?

69
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
I just saved you.

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,320
Is this how you repay me?

71
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm warning you.

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm your father's concubine.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
And I'm warning you.

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,520
You've been thrown out.

75
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm begging you.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
Please don't do this.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,440
Please.

78
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
Get out of here.

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,920
You want to watch me change clothes?

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
Pack your things,

81
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
and leave my house.

82
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,280
I must find a way to stay.

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,160
Can you let me stay for a while?

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm still injured.

85
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,200
And I have nowhere else to go.

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,320
Can I stay for a while?

87
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
I don't keep idlers.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm not an idler.

89
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,040
I can work.

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm not short of workers.

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,520
You just got back from the war.

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,880
You need a maid to take care of you.

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,160
One month.

94
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,720
Get healed,

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,480
and get lost.

96
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Okay.

97
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,880
You'll be inaugurated
as the military governor tonight.

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,280
If outsiders know

99
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,360
you keep your father's concubine

100
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,080
by your side as a maid,

101
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,040
what will they think?

102
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,920
If we don't say anything,

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,800
no one will know.

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,920
Besides, she's not exactly
my father's concubine.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
After all, you have driven her out.

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,760
And she and my father had no ceremony.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,520
Shut up!

108
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,440
Good job cleaning the car.

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Seems like you can do something.

110
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,280
No wonder you can be so brazen to stay.

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,600
My shoes are dirty.

112
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,480
Why don't you clean them for me?

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,200
What's wrong?

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,360
Are you unwilling?

115
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,080
You still think you're Mrs. Yun Lian?

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,480
You hear me?

117
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Clean my shoes for me.

118
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,440
Mr. Xue.

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,280
Are you okay?

120
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm good.

121
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,120
Madam hit you so hard.

122
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,040
What time is the inauguration ceremony?

123
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,040
10:30 PM.

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,440
Which store

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,720
sells the best women's clothing?

126
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,320
Mr. Xue.

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,760
Our men don't need that.

128
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,680
It could hurt.

129
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,560
Be thorough.

130
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,320
That's what makes a good maid.

131
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Get up.

132
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh, my.

133
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
You scared me.

134
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,680
Dongfeng.

135
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
Easy with your gun.

136
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,920
You work for me.

137
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,800
You clean shoes only for me.

138
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,760
Got it?

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
Dongfeng.

140
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Guess what?

141
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,280
She even gave up her dignity

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,040
to stay.

143
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,560
Just a kind reminder.

144
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,800
Don't be bewitched

145
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,480
by this fox.

146
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,520
Nan.

147
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Yes?

148
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Give her a lesson.

149
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,080
Yes.

150
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,400
Watch your mouth, not your shoes.

151
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,720
Yun Lian.
