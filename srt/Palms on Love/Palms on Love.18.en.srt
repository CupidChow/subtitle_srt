[Episode 18]

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,400
Bring him in.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,240
Zhihai.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,840
He was the one

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,320
who shot me at the shooting range.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,680
He said someone ordered him to do that.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,640
Tell me.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
Was it him?

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,920
Me?

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,280
Yes,

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,360
it was him.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
He paid me 100,000 to assassinate you.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Nonsense!

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,920
You beast.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,720
I can't believe you tried
to kill your brother!

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,440
Grandma.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
There must be some misunderstanding.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
Dongfeng.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
How could you believe a stranger?

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,120
Someone must've set me up!

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Zhihai.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,560
Don't try to deny it.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,000
Commander Qin.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
My brother has been mistaken about me

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,480
for some personal reasons.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,440
I request you to clear my name.

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,720
The whole thing is suspicious indeed.

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,600
Dongfeng.

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,600
You should get more rest now.

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,160
I'll take it from here.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,720
Alright.

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,720
I'll leave it to you.

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Madam Xue.

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
I'll take my leave.

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,520
Alright.

38
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,240
Mengmeng, let's go.

39
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm not leaving.

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,520
Commander Qin, take care.

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,160
See Commander Qin out.

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,320
My dear.

43
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,720
You've finally woken up.

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,760
Let me look at you.

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,240
You look fine.

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll ask Ms. Zhang
to make you some ginseng soup.

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,640
It's good for your recovery.

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,440
Okay.

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Come.

50
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,200
Hey.

51
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,760
She said she had a thing with you.

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,800
Dongfeng, tell her

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,560
what she is to you.

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
She's nothing.

55
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Did you hear that?

56
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,160
Just stay away from Dongfeng.

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,480
Dongfeng, let's go have some soup.

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,960
Dongfeng, tell her

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,520
what she is to you.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,600
She's nothing.

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,960
But she often flirted with me.

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,280
I spared you for old times' sake.

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,680
How dare you stay here?

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,960
I won't leave until I take my revenge.

70

I misunderstood you.

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,600
It wasn't you who wounded me.

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,640
The bullet in my body was not
from your gun.

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,800
You've been used.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,240

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,680
Ji Lianyun.

78
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,400
I've done so much for you.

and disbelief.

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
You pointed a gun at me.

83
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,280
Now I've seen you
for who you really are.

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,640

Actually, I can tell Miss Ji likes you.

99
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,800
Are you really going to marry Miss Qin?

100
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,440

to uncover the secrets

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
behind the Qin family.

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
Dongfeng, I'm sorry

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,560
that I have been wrong about you
this whole time.

104
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,480
I cannot make up for what I did to you,

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
but I'm content
as long as you're safe and sound.

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,760
Thanks for your information.

107
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,080
We have found the witness
and physical evidence.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,800
Governor, you're finally awake.

109
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Where is Ji Lianyun?

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I've arrested her.

111
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
At this point,

112
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,240
are you still concerned about her?

113
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
And the bullet?

114
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,120
What bullet?

115
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
The bullet that was shot into my body.

116
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
It's here.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Have a check.

118
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,280
Is this the bullet from her gun?

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,320
The force and direction
of the bullet were wrong.

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Someone else shot me.

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,120
What?

122
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,920
I sort of can guess who it was.

123
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,760
I have a plan.

124
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Don't tell anyone else

125
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
that I have woken up.

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,760
Let's see if we can catch the big fish.

127
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,360
Understood.

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,520
Don't forget

129
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,400
what you have promised me.

130
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,560
Xue Zhihai

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,040
has already been taken by Commander Qin.

132
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
He won't die, but he'll suffer a lot.

133
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,040
Haven't I told you?

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,160
You must bring him here!

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,080
He betrayed you,

136
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
but you still want to see him?

137
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,000
Xue Zhihai has done so much
for Commander Qin.

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,840
It's not hard to spare his life.

139
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,320
But I must say

140
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,400
your family

141
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,520
asked for it.

142
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,760
Your family adopted him

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
but treated him badly.

144
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,600
How dare you!

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,440
I almost fell for your trick.

146
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,200
You little rat.

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,720
I've left the most profitable business
to you,

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,000
but you still covet the position
of the Governor.

149
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,760
How greedy you are!

150
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Commander.

151
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,400
For all the years I've worked for you,

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,120
please give me another chance.

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
My daughter likes Dongfeng,

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,120
but Dongfeng hates you.

155
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,120
What do you think I should do?

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Commander.

157
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
I have goods worth four million.

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,000
I can give you the goods
and the list of suppliers,

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,240
but I beg you to spare me.

160
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,480
Fine.

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,840
But you must leave Jiang City

162
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,360
and never come back.

163
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Alright.

164
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,760
I'll leave.

165
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,120
Ms...

166
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,680
It's you.

167
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,560
Why are you here?

168
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
I haven't seen Ms. Fang Fei lately.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
Can't I come to see her?

170
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,680
Humph.

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,080
Drop the act.

172
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,080
Madam Xue is looking for her.
Where's she?

173
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,000
S-She was here just now.

174
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
Don't try to fool me.

175
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
I didn't see her yesterday
for Madam's birthday.

176
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Is she fooling around again?

177
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,200
Nonsense.

178
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,560
Pan.

179
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,160
I know you're covering up for her.

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
But she is one of the Xue family
and has been missing for days.

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
It's no small matter.

182
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
What if she's met bad guys

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,480
and got hurt?

184
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,800
Can you hold the blame?

185
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,400
Miss Yun, I really don't know.

186
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,680
She has been away for five days.

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,520
She used to be out
for only two or three days,

188
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
but she has never been gone this long.

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,120
Where did she usually go?

190
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Xinxin Night Club.

191
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
I guess Fang Fei's disappearance
is related to Xue Zhihai.

192
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,360
But he has been taken away
by Commander Qin.

193
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Did she fall out with Xue Zhihai?

194
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,160
Has Xue Zhihai killed her?

195
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
Or has she been hidden somewhere?
