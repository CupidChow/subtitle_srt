00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,640
Dongfeng.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,280
Mengmeng told me
something is bothering you.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,080
Yes, Commander.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,160
Since last year,
factories have moved south due to war.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,400
It's getting hard to collect taxes.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
So, it caused a significant shortfall
in military pay.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,000
I see.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,760
Indeed, it's an issue.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,280
I hope you can help me.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,200
Giving you financial support
is merely a stopgap.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,520
I have a solution.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,240
Could you please enlighten me now?

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,920
Not now.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,040
You'll know once you marry Mengmeng.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,600
Have some tea.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,480
How are you doing?

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm fine now.

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
Get me a cup of tea.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,680
Qin Mengmeng is here.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,240
I don't want to get beaten again.

Dongfeng.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,840
Ms. Yun Lian.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,080
Come hold up my dress.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
It's too long.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,880
Dongfeng.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,600
Do I look good today?

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
Miss Qin, are you alright?

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,080
It was my fault.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
You wench, I'll kill you.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,720
Stop it.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
It's a big day.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,480
Don't ruin your mood.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,640
Though this dress looks nice,

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
it gives you an awkward walk.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,200
Take care not to fall again.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,040
You're right.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,320
I'll go and change.

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,640
Wait for me.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,040
I'll help you.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,640
Get away from me.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,160
Good for you.

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,040
Start your revenge already?

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,560
What?

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
She only fell.

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
It broke your heart?

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,280
Of course.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
After all, she is my fiancée.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,320
Are you marrying her
because you like her

52
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,200
or for some other reason?

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,760
If I don't like her,

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
why am I marrying her?

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,040
For her father's power?

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I admit it.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,040
As you said,

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,640
smart people make the right decision.

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,560
My patience is wearing thin.

60
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,440
Miss Yun.

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,480
Qin Mengmeng has been with him.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
I have no chance to approach him.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,800
It seems you don't want to cooperate.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,800
You're forcing me to act.

65
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,440
Governor.

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,360
Bad news.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,240
What is it?

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
We received a telegram.

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,280
It says Miss Ji has been kidnapped.

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,480
They're asking you

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,720
to go to the abandoned warehouse
in the southeast alone immediately.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Governor, don't be impulsive.

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,280
Let me check it first.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,320
No, I must go myself.

75
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,640
I cannot risk her life.

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,240
But...

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
No buts. Give me the car key.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,920
Ji Lianyun.

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
Ji Lianyun.

80
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
Xue Zhihai.

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,520
Come at me.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,640
Let her go!

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,320
You have no bargaining chips.

84
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,880
Stop bluffing.

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
Put the gun down.

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,840
Otherwise, I'll kill your darling.

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,480
Xue Dongfeng, get out of here.

88
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
Xue Dongfeng.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
Without you,

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,400
I would be his only son,

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,120
his own son.

92
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
Do you know

93
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,080
I've been despised because of you?

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
No one likes you

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,280
because of your bad character.

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Back then, when my mother was pregnant,

97
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,480
you pushed her down the stairs,
causing her to die.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,120
My family was merciful enough
to spare you.

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
But still, you were born

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,520
and took everything from me!

101
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Dongfeng!

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,800
Let's go.

103
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,880
- Mr. Xue.
- Don't mind me.

104
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
Go kill them.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,000
You've got some nerve.

106
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
I knew you had an extra gun.

107
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,560
So, I dared to take the risk.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
How did you know?

109
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
The first gun wasn't the standard issue

110
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,800
for your army.

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
You're quite clever.

112
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
I underestimated you.

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,560
Why did you come to rescue me?

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,440
You still care about me, don't you?

115
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,160
When Xue Zhihai said

116
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,520
that Commander Qin was behind it all,

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
I had it all figured out.

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,560
You're marrying Qin Mengmeng

119
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,600

152
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,480
pitied me.

153
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
So, he gave me some buns.

154
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880

155
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,080
they were the most delicious food
in the world.

156
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm sorry

157
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,320

158
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
It's all in the past.

159

You should have told me earlier.

At that time, I didn't know you were
from the Xue family,

from a decent family.

You had your aspirations.

163
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,920
