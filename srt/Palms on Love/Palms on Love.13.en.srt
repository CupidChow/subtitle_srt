[Shanghai Xinxin Hotel]

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,920
Are you willing to be with me?

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,640
Mr. Xue.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,640
Don't forget who I am.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,480
If you can stay with Xue Dongfeng,

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,160
why can't you be with me?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,360
What about Mrs. Fang Fei?

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,800
So you did your homework.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
I'll cut to the chase then.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,720
If you don't want to end up

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,520
like your friend,

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
you better stop digging

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,960
into anything.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
I told you.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,080
I have great respect for Mr. Ji.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,560
I'd hate to see his only daughter unable

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,960
to visit his grave again.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,240
Mr. Xue.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
This is indeed your territory.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,960
But remember,
Governor Xue rules this city.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,040
Good.

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,680
So you know you have my back.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,680
Let's go.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Dongfeng.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,480
It's my date with her.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Isn't it rude for you to barge in?

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,200
Zhihai.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I think you're almost finished.

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,400
And she's mine.

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm not happy

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
to see her with you for so long.

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Fine.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
You two may leave.

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Oh, right.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,560
Zhihai.

39
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
Remember

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,480
to send the painting to my house.

41
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
Ms. Yun.

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,200
Hope to see you again.

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
What are you doing?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
Starting now,

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
don't ever leave my sight.

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,200
What's wrong with you?

47
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,480
He already knows your identity

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,800
and your purpose.

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,400
Do you think he will let you off?

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,840
But we don't have to be together
all the time.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,840
I'll be more careful.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
You have no idea how cunning he is.

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
You can't handle him.

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,400
One more thing,

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,120
if I hadn't made it in time today,

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
would you have returned safely?

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Don't underestimate me.

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
I used to be fine

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,080
without you for years.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
Give it back.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,160
Please.

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,600
Give me a break.

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,920
What should I do?

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,400
- Move.
- Don't move.

65
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Don't listen to her.

66
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Xue Dongfeng.

67
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,800
Xue Dongfeng, put me down.

68
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,680
Xue Dongfeng.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,280
What are you doing?

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,480
Dongfeng.

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,960
I've turned a blind eye

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
to your thing with her.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,000
But if you two live together,

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,560
it's...

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,560
Grandma.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,520
Please leave it.

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,520
Xue Dongfeng.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm still your Grandma.

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,880
If you can't ignore it,

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,280
I'll move out with her.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,080
You...

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
Child,

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
if you do this,

84
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,520
you will embarrass yourself.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
I don't care.

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,480
If you don't want to lose face,

87
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,600
then don't interfere with my business.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,560
What?

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,720
You...

90
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,160
That's sin.

91
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Shame!

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,120
Put me down.

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Even if you carry me in,

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
I can still walk out.

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,680
Xue Dongfeng.

96
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,760
Where is the key?

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,520
Give me.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,400
Give it to me.

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,160
Give it to me.

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,520
Come on.

101
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,720
Give me now.

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,600
I warn you.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,560
If you don't stop this,

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,480
I'll ask Nan to throw it into the lake.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Nan!

106
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
Alright.

107
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
I will stop.

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,880
You managed to stay unscathed.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,840
You did great.

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
But now that you have me,

111
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
I can't let you risk your safety again.

112
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,480
When all this

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,680
is over,

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
you will be free forever.

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,880
But not now.

116
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
The last chance.

117
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
Limited freedom.

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,360
Okay.

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
You sleep on the sofa.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
You sleep there.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,960
Mr. Xue.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
They're always together.

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,000
I have no chance.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Why are you staring at me?

125
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
What else can I do?

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,880
If you're bored,

127
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,400
sort out the files for me.

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,360
How?

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
Sort them by date.

130
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,480
I almost forgot.

131
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
I saved you from Xue Zhihai.

132
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,960
You haven't repaid me yet.

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm sorting the files for you.

134
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,680
Well, I think

135
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
that's far from enough.

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Stop it.

137
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,880
It just reminds me

138
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,480
of our school days.

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
Me too.

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Governor.

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
You need

142
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
to go to the arsenal.

143
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,680
I have to go.

144
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,200
You stay here.

145
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
Lock the door.

146
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Don't open the door for anyone but me.

147
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,680
What happened?

148
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,640
Military affairs.

149
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,240
Let's go.

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Who is it?

151
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,800
It's me.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,880
Do you need me for something, Madam?

153
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Yun Lian.

154
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,000
Come out and have tea with me.

155
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,600
Madam.

156
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,640
Just be direct with me.

157

Yun Lian.

158
