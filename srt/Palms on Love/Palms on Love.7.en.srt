[Episode 7]

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,400
Where is Xue Zhihai?

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,160
What happened?

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,440
Well,

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,920
I have the same question for you.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,120
For me?

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,920
What do you mean?

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,440
Last night, Yun Lian was drugged
and kidnapped at your place.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,920
Zhihai.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,080
Shouldn't you explain this to me?

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
I didn't know about it.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,760
Mr. Xue.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
We have no idea about this.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Bei.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,880
Yes?

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,640
Find the kidnapper in one day

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,240
for Ms. Yun.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Yes.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,520
Louder.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
Let Governor Xue hear you.

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,880
Yes!

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,760
I left something important inside.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,880
We're closed

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,720
today.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
Come back another day.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,800
Please.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,400
What I lost is important.

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,560
Don't you get it?

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Come back another day.

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
Please let me in.

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,640
I'll leave after I find it.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,960
No way.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,720
It's not open right now.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,280
But if you can be friends with me...

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
Why are you still here?

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,600
I lost one of my earrings inside.

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
I want to look for it.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,440
Governor.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Please don't make it hard for me.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,840
Without Mr. Xue's order,

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,120
I dare not let her in.

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
I warn you.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,880
Let her in.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,360
Nothing gets lost at my place.

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,400
Ms. Yun.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
What are you looking for?

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
One of my earrings.

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
An earring?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
Why waste time with it?

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,280
How about

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,680
I take you to the department store.

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,440
No matter what earrings

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,240
you like,

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,320
I'll buy them for you.

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,120
But...

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,800
She lost what I gave her.

59
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,840
How can I let you buy her a new one?

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
Besides,

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,040
the earrings I gave her

62
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320
were a token of my love for her.

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,200
Tell him.

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
Is that true?

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,160
You know what?

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,640
I've saved a lot of money.

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Once it's all settled,

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
we can run a small business together.

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,760
Great days lie ahead.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920
All right.

72
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,440
Cheer up.

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,080
I feel bad for you.

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,960
Pin.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,520
Pin.

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,960
Pin, don't.

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
Have I slept for a long time?

78
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Yeah.

79
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
You were scared.

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,240
You kept calling Pin.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,680
Who is she?

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
An old friend.

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
The one who died yesterday?

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
No,

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,960
I don't know her.

86
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
You went to the dance hall

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
to look for her, not your lost earring,

88
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,760
right?

89
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
None of your business.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,600
Xue Dongfeng.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,760
Xue Dongfeng.

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,440
Are you willing to tell me now?

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Must you treat me this way?

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm only trying to calm you down.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Tell me.

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Who is Pin?

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,640
I told you. I don't know her.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,680
Why do you always cause me trouble?

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,240
Fine.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
You stay here and think it over.

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,280
You can't leave

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,640
until you know who she is.

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Behave.

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Release me.

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,280
Let me go.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
Dongfeng.

107
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
What are you doing?

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
She made a mistake.

109
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm punishing her.

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,080
Do it properly.

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,520
Look what you're doing now.

112
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
Madam.

113
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
You saw it.

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,240
He took me by force.

115
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Please help me.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
What?

117
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Dongfeng.

118
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
Madam.

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
I won't tell anyone.

120
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,480
As long as he treats me well,

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,240
I won't tell others.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,280
But please un-cuff me.

123
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Otherwise, I...

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,560
What are you waiting for?

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,280
Release her.

126
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,720
Grandma.

127
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
I will handle it.

128
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,880
Let's talk outside.

129
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Don't try to play tricks on me.

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
My Grandma

131
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,640
can't help you.

132
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,320
You're such a loser.

133
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I haven't found what I want yet.

134
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,480
She jumped herself.

135
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
It's not my fault.

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,840
You...

137
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Zhihai.

138
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
Find the photos first.

139
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Don't scare him.

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,880
Please spare me.

141
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,240
Don't worry.

142
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,600
I will find the film.

143
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,760
You don't know yet.

144
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,840
Come on.

145
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Tell your aunt what you've done.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,120
What is it?

147
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,160
Back then,

148
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,920
I was possessed

149
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,680
and drugged Yun Lian.

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
And then?

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,160
Then,

152
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,200
Xue Dongfeng and his men stormed in.

153
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,040
You loser.

154
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,480
Auntie.

155
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,000
You're so useless.

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
What can you do?

157
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,120
Stop, Auntie.

159
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,880
You fool.

160
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Enough.

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
I bought you expensive high heels

162
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,320
not for hitting people.

163
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
You should do that with a gun.

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,240
Auntie.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,760
Zhihai.

166
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
Don't.

167
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
Calm down.

168
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,640
Zhihai.

169
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,560
He's too young.

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
He's my only nephew.

171
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,880
Just give him one more chance.

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Please.
