[Adapted from the online novel,
The Age of Wind and Rain]

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,780
[Episode 16]

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,200
You fired at the Governor.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,320
Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,400
Is he dead?

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,360
What did he ever do to you?

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,560
How could you?

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
I feel bad for Governor Xue.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
Do you have a conscience?

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
Governor Xue always defended you.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,760
Don't you at least know that?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,080
My gun didn't point at him.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,320
How did that happen?

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,080
You used to study abroad.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,000
You should be more sensible than me.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,480
But as far as I can tell,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,320
you're ungrateful and unreasonable!

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,440
Mr. Xue.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,760
I don't want to die.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,760
It seems you understand
your own situation.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,240
Whether you live or not

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,960
depends on what you'll do next.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,560
I can tell you

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,600
whatever you want to know.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,680
The Ji family was charged with treason.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,400
What exactly happened?

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,120
Who is behind you?

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,200
The hag, Fang Fei.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,280
She colluded with Xue Zhihai.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Xue Zhihai switched the replicas
in Mr. Ji's warehouse

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,160
with opium.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Then he framed the Ji family.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,520
Where did they get the opium?

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,160
Because

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
someone else is behind them.

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,600
That person is the real boss.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,760
The two of them are merely lackeys.

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,600
Who is

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
the real boss?

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,440
I don't know.

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
All I know is that he still
runs the opium business.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,280
He has a warehouse
in the western suburbs of the city.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,200
I've been there once
with Xue Zhihai to pick up goods.

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
The exact location?

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Yang Village.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,480
Nan.

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,680
Send men to Yang Village
to find the warehouse.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,960
Why?

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,800
The opium business is way bigger
than this.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
She cannot be involved.

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,520
So, who exactly

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,520
is behind all this?

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
We are investigating it.

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
We will soon have a lead.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
Fang Changlin was killed

57
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,320
due to my negligence in guarding.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,880
The assassin got a chance

59
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,800
to kill him.

60
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,480
How's the Governor...

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
According to our investigation,

62
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,640
someone else shot the Governor.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,160
Their gun was aimed right at him.

64
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,680
Perhaps

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
he won't wake up.

66
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,520
I want to see him.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,640
Please, let me see him.

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
Nan, take me to him.

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
So you can shoot him again?

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,800
Please, Nan.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,480
Let me see him.

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,840
Please.

73
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm begging you.

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
Please, nothing more.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,880
I am begging you.

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,160
Please let me have a look at him.

77
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Let me see him.

78
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
Please, Nan.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,240
I want to see him.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,120
You old fox.

81
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,400
You knew
that wench might not aim at him,

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,080
so you sent someone to follow them.

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
What a pity.

84
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,880
My guy still missed.

85
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Now Xue Dongfeng is in a coma.

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
And Ji Lianyun has been taken
into custody.

87
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,400
Changlin,

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,000
don't blame me.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
In the next life,

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,920
I will repay you as much as I can.

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,680
I got a letter from Commander Qin,

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,880
saying that since Dongfeng
is unconscious,

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
someone else should take his place.

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,160
Someone from the Xue family.

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
Really?

96
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
That's great.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
To you,

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,080
my dear Governor.

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
I knew

100
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,720
I chose the right man.

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
Starting tomorrow,

102
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,520
don't come to see me again.

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
What do you mean?

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,480
Do you know
why Commander Qin favored Xue Dongfeng?

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,520
He sees him as his future son-in-law.

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
That's why he can be the Governor

107
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,960
of Jiang City.

108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,200
You're going to marry Qin Mengmeng?

109
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
No.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,640
Didn't you promise me

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,960
that I would be the Governor's wife?

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,920
Governor's wife?

113
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,880
Do you want the whole world to know

114
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,640
that I slept with my father's woman?

115
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,520
Xue Zhihai.

116
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
Are you going to dump me?

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,320
Do you really take yourself
as the eldest son of the Xue family?

118
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,880
Don't forget.

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,280
You're just an adopted son,

120
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,040
a dog of the Xue family!

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,200
You've gotten this far

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,040
because of all the dirty work
I've done for you!

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
It's all thanks to me. Do you know that?

124
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,440
Before I lose my temper,

125
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,680
get out of here.

126
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Xue Zhihai.

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,000
Have you cheated on me?

128
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,800
You said you'd only love me.

129
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,720
Only me.

130
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,240
Xue Zhihai.

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Please.

132
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,680
I can't live without you.

133
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm not leaving!

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
Zhihai.

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Please.

136
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,480
Please don't drive me away.

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
I've done so many bad things for you.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,320
I know I will go to the devil.

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
But I'm not afraid at all.

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
In this world,

141
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,720
if you dump me,

142
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,840
what should I do?

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Zhihai.

144
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll see you down there when I die.

145
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,280
Get lost.

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,120
Leave Jiang City for good.

147
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
Get out before I change my mind.

148
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
