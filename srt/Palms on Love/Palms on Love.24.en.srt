4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,560
Stop!

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,840
Stop.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,000
Not her.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,760
Stop.

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Hello, Reporter Zhao.

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,920
Hello, Miss Ji.

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,520
A friend
of Governor Xue is a friend of mine.

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
Just tell me what I can do.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,640
What would you like to drink?

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,440
No, thank you.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,200
Reporter Zhao, it's a huge thing.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,960
You must think it through.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,920
Since you trust me so much,

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
I have nothing to fear.

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,360
Is this evidence?

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,240
Yeah.

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
However,

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,240
before I hand it over to you,

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,960
I'd like to know your plan first.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,680
My plan?

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,360
I need to think about it.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
But before that,
you can tell me what evidence you have.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,240
After you think it through,

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
we'll talk.

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,520
I'm sorry, Miss Ji.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,080
We are no match for Commander Qin.

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Where is it?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,560
It's important evidence.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,800
I certainly can't take it with me.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
You are in my hands now.

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,320
I suggest you give it to me now.

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Then I'll say something
you can understand.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,280
Commander Qin has taken Xue Dongfeng.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,800
The stuff in your hands can save him

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,800
and yourself.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,560
Alright.

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,360
I can give it to you.

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,400
But before that,
I need to make sure he's alive.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Fine.

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
As you wish.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,040
But remember,

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,000
you can't win.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Shut up. Take me to see him now.

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,120
Dongfeng.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Why are you here?

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,280
Get out of here.

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,160
I won't leave you again.

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,480
Don't worry.

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,000
As long as my army is there,

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,640
they won't kill me.

55
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,560
I'll take care of the rest.

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,320
After all, it is my family affair.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Leave the rest to me.

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you going to do?

59
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Don't worry.

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
I can take care of myself.

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,280
Ji Lianyun.

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,120

Ji Lianyun.

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
You've seen him.

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,200
Give me what I want.

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
I can hand it over,

68
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
but not to you.

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,680
Take me to Commander Qin.

70
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,720
I'll give it to him myself.

71
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,880
What tricks are you trying to play?

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,120
You've always had a grudge
against Dongfeng.

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
Who knows if you will kill him

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,680
after getting the evidence?

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,440
If you talk with Commander Qin,

76
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
you'll be engaged in a dangerous game.

77
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,080
It's better than playing it
with a viper like you.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,040
You have no choice.

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,280
At your mercy.

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,280
Fine.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,080
Take your stuff,

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,880
and see you there.

83
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,280
You have some nerve.

84
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,600
Commander Qin, I've brought
what you want.

85
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,200
I will exchange it for Dongfeng's life.

86
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,720
You're the first woman

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,440
who dares to negotiate with me.

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,040
You're a hero of our times.

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,240
I believe you prefer a fair game.

90
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,120
I haven't agreed yet.

91
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,040
You're Ji Xianwen's daughter.

92
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,600
You remind me of your parents.

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,480
I destroyed your family.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,800
If that old fogey Ji Xianwen
had done what I said,

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,880
his family would not have been ruined.

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,040
Now I understand

97
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,080
I'm nothing but a nobody.

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
I cannot be against you.

99
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,800
You are much smarter than your parents.

100
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,440
Show me the stuff.

101
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,760
So, it's a deal?

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
Deal.

111
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,520
You haven't told me

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,280
how you escaped from prison that day.

113
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
I've been curious.

114
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,120
Tell me about it.

115
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
Come on, tell me.

116
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,400
Do you not want to tell me, do you?

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
I can tell you.
