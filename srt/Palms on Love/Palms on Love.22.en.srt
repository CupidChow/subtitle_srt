[Episode 22]

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,640
Yun Lian, you witch.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,440
How dare you seduce Dongfeng?

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,440
I'll tell my father to kill you.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,520
You're back.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,720
How is it going?

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,160
Are you used to living here?

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,040
It's not as good as my home.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,520
But I don't mind
as long as I'm with you.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,120
Mengmeng.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,640
I've told your father about my problems
with military pay.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,480
But he doesn't trust me.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,960
I guess he can't help me.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,320
What? I can't believe him.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,000
We'll be a family very soon.

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll go to him.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,560
Don't.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,040
He can't know I asked for your help,

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,280
or he will get mad.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,120
Besides,

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,960
I don't want
to trouble Commander Qin too much.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,000
It makes me seem incapable.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Dongfeng, you're overthinking it.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
Who doesn't have a difficult time?

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,640
The point is,

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,160
I don't want people
to think I rely on a woman.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
That's why I tried

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,760
to avoid you before.

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
I think

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,560
if I could run a business
like your father,

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,040
my problems would be solved.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,280
But I have no connections.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I get it.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Let me help you.

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,760
I don't know much
about my father's business,

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
but I know that Chairman Deng
of Jiang City Commerce Association

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,320
has the source of goods.

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,680
Go to Chairman Deng.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
Maybe he's willing to work with you.

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
That's great, Mengmeng.

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm on it.

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,520
Don't tell him I told you this,

45
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,880
or my father will kill me.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,480
Okay.

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
So, if we break Chairman Deng,

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,080
we may get evidence
of Commander Qin trafficking opium.

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,480
I must talk to Chairman Deng

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,240
tomorrow.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,520
You two are not acquaintances.

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,640
I don't think he will talk to you.

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,640
Moreover, if he tells Commander Qin
about it,

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,200
you will expose yourself.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,840
I think...

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
I know what you're thinking.

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,040
No way.

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,640
Hear me out.

59
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,360
My father

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,600
dealt with Chairman Deng before.

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,200
I know he has a knack for business.

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,800
But he's a lecher.

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,400
He got into trouble many times
because of women.

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,280
So, let me deal with him.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,680
No, I can't let you take that risk.

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't worry. I will protect myself.

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,120
No.

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Xue Dongfeng.

69
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,040
We promised to fight together.

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,880
I...

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,560
You know I won't back down.

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Just let me do it.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
We don't have much time.

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,160
I'll use this to record all his crimes.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
Hello, Chairman Deng.

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,760
Hello, Miss Shen.

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Please.

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,280
Since you're Miss Qin's friend,

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
as her elder,

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
I must take good care of you.

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
Thank you.

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,120
Mengmeng told me
she knew a reliable elder

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
who's the chairman

84
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
of Jiang City Commerce Association.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,040
She said if I want to do business,

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
I must ask for your help.

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
Miss Qin was right.

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,000
I can help you with your business.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,840
I can't do it without your support.

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,400
Sure.

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,920
However...

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
What kind of business do you want to do?

93
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,160
To be frank,

94
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,320
my family is rich.

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
So, I want to engage in the biggest

96
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
and most profitable business here.

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,920
It seems Miss Qin
and you are really close.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
I know it's not easy
to do this business.

99
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,840
But if you give me an opportunity,

100
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,600
I will surely

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,160
repay you.

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,640
Tell me how you will repay me.

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Tell me how you will repay me.

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
Chairman Deng.

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
No rush.

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,400
Well,

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,320
let's drink

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
and chat.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Chairman Deng.

110
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't be so hasty.

111
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,760
Looking at such a beauty,

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,440
how can I not be hasty?

113
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Chairman Deng, don't be so hasty.

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,360
Looking at such a beauty,
how can I not be hasty?

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Chairman Deng.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,880
Doing opium business is a capital crime.

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Can you ensure everything goes smoothly?

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,960
Since you heard about me from Miss Qin,

119
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
you should know my relations
with Commander Qin.

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,720
Commander Qin is a big shot.

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,080
He's afraid of nothing.

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,920
But I'm a nobody.

123
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,520
How can I compare with him?

124
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,120
As long as you're with me,

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,920
you won't have to fear anything.

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
So, how long have you been working
with Commander Qin?

127
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
It's been six or seven years.

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Can you offer me the same price
as Commander Qin?

129
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,920
Miss Shen, do you really come here
for business?

130
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
Of course.

131
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
In that case,

132
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,320
you need to sweeten the deal, got it?

133
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Miss Shen, do you really come here
for business?

134
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
Of course.

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
In that case,
you need to sweeten the deal, got it?

136
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
Then forget it.

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,880
Quite feisty.

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,840
Quite feisty.

139
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Come here.

140
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
What are you doing?

141
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
Let go of me.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
Let me go.

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
Stop it, Dongfeng.

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,080
Don't kill him!

145
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,680
Are you alright?

146
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,720
Doing opium business is a capital crime.

147
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Can you ensure everything goes smoothly?

148
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Since you heard about me from Miss Qin,

149
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,120
you should know my relations
with Commander Qin.

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Once we make it public,

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,680
he will be ruined and notorious.

152
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Very soon,

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,640
everything will settle down.

154
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,800
After it's all over,

155
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,200
what do you want to do?

156
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,160
Go back to school.

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,560
I'll complete my studies.

158
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,560
I'll go with you.

159
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,880
We can experience the journey
we've taken again

160
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,160
and see the scenery we enjoyed together.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,800
The street
outside our school is beautiful.

162
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,400
I often dreamed about it.

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,760
I wonder if it has changed.

164
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
Dongfeng.

165
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,920
Dongfeng.

166
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
Are you back?

167
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,840
Dongfeng?

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Dongfeng.

169
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,560
Strange. I heard a voice.

170
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,640
