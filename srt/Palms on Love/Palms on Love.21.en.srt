[One month later]

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,640
Alright, we're home.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
Don't forget our status.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,560
Okay, it's not done yet.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,320
I'll keep pretending.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,360
Dongfeng, where have you been?

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,360
Something happened at the armory.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,600
I was away for work.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,840
What about her?

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
You two were together the whole time?

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,880
I went to the hospital

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,160
to get my medicine and ran into him.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,880
The armory and the hospital are
in two different directions.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
The Governor is slightly injured.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,640
What? Injured?

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,160
Where? Let me see.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,840
It's not serious.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,240
I must stay and take care of you.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,280
Mengmeng.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
We haven't married yet.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,040
It's not appropriate for you to move in.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,720
I don't care.

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,560
Who dares to gossip?

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,360
But...

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,360
No buts.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,720
If you reject me again,
I'll tell my father.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,200
As you wish.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,080
Let's go.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,600
Governor, you're finally back.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
I've been looking for you all night.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
I even went
to the Ji family's old factory.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Did you see Xue Zhihai's body?

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,320
Him again?

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,640
Did you kill him?

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,040
He was shot twice.

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,040
One of the shots hit a vital spot.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,120
Then he's definitely dead.

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
Dongfeng.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,800
You'll soon be a family man.

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,480
You have to be prudent now.

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
By the way,

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,280
I haven't seen Fang Fei for days.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,800
Have you seen her?

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,760
Ms. Fang Fei?

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
Something happened to her nephew.

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
So, she went back
to accompany her family.

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
Nan sent her back.

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,320
She has no manners at all.

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,320
How could she not tell me?

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
When she comes back,

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
you can punish her.

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,240
Grandma, please don't be angry.

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
Take care of your health.

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,240
You're right.

59
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,520
Madam, I will take good care of you.

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,440
After all, Dongfeng
and I are getting married soon.

61
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
Madam, I will take good care of you.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm glad to hear that.

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,640
Yun Lian.

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,560
Have you finished what I told you?

65
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,320
Miss Qin's room is ready.

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,600
Good.

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
Fang Fei will be away for a while.

68
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,240
So, you take care of the housework.

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll punish you
if you make Mengmeng feel unwelcome.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,080
Mengmeng, from now on,

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,680
if you need anything,

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,160
just let the servants know.

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,560
This is also your home.

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
Okay, Madam.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Good.

76
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,840
Have some tea.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,880
Let go.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
What's wrong? Are you jealous?

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,120
Let go, or they will see us.

80
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

81
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
Dongfeng.

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,400
Dongfeng.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
Dongfeng.

84
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
Dongfeng, are you there?

85
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
I know you're jealous.

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,920
You're pulling a long face.

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,280
When I saw Qin Mengmeng sitting
next to you,

88
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
I just thought

89
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,280
how nice it would be
if I were sitting beside you.

90
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I will come to you as soon as possible.

91
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Are you still upset?

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,600
No.

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,320
But you should go back now.

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,240
Why are you still holding me so tight?

95
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,880
Alright, go back.

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
Tomorrow, I'll have Nan pick you up
at the gate.

97
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,200
Where to?

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
You'll see tomorrow.

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Okay.

100
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,800
Xue Dongfeng.

101
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
Who allowed you to bring her here?

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,840
You are nothing but a prisoner now.

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,640
I don't need your consent

104
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,760
to whatever I do.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,120
Pah.

106
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
Ji Lianyun, you jinx.

107
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,640
Well played.

108
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,120
Yes.

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,640
Every time I met you,

110
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,200
I wanted to tear you into pieces.

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,560
But I had to bear with it.

112
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
If you want revenge, go to Xue Zhihai

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,480
and Commander Qin.

114
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

115
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,920
Looks like you're impenitent.

116
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Your family was too high-profile.

117
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,120
Commander Qin tried to persuade your dad
to finance the military many times,

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,040
but he refused

119
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,520
and even reported on Commander Qin
for trafficking opium.

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,800
That's Commander Qin!

121
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,160
Who am I to mess with him?

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,440
What about Pin?

123
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
You got her killed.

124
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,960
If you didn't try to revenge,

125
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
she would not have died.

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,400
You know what?

127
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,000
I've saved a lot of money.

128
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,320
Once it's all settled,

129
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,200
we can run a small business together.

130
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,280
Great days lie ahead.

131
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,040
I will expose your crimes to the world.

132
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
I will make you despised by everyone

133
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
and lose everything.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,080
Xue Dongfeng.

135
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,480
Ji Lianyun.

136
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,400
Xue Zhihai.

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,360
You can cry if you want to.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
My shoulder is here for you.

139
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,240
I've cried so many times before

140
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,360
that my tears have been dried.

141
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
You can kill her

142
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,520
if it makes you feel better.

143
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,960
It will only make me happy for a moment.

144
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,520
After all, she is a witness.

145
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
Keeping her alive matters.

146
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
You're too rational.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
If I'm sentimental,

148
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
I won't make it to this day.

149
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
I hope you won't worry so much.

150
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm here for you.

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Dongfeng.

152
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,920
Thank you for being my armor

153
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,080
and my weapon.

154
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,280
But I hope that we can fight together.

155
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,560
