[Episode 19]

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,920
I guess Fang Fei's disappearance
is related to Xue Zhihai.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,320
But he has been taken away
by Commander Qin.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,520
Did she fall out with Xue Zhihai?

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,400
Has Xue Zhihai killed her?

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
Or has she been hidden somewhere?

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,680
Isn't that Ms. Yun Lian?

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,960
Just ignore her.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,520
Let's go shopping.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,520
Ms. Yun Lian.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,240
Stop there.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,480
I told you to stop. Didn't you hear?

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,960
No.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,960
You...

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Why are you here?

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,640
Hanging around.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
Are you?

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Are you hooking up with someone here?
It's not even that late.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,800
Nan.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
Send her back.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,000
Wait.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,000
Dongfeng, you know what?

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,000
She was very arrogant
while you were unconscious.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,440
Really?

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,040
I'll punish her later.

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,880
No, I want her to kneel
before me right now.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,120
Kneel.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,560
Hey, what are you doing?

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
Governor, Miss Qin.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
You're just in time. Hit her.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,800
Well...

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
Get out of here.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
Even the police dare not interfere.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
Go on.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,840
You asked for it.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
Never mess with me again.

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
How is she?

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,760
The doctor has checked on her.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,120
It's not serious.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,040
Luckily it was you.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,760
I controlled my strength.

45
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
If I had hit her hard,

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,480
Miss Ji would have died.

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
In that case,

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,440
if I had spoken up for her,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Qin Mengmeng
would have made her suffer more.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,920
You can go check on her.

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
The doctor gave her a sedative.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,480
So, she won't know.

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,440
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,280
I'll find out the truth
about your family.

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,960
Why are you here?

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,400
I came to see if you're dead.

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,800
Well, I'll live.

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,960
Are you happy or disappointed?

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,080
It doesn't matter.

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,080
As long as you don't die in my house.

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,640
Otherwise, it's unlucky.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,800
No need to provoke me.

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
I know

64
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,640
I hurt you first.

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,440
So, you can torment me all you want.

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,800
I won't have any complaints.

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,440
Anyway, you used to do the same

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,800
to me.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,880
You sure have a smart mouth
for someone who's injured.

70
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
Why didn't you dare
to argue with Qin Mengmeng earlier?

71
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
I have nothing to say to her.

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,120
Talk to me.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Fang Fei is missing.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,240
Help me find her.

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,880
Who are you to order me around?

76
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,560
You tell me.

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,440
What?

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,440
You're my ex-girlfriend

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
or my mistress?

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,960
You're not in a position
to be my mistress.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Qin Mengmeng doesn't know
about our past relationship.

82
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,720
Anyway, I can't get revenge
without your help.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,040
If you don't help me, I'll tell her.

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,240
I'll ruin your marriage and reputation.

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,320

You're dooming yourself.

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,800
You know I'll stop at nothing
for my revenge.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
Fang Fei is safe for now.

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
Now,

91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
can you calm yourself?

92
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,000
You want revenge,

93
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,800
but you need to be alive to do it.

94
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't try to challenge me again.

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Now that he has Fang Fei,

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,920
maybe she will be safe.

To the Governor's house.

100
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,080
Stop, this is the wrong way.

101
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,040
Stop.

102
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,080
Long time no see.

103

Miss Yun.

104
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
Why are you so afraid of me?

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
Weren't you taken by Commander Qin?

106
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Xue Dongfeng is indeed very cunning.

107
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,480
But I survived.

108
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
In fact,

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,640
I've been working for Commander Qin.

110
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,960
It was Commander Qin
who destroyed your family.

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,000
Aren't you Ji Xianwen's daughter?

112
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,960
You know what I'm talking about.

Fire.

114
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,720
Why should I believe you?

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
You don't have to.

116
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,520
But you'll lose someone
who can help you get revenge.

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,760
When Xue Dongfeng
and Qin Mengmeng humiliated you,

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,320
I just happened to see it.

120

You're just an obstacle to his success.

121
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,160
You'll help me get revenge?

122
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,000
Why?

123
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Because I hate the Xue family.

124
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
Before I was five,

125
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,280
they treated me as one of their own.

126
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,320
But nothing lasts forever.

127
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,440
When Mrs. Xue was pregnant,

128
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,120
they started to ignore me
and sent me to the side room.

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Xue Zhaokun never cared for me again.

130
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Outsiders thought of me
as the eldest son of the Xue family,

131
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,640
but the Xue family treated me

132
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,960
like a wildling with no parents.

133
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
I thought you would not welcome me home,

134
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,880
just like before.

135
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
What makes you say that?

136
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,400
Congrats, Governor Xue.

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
Even if Dongfeng remains unconscious,

138
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,960
you still have me.

139
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
I'll protect us.

140
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,120
No need to say anything.

141
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,040
I've long wanted you
to be my son-in-law.

142
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't like him.

143
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
I only want Dongfeng.

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Xue Dongfeng took everything from me.

145
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,280
He should never have been born.

146
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
Don't you want
to take down Commander Qin?

147
