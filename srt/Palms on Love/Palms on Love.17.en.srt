00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm sorry, Dongfeng.

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,240
It's all my fault.

7
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,160
I misunderstood you.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,480
I know it's too late to say anything.

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,880
But I still want to tell you

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,640
that my gun wasn't aimed

11

But I don't know why.

How come I still messed it up?

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,480
Could you please wake up?

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
As long as you wake up,

16

you can blame me or hate me.

17

You can refuse to see me again.

I'll look after him.

Ask him yourself after he wakes up.

Dongfeng...

76

It's not about Dongfeng.

I have someone else in mind.

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm glad
that Xue's Army is skilled in battle,

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,720
but a city can't do without a governor.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,120
I've discussed it with the governors
of the other two cities.

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,160
We've decided to appoint Zhihai
as the acting Governor.

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,920
He hasn't been on a battlefield,

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
but he is a Xue.

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,280
I believe your army will accept him.

Why didn't you discuss it with me?

87

I don't like him.

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I only want Dongfeng.

89

Be quiet.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
Dongfeng is a good man.

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
But the doctor said

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,520
he might not wake up.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,360
I have to think for Mengmeng.

95
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
I understand.

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,440
If he doesn't wake up,

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
I will stay by his side forever.

98
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,880
Stay out of this.

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
Just do what I say.

101
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Don't worry.

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
Even if Dongfeng remains unconscious,

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
you still have me.

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll protect us.

105
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,240
Who says I won't wake up?

106

Commander Qin.

107
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,320
Dongfeng?

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
Why didn't you come see me first
after you woke up?

109
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,240
Now that you're alright,

110
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,560
set a date for your wedding
with Mengmeng.

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,920
So we can be family soon.

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Dongfeng.

113
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm so happy for you.

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,240
I didn't mean to replace you.

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,520
It's just that situation was critical.

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Is that so?

117
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Bring him in.
