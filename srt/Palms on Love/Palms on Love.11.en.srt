[Episode 11]

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,640
You got my family killed.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,280
How could you enjoy a good life?

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,120
Anyway,

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,080
your good life might end today.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,080
Where are you off to?

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,920
Madam.

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm going for a walk.

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
Search.

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Go.

13
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Let go.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,640
Don't move.

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,880
Give it to me.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,960
Let go.

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,920
Let go.

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Madam.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
You thief.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,320
- A thief at my home.
- Madam.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Madam.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,360
Let me explain, Madam.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
I made a mistake.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
Fang Fei.

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,720
This is just the beginning.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
Just you wait.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,440
That's a lot of money.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,160
Mrs. Fang Fei can't get it all.

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Is there a big shot behind her?

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
A big shot?

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,040
I hear

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,960
she's close to Mr. Xue Zhihai.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,160
Xue Zhihai is two-faced.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,040
He only cares about himself.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,880
He refused to help my Auntie.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
What will Mrs. Fang Fei do?

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
Tell you a secret.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
The Xue family

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
has a lot of cash.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,720
Auntie will find a way to get it for me.

41
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,890
[Tonight, a thief in the house
will steal money]

42
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,960
I finally see you smile.

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
Are you happy now?

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,560
Fang Changlin has no one now.

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,960
He's helpless.

46
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,040
If you pay his debts for him,

47
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,720
he will be willing
to answer your questions.

48
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
If I do what you say,

49
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,080
what can you give me?

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Once I get the evidence,

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,680
I'll give you the antidote.

52
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,080
Is that okay?

53
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Did you really think

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,160
I'd fall for that?

55
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,680
I have checked on it.

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,120
This is just a regular narcotic.

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,440
But you...

58
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,640
I have proven to you

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,680
that I can be trusted.

60
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,320
Trust me.

61
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
You're late.

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,400
Mr. Fang, I am sorry.

63
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
He's still alive.

64
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
You're injured.

65
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,440
I'm fine.

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,800
Take him to the hospital.

67
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Hurry.

68
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,110
[Sheng'an Hospital, several days later]

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
How is Fang Changlin?

70
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,640
He has survived.

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
But nobody knows when he will wake up.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,400
Watch him.

73
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
No visitors allowed.

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
Yes.

75
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,240
You took a bullet for me.

76
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,960
Did you have a death wish?

77
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,520
I couldn't watch you die.

78
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
So I bet my life on it.

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
And I won, right?

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
But what if you lost?

81
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,280
Even if I die, I will haunt you.

82
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,080
Stop that nonsense

83
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,200
or I won't talk to you again.

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
Did I hurt you?

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,360
You still care about me,

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,640
right?

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,760
Am I interrupting?

89
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I heard you were injured.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,160
I came to check on you.

91
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,840
You're well-informed.

92
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,040
Is it serious?

93
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,520
Thanks for your concern.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
You don't have to thank me.

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
After all, we are family.

96
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,280
What do you say, Ms. Yun?

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
By the way,

98
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,440
these flowers are for you.

99
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Zhihai.

100
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,560
I'm the one who is injured.

101
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,920
Why give her flowers?

102
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,040
She's taking care of you.

103
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
So, I'm thankful to her.

104
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
Besides,

105
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,080
as a man, you like flowers?

106
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,280
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

107
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,440
I will not bother you.

108
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
See you.

109
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,160
She is indeed Ji Xianwen's daughter.

110
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,320
When Ji Xianwen was in trouble,

111
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,480
she was studying in Japan.

112
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,560
Japan?

113
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
So, she and Xue Dongfeng...

114
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,600
Yes, they attended the same school.

115
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
Good for you, Xue Dongfeng.

116
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,040
You want to avenge her family

117
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,280

118
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,560
