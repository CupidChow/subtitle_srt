[Episode 8]

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,280
Auntie.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,480
Zhihai.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,080
Don't.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,440
Auntie.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,360
Calm down.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,120
Zhihai.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,920
He's too young.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
He's my only nephew.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,280
Just give him one more chance.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,360
Please.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,880
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,200
Aren't you eating?

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
If you miss this meal,

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,240
you'll have the next one
tomorrow morning.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,360
Untie my hand.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,080
I need to use the restroom.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,520
Do you need help?

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,960
If you don't tell me what you're up to,

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,920
you can't go anywhere.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,680
Even if you don't tell me,

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,880
I know you're here for Fang Fei.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,800
As for your plan,

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
I suppose

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
I will know very soon.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,880
Do you really want to know?

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,880
Yes.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,440
Untie me.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
And we can talk.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
I want to eat something I like.

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,400
Untie me,

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,720
and I'll cook myself.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,920
I cook for you.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
It happened before.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,600
You cooked

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,920
while I watched you.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,240
1,785 days.

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,320
What?

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,480
I've cooked for you that long.

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,520
You remember it so clearly.

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,160
That day,

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
you left right after dinner

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,800
and never appeared again.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,680
This is my father's favorite dish.

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,760
The lotus root is my mother's favorite.

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,400
I don't care about that.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,600
Then let's start with Fang Fei.

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,320
She was a dancer.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,360
My mother had a kind heart.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,000
She pitied Fang Fei

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,920
and kept her as her sworn sister.

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,880
Unexpectedly,
she slept with mf my father

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
when he was drunk.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
Since then, my home has been a mess.

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,280
I heard of it when I studied abroad.

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
So, I wanted to return home.

59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,080
Unexpectedly,

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,040
she falsely accused my family
of selling opium.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,480
Yet she embezzled the fortune
of my family,

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,440
turned into a national heroine,

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,160
and married your father.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,400
What did you put in my glass?

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,920
Dongfeng.

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
Thank you
for the good times you gave me.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,560
I have never forgotten you.

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,080
If one day, it's all done and dusted,

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,800
can we get back together?

70
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
How dare you.

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,800
You drugged me.

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,640
So what?

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,040
Anyway, your life is in my hands now.

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
You're holding a knife at midnight,

75
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
standing outside Mrs. Fang Fei's room.

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
So,

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,200
you're going to kill her.

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,440
Are you crazy?

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll die with her,

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
and it's all over.

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,960
Must you die?

82
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,920
Who will give me the antidote?

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Think about it.

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
If you die

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,760
with Fang Fei,

86
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
you'll have no chance

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,320
to prove your family's innocence.

88
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Mr. Xue.

89
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,800
I don't get it.

90
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,720
You knew she put something
in your drink.

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
Why did you still drink it?

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,720
Perhaps in that way,

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
she would feel more secure.

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,880
After all, she dares not trust anyone

95
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
after being betrayed.

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
I got more confused.

97
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Stop hitting me.

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm begging you.

100
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,240
Spare me.

101
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,200
I can't help.

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,760
Today,

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,280
you apologize to Ms. Yun and my brother.

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
You implore them.

105
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,680
I won't stop until you ask me to.

106
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,640
Mr. Xue.

107
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,360
Ms. Yun.

108
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,440
I was wrong.

109
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,600
Please spare me.

110
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,200
I was just drunk.

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,360
Please.

112
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,520
Stop him.

113
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Xue Zhihai.

114
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,280
Stop it.

115
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
You're injured.

116
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,560
Auntie, I made a mistake.

117
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,360
Please stop him.

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640
You mean woman.

119
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,400
Calm down.

120
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,320
Though Changlin is your nephew,

121
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,840
he has to be punished for his mistake.

122
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
You can't cover for him.

123
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,840
She's just a lowly maid.

124
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
How could you hurt Changlin for her?

125
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,680
This mean woman loves

126
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
to hook up with guys.

127
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,400
She was

128
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,320
in Dongfeng's room last night.

129
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,760
Now,

130
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,960
why are you siding with her?

131
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
Are you okay?

132
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,520
You're severely injured.

133
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
You need a good rest.

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,040
Since it's hot,

135
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,320
take care not to get inflamed.

136
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,160
I...

137
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,720
Mrs. Fang Fei.

138
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,720
I know you said those words

139
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,120
you didn't mean.

140
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,680
Actually, I don't blame Fang Changlin.

141
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,920
Don't be angry over this.

142
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Mr. Xue.

143
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,520
I know you mean well.

144
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,160
Thank you.

145
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
Governor.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
I am no longer angry with Fang Changlin.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Please let him go.

148
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,880
What is she

149
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,600
up to?

150
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,400
