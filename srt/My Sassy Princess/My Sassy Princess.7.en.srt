-Lord Shen! -Your Highness!

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,780
-Your Highness! -Lord Shen!

6
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,710
Your Highness!

7
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,710
Lord Shen!

8
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,320
Lord Shen!

9
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,690
Lord Shen!

10
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,860
Your Highness!

11
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,300
Lord Shen!

12
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,670
Why are you laughing?

13
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
I laugh

14
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,040
because in the world

15
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,690
there is indeed a man so courageous,

16
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,570
and this man belongs to me.

17
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,170
What a bargain!

18
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,460
I feel happy

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
so I laugh.

20
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,380
Indecent.

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,470
Decency?

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,100
Leave it to other women.

23
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,460
As for me,

24
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,350
Lord Shen!

25
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,180
I don't need it.

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,130
Your Highness!

27
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,510
Lord Shen!

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,620
Lord Shen!

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,120
It's my lord!

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,920
My lord!

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,680
How come they came so quickly.

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,990
My lord!

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,760
My Lord,

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,910
we found you at last!

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,010
Are you okay?

36
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,860
I'm good.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,350
How are the brothers?

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,510
Don't worry, my lord.

39
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,100
We are hard to kill.

40
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,550
The fact that you two haven't returned for days

41
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,030
worried us to death.

42
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,120
Exactly.

43
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,380
We went to the mountain every day

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,980
to look for you and princess.

45
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,870
We've searched almost the whole mountain

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,360
and found you at last.

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,220
Yes, my lord!

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,050
[Courier Station]

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,340
My Lord,

50
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,030
we've investigated.

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,760
These killers are clean and quick.

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,090
Because of their deadly efficiency,

53
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,660
not a single trace

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,820
is left for us.

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
Did you notice anything unusual

56
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,700
during the fight?

57
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,370
My lord,

58
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,920
these people seemed to have done it on purpose.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,980
Their skills were very sophisticated.

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,440
But in the heat of the fight,

61
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,700
I noticed that some skills are similar to

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,990
those of the family Lu's in Yejing.

63
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,130
It's the Lus.

64
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,260
You Highness,

65
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,470
since you had a hard time coming back,

66
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,470
why don't you go to the room and rest?

67
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,329
Why do you come here for the case?

68
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm not here for the case.

69
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,740
I

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,100
come to see Lord Shen.

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,050
What is it?

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,340
Amazing, my lord.

73
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,940
How do you know that

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
inside Yun Yi's mouth

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,700
lies the mystery?

76
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,030
What a deadly crime!

77
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,740
If so,

78
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,950
I don't want you to win.

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,590
Wait till I am dead.

80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,210
I'll do you a favor.

81
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,240
I reached an agreement with Yun Yi.

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Despite his mortal sin,

83
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,420
before he died,

84
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,060
he saw sense.

85
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,620
Take it.

86
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,660
After we return to the capital,

87
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,650
check the jade

88
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,210
and Lu Lianshan.

89
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,980
Yes.

90
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,220
Isn't the princess

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,850
a little weird today?

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,500
Since you said so,

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,340
she is indeed.

94
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,730
Your Highness,

95
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,690
did anything happen

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,320
in the last few days at the foot of the mountain?

97
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,090
When she was with us in the past,

98
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,740
-It's never so quiet. -What happened?

99
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,930
Now,

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,030
Why are you here?

101
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,200
it looks like...

102
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,630
We...

103
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,130
down the mountain...

104
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,560
We...

105
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,780
Go away.

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,770
The princess is tired, and she needs to rest.

107
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,040
Why so sudden?

108
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,530
They are holding hands!

109
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,700
What's going on?

110
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,900
They're holding hands.

111
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,990
Shen Yan,

112
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,640
you dragged me out in such a hurry.

113
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,750
Are you afraid...

114
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,630
Afraid of what?

115
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,610
afraid that others will know our relationship.

116
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,290
Right?

117
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,630
You and me,

118
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,220
what relationship?

119
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,120
Nothing.

120
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,900
Since you refused

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,580
to marry me down the mountain,

122
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,980
of course, there is nothing.

123
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,450
Now, as I recall that

124
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,659
you were eager to return to the capital,

125
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,320
I'm afraid from the beginning

126
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,620
you never thought of

127
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,940
being with me forever.

128
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,830
Your kisses and hugs

129
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,480
were misinterpreted by me.

130
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,620
On the cliff,

131
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,750
you saved me when falling off the cliff

132
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,380
to fulfill your duty.

133
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,830
And...

134
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,860
when we were on the iron chains

135
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,460
and a thousand birds flew by,

136
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,160
what you said

137
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,090
was not true at all?

138
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,820
Since Lord Shen doesn't want to answer,

139
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,400
I won't force you.

140
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,110
Men are heartless,

141
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,200
which is no news.

142
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,620
I'll take those days

143
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,540
as a dream.

144
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,170
Why

145
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,030
are you angry?

146
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,580
Shen Yan,

147
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,380
you are bullying me.

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Bullying you?

149
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,480
If you dare

150
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,330
to talk nonsense in the public,

151
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,230
believe it or not,

152
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,030
I'll prove it to them right away.

153
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,170
I don't believe it.

154
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,170
What will you do?

155
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,980
You don't believe me?

156
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,040
It's up to you.

157
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,770
You.

158
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,300
Be a good girl.

159
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,250
Lord... Lord Shen.

160
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,210
Your...

161
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,120
Your Highness,

162
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,370
are you alright?

163
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,210
Yes.

164
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,770
I'm good.

165
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,580
Attention!

166
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,070
-Lord! -Lord!

167
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,740
Early in the morning tomorrow,

168
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,340
we'll return to the capital.

169
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,750
-Yes. -Yes.

170
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,220
Come in if you have something to say.

171
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,400
My Lord,

172
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,720
although the fish we're going to catch

173
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,970
is off the hook,

174
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,420
you manged

175
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,010
to get the information

176
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,480
from Yun Yi.

177
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,080
We can continue investigating the case.

178
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,170
If the crown prince hold us accountable,

179
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,880
will we

180
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,080
be beheaded?

181
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,660
Having said so,

182
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,810
my Lord, your face

183
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,890
shows that

184
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,710
something difficult happened.

185
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,650
Do you know the case

186
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,780
of the late Princess of Guangping?

187
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,380
My Lord,

188
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,950
you asked the right person.

189
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,280
The official announcement writes that

190
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,490
Princess Guangping fell into the pond by accident

191
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,530
and drowned.

192
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,630
However,

193
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,210
according to my research,

194
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,450
it was because Prince Guangping's

195
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,810
infidelity.

196
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,110
Princess of Guangping

197
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,970
jumped into the lake because she was heart-broken.

198
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Ok.

199
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,940
I have a question for you.

200
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,290
Who is Prince Guangping's new wife?

201
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,680
Everyone knows who she is.

202
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,010
She is from Family Lu...

203
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,860
Family Lu!

204
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,200
Family Lu again?

205
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,020
You sensed it's weird as well.

206
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,950
My Lord, do you have any discovery?

207
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,660
As far as I know,

208
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,670
the Family Xu of Yejing

209
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,180
and the Family Zhang of Dingbei Mansion

210
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,070
have been friends for generations.

211
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,420
The eldest son of the Family Xu

212
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,800
and Zhang Yun, late Princess of Guangping,

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
are sworn siblings.

214
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,570
According to the princess,

215
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,760
after the case in Jiangzhou happened

216
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,480
where the Xu couple died,

217
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,560
the late princess and Prince Guangping

218
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,710
had an argument.

219
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,840
Shortly after that,

220
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,700
the princess drowned in the pond.

221
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,600
It was just at that moment,

222
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,010
Family Lu connected themselves with

223
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,470
the Family of Prince Guangping by marriage.

224
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,290
What a coincidence,

225
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,780
yet could it be

226
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,780
just a coincidence?

227
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,690
I have worked under your supervision, my Lord,

228
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,660
for only a few years,

229
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,580
but I know that

230
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,280
there must be a demon if something goes wrong.

231
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,030
Coincidences

232
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,840
happen very often

233
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,370
in the tales of storytellers,

234
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,340
but in the real world

235
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,500
they rarely happen.

236
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,260
Poor princess.

237
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,510
If you're right,

238
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm afraid, in the end, the Jiangzhou case

239
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,600
will cause more pain to

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Her Highness

241
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,440
who lost her mother at a young age.

242
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:41,220
[Yejing]

243
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,430
Princess Changle, Liu Ling

244
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,960
I pay respect to Your Grace.

245
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,170
I

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,390
have something to report.

247
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,420
I hope Your Grace will give me a chance.

248
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,190
My cousin,

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,910
you haven't shown up for years.

250
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,260
When you do,

251
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,840
you have things to report.

252
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,820
Interesting.

253
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,010
Tell me.

254
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,870
The criminal Yun Yi's death

255
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,450
is not the Jinlin Guard's fault.

256
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,020
It was due to me who was so unruly

257
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,490
and delayed the important matter of His Majesty and Your Grace.

258
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,570
Good.

259
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,140
I've never blamed you,

260
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,610
yet you're trying to silence me.

261
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,100
You are still

262
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,070
as discerning as ever.

263
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,800
Forget it.

264
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,330
I don't need you

265
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,810
to mind the state affairs.

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,350
I heard you have

267
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,380
officially engaged with Lu.

268
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,090
Engaged?

269
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,110
That's Prince Guangping's

270
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,190
wishful-thinking.

271
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,640
It has nothing to do with me.

272
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,240
If my memory serves me right,

273
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,550
Lu Mingshan

274
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
is the son of a concubine.

275
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,180
You are a princess.

276
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,370
Marrying him

277
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,010
is below your status.

278
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,100
However,

279
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,450
The Lus have few heirs.

280
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,950
He'll inherit the title from Duke Lu

281
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,340
in the future.

282
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,270
Compared to Shen Yan,

283
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,630
Lu Mingshan and you are a good match.

284
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,880
How come a human and a beast

285
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,280
belong together?

286
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,940
Beast!

287
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,760
My cousin,

288
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,110
you're still full of witty words.

289
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,600
I also hope

290
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,630
you can find your Mr. Right.

291
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,870
But

292
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,310
in this world,

293
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
people who can do whatever they like

294
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,600
are few.

295
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
For those who are born into royal families,

296
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,690
it's even harder.

297
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,630
I hope your expectation

298
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,700
will be neither an illusion

299
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,010
nor a pipe dream.

300
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,980
All right.

301
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,500
The lychees of tribute

302
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,890
were brought to the palace yesterday.

303
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,620
Today,

304
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,580
I'm to hold a banquet in the court

305
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,720
and invite the officials

306
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
to enjoy.

307
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,930
Since you just came back to the capital,

308
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,140
come and join us.

309
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,100
I have something important to discuss with Shen Yan.

310
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,160
You can go back now.

311
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,320
"In this world,

312
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
people who can do whatever they like

313
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,640
are few."

314
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,720
Your Highness!

315
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,870
Be careful.

316
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,280
"I hope your expectation

317
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,460
will be neither an illusion

318
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,980
nor a pipe dream."

319
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,620
Shen Yan.

320
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,700
Your Highness.

321
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,390
The commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard, Shen Tan, arrives.

322
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,030
Let him in.

323
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,170
The commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard, Shen Tan.

324
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,780
I pay respect to Your Highness.

325
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,980
My dear Shen,

326
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,300
you're finally back.

327
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,820
I, your humble subject,

328
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,220
failed to fulfill my duty

329
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,980
and didn't live up to Your Grace's expectation.

330
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,640
Please punish me, Your Grace.

331
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,800
Father and I

332
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,140
have high hopes

333
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,720
for you.

334
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,400
Do you know

335
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,650
in order to have you

336
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,740
in charge of the case

337
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,280
I have drawn

338
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,340
many controversies in the court.

339
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,050
I have defended you,

340
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,980
but in the end what I got

341
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,260
was you apologizing

342
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,550
for failure

343
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,130
and incompetence.

344
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,410
I

345
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,220
deserve to die thousands of times.

346
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,750
The news of the Jinlin Guard

347
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,250
escorting the princess back to the capital

348
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,060
was released by Shen Yu on your order, isn't it?

349
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,120
Your Grace is wise.

350
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,660
You want to

351
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,270
use the news that the princess has returned to the capital

352
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,730
to lure the criminals out.

353
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,740
But in my opinion.

354
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,870
you are spinning your own web.

355
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,840
In the court,

356
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,210
Duke Lu repeatedly

357
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,160
complained to me

358
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,190
that you didn't make a distinction between private and public interests.

359
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,120
It has affected the state affairs.

360
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,630
The princess came back,

361
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,630
but Yun Yi died.

362
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,380
Shen Yan,

363
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,680
I want to ask you.

364
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,010
How do I

365
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,570
explain it to other officials

366
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,160
and how should I punish you?

367
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,410
I, the commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard, Shen Yan

368
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,800
failed to handle the case properly

369
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
and let His Majesty down,

370
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,890
but Your Grace is fair in giving out rewards and punishments.

371
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,620
Considering that I have protected the princess,

372
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,420
I hope to be exempted from death penalty and

373
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,620
be held on suspension.

374
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,750
Your Grace will see whether I will have bettered myself.

375
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,730
Rise.

376
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,100
Thank you for your mercy.

377
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,870
Why do you

378
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,040
give this to me?

379
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,180
The jade

380
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,560
was kept in Yun Yi's mouth by himself

381
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,290
before he died.

382
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,250
If I'm right,

383
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,540
this jade

384
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,270
is not only one of a pair

385
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,210
but also closely connected with

386
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,740
the treasury that was stolen in Jiangzhou.

387
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,990
Through mere one word "qian",

388
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,180
what connection you can see?

389
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,930
Your Grace has sharp eyes.

390
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,220
The word "qian" on the jade

391
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,140
is one,

392
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,110
while the other

393
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,220
is Yun Yi.

394
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,610
This man

395
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,730
is cunning

396
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,010
and stingy.

397
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,540
Both the Jinlin Guard and the prime culprit of the Jiangzhou case

398
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,900
wanted to find the treasury silver,

399
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,170
both were his enemies.

400
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,400
He knew

401
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,140
he won't be able to escape.

402
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,130
As a result,

403
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,280
He placed them

404
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,440
at two places,

405
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,300
so that each side gets one

406
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,590
and fight endlessly

407
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,940
to the advantage of neither party.

408
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,510
That's how it goes his way.

409
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,930
The bait fell,

410
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,950
but the fishing line

411
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,740
is still there.

412
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,850
Your Grace,

413
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,910
my suspension

414
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,240
on the one hand can stop the gossip

415
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,300
and let the chief criminal lower his vigilance,

416
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,230
on the other hand

417
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,550
it enables me

418
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
to have more convenience

419
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,330
and make amends for my negligence.

420
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,740
Based on what you said,

421
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,660
this time

422
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,670
you worked hard.

423
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,860
Shen,

424
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,630
why don't you greet your older brother?

425
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,880
You are getting older every day,

426
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,490
yet you have no manners.

427
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,620
Did you give them back to your parents?

428
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,320
My Lords, you haven't seen each other for a long time.

429
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,520
I'd better not to disturb you.

430
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,250
See you.

431
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,790
You look like a philanderer.

432
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,760
If the palace servants noticed it and spread the word,

433
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,160
how indecent it would be!

434
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,120
Just like

435
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,130
you and Princess Changle.

436
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,840
Your love affair,

437
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,130
despite the long distance,

438
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,740
is known by everyone.

439
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,260
Irresistible love and passion.

440
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,310
It is indeed indecent.

441
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,470
You're making up stories and adding fuel to the fire.

442
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,810
I haven't got even with you

443
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,060
for what you did.

444
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,210
You brat,

445
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,870
taking your undeserved gains for granted.

446
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,100
You walk so fast

447
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,540
to meet your princess?

448
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,690
Your Highness, this way.

449
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,330
Your Highness,

450
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,970
this way.

451
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,780
Lady-in-waiting Xu.

452
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,430
-Ling. -Jin.

453
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,480
You can go.

454
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,700
Let's sit down.

455
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,300
Ling,

456
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,110
It’s been years since we parted.

457
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,310
Have you read the letter

458
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,260
I wrote to you?

459
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,570
Which one?

460
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,020
The one in which I told you

461
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,000
your betrothed Lu Mingshan

462
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,210
had an affair

463
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,500
with his maid Yue Ling,

464
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,870
and before marriage

465
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,560
he'll take her as a concubine.

466
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,810
Lady-in-waiting Xu is amazing!

467
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,600
You are

468
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,150
straight to the point.

469
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,480
Compared with Princess Changle,

470
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,010
I feel inadequate.

471
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,720
Although Lu Mingshan is indiscreet,

472
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,200
you are no better than him.

473
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,700
In just a few days,

474
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,990
you had an affair with

475
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,330
the commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard.

476
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,250
Otherwise I'd be like you

477
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,660
being single all along.

478
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,090
Ling is still the old Ling.

479
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,620
You haven’t changed at all.

480
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,100
Seeing you come back safe and sound,

481
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm very happy.

482
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,830
However, seeing you

483
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,190
makes me feel bad.

484
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,820
It turns out

485
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
that you don't want to see me?

486
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,180
Yes, I want to,

487
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,190
but I dare not to.

488
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,750
Everyone in Yejing

489
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,090
knows Lady-in-waiting Xu

490
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,090
as being astute

491
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,060
and tough.

492
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,050
Everyone says

493
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,470
that you are trusted by the crown prince and

494
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,820
has a bright future.

495
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,970
But I'm the only one who thinks

496
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
you have changed.

497
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,180
Jin!

498
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,150
Was I wrong

499
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,480
to help you enter the palace?

500
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,170
As the saying goes,

501
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,570
taking people as a mirror helps one understand gains and losses.

502
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,740
Do you know

503
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,590
you are my mirror?

504
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,860
Give it back!

505
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,130
No. What can you do?

506
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,710
He is robbing her!

507
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,640
Give it to me!

508
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,770
Why are you grabbing me?

509
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Are you the national traitor?

510
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,510
Who kicked me?

511
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,180
You.

512
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,660
You are Xu Shijin?

513
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,300
That's right. Let's go.

514
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,300
Wait and see.

515
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll go home and ask my father to punish you.

516
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,190
You...

517
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,640
My name is Liu Ling.

518
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,480
Duke Dingbei is my grandfather and

519
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,040
Zhang Yun is my mother.

520
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,900
What else do you want to ask?

521
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,570
Why did you help me just now?

522
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,780
They were bullying you,

523
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
so I helped.

524
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,060
My grandpa said

525
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,600
my mother and your father were sworn siblings

526
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
by burning yellow paper

527
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,160
in front of gods.

528
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,740
Then you and I

529
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,340
are sisters.

530
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,690
Your parents died

531
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,430
and so did my mother.

532
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,780
Since we are sisters,

533
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
we should rely on each other, right?

534
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,050
That's right!

535
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,940
Jin, don't be afraid.

536
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,810
If anyone dares to bully you again,

537
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,850
I will help you

538
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,910
fight back.

539
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,450
Happy or sad,

540
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,860
right or wrong,

541
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
it seems that the pain I don't want to see

542
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,100
and the past I don't want to recall

543
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,830
have no place to hide

544
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,420
in front of you.

545
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,510
This old thing

546
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,020
is still kept by you?

547
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,170
It's priceless.

548
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,820
How could I throw it away?

549
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,090
Without you

550
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,520
and the protection from the Duke,

551
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I’m afraid I wouldn't be here today.

552
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,490
At that time in Yejing

553
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,500
only you believed me.

554
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,380
Only you.

555
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,190
My parents didn't betray the country.

556
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,410
They were set up to die.

557
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,730
Do you remember

558
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,600
I asked you

559
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,910
whether you believed what I said?

560
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,160
How did you answer me?

561
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,150
You are my sister.

562
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,480
Of course I believe

563
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,430
what you said.

564
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,100
Since you call me sister,

565
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
I have to ask you about

566
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,740
you and Lu Mingshan,

567
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,820
what's your plan?

568
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,520
There is no plan

569
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,800
other than making him back off.

570
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,360
That's easy for you to say.

571
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,200
How many royal women

572
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,320
can marry

573
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,300
out of free will?

574
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,180
I think

575
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,540
the Family Lu is determined

576
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,110
to cling to your family.

577
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,850
Making him back off

578
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,410
will not be as easy as you said, I'm afraid.

579
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,740
If he insists,

580
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,980
I'll give him some trouble.

581
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,530
Ever since I came back to Yejing,

582
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,440
I've been upset.

583
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,550
Lady-in-waiting Xu,

584
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,980
the palace banquet is ready.

585
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,640
It's time for you

586
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,570
to join them at the Eastern Palace.

587
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,650
Okay.

588
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,350
Please, Your Highness.

589
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,150
The lychees,

590
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,910
precious as they are,

591
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,150
are unable to

592
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,350
fill the stomach.

593
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,360
My ministers and officials,

594
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,020
it's rare for you to come here.

595
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,400
If I

596
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,840
let you go home

597
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,030
hungry,

598
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm afraid you would call me name

599
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,360
after leaving the palace.

600
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,770
My yard often receives

601
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,290
people who are

602
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,170
the younger generations of Wei,

603
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,640
so relax today and

604
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,290
speak your mind freely.

605
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,460
Today's banquet

606
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,900
coincides with

607
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,300
Princess Changle's return to the capital.

608
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,810
Here,

609
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,900
let's make a toast to the princess

610
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,820
as a welcome.

611
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,080
Here we go.

612
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,390
The bitch got lucky,

613
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,820
but she caused a lot of trouble for me.

614
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,830
This Princess Changle.

615
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,230
How interesting she is!

616
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,340
She's been staring at you

617
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,940
as if she wants the whole world

618
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,420
to know about your affair.

619
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,290
Shen Yan,

620
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,880
tell me the truth.

621
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,840
How far did you get with her?

622
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,870
Ling,

623
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,610
I’m so happy

624
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,270
to see you back.

625
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,580
Ling,

626
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,260
are you still angry with me?

627
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,140
I know

628
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,160
your way back to the capital was full of danger.

629
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,490
I couldn't stay by your side.

630
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,610
I feel guilty.

631
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,960
Ling,

632
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,030
I'll have a drink as a punishment.

633
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,920
I apologize.

634
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,600
The princess is...

635
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,930
Look at Her Highness...

636
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,000
What brings Your Highness

637
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,760
to see me?

638
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,970
Someone boring

639
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,840
was around me.

640
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,100
Come on,

641
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,100
On my way to the capital,

642
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,910
thanks to Lord Shen's company

643
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,150
day and night,

644
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,940
I am safe and sound.

645
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,780
This is

646
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,360
for Lord Shen.

647
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,800
It's my duty and

648
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,700
I dare not to take the credit.

649
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,280
Lord Shen, you're too modest.

650
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,190
Thank to your escorting my betrothed,

651
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,660
she is here

652
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
safe and sound.

653
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,850
I heard that

654
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,220
you failed on an important matter for the sake of princess;

655
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,940
as a result,

656
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,080
you are punished

657
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,440
by the crown prince.

658
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:49,960
I

659
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,540
feel unease.

660
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,790
This

661
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,510
on the behalf of the princess and I

662
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,670
is for you.

663
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,430
Now that Ling is back,

664
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,030
our wedding

665
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,580
is around the corner.

666
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,630
I'd like to invite Lord Shen

667
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,070
to come to our wedding

668
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,020
along with all officials here.

669
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,969
All of you

670
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,900
will bring joys to our big day.

671
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
What do you think?

672
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,540
That's a good suggestion.

673
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,600
Lord Shen,

674
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,949
please.

675
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,900
Mr. Lu is being funny.

676
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,290
You talked about you getting married

677
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,540
in the public for a while.

678
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,340
Why didn’t you ask

679
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,020
if I would like to marry you?

680
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,000
Today's wine is strong.

681
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,889
Your Highness must be drunk.

682
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,179
If you say I'm drunk,

683
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,699
then I'm drunk.

684
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,980
The wine of the palace banquet

685
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
I will drink no more.

686
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,550
I'm not happy here

687
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,550
so I'm leaving.

688
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,580
Shen Yan,

689
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,990
you owe me

690
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,180
a drink.

691
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,190
Your sweetheart is gone,

692
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,100
why are you still sitting here?

693
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,350
If you don't go after her,

694
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,750
I wonder what trouble

695
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,070
will this wild girl cause.

696
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,440
Jin.

697
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,720
Jin!

698
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,900
As soon as Ling is back,

699
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,590
the capital

700
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,300
will be eventful again.

701
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,690
Have you had enough fun?

702
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,510
I told you not to come back,

703
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,830
but you insisted.

704
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,530
You see, I've only been back for half a day,

705
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,330
yet I've caused so much trouble.

706
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,470
Then tell me, Lord Shen,

707
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,280
when are you going to marry me?

708
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,470
I have a plan.

709
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,610
You just need

710
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,360
to behave yourself.

711
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,890
When will it be?

712
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,110
Today?

713
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,830
Tomorrow?

714
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,730
I am not sure about

715
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,170
what you said.

716
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,510
How can I...

717
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,030
♫We two love each other forever♫

718
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,470
♫Arrows stop time♫

719
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,700
♫Life is short ♫

720
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,480
♫Attachment hidden in every tear♫

721
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,760
♫We two love each other forever♫

722
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,310
Are you sure now?

723
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,960
♫It is shown through our eyes and knitted eyebrows ♫

724
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,420
Forget it.

725
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,220
♫No matter how long our reunion would be♫

726
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,780
It's cold here.

727
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,340
You just drank wine.

728
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:29,130
♫Our hearts are forever together ♫

729
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,560
Go home and have an early rest.

730
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,110
I’ll deal with

731
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,540
Lu Mingshan.

732
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,670
But Shen Yan,

733
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,380
be efficient.

734
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,410
Don't let me wait too long.

735
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,460
I know.
