[Episode 6]

4
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,500
Shen Yan!

5
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,940
Shen Yan!

6
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,260
Shen...

7
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,980
You're awake.

8
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,980
Eat this.

9
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,460
It's very sweet.

10
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,829
You eat some too.

11
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,980
I've eaten.

12
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,230
Lord Shen,

13
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,030
you haven't recovered.

14
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,660
How about we stay here

15
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,820
for a few more days?

16
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,660
If you want, you can stay longer.

17
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,630
I'm busy. I have to go.

18
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,480
Shen Yan, wait for me.

19
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,579
Shen Yan!

20
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,510
Shen Yan, Shen…

21
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,840
Mind your step.

22
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,230
Let's go.

23
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,220
Shen Yan.

24
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,300
I...

25
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,840
I feel uncomfortable. I need to take a bath.

26
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
Please bear with it.

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Across the pond,

28
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,460
there is an uphill road

29
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,100
leading back to the camp.

30
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,030
Back to the camp?

31
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,220
Already?

32
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,920
It's been two days.

33
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,180
If it weren't for you,

34
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,230
I should have gone back yesterday.

35
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,700
Lord Shen,

36
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,060
you are busy.

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,390
I dare not delay it.

38
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,839
If you're anxious,

39
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,959
you can go first.

40
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,380
Are you really going to stay here?

41
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,019
Of course.

42
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,020
I feel very sweaty.

43
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,280
I don't want to take another step.

44
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,420
You deliberately make things difficult for me.

45
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,680
You knew I wouldn't leave you here alone.

46
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,020
You are an impartial person.

47
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,050
I wouldn't dare to push your limits.

48
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,780
Yesterday, you swore that

49
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,700
when you had eyes on the target,

50
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,360
it wouldn't be able to escape.

51
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,700
Now it seems that

52
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,020
you were just bluffing

53
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,740
and bragging.

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,540
After all, doing your job

55
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,930
is more important than saving your face.

56
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,540
Right?

57
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,030
Just go.

58
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,740
Leave me alone here.

59
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,420
You're trying to delay the schedule

60
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,060
even by provoking me.

61
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,140
Fine.

62
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,140
If you want to bathe now,

63
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,780
you can.

64
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,700
I

65
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,140
will stay here to protect you.

66
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,980
Now that you put it this way,

67
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,210
if I take a bath,

68
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,140
then...

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,500
then I'd be guilty of

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,850
delaying the schedule.

71
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm not in the mood anymore. I'm not going.

72
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,580
Really?

73
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,780
Yes.

74
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,600
Okay.

75
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,980
I’ll take a bath.

76
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,500
You have wounds.

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
You can't be in the water.

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,700
I'll avoid having water on the wounds.

79
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,560
Your Highness,

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,740
you know you are

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
not supposed to watch me, right?

82
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,580
Don't worry.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
I won't peep.

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,220
I swear

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,250
by my name.

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,100
Okay.

87
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,659
Deal.

88
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,220
Come here.

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,210
I won't watch him bathe.

90
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,480
Lord Shen values his reputation so much.

91
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,930
He's taking a bath in the pond.

92
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,500
Of course I won't peep.

93
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,000
But I can

94
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,060
watch out for him.

95
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,659
You swore not to peep

96
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,659
by your name.

97
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,500
Who said I was peeking?

98
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,630
Then what are you doing?

99
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,460
I was just watching out for you.

100
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,660
You are up so high.

101
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,290
Can you see clearly?

102
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,220
How about

103
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
you come down here and watch?

104
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,260
Can I go down?

105
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
No.

106
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,380
♫ The night is not spent yet as affection spreads far and wide ♫

107
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,030
♫ Never expect to savor the taste of life ♫

108
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,870
Your wounds...

109
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,050
♫ How lucky I am to have you around ♫

110
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,300
does it hurt?

111
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,420
Stop talking.

112
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:25,080
♫ Night and day, we stay together. Never forget each other ♫

113
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
Hold your breath.

114
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,560
♫ The red candle lights up the road we've been through ♫

115
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:40,140
♫ I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

116
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,670
♫ Wherever I go, if you can't go with me ♫

117
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,780
♫ I'll take a curtain call of my free will ♫

118
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:55,160
♫ I wish you all the best and I give you all my heart ♫

119
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,450
The wound is so deep.

120
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,630
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

121
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm fine.

122
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,540
Hang in there.

123
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,290
I'll find some herbs

124
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,180
to heal your wounds.

125
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,620
Don't go.

126
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,380
Don't go.

127
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,300
Don't.

128
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,300
Don't go.

129
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,040
Shen Yan!

130
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,750
Don't go.

131
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,180
Don't go anywhere.

132
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,380
Stay by my side.

133
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,860
Lord Shen,

134
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,980
you don't know that

135
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,860
I can protect you.

136
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,420
I'm willing to do anything

137
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,020
for you.

138
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,450
Okay.

139
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,810
Talk to me.

140
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,060
Talk?

141
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,520
Since I met you,

142
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,850
I have

143
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,140
many doubts in my heart.

144
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,890
The longer we spend time together,

145
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,300
the more doubts I have.

146
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,310
People say you are a wicked woman from Jiangzhou.

147
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,540
But to me,

148
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
you are Princess Changle, Liu Ling.

149
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,420
Which one is the truth?

150
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,720
Which one is the lie?

151
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,790
If you don't want to talk about it,

152
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,660
I won't ask you again.

153
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,990
I'll tell you

154
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,170
anything you want to know.

155
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,780
The title "Changle"

156
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,540
was granted by His Majesty

157
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,370
when I was born.

158
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,820
When I was a kid,

159
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,100
there was a period

160
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,170
when I lived up to the title.

161
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,010
Mom, higher.

162
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,500
Higher?

163
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,740
Aren't you afraid?

164
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,660
I’m not.

165
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,100
Father is a hero.

166
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,430
I'm are a little heroine.

167
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,180
I'm fearless.

168
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,660
What a great heroine!

169
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,380
May I know

170
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,180
the name

171
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,500
of this little heroine?

172
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,440
Dad.

173
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,450
My daughter.

174
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,220
Let me look at you.

175
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,140
Did you miss me?

176
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,980
Yes!

177
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,060
My love,

178
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,680
let's swing together.

179
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,460
Come on.

180
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,240
Okay.

181
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,180
Back then,

182
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,490
I liked swinging with my mother

183
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,210
in the garden

184
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,160
while waiting for my father to come back.

185
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,260
Until one day,

186
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,690
my father

187
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,090
came back with a company.

188
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,850
Ling.

189
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,300
-Daddy. -My love.

190
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,900
This is Miss Lu Qian.

191
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,220
She will stay here

192
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,460
for a while.

193
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
The person he brought back

194
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,410
was the eldest daughter of the Family Lu.

195
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,380
Lu Qian.

196
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,780
My father said she came to Jiangzhou

197
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
all alone.

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,880
She didn't know anyone there.

199
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,320
She would stay in the mansion for a while.

200
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,900
Now that I think about it,

201
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,180
I think that's when

202
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,480
Changle (also means lasting happiness)

203
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,460
started to sound ironic to me.

204
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,590
Long live Your Highness.

205
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,580
Is His Highness in the main hall?

206
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,900
Come on.

207
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,520
Sit down. Sit down here.

208
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,980
Your Highness, I'll get a bottle of wine.

209
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,720
Mom, dad is here.

210
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,860
Mom, what's wrong?

211
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,380
Sister.

212
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,780
You're only a few years older than me.

213
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,340
Why are you so weak?

214
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,210
Since I live here,

215
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,860
I should

216
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,340
share some responsibilities with you.

217
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Sister, go back.

218
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,820
I’m going to see dad.

219
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,770
Ling,

220
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,540
let’s go.

221
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
Mom.

222
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,500
Aren't we going to see daddy?

223
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,260
Actually,

224
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,740
what happened in the mansion

225
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,270
was nothing new.

226
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,780
Yes.

227
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,740
For story-listeners,

228
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,620
that was

229
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,820
nothing new.

230
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,680
But

231
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,030
for people living the story,

232
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
it was

233
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,190
completely different.

234
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,340
I was a kid,

235
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
I knew nothing.

236
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,200
The servants in the mansion

237
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
gossiped about it.

238
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,970
But my mother was hurt by her love.

239
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,920
She cried every day.

240
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,810
Not long after that,

241
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,420
a silver robbery happened in Jiangzhou.

242
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,650
My mother's childhood friends,

243
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,820
Mr. and Mrs. Xu, were killed.

244
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,140
She became

245
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,070
more depressed.

246
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,050
One day,

247
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,900
my mother was crying

248
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,230
by the lake in the backyard of the mansion.

249
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,570
She said a lot to me.

250
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,380
I just felt furious.

251
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,900
I hated my father.

252
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,620
I hated Lu Qian.

253
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,490
I asked my mother to see my father

254
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,320
and evict that woman

255
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
from our house.

256
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,550
But mother said she was afraid.

257
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,520
She was afraid that

258
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,750
father was in love with that woman.

259
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,660
I'll remember it forever.

260
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,640
On that day, my mother said to me with a smile,

261
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,580
"Ling,

262
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,860
in the future,

263
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,420
you can't

264
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,660
be as weak as me."

265
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,320
On the next day,

266
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,850
my mother got up early and washed up.

267
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,220
She went in my father's study.

268
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,150
I couldn't hear what they were talking about.

269
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,620
I only heard my father scolding her.

270
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,490
When she came out from the study,

271
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,630
she looked pale.

272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,460
I should've

273
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,030
comforted her.

274
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,340
But I hid out of anger.

275
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,930
Later, I missed my mother.

276
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,220
When I went to see her,

277
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,910
she was already...

278
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,990
Help!

279
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,660
Her Highness jumped into the pond! Help!

280
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,240
Her Highness jumped into the pond! Help!

281
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,740
That was the last memory

282
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,000
I have about my mother.

283
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,700
Shen Yan, you know what?

284
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,109
My mother has a beautiful smile.

285
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,380
Very beautiful.

286
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,780
But in the end,

287
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,700
she was in that pond.

288
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,260
She would never smile

289
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,140
or cry again.

290
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,040
The servants in the mansion said that

291
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,850
I was the reason she died.

292
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,700
The late princess

293
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,470
was raised in an influential family.

294
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,270
Her death

295
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,180
has nothing to do

296
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,840
with your childish behavior.

297
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,420
But if at that time,

298
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,220
I could comfort her

299
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,140
with a few words,

300
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,820
maybe she wouldn't have...

301
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,340
My mother

302
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,420
was drove to suicide by my father and Lu Qian.

303
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,860
I was the accomplice.

304
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,910
Shortly after my mom died,

305
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,820
my father married Lu Qian.

306
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,140
In the evening of the wedding,

307
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
I visited

308
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,490
my mom's tomb by myself.

309
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,740
I added a handful of dirt

310
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,780
to her grave.

311
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,790
By that, I buried

312
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,620
the carefree Princess Changle.

313
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,140
Then I rose

314
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,790
as the most wicked woman in Jiangzhou,

315
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,060
Liu Ling.

316
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,400
Here are three sleeve arrows.

317
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,850
If you can hit the target three times,

318
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,910
we'll be able to escape.

319
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,130
If not,

320
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,180
you just need to shoot all three arrows

321
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,580
and flee as far as you can.

322
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,230
What about you?

323
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,020
I will try my best.

324
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,220
Don’t worry.

325
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,930
Shen Yan,

326
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,420
You don't know that

327
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,690
I can protect you.

328
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,930
You should stop

329
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,030
pushing yourself to be brave.

330
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,490
I'm not trying to be brave.

331
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm willing to do anything

332
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,190
for you.

333
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,650
You forgot the key points I taught you.

334
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,660
Raise your hands.

335
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,710
Stay calm.

336
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:28,900
Release!

337
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,070
Load the arrow!

338
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,300
Let's go.

339
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,720
-Go! -Shen Yan!

340
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,460
Shen Yan!

341
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,020
Shen Yan!

342
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,060
Shen Yan.

343
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,730
I...

344
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,340
I...

345
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,140
It's okay.

346
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,180
It's alright.

347
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,850
I told you to leave.

348
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,680
Why didn't you leave?

349
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,170
If you die,

350
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,170
I don't want to live without you.

351
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,820
What are you thinking?

352
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,420
Nothing.

353
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,540
Birth and death

354
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,170
are the most common things

355
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,580
in this world.

356
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,100
If you dwell on it,

357
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,980
it does nothing but add misery.

358
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,710
You were talking

359
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,380
about the most wicked woman in Jiangzhou.

360
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,860
It was interrupted by

361
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,910
the two bastards.

362
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,500
How about

363
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,960
you continue with your story?

364
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,310
How dare you trying to kill your father?

365
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,700
Ah

366
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,740
Ling,

367
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,580
how could you

368
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,240
do such a thing to your father?

369
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,400
Your Highness.

370
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,790
Ling is still young and immature.

371
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,660
She would never

372
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,140
want to kill you.

373
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,740
If you do this again,

374
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,660
you will be punished severely.

375
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,410
You killed my mother.

376
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,320
I hate you.

377
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,030
Since Xiang was...

378
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,700
Since Xiang was born,

379
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,300
as your mother,

380
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,460
I didn't give you enough attention.

381
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,820
Your Highness.

382
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,060
How about this?

383
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,360
Let me take care of Ling.

384
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,640
I'll take to her.

385
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
Our little princess

386
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,280
is something else.

387
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,180
She just drove Her Highness to suicide.

388
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,420
Now she tries to kill His Highness.

389
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,590
Oh dear!

390
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,380
Isn't she a dreadful troublemaker?

391
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,380
She's only seven years old.

392
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,260
How dare she

393
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,860
do such a treacherous thing?

394
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,150
Exactly.

395
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,200
She made such a scene,

396
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,220
and now we are kept busy

397
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,380
and have to stay here day and night.

398
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,690
Stop complaining.

399
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,290
His Highness locked her inside.

400
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,750
The new princess won't let her eat and drink.

401
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,980
She's just a kid.

402
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,480
How will she survive this?

403
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,430
I never thought that

404
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,000
Princess Changle

405
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,610
lived like this when she was little.

406
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,230
If you hadn't said it yourself,

407
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,220
no one

408
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
would believe it.

409
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,900
I didn't know

410
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,050
how long

411
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,470
I stayed in the woodshed.

412
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,340
It's so dark there.

413
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,160
I was sleepy every day.

414
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,730
I've been having dreams.

415
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,680
I dreamed that my mother

416
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,980
playing on the swing with me.

417
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,790
She smiled at me.

418
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,360
I've been waiting for her to get me.

419
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,280
I waited and waited.

420
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,120
Finally, someone came for me.

421
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,840
Ling!

422
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,980
Ling!

423
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,300
Ling!

424
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,780
Ling!

425
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,180
Ling!

426
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,860
Ling!

427
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,010
My poor child.

428
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,640
Even wild beasts look after their young.

429
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,960
How could you do this?

430
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,670
Let's go.

431
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,260
My Lord.

432
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,580
You can't take Liu Ling away.

433
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,500
You bitch!

434
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,640
How dare you

435
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,740
stop me here!

436
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,480
You broke my daughter's marriage

437
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,820
and drove her to suicide.

438
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,160
Now you are torturing her child.

439
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,140
What a cultured family

440
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,580
you have!

441
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,300
I...

442
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,880
Get lost!

443
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,120
I know.

444
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,570
If I die,

445
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,340
it will be much easier for many people.

446
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
But when I think of

447
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,580
my loving grandpa,

448
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,820
suddenly I felt that

449
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,700
if possible

450
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,020
I want to live.

451
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,020
It's funny.

452
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,070
I became famous

453
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,540
as the most wicked woman in Jiangzhou,

454
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,840
after I left Jiangzhou.

455
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,810
At that time,

456
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,930
everyone in Jiangzhou knew that

457
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,410
Princess Changle

458
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,940
drove her mother to suicide at five

459
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,820
and stabbed her father at seven.

460
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,660
Jin said

461
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,480
the rumor started because

462
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,250
Lu Qian was afraid of been criticized

463
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,780
for my grandpa taking me away.

464
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,590
So she

465
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,420
started the rumors.

466
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,050
But after that,

467
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,500
why did you return to Jiangzhou?

468
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,070
Because I think

469
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,060
my hatred against the Prince Guangping's family

470
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,540
is much less than

471
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,240
Lu Qian's hatred to me.

472
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,780
In that case,

473
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,450
I'm winning here.

474
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,530
Also, I miss my mother.

475
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,340
Her tomb is in Jiangzhou.

476
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,520
When I'm in Jiangzhou,

477
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,700
I feel closer to her.

478
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,620
Now that I think about it,

479
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,940
going back to Jiangzhou is

480
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,290
a great decision.

481
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,340
Otherwise,

482
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,820
I wouldn't have met you.

483
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,480
I'm flattered.

484
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,580
I might be overrated.

485
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,300
Others may be overrated.

486
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,590
But you

487
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,720
you are not.

488
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,580
My mother

489
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,700
gave her heart

490
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,290
to my father.

491
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
But in the end,

492
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,900
she lost her life.

493
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,660
Since then,

494
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,290
I thought

495
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,070
love was the most hopeless thing

496
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,470
in the world.

497
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,250
I beg to differ.

498
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,660
You once said that

499
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,500
I treat love

500
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,730
as a game,

501
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,160
and I've never given out my heart.

502
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,920
Today, I want to ask you,

503
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,220
if I give my heart

504
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
to you,

505
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,770
do you dare to promise

506
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,120
that you will be faithful for life,

507
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,690
that you will be there fore me forever?

508
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,430
You dare not.

509
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,690
I'm waiting for you to make up your mind.

510
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,940
If you want to

511
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,180
leave me,

512
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,320
then this moment

513
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,440
is your last chance.

514
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,060
What will happen

515
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,440
if I stay?

516
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,280
Let me take you somewhere.

517
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,750
Don't be afraid.

518
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,620
Open your eyes.

519
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,140
It's heavenly.

520
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,060
Do you know

521
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,180
why I

522
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
brought you here?

523
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,840
I want you to know

524
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,860
giving our heart to each other

525
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,020
is just like

526
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,700
us standing here now.

527
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,220
It's dangerous.

528
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,120
But as long as we hold on to each other,

529
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,790
♫ My longing for you runs like an endless song ♫

530
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,740
we can appreciate

531
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,040
this beautiful scenery.

532
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,410
♫ I love you to the moon and back ♫

533
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,980
But if one of us

534
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,490
let go,

535
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,410
♫ I promise to love you always ♫

536
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,280
♫ I never want to say goodbyes to you ♫

537
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,260
♫ You are in my dreams; you are in my heart ♫

538
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,810
then awaits us

539
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:08,300
♫ My untold thoughts. My lovesickness ♫

540
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,130
the doomed fate.

541
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,080
♫ Your love for me is like my love for you ♫

542
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,030
♫ We’ll never feel lonely in the world ♫

543
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,160
♫ I’ll share your wishes in the coming years ♫

544
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:31,190
♫ All the love poems fail to portray my love for you ♫

545
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,190
♫ I promise to take your hand and grow old with you ♫

546
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,900
Your Highness.

547
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,940
Tell me.

548
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,430
Did you find anything?

549
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,330
Your Highness,

550
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,300
a few days ago,

551
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,810
the lady-in-waiting received a letter

552
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,310
from the person

553
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,020
that she sent to help

554
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,170
the Liaison Office,

555
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,300
the Ghost.

556
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,540
We don't know the content of the letter.

557
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,330
But according to the conversations between Lady-in-waiting and Lord Xu,

558
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,270
something must have happened

559
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,050
in Jiangzhou.

560
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,020
Originally,

561
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,700
Lord Xu asked Lady-in-waiting

562
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,020
to inform Your Highness as soon as possible.

563
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,050
But unexpectedly,

564
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,140
the Lady-in-waiting covered it.

565
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,400
She said she needed to think about it.

566
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,700
Think?

567
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,140
She messed up.

568
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,380
What does she need to think about?

569
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,780
We don't know.

570
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,930
It seems that

571
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,980
the Lady-in-waiting is waiting for a chance.

572
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,340
My Jin

573
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,990
is a smart person

574
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,110
who makes plans for herself.

575
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,780
But you're a caged bird,

576
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,980
a toy.

577
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,000
If you

578
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,380
overthink,

579
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,670
plot not for your lord,

580
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,420
and misbehave,

581
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,580
then what's the use

582
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,580
of keeping you?

583
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,790
Take it out.

584
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,239
Your Highness.

585
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,570
Feed it to a stray cat

586
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,800
or a dog.

587
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,100
Yes.

588
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,380
Mind your step.

589
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,830
It's getting late.

590
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,580
Princess,

591
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,880
We need to hurry.

592
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,020
Where are we going?

593
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,840
Going back

594
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,940
to Yejing.

595
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,139
Already?

596
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,820
I mean

597
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,260
it's a rugged road.

598
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,139
What if I'm too tired to walk?

599
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,130
And,

600
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,300
what if I'm following you closely

601
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,940
and get lost in the woods?

602
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,960
What should I do?

603
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,180
Now you won't get lost.

604
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,690
I feel chest tightness suddenly

605
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
and dizzy.

606
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,820
Maybe because I was frightened just now.

607
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,840
Or because I caught cold.

608
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,660
Get to the point.

609
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,530
I'm tired.

610
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,750
I can't walk anymore.

611
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,180
Unless

612
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,660
you let me rest for a while

613
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,560
every three steps.

614
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,740
Maybe

615
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,620
I'll have the strength to walk on.

616
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,060
I'm injured.

617
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,060
Do you want me

618
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,360
to carry you on my back?

619
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,930
How about

620
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,490
we stay for a few more days?

621
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,620
When you are healed,

622
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,940
you can carry me back.

623
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,460
Do you really not want to go back?

624
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,790
We fell off the cliff.

625
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,720
They must thought

626
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,120
we were dead.

627
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,280
We could hide and live in the mountains.

628
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,230
It's fate.

629
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,190
Unfortunately,

630
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,900
I'm on an order.

631
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,790
It's not a game.

632
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Shen Yan,

633
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,020
Is the outside world

634
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,980
that important to you?

635
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,880
Don't you

636
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,930
want to be with me?

637
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,720
Don't you want to stay away from the troubles

638
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,370
and be with me forever?

639
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,740
Ran away for a secret man,

640
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,100
wedded without the parents' blessing.

641
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
You will be my wife.

642
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,740
I don't want you to suffer these.

643
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,360
Are you...

644
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,890
Are you really going to marry me?

645
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,240
Following all the formalities

646
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
with a grand ceremony

647
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,070
in front of the whole world,

648
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,770
When we are back to Yejing,

649
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,810
I’ll think about it.

650
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,730
I still don’t want to go back.

651
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,220
The people and things in Yejing

652
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,810
are too complicated.

653
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,980
I'll be scared there.

654
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,070
And if...

655
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,650
I'll be by your side.

656
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,390
Let's go.

657
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,280
Come up.

658
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,900
You are so gentle.

659
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,010
Why do people call you

660
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,620
the grim King of Hell.

661
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,320
When I was 16,

662
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,950
I worked at the administration of Beidian.

663
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,190
Unlike the Nandian,

664
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,310
Beidian specialized in criminal interrogation and hunting.

665
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,720
I knew

666
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,760
every order

667
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,700
could be the last order.

668
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,060
I fighted for

669
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,770
the slim chance to live.

670
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,040
In a blink of an eye,

671
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,390
seven years have passed.

672
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,340
I was promoted from lieutenancy

673
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,800
to the commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard.

674
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,150
But my comrades,

675
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,430
my mentors,

676
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,690
and the former commander

677
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,300
were no longer alive.

678
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,560
If one's heart turns cold,

679
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,510
his face

680
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,190
will naturally

681
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,110
look grim.

682
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,430
Grim King of Hell

683
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,380
is a close depiction.

684
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,410
It's not.

685
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,070
You may look cold,

686
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,480
but your heart is warm.

687
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,940
Others may not know,

688
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,300
but I do.

689
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,140
Lord Shen

690
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,540
wouldn't like purging.

691
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,500
You are

692
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,830
the son of Duke Shen.

693
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,620
How come you started

694
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,810
from lieutenancy?

695
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,220
I chose my own path.

696
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,640
I'm not as talented as Shen Yu.

697
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,180
If I want to achieve something,

698
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
I will definitely

699
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,110
have to work harder than others.

700
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,060
It's how I learned martial arts and read books when I was little.

701
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,470
It's how it is

702
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,300
when I'm working at Beidian.

703
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,190
Step by step.

704
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,010
Doing it by myself.

705
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,810
That's how I make achievements.

706
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,060
That's how I feel the peace in my mind.
