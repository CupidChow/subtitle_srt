00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,539
Please have some.

10
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,670
Take it away.

11
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
Well, my lord.

12

Look at the food.

14

15

what happened to us

29
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,950
is all because of you.

30

You didn't say a word.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,579
Is that proper?

32
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,820
That's right.

33
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,500
Lord Li,

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,740
what do you mean?

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,600
If you hadn't flirted with ladies

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,380
and offended Princess Changle...

37
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,240
How could Shen Yan

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
collude with her?

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,140
Now Shen Yan

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,210
is openly targeting the Lu's Mansion.

41
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,940
I think

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,460
his joint investigation is fake.

43
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,260
Being jealous with you

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,860
is real.

45
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,740
How did I flirt with ladies?

46
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,780
Alright.

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,750

shows your care about the country and the court.

68
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,380
It's quite sincere.

71
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,060
definitely contribute to such good deed.

75
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,180
I didn't expect

Shan to let Lord Liu of the Ministry of Punishments

77

He has really improved.

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,740
But Shen Yan

81
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,470
is really hard to deal with.

82
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,500
He's determined to be

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,820
against the Lu family.

84
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,220
I wonder

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,140
what that bitch Liu Ling

86
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,540
has done to persuade him.

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,140

88
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,409
I've been anxious

89
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,060
these days.

90
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,460
Do you think the old case in Jiangzhou

91
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,320
can be revealed

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,710
by him?

93
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
You...

94
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,570
I've already asked you to get rid of her.

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,540
You didn't do it

96
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,980
due to her blood of Liu Lishan.

97
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,220
You said

98
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,960
you would definitely watch her closely.

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
In the end,

100
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,500
leaving Princess Changle as a problem.

101
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,820
She first sent the bitch Xu

102
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,820
into the Eastern Palace

103
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,620
and left me not dare do anything.

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,820
Now, she hooked up with Shen Yan.

105
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,460
All of them

106
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,350
have become rivals

107
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,510
of the Family Lu now.

108
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,340
Father.

109
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,780
At this point,

110
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,390
there is no need to talk such nonsense.

111
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,380
Forget it.

is nothing to be afraid of.

I've discussed it with Shan.

115

Can I tell you?

160
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,580
When Pangu created the world,

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,770
a goddess

162
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,140
was granted hundreds of flower seeds by her father.

163
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,200
He ordered her to take the essence of all directions

164

and cultivate them day and night.

165

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,210
After that,

175
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,640
she took the flower leaves

176
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,340
from the fairyland,

177
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,950
and spread them to the world.

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,030
Later in this mortal world,

179
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,090
there are flowers.

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,230
Am I right?

181
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,260
Shen Xiaoyu.

182
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,620
Why do you know everything?

183
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,140
Tell me.

184
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,180
When did you read it?

185
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,500
Why didn't you tell me?

186
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,040
Because I wanted to wait for you to read it

187
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,120
and tell me.

188
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,810
OK. You even slack off in this.

189
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,270
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

190
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,830
Stop running! Stop!

191
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,720
What are you thinking?

192
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,500
It's just

193
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,900
something unimportant.

194
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,430
It's none of your business.

195
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,860
Sit here.

196
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,220
Come here.

197
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,330
Come.

198
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,420
I was wondering who you are.

199
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,820
It turns out to be Commander Shen

200
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,940
who barged into my mansion at midnight.

201
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,020
Even if you are searching for evidence,

202
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,750
it's against the rules, right?

203
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,400
The entire Lu family

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,260
are all related to

205
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,390
the Yue Ling's case.

206
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,610
I knocked on your door just now,

207
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,740
but no one answered.

208
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,380
I was afraid something happened

209
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
in your mansion,

210
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
so I came in to have a look.

211
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,760
You think too much, Lord Shen.

212
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,240
You are so cautious, Mr. Lu.

213
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,550
I'm very satisfied.

214
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,760
But I still have to remind you.

215
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,380
Don’t slack off.

216
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,380
Otherwise,

217
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,970
I won't just come in

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,080
next time.

219
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,780
Okay.

220
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,180
I will keep

221
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,100
your words in mind.

222
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,330
If there's nothing else,

223
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,860
please leave.

224
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,940
Goodbye.

225
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,340
Young Master.

226
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,970
According to your order,

227
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,840
I blew out the candles

228
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,490
when Shen Yan broke into the mansion.

229
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,450
Is there any mistake?

230
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,180
Perfect.

231
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,310
Since he has taken the bait,

232
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,980
we'll just wait for him.

233
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,190
[Thousands of Ships Competing]

234
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,180
It's getting late.

235
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,660
Please leave, Lady-in-waiting Xu.

236
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,980
Staying up late

237
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,320
is not good for health.

238
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,060
I'm not tired.

239
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,730
You don't have to worry about me, Lord.

240
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,860
You misunderstood.

241
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm getting older.

242
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,640
Although you took good care of me today,

243
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,850
I still can't take it.

244
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,100
Since you can't take it,

245
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,230
why don't you go back on your own, Lord?

246
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,180
Look at this.

247
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,490
There is a capable man in the north

248
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,580
called Lu He.

249
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,180
He was originally a descendant of Gongshu.

250
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,410
He was famous for his craftsmanship.

251
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,290
Among the items he built,

252
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,410
there is a treasure box of mechanism.

253
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,380
It's exquisite.

254
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,660
And this.

255
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,590
Look, it's written in this book.

256
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,310
This box is eight inches long.

257
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,600
And three inches deep.

258
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,960
Things can be put inside.

259
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,020
There is gunpowder inside the walls.

260
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,300
If

261
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,460
it is not opened by the Qian and Kun jade together,

262
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
it will explode and destroy itself.

263
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,340
So the Qian and Kun jade

264
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,020
are the keys to this box.

265
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Really?

266
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,500
Shen Xiaoyu.

267
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,910
Is the bag taken by

268
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,820
Commander Shen

269
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,740
from Yun Yi

270
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,540
with you now?

271
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,550
Lu Lianshan.

272
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,550
[Lu Lianshan]

273
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,090
The name on the book

274
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,680
is Lu He.

275
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Could it be that...

276
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,710
they are brothers

277
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,260
or father and son?

278
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,700
Wrong.

279
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,450
They're master and disciple.

280
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,220
You knew it.

281
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,980
What else do you know?

282
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,260
Nothing.

283
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,220
Lu Lianshan

284
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,500
was a master of mechanism,

285
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
the only disciple

286
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,380
of Lu He.

287
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,480
He was best at making secret rooms of mechanism.

288
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,730
A few years ago,

289
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,980
Family Lu recruited him

290
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,990
as a follower.

291
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,700
His Majesty had also thought about

292
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,440
recruiting him to the palace.

293
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,050
Unfortunately,

294
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,060
not long after the imperial edict was issued,

295
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,620
Lu Lianshan had a quick disease

296
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,280
and died suddenly.

297
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,700
You mean Lu Lianshan died?

298
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,820
He died four years

299
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,570
before the Jiangzhou case.

300
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,540
Shen Xiaoyu,

301
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,860
you knew about this long ago.

302
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,780
Why didn't you tell me

303
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,020
about such an important clue?

304
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,070
What else do you know?

305
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,540
No.

306
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,940
No step

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,470
can be skipped.

308
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,060
You...

309
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,350
If I had told you,

310
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,650
I would have taken away

311
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,220
the fun of

312
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,520
discovery and investigation tonight.

313
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,480
Besides,

314
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,820
what can you do

315
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,970
if you know

316
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,220
Lu Lianshan is dead?

317
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,480
The key of the problem

318
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
is not Lu Lianshan.

319
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,700
The problem we should solve now

320
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,250
is to

321
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,840
find the clues

322
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,450
in these books

323
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,440
and deduce that

324
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,870
how Yun Yi, the major criminal of the case

325
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,110
got

326
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,390
the box of mechanism?

327
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,600
Also,

328
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,720
where did he

329
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,050
hide it? )

330
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
Do you think

331
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,780
what I said makes some sense?

332
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,710
Shen Xiaoyu,

333
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,500
you look

334
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,030
just like you did back then,

335
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,430
behaving like you know everything.

336
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,030
Yes.

337
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm nostalgic.

338
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,820
Back then,

339
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,620
the person

340
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,740
with me

341
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,420
got lost.

342
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,420
I'm afraid one day

343
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,700
when she turns around,

344
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,100
she is not able to find me.

345
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,340
So I've been waiting for her to come back

346
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,460
at the same place.

347
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
Today,

348
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,310
I've learned a lot.

349
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,470
Thank

350
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,370
you.

351
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,930
In the future,

352
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,260
I will still bother you.

353
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,500
I'll take my leave.

354
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,100
[Administrator of Beidian]

355
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,260
Lord Shen.

356
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,450
Is Lord Shen here?

357
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,140
Shen...

358
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,260
-Lord Shen. -Miss Ling Bi.

359
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,190
Why are you here?

360
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,930
Princess asked me to come.

361
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,010
Where is Lord Shen?

362
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,650
He is in the back.

363
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,740
I'll get him for you.

364
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,220
OK.

365
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,070
My lord.

366
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,520
My lord, just in time.

367
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,830
Miss Ling Bi is looking for you.

368
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,670
Lord Shen.

369
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,270
What is the progress of

370
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
what I asked Shen Yu to investigate?

371
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,300
My lord,

372
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,590
Lord Shen Yu said

373
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,800
there is progress

374
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,950
in the Jiangzhou City case,

375
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,020
but there's something fishy behind it.

376
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,220
He asked me to tell you

377
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,960
the jade theft case in Lu's mansion

378
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,220
still needs some time.

379
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Keep an eye on him.

380
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,410
If he doesn't reply,

381
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,569
just rush him.

382
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,109
Yes.

383
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,440
I...

384
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,300
Lord Shen.

385
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,069
Her Highness

386
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,230
worries about your stomach disease.

387
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,020
So she visited the imperial physician in the palace

388
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,430
and asked for this prescription.

389
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,590
According to the medical instructions,

390
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,880
she spent hours

391
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,840
on the medicine.

392
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,540
Please drink it while it's hot.

393
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,220
Don't make

394
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,950
our princess's effort a waste.

395
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,430
Thank you.

396
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,150
Send a message for me

397
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,600
after you are back.

398
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,500
Thank you.

399
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,710
No, no, no.

400
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,620
My lord,

401
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,070
I have something

402
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,030
to tell you.

403
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,940
Go ahead.

404
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,860
Her Highness hasn't eaten anything all day.

405
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,750
She's just worried about your health.

406
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,790
Since I was young,

407
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,260
I've been with her.

408
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,610
In my opinion,

409
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,090
she has never paid so much attention to anyone

410
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,500
like you.

411
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,900
She

412
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,620
is child-like sometimes

413
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,900
and willful.

414
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,620
So,

415
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,930
please don't take it seriously, my lord.

416
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,240
Don't argue with the princess anymore.

417
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
OK?

418
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,070
Are you done?

419
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,250
Yes.

420
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,210
If there's nothing else,

421
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,010
please leave.

422
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,350
Luo Fan.

423
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,110
Miss Ling Bi.

424
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,720
Please leave.

425

[Dinghua Gate]

426
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,150
Why are you here

427
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,990
at the Eastern Palace, everyone?

428
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,430
I want to

429
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,850
submit a complaint of

430
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,810
Shen Yan, the commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard.

431
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,940
Shen Yan?

432
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,040
Duke Lu,

433
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,290
don't take it to heart.

434
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,150
I know Shen Yan

435
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,030
is usually reckless in words.

436
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,510
He must have offended you.

437
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,840
It doesn't matter.

438
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,810
I will remember

439
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,810
what you said.

440
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,180
Pass my order.

441
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,700
Let Shen Yan come in person

442
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,270
to apologize to Duke Lu.

443
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,130
Yes.

444
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,020
If it's normal,

445
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,810
I'm willing to

446
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,860
solve it privately with Commander Shen.

447
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,460
But today,

448
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,050
what I want to discuss

449
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,580
is not the personal grudge between Shen Yan and Family Lu.

450
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,300
It really concerns

451
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,530
the safety of the Imperial Court of Wei.

452
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
You

453
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,960
and Shen

454
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,690
are both pillars of Wei State.

455
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,220
Were your

456
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,810
words too serious?

457
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,240
Your Grace is wise.

458
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,660
The ministers and I

459
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,860
thought Shen Yan is someone

460
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,910
Your Grace values,

461
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,140
so we tolerated him for a long time.

462
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
But we didn't expect him

463
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,140
to be domineering

464
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,140
and disrupt the court.

465
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,850
I'm afraid

466
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,310
I'm not the only one to accuse him today.

467
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,010
Please read it.

468
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,090
[Memorial to the throne]

469
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,190
I understand

470
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,570
your wishes.

471
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,140
Let me think about it.

472
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,750
We'll discuss it later.

473
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,860
Your Grace.

474
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,020
A group of scholars and officials have gathered outside the palace,

475
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,410
saying the Jin Lin Military Camp is too domineering.

476
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,500
If this continues,

477
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,820
it will definitely bring disaster to Wei.

478
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,020
If Your Grace does not

479
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,460
discharge Shen Yan from his position

480
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,780
to appease the public today,

481
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,220
they will kneel forever.

482
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,470
If Your Grace insists on doing it in your wish,

483
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,560
for the sake of Wei,

484
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,740
they will...

485
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,910
Say it.

486
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,790
Yes.

487
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,920
They can only go to the palace

488
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,290
to disturb His Majesty.

489
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,100
Everyone,

490
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,590
you are all officials.

491
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
If you ask for truth,

492
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,460
there will be conflicts.

493
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,590
Today,

494
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,420
I punish Shen Yan because...

495
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,330
First, he didn't do his job well.

496
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,580
Second,

497
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,130
my father was too tired

498
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,080
and recuperated in the palace.

499
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,680
I

500
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,710
don't want to

501
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,820
disturb him with the heart of a good son.

502
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,900
If you insist,

503
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,700
Duke Lu,

504
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,080
I'm afraid

505
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,240
the result won't satisfy you either.

506
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,940
Duke Lu,

507
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,850
what do you think?

508
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,020
Your Grace is wise.

509
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,750
Lords,

510
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,580
please leave.

511
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,110
Ling,

512
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:43,890
look.

513
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,130
The dishes newly pickled by the kitchen

514
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,200
are delicious.

515
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,590
And the steamed egg.

516
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,380
It's refreshing.

517
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,980
Eat more.

518
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,840
Thank you, grandpa.

519
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,700
Ling.

520
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,580
When you were a child,

521
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,330
you lived here

522
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,740
for so long.

523
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,420
I didn't see

524
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,330
you care so much about me.

525
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,100
You've known Shen Yan only for a few days.

526
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,690
And you…

527
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,340
Just because your uncle

528
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,780
doesn't allow you to meet him,

529
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,820
you don't eat or drink,

530
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,150
to show your anger to us?

531
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,460
Grandpa,

532
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,670
you doesn't allow me to see Shen Yan,

533
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,670
so I won't see him?

534
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,340
In your heart,

535
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,020
am I such an obedient girl?

536
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,620
That's true.

537
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,060
Look at you.

538
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,650
Grandpa,

539
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,090
you are the closest person to me

540
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,290
in this world.

541
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,620
How can I be angry with you?

542
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,850
I don't see Shen Yan now

543
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,690
because

544
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,370
I have something on my mind.

545
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,140
Before I see and think it through,

546
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,960
I can't and I don't dare to see him.

547
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740
No matter what happens,

548
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,270
it's right not to see him.

549
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,960
If you can't figure it out,

550
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,560
just stop thinking about it.

551
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,150
I think Shen Yan

552
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
is just an ordinary man.

553
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,020
Look.

554
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,300
There are many good

555
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,180
aristocratic young men

556
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,820
in the capital.

557
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,570
Later...

558
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,620
Later, I'll find you

559
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,700
an unparalleled man

560
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,680
to be your husband.

561
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,500
-No, no, no. - Then you can live

562
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,980
a carefree life.

563
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,380
I'll choose

564
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,780
my own husband by myself.

565
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,390
You can't do that.

566
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,940
Why not?

567
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,420
I'll find a few more for her to choose from.

568
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,020
Isn't it okay?

569
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,620
Right?

570
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,820
Grandpa,

571
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,980
if for such a good man

572
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,140
as Shen Yan,

573
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,780
I can't love him

574
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,140
sincerely,

575
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,580
maybe no one

576
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,290
in this world

577
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,880
can be loved by me that sincerely.

578
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,520
Father.

579
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,630
Father!

580
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,820
Bad news!

581
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,090
Bad news, father!

582
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,940
What's wrong?

583
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,000
Why are you in such a panic?

584
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,500
Sit down and talk.

585
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,900
How dared this old man

586
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,790
argue with me face to face!

587
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,060
He has gone too far!

588
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,620
Your Grace,

589
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
don't blame yourself

590
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,200
for others' mistakes?

591
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,210
How is the investigation

592
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,960
about the jade?

593
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,540
Although there's some progress,

594
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,300
we need to figure out

595
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,540
the whole story.

596
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,680
It will take some time.

597
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,980
Even the Lu Family

598
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,260
dared to fight with Shen Yan.

599
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,390
We don't have much time

600
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,890
for us.

601
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,510
I will make haste

602
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,890
and find

603
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,620
the evidence of the case of Jiangzhou soon

604
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,020
to relieve your worries.

605
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,060
Please be patient, Your Grace.

606
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,100
After all,

607
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,810
when two armies are facing each other,

608
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,070
what we need to compare

609
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,590
is always patience.

610
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,890
The Double Seventh Festival is coming, right?

611
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,620
Yes.

612
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,300
I've been busy with the case of Jiangzhou recently.

613
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,100
I can't help

614
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,780
feeling agitated.

615
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,270
The Double Seventh Festival is coming.

616
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,110
Jin,

617
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,660
come with me

618
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,430
to go to the street then.

619
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,820
No.

620
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,520
Your kindness to me

621
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,820
has aroused much gossip

622
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,660
in the palace.

623
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,530
His Majesty has always disliked this matter.

624
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,040
He has already reminded you

625
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,240
for countless times.

626
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,280
So,

627
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,110
if Your Grace and I go out of

628
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,920
the palace for a date privately,

629
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,540
and His Majesty hears about it,

630
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,650
it's very likely that

631
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,220
we'll be criticized again.

632
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,830
So what?

633
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,640
Jin,

634
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,940
you are the woman I like.

635
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
As long as you are loyal to me,

636
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,780
I won't be harsh on you.

637
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,060
Don't worry

638
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,070
about this matter.

639
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,980
I'll plan it carefully.

640
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,970
By then,

641
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,470
just follow my arrangement.

642
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,710
Thank you, Your Grace.

643
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,860
It's been more than ten years.

644
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,940
This old man still wants to use the tactic

645
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,740
of internal strife in the court.

646
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,240
He thought

647
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,920
the Crown Prince was weak and could be easily bullied.

648
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,790
He doesn't know

649
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,570
he has mistaken a tiger for a cat.

650
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,280
He will suffer a big loss sooner or later.

651
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,320
Father.

652
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,360
I don't know if he'll suffer a great loss.

653
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,980
Anyway,

654
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,180
if they are going to deal with Shen Yan,

655
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,820
they'll be miserable.

656
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,360
Who are you talking about?

657
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,640
No one.

658
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,880
I need to go out.

659
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,160
Sit down.

660
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,150
If you go to the Lu family like this,

661
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,300
it's exactly what they want.

662
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,660
If he turns you in later,

663
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,340
you'll still suffer.

664
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,580
If you do this,

665
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,410
not only will you not help,

666
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,320
but also implicate Shen Dian.

667
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,720
You'll even put more burden on him,

668
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,820
making his situation more difficult.

669
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,540
Yes.

670
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,660
You're a girl.

671
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
-If you go there so early... -You...

672
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,980
Father,

673
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,750
you have foresight.

674
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,010
You know

675
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,340
Shen Yan is unreliable.

676
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,810
Father, let's eat.

677
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,110
The dishes are getting cold.

678
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,910
I'm not eating.

679
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,020
I'm so angry.

680
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,550
Take all the dishes away.

681
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,230
Your Highness,

682
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,780
are we going to Lu's Mansion?

683
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,790
Grandpa is right.

684
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,470
It's not good to go to the Lu's Mansion

685
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,270
at this time.

686
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,570
But Shen Yan is in difficulty,

687
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,770
and I can't ignore it.

688
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,460
What are you going to do?

689
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,860
I'll go find Jin.

690
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,940
She's so smart.

691
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,320
She must know what to do.

692
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Don't go with me.

693
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,570
Keep an eye on the kitchen today.

694
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,770
Prepare Lord Shen's breakfast, lunch and dinner,

695
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,590
and his medicine

696
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,540
carefully.

697
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,900
Send them to

698
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,040
the administration of Beidian on time.

699
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,770
Understand?

700
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,950
Okay.

701
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,040
By the way,

702
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,220
there's an old ginseng in the kitchen.

703
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,890
Make soup with it,

704
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,490
and send it to Lord Shen, too.

705
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,510
He has stomach disease.

706
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,740
Don't let him starve.

707
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,490
Understand?

708
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,740
I got it.

709
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,980
Don't forget.

710
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,700
Don't worry, Your Highness.

711
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,190
I'm sorry to make you

712
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,900
suffer it this time.

713
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,790
But

714
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,860
don't worry.

715
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,000
The Lu family

716
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,410
is just

717
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,810
being complacent for time being.

718
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,940
Lord Han,

719
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,670
the testimony of Yue Ling's case

720
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,590
is all here.

721
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,440
Please check it, Lord Han.

722
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,480
I can't disobey His Majesty's order.

723
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,940
Just take it as a lesson to gain wisdom.

724
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,280
Don't take it to heart.

725
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,800
In the next few days,

726
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,710
you can

727
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,030
work for Luo Fan.

728
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,990
Yes.

729
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,750
I knew it.

730
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,230
Your Highness.

731
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,730
Lady-in-waiting Xu,

732
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,130
you are really punctual.

733
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Why is there so much dust?

734
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,060
Are these files

735
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,350
even older

736
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,610
than me?

737
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,860
A little older.

738
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,700
In terms of age,

739
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,160
these books here

740
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,860
can probably be as old

741
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,930
as your grandpa.

742
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,040
Your Highness,

743
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
be careful.

744
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,690
If the old paper

745
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,920
gets broken, shredded

746
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,410
or even turned into ashes on the spot,

747
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,370
and

748
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,620
it happens to get the record

749
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,910
of some key words on it,

750
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,100
we can only blame

751
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,670
Shener is so unlucky.

752
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,250
You...

753
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,360
Stop laughing.

754
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,930
Didn't we agree

755
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,190
you should come alone?

756
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,990
Why did you bring someone else?

757
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,930
Ling cares about your brother.

758
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,820
She knew he had been framed by the Lu Family

759
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
so she hurriedly came to me,

760
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,390
and asked me to find a solution for her.

761
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,140
After thinking about it,

762
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,580
I'm afraid

763
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,670
only the Jiangzhou case can help him.

764
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,620
Shen Yu,

765
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,550
I don't want to disturb you.

766
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,570
But Shen Yan is in trouble now.

767
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,010
If I don't do anything,

768
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,500
I'll feel very sorry.

769
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,700
There are so many files.

770
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,820
If we want to find some clues

771
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,940
among them,

772
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,610
it's like fishing for a needle in the ocean.

773
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,260
More people, more helping hands.

774
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,660
It's always a good thing.

775
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,400
If you have any complaint,

776
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,720
for the sake of your brother,

777
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
swallow it.

778
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,310
You're sharp-tongued and eloquent.

779
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,870
Poor Shener.

780
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,500
He will suffer in the future.

781
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,590
You are not the one to live with me.

782
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,850
None of your business.

783
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,590
[The Administration of Beidian]

784
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,100
Is Lieutenant Shen Yan here?

785
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,590
Aren't they from the Ministry of Punishments?

786
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,990
What are they doing here?

787
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,830
I don't know.

788
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,140
The Ministry of Punishments is busy.

789
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,660
The files collected

790
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
have piled up.

791
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,340
Lord Shen has put down the burden

792
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,770
of 14,000 households.

793
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,660
You must have a lot of free time.

794
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,020
Since we are both officials,

795
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,820
we must do our best

796
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,160
to help His Highness

797
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,980
and the court to get over difficulties.

798
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,230
Thinking of this place,

799
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,840
I went to

800
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,670
the Eastern Palace today

801
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,340
and asked for an edict

802
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,120
which allows Shen Yan to assist the Ministry of Punishments to investigate the old case.

803
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,280
This is the order of the Eastern Palace.

804
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,320
Commander Shen,

805
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,130
do you want to take a look?

806
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:57,770
No need.

807
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,280
I accept the edict.

808
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,980
Lieutenant Shen,

809
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,870
don't you like investigating cases very much?

810
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,100
These are some mystery cases without clues

811
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,000
which remain unsolved in the Ministry of Punishments for so long.

812
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
You're asked to handle these things,

813
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,610
and that suits your preference.

814
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,100
It's perfect.

815
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,219
I've put down the files.

816
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,550
Lieutenant, you have to hurry up.

817
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,280
Don’t let me down.

818
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,100
Goodbye.

819
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,630
I think

820
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,440
they are trying to provoke us,

821
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,909
and give us a hard time.

822
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,690
My lord,

823
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,260
tell me.

824
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,179
There are so many old cases.

825
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,380
In your opinion,

826
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,900
what should we do?

827
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,270
This happened because of me.

828
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,949
I'll take full responsibility.

829
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,980
After I read

830
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,330
these files,

831
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,510
I'll ask Captain Luo to have a look.

832
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,110
No.

833
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,980
No, my lord.

834
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,570
Don't make fun of me.

835
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,880
My lord. My lord.

836
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,220
What are you waiting for?

837
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,100
You really want him to carry them?

838
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,580
Hurry up. Move them in.

839
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,020
My lord.

840
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,300
Looks like

841
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,320
they are all files about eating and going to toilets.

842
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,630
Why is the administration of Nandian

843
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,870
so unprofessional?

844
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,170
Such work is like fishing for a needle in the ocean,

845
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,650
which requires patience,

846
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,240
and Your Highness surely can't do it.

847
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,740
Instead of suffering like this,

848
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,220
why don't you go home early

849
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,020
and have a good sleep?

850
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,790
Yesterday, you said

851
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,360
the problem of this case

852
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,280
is to find clues

853
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
to deduce

854
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,560
how Yun Yi got the treasure box,

855
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,940
and

856
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,020
where he would hide the treasure box.

857
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,350
But I've

858
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,840
searched all these books,

859
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,120
and there's no clue.

860
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,280
Did you find anything today?

861
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,150
Give Ling and me some advice.

862
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,260
This is difficult.

863
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,190
I've been investigating Lu Lianshan's background

864
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,190
repeatedly

865
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,130
for a few times.

866
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,830
Unfortunately,

867
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
this person

868
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,190
didn't live for long.

869
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,420
After entering the capital,

870
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,680
he lived in seclusion.

871
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,640
I've checked all the men who had contact with him

872
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
when he was alive.

873
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,150
None of them

874
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,200
has any connection

875
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,400
with the later Yun Yi.

876
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,950
Only after Lu Lianshan died

877
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,300
did Yun Yi enter Yejing.

878
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,040
If we can't find anyone

879
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,500
associated with him,

880
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,450
I'm afraid you can't solve

881
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,040
these two problems.

882
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,500
What Yun Yi and Lu Lianshan?

883
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,990
The alive and the dead?

884
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,510
I know you two

885
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,740
grew up together.

886
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,550
But I'm still here.

887
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,400
Can you say something

888
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,680
I can understand?

889
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,320
-Your Highness. -Ling.

890
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,060
What did you say?

891
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,640
I said you two grew up together.

892
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,510
The former sentence.

893
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,060
What Yun Yi and Lu Lianshan?

894
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,350
The alive and the dead?

895
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,400
The alive.

896
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,410
The dead.

897
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,820
Yun Yi's records in Yeching

898
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,800
started from

899
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,950
the spring of the 28th year of the Dawei Dynasty.

900
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,560
Lu Lianshan was seriously ill

901
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,360
and died suddenly.

902
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,090
It happened in the 27th year of the Dawei Dynasty.

903
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,840
The stolen silver in Jiangzhou

904
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,950
was of a large amount.

905
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,950
It's necessary to

906
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,510
hide the stolen silver

907
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,140
in somewhere safe and secret.

908
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,970
Lu Lianshan was most skilled at

909
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,400
making traps and building secret rooms.

910
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,270
In that case,

911
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,730
Yun Yi's real identity

912
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,190
is Lu Lianshan.

913
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,820
Wait!

914
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,220
So,

915
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,770
you mean

916
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,460
Lu Lianshan was a follower of the Lu family,

917
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,190
and he faked his death because of illness.

918
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,520
Then he became the martial artist, Yun Yi.

919
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,010
He went to your Xu Family

920
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,620
and became your father's attendant.

921
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,820
That's right.

922
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,850
After a few years,

923
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,210
Yun Yi perpetrated

924
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,680
the robbery of the treasury in Jiangzhou,

925
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,630
so as to spare himself of the suspicion.

926
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,960
Then it became logical.

927
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,910
The dead is gone.

928
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,390
Instead of worrying about the past,

929
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,870
why don't you guess

930
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,270
where the box of Qian and Kun jade

931
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,550
with evidence inside

932
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,920
is hidden?

933
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,340
Xuanwu Town.

934
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,350
Yun Yi, or Lu Lianshan could only

935
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,910
entrust something important

936
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,020
to his master

937
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,910
Lu He, a master of mechanisms.

938
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,860
Are you sure

939
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,460
they are the same person?

940
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,090
We'll know if it's true or not after testing it.

941
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:48,660
Test?

942
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,260
How?

943
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,220
Lord Shen.

944
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,330
Captain Luo.

945
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,130
Thank you.

946
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,550
My lord,

947
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,300
don't make fun of me.

948
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,720
Let our men do

949
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,200
these trivial matters as filing documents.

950
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,940
Isn't the princess very considerate?

951
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
she worries you'll be tired from sitting here for a long time.

952
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,500
She has prepared a cushion for you.

953
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,690
Have a seat, my lord.

954
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,430
sit down, my lord.

955
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,450
-My lord. -Captain Luo.

956
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,060
You must be tired after a busy day.

957
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,620
Look.

958
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,850
All of them were sent by Miss Ling Bi

959
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,560
to you under the princess' order.

960
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,620
Please taste them.

961
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,090
My lord, this tea is too strong.

962
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,140
Her Highness said

963
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,490
she was afraid it would hurt your stomach,

964
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,460
so she had prepared best-quality

965
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,540
Pu'er tea for you.

966
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,090
-I'll change it for you now. -I don't need it.

967
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,060
And this medicine.

968
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,520
My lord.

969
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,490
Her Highness also asked Miss Ling Bi to sent it...

970
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,740
Anything else?

971
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,050
Her Highness has ordered

972
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,540
you have to

973
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,360
drink it while it's hot.

974
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,410
I know.

975
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,970
Hurry up. Let's go.

976
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,850
What is the princess

977
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,780
busy with today?

978
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,320
We've arrived.

979
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,300
Okay.

980
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:24,950
Let's go.

981
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,780
It's not a visit to a park at night.

982
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,380
I don't understand

983
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,450
why you two ladies

984
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,750
follow me here.

985
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,410
-The case of Jiangzhou concerns the innocence of the Xu family. -Be careful.

986
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,130
How can I

987
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
not handle it myself?

988
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,490
In that case,

989
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,110
why does the princess

990
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,260
also handle the case by herself?

991
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,300
I just don't want to let

992
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,260
you and Jin

993
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,340
be alone together.

994
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
Is that okay?

995
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,660
Of course.

996
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,950
To come here alone

997
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,840
in the middle of the night

998
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,320
to dig a grave,

999
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,400
it's better

1000
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,480
-to have more helping hands. -Help me to go forward.

1001
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
[Lu Lianshan]

1002
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,270
Lu Lianshan.

1003
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,370
Your Highness.

1004
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,410
You go.

1005
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
For Jin's sake.

1006
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,280
Not an empty coffin.

1007
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,500
That means Lu Lianshan

1008
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,630
is really dead.

1009
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,930
Not necessarily.

1010
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,120
Although I don't know

1011
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,420
who is in this coffin,

1012
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,610
it's definitely not Lu Lianshan.

1013
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,380
How do you know?

1014
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,870
Come and have a look.

1015
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,640
Ling, do you know

1016
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,550
Yun Yi...

1017
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,810
No.

1018
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,990
Lu Lianshan.

1019
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,370
He accidentally broke his right leg

1020
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,100
while fulfilling a task for our Xu Family.

1021
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
It took him a long time to recover.

1022
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,250
Even if a broken bone heals,

1023
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,850
and the movement is as usual,

1024
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,040
there will be traces of regeneration

1025
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,520
around the cured part.

1026
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,840
Either the bones aren't connected rightly,

1027
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,320
or this part feels rougher

1028
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,700
than other intact parts.

1029
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,500
But look.

1030
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,660
His leg bones are smooth and complete.

1031
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,860
Is there any trace that I've mentioned?

1032
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,790
So

1033
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,780
Lu Lianshan is Yun Yi?

1034
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:37,910
That's right.

1035
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,850
Since Yun Yi's true identity has been verified,

1036
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,870
we can solve the Jiangzhou case,

1037
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,220
and bring down the Lu family

1038
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,180
soon.

1039
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,970
Then Shen Yan...

1040
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,420
Don't worry.

1041
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,020
For the Jiangzhou case,

1042
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,130
we can only trust the Jinlin Guard

1043
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,390
in the Eastern Palace.

1044
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,570
For your Lord Shen,

1045
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,360
I think

1046
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,980
he'll be assigned with an important task soon.

1047
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,150
Lord Shen will have to

1048
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,580
restore the tomb

1049
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,580
in case that the information should be leaked,

1050
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,910
and the Lu Family should guard against it.

1051
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,860
Indeed, an able man is always busy,

1052
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,100
and a busy man suffers a lot.
