According to Duke Lu,

the six statements

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,470
interrogated by Shen Yu.

Duke Lu refused to admit them.

God can see it.

11
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,070
You could have fooled me.

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,090
I have

13
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,410
a witness.

14
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,140
I wonder

15
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,900
if you admit it

16
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,750

What benefits did you get?

20
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,340
How dare you collude with outsiders

21
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,340
to frame your family.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Family?

23
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,860
I am an illegitimate and humble child.

24
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,060
When did I ever

25
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,540
become one in Lu's family?

26
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,420

I heard

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,300
you want to report

34
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,180
your grandfather's crime.

35
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,350
Is that true?

36
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,070
Yes.

37
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,090
The crimes Lu family has committed

38
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,380
are innumerable.

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,660
I didn't report it

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,820
considering the family relations.

41
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,900
Not long ago,

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,450
I found that my grandfather

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,020
colluded with Yigu.

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,820
He stole the official silver from Wei

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,220
and put the blame on the officials of the court.

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,740
That's why I decided

47
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,350
to help Wei

48
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,079

about my grandfather's evil deeds.

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
I got the

52
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,980
evidence of Lu's Corruption

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,790

in Yigu

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,550

It turns out that Jin is back.

Since I came back from the north,

to relieve the worries of Your Majesty.

110
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,580
Then tell me

111
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,500
why I'm worried?

112
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,400
Your Majesty wants to take back

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,860
the silver lost in Jiangzhou to make contributions.

114
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,820
Unfortunately,

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,060
the stolen silver fell

116
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,390
within Yigu.

117
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,580
That's a bunch of wolves who won't let their mouths go when they smell a bit of meat.

who won't let their mouths go when they smell a bit of meat.

119
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,520
If the official documents

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,890
ask someone to ask for it,

121
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,980
I'm afraid

122
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,220
it won't be able to get even a single piece of silver.

123
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,420
If it comes in secret,

124
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,380
just send a few trustworthy henchmen

125
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,220
to smuggle them,

126
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,680
it would not be difficult.

127
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,860
But I'm afraid

128
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,020
once we Wei people enter,

129
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,340
within Yigu,

130
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,440
it will attract their attention.

131
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,940
and end up

132
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,340
without getting any silver.

133
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,060
Not to mention,

134
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,940
we people might

135
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,370
be blamed by Yigu

136
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,800
and be slandered for Wei's evil intentions.

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,390
Then Wei may become unreasonable instead.

138
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,820
It is a dilemma.

139

It is worrying, isn't it?

very delight.

144

I

146
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,810
should I do?

147
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,540
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

148
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,270
Because the money

149
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,360
has fallen into

taking the lead,

154
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,360
you must have strategized a lot

Jin.

156
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,380
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

What I want

158

is that

Sister Ling

160
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,940

With Your Majesty's help,

162
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,180
when Shen Yan returns with the treasury silver,

163
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,620
the credit of knowing people and making good use of them

164
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,540
must be attributed to Your Majesty.

165
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,600
As soon as the Xu family was rebelled,

166
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,630
you immediately turned around to help others.

167
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,300
You are so heartless.

168
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,350
I'm really sad.

169
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,620
Your Majesty, you're exaggerating.

170
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,220
Shen Yan comes out this time

171
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,590
to escort the envoy.

172
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,720
Whether Liu Ling gets married or not,

173

Shen Yan is going to report back.

Why do you think

176
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,540
I would do it?

177
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,420
Our Wei Dynasty established a country with martial arts.

00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,280
Unfortunately,

179
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,210
His Majesty is too old to avoid war.

180
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,710
That's why the Eastern Palace

181
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,560
has been without military success for many years.

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,170
If your Majesty want to inherit the throne,

183
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,300
you would criticized by the generals.

184
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,480
Now is the best opportunity,

185
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,520
Your Majesty.

186
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,620
If

187
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,700
ask Lu Mingshan to send a message to Tuoba Lie,

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,820
just tell him

189
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,220
the money

190
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,659
Lu's stole from Wei

191
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,580
has been obtained by the escort team.

192
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,580
In the name of escorting the bride,

193
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,420
to transport the silver back to Wei secretly

194
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,660
is the real purpose of the escorting team.

195
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,850
What do your Majesty think

196
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,380
that Tuoba Lie's reaction?

197
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Yigu

198
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,200
has always been poor.

199
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,510
and lack of military funds.

200
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,460
These are the reasons

201
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,990
they refuse to send troops.

202
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,460
There is no reason not to eat

203
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,520
tens of millions of

204
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,140
taels of silver.

205
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,970
That's right.

206
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,930
Yigu is greedy.

207
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,180
If they want money and people,

208
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,710
they will definitely benefit from the escort team.

209
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,750
In this way,

210
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,820
Yigu

211
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,440
will disregard the kindness of Wei

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
stabilizing the border.

213
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,350
and show their disloyal heart.

214
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,330
In this way,

215
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,980
the battle your Majesty want

216
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,780
will come.

217
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,789
The timing is fleeting.

218
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,440
If Your Majesty

219
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,880
miss the opportunity,

220
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,780
it's hard know

221
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,580
how long to wait for the next one.

222
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,200
Your Majesty's effort

223
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,130
can not only fulfill Ling and Shen Yan,

224
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,660
but also fulfill yourself.

225
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,380
Good things come in pairs.

226
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,490
Why not do it?

227
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,860
Jin,

228
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,780
you're really smart.

229
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,220
But even so,

230
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,850
you should know

231
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,420
One infidelity

232
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,220
will make it impossible for others to continue to believe him.

233
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,530
Do you think

234
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,140
it's worth giving up your splendid future

235
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,290
for Liu Ling?

236
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,920
I don't want a splendid future .

237
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,380
In this world,

238
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,720
someone values love,

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,180
and others value profits.

240
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,820
Whether it's worth it or not,

241
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,980
only the guy drinking water knows it's cold or hot.

242
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,540
Your Majesty is busy,

243
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,740
I'll take my leave.

244
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,570
Guards!

245
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,380
Get Lu Mingshan here.

246
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,250
OK.

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,670
[A boat on a river]

248
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,520
You're back.

249
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,610
Your Majesty.

250
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,180
Your Majesty.

251
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,500
did you order to strike camp?

252
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,580
No need.

253
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,530
I've left the camp for days.

254
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,460
I need to rest.

255
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,740
Tell them

256
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,410
to prepare the banquet.

257
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,980
Serve the soldiers of Wei.

258
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,740
Are you deaf?

259
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,640
Yes.

260
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,700
Your Majesty.

261
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,300
Why did you invite them?

262
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,300
Later,

263
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
take them to the back of the tent.

264
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,390
Take them all there.

265
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,540
Your Majesty.

266
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,940
Wei people are doing all kinds of tricks.

267
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,830
Why are you so polite

268
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,820
to them?

269
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,450
Have you heard that

270
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,370
if you want something,

271
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,920
you must give it first?

272
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,500
I don't understand.

273
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,410
I told you to read more.

274
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,940
I received a secret letter from Lu Mingshan.

275
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,880
Wei's escort team

276
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,940
not only escorts the princess,

277
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,660
but also escorts

278
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,170
tens of millions taels of silver.

279
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,890
tens of millions taels

280
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,690
Ah!

281
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,350
I reported this news

282
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,910
to Father immediately.

283
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,130
Guess what he said.

284
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,200
What did he say?

285
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,110
Wei

286
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,020
knows

287
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,620
we are lack of military pay,

288
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,970
and sends it here.

289
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,890
The money is ours.

290
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,020
Princess.

291
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,220
is also ours.

292
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,660
At night,

293
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,830
treat Wei army soldiers well tonight.

294
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,660
When they are so drunk

295
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,900
that can't get up,

296
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,750
kill them.

297
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
Tie

298
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,900
Liu Lling.

299
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,350
And take him here.

300
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,840
Look.

302
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,600
Not bad.

303
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,620
Your Majesty.

304
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,820
Your Majesty.

305
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,750
Mu Kun.

306
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,260
How is the wine

307
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,300
you prepared for Wei Army?

308
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,690
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

309
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,010
No matter who

310
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,300
No matter who it is,

311
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,380
as long as he drinks this bowl,

312
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
and

313
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,850
comes in and out,

314
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,190
I'm sure he won't even say a word.

315
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,060
Here.

316
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,350
Your Majesty.

317
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,950
Bad news!

318
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,300
Your Majesty.

319
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
Those Wei people ran away on horses.

320
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,000
Your Majesty.

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,460
Those Wei people just escaped.

322
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,520
They won't get far.

323
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll go after them now.

324
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,970
We will catch up.

325
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,770
Your Majesty.

326
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,460
Your Majesty.

327
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,140
General.

328
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,600
Our horse was drugged.

329
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,670
and had diarrhea.

330
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,890
It can't run anymore.

331
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,140
It must be the Wei people's scheme.

332
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,270
I want to see

333
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,980
how capable they are.

334
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,550
Luo Fan.

335
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,150
I’m afraid.

336
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,110
Don't be afraid.

337
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,770
I'm here,

338
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,930
no one can touch you.

339
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,340
Ling Bi.

340
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,450
This is for you.

341
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,300
I bought it at the market Qiao that day.

342
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,500
But I never had a chance to give it to you.

343
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,500
I don't know

344
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,360
if I have the chance in the future.

345
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,180
If

346
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,760
we get through today,

347
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,570
Will you...

348
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,500
Is it beautiful?

349
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,580
Yes.

350
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,870
Princess.

351
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,810
Don't be afraid.

352
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,700
You want

353
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,250
me to go alone, don't you?

354
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,670
I told you I won't leave you.

355
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,740
No matter life or death,

356
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
I will go

357
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,750
wherever you go.

358
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,780
Kill!

359
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,010
Kill!

360
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,900
No regrets.

361
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,210
I said

362
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,690
I won't divorce you.

363
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,859
you can't give up.

364
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,859
So of course,

365
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,990
I will not leave you.

366
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,460
Fine.

367
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,220
If you don't leave me,

368
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,600
I won't.

369
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,260
Shen Yan,

370
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,580
Is this all part of your plan?

371
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,720
Yes.

372
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,260
Princess were in a hurry to express her feelings.

373
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,180
If I had

374
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,260
talked too much,

375
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,590
if I talked too much, that would be too untactful.

376
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,530
Retreat.

377
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,460
Princess,

378
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,580
I've repaid you

379
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,800
for saving my life.

380
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,150
I'll keep that in mind.

381
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,820
Take care.

382
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,780
Goodbye.

383
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,130
Your Highness,

384
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,720
we should go back.

385
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,310
Lord Shen.

386
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,950
When did you

387
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,430
get the money back?

388
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,580
I'm with you every day.

389
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,690
I didn't know that!

390
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,730
It

391
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,260
was arranged by your Jin.

392
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,850
When I went to Jiangzhou to look for you,

393
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,420
she gave me

394
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,970
the map of the house that kept the silver.

395
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,430
On the way to the marriage,

396
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,940
when you procrastinated,

397
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,520
I ordered my men

398
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,710
to move the money away.

399
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,190
By the way, she also said

400
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,660
this is

401
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,780
a gift for your wedding.

402
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,940
Wedding?

403
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,320
You didn't even

404
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,630
ask for His Majesty.

405
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,430
Where did the wedding come from?

406
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,740
Your Majesty's sister Peace.

407
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,950
I'm Shen Yan.

408
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

409
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,060
Please get up.

410
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,490
Thank you, Your Majesty.

411
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,170
Both of you are safe.

412
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,280
I am

413
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
finally reassured.

414
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,040
Announce the edict.

415
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,020
Princess Peace, Liu Ling,

416
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,300
Jin Lin Military Camp,

417
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,250
Commander of the administration of Beidian,

418
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,420
receive the edict.

419
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,600
Under the heavens' blessing, the emperor decrees that

420
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,210
Yigu extended its wild ambitions

421
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,120
and disregarded the peace of Wei.

422
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,940
They should be executed.

423
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,080
Fortunately, the Princess Peace is virtuous

424
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,440
and fearless of danger,

425
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,260
so that we won't disgrace Wei's great prestige.

426
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,960
Besides,

427
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,800
Commander of the administration of Beidian

428
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,720
is loyal and courageous.

429
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,860
He retrieved the stolen treasury silver in the enemy line,

430
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,120
protected the princess

431
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,910
and returned safely.

432
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,370
He deserves great merits.

433
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,390
A martyr and a loyal woman are made in heaven.

434
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,030
In order to bring a romance to a happy ending,

435
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,830
I allow Princess Peace

436
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,200
to marry Commander Shen Yan.

437
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,870
I hope you two can love and respect each other

438
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,390
and make a great story.

439
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,780
End of the decree.

440
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

441
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,310
- Long Live Your Majesty! - Long Live Your Majesty!

442
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,640
Princess.

443
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,630
Lord Shen.

444
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,230
Accept the decree.

445
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,460
Why did the decree

446
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,920
come so fast?

447
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,440
Father said that

448
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,020
my cousin suffered a lot

449
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,680
in the Royal Intermarriage.

450
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,480
This

451
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,860
decree of marriage.

452
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,420
He wonders

453
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,120
if you are satisfied, my cousin?

454
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,280
Love and respect each other

455
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
and make a great story.

456
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,940
I'm very satisfied.

457
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,260
It's like a dream.

458
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,770
You little girl.

459
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,740
You never know how to restrain yourself.

460
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,060
The wedding will be organized by

461
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,660
the Ministry of Rites

462
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,380
and the Imperial Astronomy Bureau.

463
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,460
Father ordered

464
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,780
the highest etiquette

465
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,580
for the princess to get married,

466
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,970
so that you can marry Shen Yan

467
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,970
in a grand manner.

468
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,020
First,

469
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,940
it will bring good luck

470
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,220
to comfort the people of Wei.

471
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,370
Second,

472
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,760
Father and I

473
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
personally

474
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,540
want to congratulate

475
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,780
for your marriage.

476
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

477
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

478
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,810
Alright.

479
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,060
Cousin,

480
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
you can prepare for your wedding in the palace.

481
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,600
The preparation for the wedding

482
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,880
and the Ministry of Rites,

483
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,140
Lady-in-waiting Xu will do them for you.

484
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,260
You may leave.

485
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,020
I'll take my leave.

486
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,050
Shen Yan,

487
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,820
the war in the south is about to start.

488
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,960
What you've seen and heard

489
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,220
are very important.

490
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,070
Tell me in detail.

491
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,340
Tell me

492
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,640
and the officials.

493
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,130
Yes.

494
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,980
Jin!

495
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,060
Ling!

496
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,530
Ling!

497
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,340
Jin!

498
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,020
You've lost weight.

499
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,340
Princess,

500
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,320
when our miss

501
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,630
knew that you are safe and sound,

502
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,910
she was so happy that she cried.

503
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,820
After crying for a while,

504
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,780
she worried that we didn't tell her the truth.

505
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,230
Without seeing you,

506
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
she was not reassured.

507
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,430
How wouldn't she lose weight?

508
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm fine.

509
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,720
Not only am I not hurt,

510
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,810
but also

511
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,000
very happy.

512
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,370
Look.

513
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,860
Am I beautiful?

514
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,850
You're even jealous, aren't you?

515
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,140
Yes.

516
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,510
I'm not the only jealous one.

517
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,220
Do you know that in order to make it up to you,

518
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,120
His Majesty not only wants you to get married,

519
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,340
but also gave

520
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,230
Palace of Peace

521
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,440
to you.

522
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,060
With your title as a name.

523
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,540
It's a great honor.

524
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,210
The other princesses were envious.

525
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,960
They wish

526
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,510
they were the ones

527
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,660
marrying Yigu.

528
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,440
That's because I have Shen Yan.

529
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,030
If they went to Royal Intermarriage,

530
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,940
they wouldn't be escorted by Lord Shen.

531
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,270
Yes.

532
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,500
Your Majesty,

533
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,470
let's go and see your Palace of Peace.

534
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,850
Let's go.

535
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,380
Let's go.

536
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,120
Jin.

537
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,660
Where is Palace of Peace?

538
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,760
Over there.

539
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,490
Do you know that

540
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,240
many things happened

541
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,660
on my way to

542
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
Royal Intermarriage?

543
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,580
I'll tell you later.

544
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,180
Let’s go.

545
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,810
Palace of Peace

546
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,910
Jin!

547
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,930
It's just

548
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,300
a temporary place.

549
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,160
The decoration is so exquisite.

550
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,880
His Majesty named and gave Palace of Peace to you.

551
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,920
People in the palace

552
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,030
know the importance of it.

553
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,190
Who dares to be careless?

554
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,780
Jin!

555
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,640
How long do I have to stay here?

556
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,110
The wedding is already settled.

557
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,570
Why are you in such a hurry?

558
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,690
Don't worry.

559
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,410
This marriage

560
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,100
was personally asked by Madam Shen.

561
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,020
His Majesty wants to

562
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,860
use this marriage to calm the people down.

563
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,640
The Ministry of Rites wouldn't dare to neglect it.

564
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,560
It's only six months.

565
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,570
It won't take long.

566
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,580
Half a year? That long?

567
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,970
Half a year?

568
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,010
Do you know

569
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,990
how many things the Ministry of Rites

570
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,970
have to prepare for the highest standard of wedding?

571
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,060
Jin.

572
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,530
I only want Shen Yan.

573
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,080
I don't need anything else.

574
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,620
You are really a child.

575
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,210
You should know

576
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,000
you and Lord Shen

577
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,620
were bestowed by His Majesty.

578
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,980
In the six rituals,

579
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,020
accepting dowry, counting birthdays, choosing auspicious days

580
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,080
are just formalities.

581
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,900
It's just going through formality.

582
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,390
There'll be a betrothal and an appointment later.

583
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,790
The last is the wedding.

584
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,980
When you get married,

585
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,260
the ritual will be really complicated.

586
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,170
Without Jin,

587
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,710
I wouldn't know what to do.

588
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,980
Don’t worry.

589
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,010
You must be tired.

590
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,470
Why don’t you take a rest?

591
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,770
I don't want to rest.

592
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,350
Can you stay with me?

593
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,600
What's wrong?

594
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,650
Finally you can

595
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,350
marry Lord Shen,

596
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,120
but you're actually worried!

597
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,160
Jin!

598
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,940
I'm...

599
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,210
so happy now.

600
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,780
I'm so happy

601
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,660
that I am scared.

602
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,710
What's wrong?

603
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,890
Are you afraid that you're having a dream?

604
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,620
When you wake up from your dream,

605
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,460
you became

606
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,020
the Crown Princess of Yigu,

607
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,170
and being alone.

608
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,110
Okay, Ling.

609
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,380
Don’t be afraid.

610
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,300
But

611
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,940
I can't stay for too long.

612
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,540
You still have Lord Shen.

613
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,100
You will live

614
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,380
with Lord Shen,

615
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,580
have a bunch of children,

616
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,500
become a happy couple

617
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,220
and live a good life.

618
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,370
Jin,

619
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,300
what do you mean?

620
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
You said you can't stay for too long.

621
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,740
Ling,

622
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,420
The Xu family's injustice has been cleared.

623
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,340
I should go now.

624
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,740
After your wedding,

625
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,570
I will go to the south

626
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,980
and leave the trivial in Yejing.

627
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,330
On the way of Royal Intermarriage,

628
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,320
I once

629
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,010
carefully observed the welcome crew.

630
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,540
Although

631
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,540
they are new soldiers

632
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,100
who have no experience.

633
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,700
But they are all strong

634
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,940
and well-organized.

635
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,030
It's not a short time

636
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,890
to train soldiers so well.

637
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,820
Mu Kun, General of Yigu

638
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,680
on the way to the marriage,

639
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,240
he always disrespected Wei

640
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,280
and Princess Peace.

641
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,740
And he talked

642
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,160
in a despicable and disrespectful manner.

643
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,040
In my opinion,

644
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,990
he will lead his crew to do the same.

645
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,860
Mu Kun's heart

646
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,030
shows

647
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,510
Yigu's intention.

648
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,960
You're right.

649
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,500
The case in Jiangzhou

650
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,860
is not a coincidence.

651
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,720
But sooner or later,

652
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,550
the war between

653
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,880
Wei and Yigu

654
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,750
will kick off.

655
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,090
Your Majesty is wise.

656
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,690
Since the Commander has found out that

657
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,890
Yigu has long been determined to fight,

658
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,200
Wei shouldn't act rashly

659
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,020
on the preparation of the war.

660
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,360
We need to deploy

661
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,100
and strengthen the border defense early.

662
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,060
I agree.

663
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,730
You are right.

664
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,980
I will go to the palace

665
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,610
to report this to Father.

666
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,180
However,

667
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,950
the war between both sides

668
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,940
will make the people

669
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,780
suffer from war again.

670
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,110
Your Majesty is benevolent.

671
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,200
It is a blessing for the people of Wei.

672
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,730
Your Majesty is wise.

673
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,370
Jin!

674
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,710
I know that you had kept the grievance of

675
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,120
your parents in your heart for a long time.

676
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,350
Now it's over.

677
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,330
You want to start over.

678
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,850
But you still have a long life.

679
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,840
Do you have to go far away?

680
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,380
Well, Ling,

681
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,470
this is not what I want.

682
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,030
What I want

683
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,700
is just a thatched house.

684
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,080
Just live a simple life

685
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,080
and live quietly.

686
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,680
Your thatched house and simple food,

687
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,230
is there anyone else

688
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,550
with you there?

689
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,420
I'm not telling you!

690
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,510
Jin.

691
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,810
I don't want to leave you.

692
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,380
I feel empty

693
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,360
when I heard you are going.

694
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,260
I know

695
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,340
you are unhappy here.

696
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,220
If you can

697
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,860
live happily,

698
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,380
then leave.

699
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,420
Go far away.

700
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,470
and

701
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,300
live happily.

702
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,170
But no matter what,

703
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,700
remember to write to me.

704
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,480
Okay?

705
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,380
Tell me where you are.

706
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,940
and how are you doing.

707
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,810
If you encounter any difficulties,

708
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,140
you can't hide it from me

709
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,180
Let me help you, okay?

710
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,630
OK.

711
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,180
I remember what Ling said.

712
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,580
Since you don't want to rest for a while,

713
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,460
why don’t we go out for a walk?

714
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,310
To visit the old Duke in Yejin

715
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,730
who loves you the most.

716
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,170
I also have a lot

717
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,150
to tell grandpa.

718
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,550
You can sort it out first.

719
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,380
I'll go first.

720
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120
Shen Yan.

721
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,970
I heard from Lady-in-waiting Xu

722
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,900
you are going to House of Duke Dingbei

723
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,300
to visit the old Marquis?

724
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,460
What's wrong?

725
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,450
Why are you worried?

726
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,780
I think

727
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,010
though uncle may be ridiculous,

728
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,800
he is not a shrew man.

729
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,840
If Prince Guangping

730
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,270
didn't manipulate,

731
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,720
he would never do something cruel like

732
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
poisoning

733
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,120
grandpa.

734
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,580
So, I...

735
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,540
Silly girl.

736
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,010
Duke Dingbei

737
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,550
is a man of great righteousness.

738
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,660
How could he

739
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,130
blame you

740
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,850
for what Prince Guangping and Junior Duke did.

741
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,950
In my opinion,

742
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,660
you came back safely.

743
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,580
If you don’t go to see him,

744
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,930
he will blame you.

745
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,980
Then please come with me.

746
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,580
Sure.

747
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,820
But

748
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,100
I have something to do.

749
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,700
After I finish this,

750
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,250
I’ll go to House of Duke Dingbei

751
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,050
to greet

752
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,630
Old Duke with you.

753
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,700
Shen Yan, the administration of Beidian

754
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,760
greet you, Duke Lu.

755
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,220
I was wondering who it was.

756
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,620
So, the Commander is back.

757
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,950
You are going to marry,

758
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,180
I

759
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,380
congratulate you.

760
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,310
Thank you, Duke Lu.

761
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,120
I'm here today

762
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,300
to ask you

763
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,730
something.

764
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,920
I've told everything

765
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,320
about the case of Jiangzhou.

766
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,820
Commander,

767
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,930
what else do you want to ask?

768
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
This matter

769
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,770
is related to the Jiangzhou case

770
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,620
But it can also have nothing to do with the Jiangzhou case.

771
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,600
Was the death of Zhang Yun, the former Princess of Guangping

772
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,050
the result of Lu?

773
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,770
I'm afraid

774
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,450
you want to ask not only about it.

775
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,850
Commander is very clever.

776
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,420
I have three questions

777
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,980
for you to answer.

778
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,580
Go ahead.

779
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,490
First,

780
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,220
the amount of silver Yun Yi stole

781
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,540
was huge.

782
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,780
but it was managed to leave Jiangzhou City gate

783
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,570
without anyone knowing.

784
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,140
only 50% of them,

785
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,750
was arrived

786
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,270
Yigu.

787
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,290
The other 40%

788
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,770
is the price

789
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,239
for opening the door for me.

790
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,170
Prince of Guangping is a royal family of Wei.

791
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,010
He has high status and power.

792
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,489
Where is he going to use

793
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,090
for embezzlement?

794
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,000
Second,

795
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,380
Zhang Yun,

796
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,400
the former Princess of Guangping

797
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,570
was indeed drowned by my daughter, Lu Qian,

798
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,960
in the lake.

799
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,210
After many years,

800
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,300
the Commander

801
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,540
could find something fishy

802
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,719
only by an illegitimate son.

803
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,679
As the head of the family,

804
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,179
Prince Guangping hastily settled the case

805
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,820
without saying a word.

806
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,320
And proved that Zhang Yun

807
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,870
was accidentally fell into the water.

808
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,700
Why?

809
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,770
Third,

810
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
when the late king was on the throne,

811
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,950
Prince Guangping has made great military achievements.

812
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,470
You should know that Wei

813
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,990
established a country with martial arts.

814
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,070
But before the late king passed away,

815
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,460
he abolished his military power

816
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,930
and pass the throne to His Majesty.

817
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,340
Commander,

818
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,070
what do you think

819
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,830
Prince Guangping would think?

820
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,750
Lord Shen,

821
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,100
you are the assistance of His Majesty.

822
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,980
Now that you're about to pass the exam,

823
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,200
And you are also

824
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,290
the son-in-law of Prince Guangping.

825
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,930
You will have

826
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,730
a bright future.

827
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,500
I'm old now.

828
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,650
I tell you these

829
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,300
words from my heart

830
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,920
as a wedding gift.

831
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,080
Shen Yan.

832
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,930
These three questions came into my heart

833
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,080
and can't be cleared.

834
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,580
Shen Yan,

835
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,260
you have gotten involved in this,

836
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,660
you won't end well.

837
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,170
I'll wait for you

838
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,070
to see God.

839
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:58,640
[House of Duke Dingbei]

840
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,780
Father.

841
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,980
We've been waiting here

842
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,300
for more than two hours.

843
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,340
There's no one in the palace

844
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,370
to pass a word for us.

845
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,040
I think

846
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,990
Ling is probably not coming today.

847
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,270
Why don’t you go home and rest?

848
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,550
Nonsense!

849
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Since Ling has returned to Yeching,

850
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,160
after meeting the Eastern Palace,

851
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,410
she'll definitely come back to visit House of Duke.

852
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,650
Can she be heartless

853
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,830
like you?

854
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,300
Alright.

855
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,680
Dad, calm down.

856
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,480
Calm down.

857
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,440
Father,

858
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,010
he says this

859
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,520
because he is worried about your health.

860
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,700
Worried?

861
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,410
If you were more worried about me,

862
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,030
my life

863
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,600
will end

864
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,960
before Ling comes back.

865
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,550
Royal Highness.

866
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,340
Ling.

867
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,430
Grandpa.

868
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,330
Ling.

869
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,640
- Grandpa
- Ling, you are back!

870
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,700
How are you?

871
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,960
How is your health?

872
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,060
I'm fine.

873
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,180
When grandpa saw you back,

874
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,740
he is perfectly fine.

875
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,120
It's windy here.

876
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,280
Let's talk inside.

877
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,760
Okay, let's go inside.

878
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,500
Let’s go.

879
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,070
- My Ling has grown up. -Be quickly everyone.

880
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,400
and is getting married.

881
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,250
I'm opening a private vault

882
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,590
to add dowry for you.

883
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,350
Grandpa.

884
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,720
A gold inlaid blue hanging.

885
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,200
A rosewood wood mirror.

886
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,610
A red sandalwood Arhat bed,

887
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,310
Two huanghuali rose chairs

888
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,060
Six pairs of dragon-shaped gold bracelets.

889
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,650
Eight golden rings with quail lotus pattern.

890
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,560
Enough.

891
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,460
Grandpa.

892
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,620
There are so many things.

893
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,140
I can't use them all.

894
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,830
So what?

895
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,110
These are all for you.

896
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,490
These things

897
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,510
were

898
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,610
just saved for you.

899
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,400
Grandpa,

900
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,790
How are you?

901
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,580
Do you want me

902
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,450
to accompany you to have a rest in your room?

903
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,070
It’s OK.

904
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,020
I’m fine.

905
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,920
My health

906
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,220
is getting worse.

907
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,760
When I die ,

908
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,390
I will have time to rest.

909
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,670
Grandpa.

910
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,010
Ling.

911
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
Good girl.

912
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,980
I’m old.

913
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,640
It's only a matter of time before I die.

914
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,370
If grandpa is gone,

915
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,110
the Prince of Guangping

916
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,020
and your useless uncle

917
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,730
will bully you.

918
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,260
So now,

919
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,030
while I'm still in charge,

920
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,330
I'll keep these things

921
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,330
for you.

922
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,740
In this way,

923
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,510
I can be comforted.

924
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,700
Grandpa is blessed.

925
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,560
You will live a long life.

926
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,630
Are you dead?

927
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,860
If you don't say anything,

928
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,550
your father

929
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,870
will give everything in House of Duke Dingbei

930
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,020
to Ling.

931
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,110
He is willing to give,

932
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,560
what can I do?

933
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,030
Stop it. It's itchy.

934
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,540
These things

935
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,250
I will give whoever I want.

936
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,020
I’ll see who dares to say no.

937
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,980
Yes, Father.

938
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,810
You're right.

939
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,150
Royal Highness.

940
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,680
Commander Shen is here.

941
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,670
He is waiting at the door.

942
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,590
Good, good timing.

943
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,410
Invite him in.

944
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,780
[Bright Moon in the Arm]

945
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,870
Greetings,  Royal Highness.

946
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,150
We will be a family soon.

947
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,120
Lord Shen, no need to be so polite.

948
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,310
Please have a seat.

949
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,500
OK.

950
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,820
His Lordship's illness

951
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,550
seems to have improved slowly.

952
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,450
Has he taken medicine regularly these days?

953
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,790
Yes.

954
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,370
They were all made

955
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,180
according to your instructions.

956
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,840
I didn't dare to neglect them.

957
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,110
It's not their fault.

958
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,860
Although I took the medicine,

959
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,890
but it's hard to cure the heart.

960
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,080
Luckily,

961
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,020
Lord Shen is a man of his word.

962
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,770
Ling is back.

963
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,700
My heart

964
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,250
gets much better.

965
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,550
Grandpa,

966
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,290
you just said

967
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,900
you are perfectly fine when you saw me.

968
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,960
How come it has become half-fine now?

969
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,740
Since His Majesty pointed you to Royal Intermarriage,

970
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,940
my heart

971
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,240
has been hanging.

972
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,600
Although you

973
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,460
returned to Yejing safely,

974
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,080
and got the imperial decree.

975
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,510
But

976
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,790
I’m still afraid that

977
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,640
if there are

978
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,170
any problems

979
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,830
before the wedding.

980
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,380
Has the Ministry of Rites

981
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,030
decided the date?

982
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,490
The Ministry of Rites

983
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,920
is making preliminary arrangements.

984
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,000
The wedding date

985
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,590
is six months later.

986
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,070
Half a year?

987
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,510
Grandpa.

988
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,540
don’t worry.

989
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,610
If my marriage

990
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,630
can cure your heart

991
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,340
I can get married with Lord Shen

992
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,470
tomorrow.

993
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,350
Silly girl.

994
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,100
You're a princess now.

995
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,780
The wedding ceremony

996
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,860
is very complicated.

997
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,060
Six-months

998
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,290
is already very short.

999
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,500
Father.

1000
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,160
Grandpa.

1001
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,710
Well,

1002
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,750
you've seen

1003
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,410
Lord Shen and Ling.

1004
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,290
Why don't we take the medicine?

1005
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,900
Take the medicine,  Royal Highness.

1006
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,420
I’ll leave with Ling.

1007
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,310
OK.

1008
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,980
Have a good rest, grandpa.

1009
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,580
OK.

1010
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,130
Ling.

1011
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,760
Let’s go.

1012
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,630
Father.

1013
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,360
Get some water first.

1014
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,720
Hurry up! The medicine!
