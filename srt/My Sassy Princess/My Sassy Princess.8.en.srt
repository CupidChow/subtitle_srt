00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,960
Princess?

356
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,520
You mean Liu Ling?

357
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,850
I saw her

358
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,320
on my way out.

359
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,060
She said she didn’t want to disturb you.

360
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,540
So she waited at the door.

361
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,860
Now I'm back.

362
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,190
She's still at the door.

363
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,960
I see.

364
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,890
Shen Yan.

365
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,710
Come here.

366
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,900
Come on.

367
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,860
Why didn’t you go in?

368
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,020
Luo Fan said you were busy.

369
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,640
I didn’t want to disturb you.

370
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,530
Then what do you want

371
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
having me here?

372
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,500
Nothing.

373
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,700
I waited in here for a long time.

374
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,220
My legs are numb.

375
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,420
Did you come here

376
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,470
for business?

377
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,740
Can't I come if not?

378
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,470
You are a princess

379
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,220
who is engaged.

380
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,700
Aren't you afraid

381
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,590
what you are doing

382
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,320
will tarnish your reputation?

383
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,660
Reputation?

384
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,540
If you were a woman,

385
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,900
you'd be included in the Legend of Chaste Women.

386
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,500
Your fame will last forever.

387
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,650
You said

388
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,260
you hate people

389
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,720
who break their promises.

390
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
I came here to... (Shen Yan's badge)

391
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,950
But I don't want to return it to you.

392
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,100
You don't need to.

393
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,710
If I want it back,

394
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,100
I can get it anytime.

395
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,750
Alright, if there's nothing else,

396
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,440
you should go home.

397
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,780
Be good.

398
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,910
Wait for me.

399
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,980
Your Highness, let's go.

400
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,060
Let's go back to Shen Mansion.

401
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,260
Shen Mansion?

402
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,600
Lord Shen asked me

403
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,250
to wait for him at home.

404
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,060
Of course I'l go back

405
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,410
and wait for him at home.

406
00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:03,350
[Shen Mansion]

407
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,290
Our lord is not here.

408
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,650
Please go back, ladies.

409
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,300
Why are you

410
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,370
so rude?

411
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,270
Your lord

412
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,500
asked us to come here.

413
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,860
Every woman who knocked the door

414
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,820
said so.

415
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,860
Go away.

416
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,580
Go.

417
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,900
Wait.

418
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,900
Did those women have this?

419
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,980
(Shen Yan's badge)

420
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,460
[Shen Yan]

421
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,770
Sir,

422
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,200
you meant

423
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,460
many women came here

424
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,210
in the past?

425
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,540
Not very often.

426
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,910
But my lord is a famous person.

427
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,260
There were some

428
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,450
from time to time.

429
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,020
Luo Fan.

430
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,780
Yes.

431
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,170
Give these to Lord Han for me.

432
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,720
Yes.

433
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,620
Shen Yan.

434
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,390
Lord Han.

435
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,820
It's good to bump into you.

436
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,900
Recently,

437
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,420
I've been busy with work.

438
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,460
You came back from the capital,

439
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
I haven't had time

440
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,790
to welcome you back.

441
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,540
How about today?

442
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,730
Let's have a drink.

443
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,320
Lord Han,

444
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,480
today I need to

445
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,990
see my mother.

446
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

447
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,140
Maybe another day.

448
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,780
Sure.

449
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,410
Thank you, my lord.

450
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,620
Lord Han.

451
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,670
Luo Fan.

452
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,870
Shen Yan looks anxious.

453
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,930
Is everything alright?

454
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,460
I think,

455
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,810
lord Shen is troubled.

456
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,740
Troubled?

457
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,020
With what?

458
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,600
It's his secret trouble.

459
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,710
Secret trouble?

460
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,990
Mother,

461
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,130
We just came back to Yejing.

462
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,190
Now we are rushing to Duke Dingbei’s Mansion.

463
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,740
I miss grandfather.

464
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,790
Why don't we go to Lu's Mansion first?

465
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,910
Please?

466
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,210
Silly girl.

467
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,260
Let me tell you.

468
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,380
For royals,

469
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,380
especially for royal women,

470
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,900
reputation

471
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,190
is more important

472
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,430
than life.

473
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,510
Is reputation that important?

474
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,540
Let’s go to Duke Dingbei’s Mansion first.

475
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,220
First,

476
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm a loving mother.

477
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,590
My eldest daughter died for no reason.

478
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,000
As her stepmother,

479
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,030
I have been in great pain.

480
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,420
Now that I’m in the capital,

481
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,540
I should go to Liu Ling’s mother’s home

482
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,130
and say some comforting words.

483
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,420
That's being sensible and considerate.

484
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,500
Second,

485
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,140
Duke Dingbei has always indulged Liu Ling.

486
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,140
Now is a great opportunity

487
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,780
to have Duke Dingbei

488
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,370
join me in visiting

489
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,790
the crown prince

490
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,660
who will hold Family Shen

491
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,780
accountable.

492
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,820
Shen Yan failed

493
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,860
to fulfill his order

494
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,780
and caused Princess Changle’s death.

495
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,470
Then, they will be busy putting out fires

496
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,840
and have no time

497
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,190
to act against our family.

498
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,460
You are right.

499
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,520
Now I'll see

500
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,700
who can go against the Family Lu.

501
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,510
We're almost there.

502
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,310
To put up a good show,

503
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,540
we should dress accordingly.

504
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,760
Here. (handing over funeral clothes)

505
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,780
Madam Shen,

506
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,010
please have some tea.

507
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,440
[Shen Yan's mother]

508
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,180
You are my guest.

509
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,670
You don't have to be so polite.

510
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,980
Have a seat.

511
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,780
Madam Shen,

512
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,700
you are Lord Shen's mother.

513
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,940
It's a courtesy

514
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,580
for me to serve tea to you.

515
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,500
Miss,

516
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,070
what's your name?

517
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
My name is

518
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,070
Liu Ling.

519
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,190
Liu Ling?

520
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
You are the eldest daughter

521
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,630
of Prince Guangping of Jiangzhou,

522
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,150
Princess Changle

523
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,520
granted by His Majesty?

524
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,440
Yes.

525
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,050
You are a royal.

526
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,760
I can't have this cup of tea

527
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,840
served by you.

528
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,850
Young Master.

529
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,950
Shen...

530
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,730
Yan,

531
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,860
come with me.

532
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,460
Mother.

533
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,180
what's your thought on

534
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,220
proposing the marriage at Duke Dingbei's Mansion?

535
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,150
Don't bring it up

536
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
ever again.

537
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,800
You've promised me.

538
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,100
Why are you breaking your promise?

539
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,640
Yan,

540
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,600
what did I teach you before?

541
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,060
You are to marry a virtuous wife.

542
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,440
I could put aside

543
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,990
the scandals

544
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,880
about you two.

545
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,390
But

546
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,740
did you know

547
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,200
Lu Mingshan and she

548
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,460
were engaged?

549
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,580
I know.

550
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,180
Duke Guangping is the brother of His Majesty.

551
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,070
Lord Lu is very powerful.

552
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,170
I know Princess Changle lost her mother

553
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,630
at a young age and had a miserable childhood.

554
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,240
But if you get involved with her,

555
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,160
you might be affected

556
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,780
by the conflicts between Family Liu and Lu.

557
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,840
Do you understand?

558
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,460
Yes, mother.

559
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,340
Yan,

560
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,700
I've been there before.

561
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,580
What I'm saying now

562
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,850
is for your own good.

563
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,620
You should think it over.

564
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,380
Mother,

565
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,010
don't worry.

566
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,840
This is my own business.

567
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,530
I know what I'm doing.

568
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,340
You...

569
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,950
You've all grown up.

570
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,660
I hope you really know

571
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,100
what you are doing.

572
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,730
Madam Shen.

573
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,710
Madam Shen.

574
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,500
What are you thinking?

575
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,930
I'm thinking

576
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,590
since your mother doesn't like me,

577
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,080
it will be difficult for me

578
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,990
to marry into

579
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,390
your family.

580
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,380
Do you want to marry me that badly?

581
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,140
Of course.

582
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,200
You don't want to marry me?

583
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,410
Have you changed your mind?

584
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,140
Or...

585
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,180
did your mother

586
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,470
say anything just now?

587
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,260
Nothing.

588
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,930
She just said

589
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,060
I should marry

590
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,740
a lady from a cultured family.

591
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,260
A nobel lady?

592
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,020
Am I not a lady?

593
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,700
I'm heading back to Duke Dingbei’s Mansion

594
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,960
right now and be a lady.

595
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,170
I'll show you that.

596
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,220
My Lord.

597
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,240
Lady-in-waiting Xu,

598
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,370
it's not a good time.

599
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,300
Ling

600
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,570
went out.

601
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,210
It's fine.

602
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
I'm here today

603
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,460
to see the Duke.

604
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,800
I thought I'd see Ling while I'm here.

605
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,900
Okay.

606
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,720
Have a seat.

607
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,920
I'll go get my father.

608
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,790
Anybody?

609
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,340
Go get the Lord.

610
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,330
Yes.

611
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,520
Lady-in-waiting Xu,

612
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,260
please wait here.

613
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,320
I’ll be right back.

614
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,180
My Ling.

615
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,710
Stop crying.

616
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,180
-Ling. -Stop crying.

617
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,380
You are crying for nothing.

618
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:01,910
Yes.

619
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,430
You can tell us

620
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,470
what's wrong.

621
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,630
Who is it?

622
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,170
How dare you to make a scene

623
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,490
in front of Duke Dingbei's Mansion?

624
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,730
Young Master.

625
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,220
Greetings.

626
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,680
Isn't this the eldest daughter of Duke Lu,

627
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
the current Princess of Guangping?

628
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,440
What...

629
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,600
What are you doing?

630
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,900
Young Master,

631
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,560
I have something

632
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,550
to report to the Duke.

633
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,310
Please inform him of me.

634
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,660
Uh...

635
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,550
You...

636
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,380
You want to see my father in this?

637
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,270
Not only that,

638
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,110
you should also

639
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,690
dress like this.

640
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,510
I...

641
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,190
What?

642
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,250
What do you mean?

643
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,250
Well...

644
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,390
Ling...

645
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,490
My sister...

646
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,940
She’s gone.

647
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,990
Ling?

648
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,250
That’s strange.

649
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,420
Ling,

650
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,780
are you alright?

651
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,660
You look very surprised.

652
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,500
I guess you're overjoyed with my death

653
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,580
and couldn’t help

654
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,090
but rush to Yejing.

655
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,720
Didn't Lu Mingshan

656
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
write to you?

657
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,300
Right.

658
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,340
You're in such a hurry.

659
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,140
Of course you didn't get the letter.

660
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,930
Liu Ling,

661
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,630
my mother was heartbroken

662
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,890
when she heard about your death.

663
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,680
How could you

664
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,560
say this to her?

665
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,010
Both of you

666
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,080
are too impatient.

667
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,810
You've even arranged the costume.

668
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,940
If you were just a little bit patient

669
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,220
and went back to Lu Mansion first,

670
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,340
you wouldn’t have come

671
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,670
to Duke Dingbei’s Mansion

672
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,460
and make a fool of yourselves

673
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,090
crying for the living.

674
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:40,820
You...

675
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,180
It's okay.

676
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,440
I won't blame you

677
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,020
for the misunderstandings.

678
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,400
As long as you are safe,

679
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,020
I'll be happy.

680
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,120
Come.

681
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,700
Let's go back and talk more.

682
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,050
Come on.

683
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,310
-Let's go. -Stop it.

684
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,910
Shen Yan.

685
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,990
Who do you think you are,

686
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,380
being so rude to me!

687
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,110
I dare not.

688
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,120
You...

689
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,520
For the sake

690
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,760
you protected Ling,

691
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,490
I won’t blame you.

692
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,460
Xiang,

693
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,580
let's go.

694
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Is your hand okay?

695
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,310
Don’t look.

696
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,770
I am a noble lady now.

697
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,500
If you stare at my hand like this,

698
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,890
you're not a gentleman.

699
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,220
Jin,

700
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,540
what is

701
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,820
on this portrait?

702
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,750
I wanted to ask you questions

703
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
about this pattern.

704
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,580
How come you are

705
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,640
asking me about it?

706
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,540
I heard that

707
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,920
you are knowledgeable

708
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,150
about jade and antiques.

709
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,030
Haven't you seen it before?

710
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,590
This pattern of yours...

711
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,590
I've never seen

712
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,570
this thing before.

713
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,670
But speaking of antiques and jade,

714
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,060
a few days ago,

715
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,199
I found some treasures.

716
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,570
Let me show you.

717
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,210
Look at this.

718
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,179
This is a vase.

719
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,570
My Lord.

720
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,020
Lord Shen, the commander of one of the fourteen armies

721
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,500
of the Jinlin Guard is here.

722
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,860
He wants to see you, my Lord.

723
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,940
Jinlin Guard?

724
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,620
Yes.

725
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,190
I'm Commander Shen Yan.

726
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,520
Greetings, my Lord.

727
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,739
Greetings.

728
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,540
I've retired from public affairs for a long time.

729
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,340
What brought you here

730
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,400
all of a sudden?

731
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,730
I come here today

732
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,719
to present a gift

733
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,730
to you, my Lord.

734
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,780
A gift?

735
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,540
It looks the same as the one the Lord has.

736
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,700
Are they a pair?

737
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,310
I'm not talented.

738
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,020
I heard you found

739
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,240
a white nephire vase.

740
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,420
I knew it was a pair.

741
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,150
So I mindfully looked for the other one.

742
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,100
I know Commender Shen is well-informed.

743
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,140
But I didn't think you'd know

744
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,950
so much about the antiques.

745
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,370
I admire you.

746
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,040
Did you get the experience

747
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
from purging officials?

748
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,760
You must be joking.

749
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,840
Confiscation doesn't happen often.

750
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,970
I don't have much experience about it.

751
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,980
My knowledge

752
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,830
about the antiques

753
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,040
all came from

754
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,510
my father.

755
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,040
That's why I know a little about it.

756
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,450
What happened to your foot?

757
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,410
You can’t even walk.

758
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,630
Grandpa,

759
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,130
it’s rare to meet such an expert.

760
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,800
Why don't you

761
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,020
show the painting you just got

762
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,300
to Lord Shen.

763
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,440
So we can appreciate it together.

764
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,580
You're right.

765
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,140
Here.

766
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,820
This is it.

767
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,930
Hang it up.

768
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,570
Lord Shen,

769
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,540
please.

770
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,300
This painting

771
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,900
is very meaningful.

772
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,630
It's expressing complex emotions

773
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,960
with scenery.

774
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,130
It's quite thought-provoking.

775
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,270
But

776
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,520
if you take a closer look,

777
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,490
it looks a little weird.

778
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,290
Lord Shen,

779
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,830
come and see.

780
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,160
In my opinion,

781
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,590
this painter is a master of realist techniques,

782
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,980
but he painted the scenery of spring and autumn.

783
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,260
The free interpretation is combined

784
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,720
with careful expression.

785
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,360
I guess that's why

786
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,660
you thought it looked weird.

787
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,040
Lord Shen

788
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,940
is so witty.

789
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,630
You're straight to the point.

790
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,260
Tell me.

791
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,040
how can a person

792
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,130
with entanglements and struggles

793
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,650
paint such a masterpiece?

794
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,480
Paintings and antiques become great pieces

795
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,980
due to unique craftsmanship.

796
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,310
This painter is devoted

797
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,100
to polish his crafts for life.

798
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,560
It's not surprising that

799
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,440
his work is a masterpiece.

800
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,690
Knowing that,

801
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
this painting is truly meaningful.

802
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,020
People usually apply light ink

803
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,580
at the peaks,

804
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,990
but he used a heavy brush

805
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,110
to accent the magnificence over delicacy.

806
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,380
This is an unusual

807
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,850
and brilliant idea.

808
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,730
No noble lady

809
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,210
would act the way you do.

810
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,920
You are staring.

811
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,940
Try to provoke me?

812
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,220
A gentleman

813
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,020
wouldn't visit a lady's home with gifts

814
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,970
for no good reason.

815
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,500
What happened?

816
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,980
How did you fall down?

817
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,400
My Lord, don't panic.

818
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,990
Her Highness must have been

819
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,130
tripped by the incense burner.

820
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,990
Let me help her.

821
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,510
I'll come to you tonight.

822
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,680
My Lord, it's getting late.

823
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,100
I won't bother you.

824
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,050
I should go back.

825
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Okay.

826
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,050
Lady-in-waiting Xu is right.

827
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,310
I should leave as well.

828
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,890
Wait.

829
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,360
These vases are a pair.

830
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,300
But I'll only keep what's mine.

831
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,610
This one is yours.

832
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,090
You'd better take it back.

833
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,950
Come on.

834
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,610
You're very insightful.

835
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,940
I will visit you more

836
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,540
in the future.

837
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,340
Goodbye.

838
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,330
See you.

839
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,410
Take care, Lord Shen.

840
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,080
Lord Shen

841
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,440
looks calm,

842
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,650
but he's quite blunt

843
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,010
with things.

844
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,110
Ling,

845
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,340
you wouldn't like

846
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,570
such a man, right?

847
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,810
Grandpa, you must be joking.

848
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,020
How is that possible?

849
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:49,910
I'm not who you can come and see

850
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,340
anytime you want.

851
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,310
What did you say?

852
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,300
Grandpa,

853
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,660
can you do me a favor?

854
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,750
Sure, what is it?

855
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,460
Get some servants

856
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,420
to seal the windows in my room.

857
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,570
What windows?

858
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,870
The windows in my room.

859
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,650
Seal the windows?

860
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,120
Yes, with planks!

861
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,930
Okay.
