00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,870
You bastard!

6
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,080
Father! Father!

7
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:48,979
Don't be upset.

8
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,860
I know I was wrong.

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,860
I know I was wrong!

10
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,520
Now you know

11
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,220
you were wrong.

12
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,380
You let a dangerous person into our home

13
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,420
without telling me.

14
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,090
You want to bully

15
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,420
Ling and I?

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,060
Right?

17
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,300
Tell me.

18
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,090
What did Family Lu

19
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,700
promise you

20
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,740
that makes you

21
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,100
worship them like a dog?

22
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,900
What's your family name?

23
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,460
I've already

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,830
sent Yue Ling off.

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,660
Sent her off?

26
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,410
Now you know to send her off.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,110
Too late!

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,490
There's nothing I can do.

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,260
It's already happened.

30
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,500
Even if you beat me to death,

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,440
it won't make any difference.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,970
You brat.

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,510
How dare you talk back to me?

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,420
Listen.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,740
If anything happens

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,290
to Ling,

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,750
you will bear the brunt!

38
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,340
Father,

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,110
don't you worry about her.

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
She is having a great time

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,110
somewhere now.

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,270
Having a great time?

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,900
What do you mean?

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,860
Those are not my words.

45
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,900
I heard it from a servant.

46
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,820
He said when things got serious,

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,420
a tall man

48
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,740
on a horse came

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,250
and took her away.

50
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,180
Who was he?

51
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,980
He...

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,420
He looked like

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,980
the commander of one of the fourteen armies,

54
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,740
Shen Yan.

55
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,540
Shen Yan?

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,290
Again?

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,260
This is the cloth

58
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,100
you made for Shen Oink.

59
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,200
It loves the cloth very much

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,920
and wears it every day.

61
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,770
Oink was in my arms this noon.

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,300
Now that it's gone,

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,840
you should learn to let go.

64
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,870
Lord Shen,

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,579
you said you'd give me

66
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,060
something better.

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,610
What is it?

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,440
Were you talking about

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,840
the stars in the sky?

70
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,270
Take a guess.

71
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,170
I just did.

72
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,040
Since you came back to Yejing,

73
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,820
you’ve become

74
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,220
more and more secretive.

75
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,740
Shen Yan,

76
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,110
did you know?

77
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,420
I didn't mean to

78
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,750
make things difficult for those beggars.

79
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,260
I didn't despise their life

80
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,420
and that child's life.

81
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,230
I know.

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,540
Yue Ling

83
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,390
is very similar to Madam Lu.

84
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,970
She pretended to be

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,540
gentle and kind.

86
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,330
Her miscarriage

87
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,950
and the death of Oink

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,550
were her calculated moves.

89
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,700
I know that, too.

90
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,020
You know everything.

91
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,470
Do you know

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,870
what's on my mind?

93
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,580
You think

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
I left you at Duke Dingbei’s Mansion

95
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,690
for nothing but my reputation.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,410
You've suffered a lot

97
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,550
and feel being wronged.

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,140
What else?

99
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,740
Also,

100
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,160
you want me to make it up to you.

101
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,220
With what?

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,600
It should be on the way here.

103
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,730
Almost here.

104
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,580
In the midnight, in the middle of nowhere,

105
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,420
it's fine if you are half-hearted.

106
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,220
But at least try to find

107
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,580
a better excuse.

108
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,700
Look.

109
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,230
That's your compensation.

110
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,350
What a beautiful meteor!

111
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,020
Do you like it?

112
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,300
Yes.

113
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,860
But

114
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,180
I like it too much to

115
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,990
feel regrets already.

116
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,120
What do you mean?

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Look.

118
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,270
The meteor burned its life

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,450
to shine with

120
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,880
such bright light.

121
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,420
But it's fleeting.

122
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,750
Don't you think such beauty

123
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,100
is too short?

124
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,770
I think

125
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,130
many things

126
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,380
become more beautiful

127
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,160
precisely because of its fleeting life.

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,580
I hope you can

129
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,580
cherish the beauty

130
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,740
in your heart forever.

131
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,420
Let go of all the

132
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,990
frustration

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
and anxiety.

134
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,760
Blossoming flowers wither within a day.

135
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,540
All the beautiful things

136
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,870
vanish eventually.

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,490
Lord Shen,

138
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,610
will your affection for me

139
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,290
disappear just like that?

140
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Don't be silly.

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,850
Greetings, Lord Lu.

142
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,020
Has the war fund been prepared

143
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,820
as requested by His Royal Highness?

144
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,700
Last month, I just gave him

145
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,030
hundreds of thousands of taels of silver.

146
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,780
He used up

147
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,580
all of it already?

148
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,180
My son-in-law

149
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,940
thinks I'm

150
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,620
a cash cow?

151
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,100
Forging fire arrow machine

152
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,340
is a costly cause.

153
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,340
His Royal Highness budgeted carefully,

154
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,580
considering you as his father-in-law.

155
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,539
His Royal Highness also said that

156
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,740
people were asking questions about the cold Jiangzhou case.

157
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,770
It will break out eventually.

158
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,140
Having the machine in place as soon as possible

159
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,670
can prepare us for the worst

160
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,560
and give us an option.

161
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,740
Fine.

162
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,680
Go to the treasurer.

163
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,840
Daddy, don't be upset.

164
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,050
Once His Royal Highness and you

165
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,190
carry out your plan,

166
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,860
the money you spend now

167
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,210
will seem like nothing.

168
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,650
You are back.

169
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,780
Come here.

170
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,980
Join me for a drink.

171
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,820
Any update on the

172
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,030
investigation?

173
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,950
My younger brother,

174
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,980
I'm drinking alone here,

175
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
while waiting for you for half a night.

176
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,340
When we meet,

177
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,400
you didn't even greet me,

178
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,730
just cut to the chase.

179
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm your older brother,

180
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,320
not your servant.

181
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,300
Tonight is a starry night.

182
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
Tomorrow will be a sunny day.

183
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,020
Stop.

184
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,080
That's enough.

185
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,040
My men are still

186
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,400
trying to find the clues

187
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,020
of the hade's pattern.

188
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,480
The carving technique

189
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,990
is very good.

190
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,170
It won't be easy

191
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,160
to investigate.

192
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,050
What we know now is

193
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,930
that the piece

194
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,600
is not from the Central Plain.

195
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,820
Its origin

196
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,160
may be in the north.

197
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,900
Please

198
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,130
be patient

199
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,750
and wait longer.

200
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,460
Then why are you here?

201
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,180
I admire you

202
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,640
for saving the beauty

203
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,670
in front of Duke Dingbei's Mansion.

204
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,900
I came here

205
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
to pass on advice from mother.

206
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
You know what she's thinking about,

207
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,780
"Princess Changle

208
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,160
takes life easily.

209
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,070
She's not a virtuous lady.

210
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,680
Your brother has gone too far.

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,990
He's misbehaving."

212
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,330
Hey!

213
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,980
What?

214
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,270
Are you upset again?

215
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,860
I heard

216
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,220
you want to go against Family Lu.

217
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,490
That's right.

218
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,940
What's your plan?

219
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,110
The Lu family killed Yun Yi.

220
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,680
They thought there was no evidence.

221
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,720
But I think

222
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,360
their temporary relief

223
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
will result in disaster.

224
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,470
When I was in the capital,

225
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,030
I filed secret reports to His Majesty

226
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,430
and asked for permission

227
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,220
to make moves on Family Lu

228
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,000
and teach them a lesson.

229
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,120
Only when Duke Lu is cornered,

230
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,580
can his weaknesses

231
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,180
be revealed.

232
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,460
Judging by your face,

233
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
has the crown prince approved of it?

234
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,370
[Shen nodded] I finally got the answer

235
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,500
after several days.

236
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,210
They got the

237
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,220
Kun jade.

238
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,620
I must get it back as soon as possible.

239
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,090
The crown prince considers you as a deadly weapon.

240
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,540
But the Lu family

241
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,100
has many contacts in the central government.

242
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,350
If you offend them,

243
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,300
I'm afraid

244
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,530
they will bring you

245
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,530
more trouble.

246
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
Be careful.

247
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,780
I know what to do.

248
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,170
Okay.

249
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,550
I've drunk and we've talked.

250
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,730
I should go.

251
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,940
By the way,

252
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,840
come home and comfort mom sometimes.

253
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,940
It's enough to have

254
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,000
one trouble-maker already.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,110
You need to behave.

256
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,300
Young Master, welcome.

257
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,160
Please come in.

258
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,020
See you again.

259
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,140
Mr. Shen is here.

260
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,340
This way, please.

261
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,060
Okay.

262
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Keep playing.

263
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,150
Keep playing!

264
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,020
Go on.

265
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,560
Mr. Shen, this way please.

266
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,060
Shan,

267
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,870
don't blame me for being cruel.

268
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,680
You are a baseborn.

269
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,670
If you marry a lowly maid.

270
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,820
People will laugh at you.

271
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,740
You are right, aunt.

272
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,770
You are a man.

273
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,290
Sooner or later, you'll take over the family business.

274
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,700
A person who does great things

275
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,420
shouldn't have

276
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,820
any weaknesses or scandals.

277
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
You can't let these things

278
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,350
obstruct your path upward.

279
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,650
Today,

280
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,870
your grandfather

281
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,110
asked you to kill her

282
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,340
to help you remember.

283
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,040
Do you understand?

284
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,330
Yue Ling.

285
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,160
Young Master.

286
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,210
Get lost

287
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,910
Get lost!

288
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,460
Go away!

289
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,900
I understand.

290
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
I understand.

291
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,550
Someone jumped into the river!

292
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,270
Someone jumped into the river!

293
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,540
Miss Yue

294
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,220
lost her life

295
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,450
at such a young age.

296
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,100
The people at the riverside said

297
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,860
she...

298
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,660
She had a miscarriage

299
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,620
because of the princess. So she...

300
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,560
Although her fingers were stiff,

301
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,890
they were pointing downward.

302
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,310
There's no mud in her nails.

303
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,660
It means she didn't

304
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,240
struggle much in the water.

305
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,460
I gently pressed the her abdomen

306
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,260
and found that

307
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,460
no fluid was discharged from her nose.

308
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,620
It means it wasn't a suicide.

309
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,200
She was suffocated to death

310
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
before being dumped into the river.

311
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,700
How did you know

312
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
she must have been suffocated to death?

313
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,840
She looks pale

314
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,660
with unnoticeable blood spots.

315
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,300
It is a sign of suffocation.

316
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,180
There are no obvious wounds

317
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,120
on her body

318
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,480
and no bruises on her neck.

319
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,160
The only explanation is suffocation.

320
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,750
My lord, you're amazing!

321
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,720
Number Seven.

322
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,230
Yes.

323
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,910
Get everyone on the list

324
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,820
and come here.

325
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,740
Yes.

326
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
The body has just been delivered.

327
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,850
You've already drafted

328
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,910
a list of suspects?

329
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,180
I meant to give a lesson to Family Lu.

330
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,620
Now there's a murder.

331
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,420
It's time for them

332
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,070
to pay their debts.

333
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,700
[Lu Mansion]

334
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,849
-Go away. -You...

335
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,650
What do you want?

336
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,339
Jinlin Guard.

337
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,910
We are here for a case.

338
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,720
[Administration of Beidian]

339
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,819
Let's go, Mr. Lu.

340
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,790
From the last nightfall

341
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,069
to this early morning,

342
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,339
did you go out?

343
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,690
I'm the butler of Family Lu.

344
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,100
I have to deal with

345
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,400
hundreds of issues

346
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,590
in the mansion every day.

347
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,990
Of course I went out.

348
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,510
Hundreds of issues?

349
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,260
What are they?

350
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Tell me one by one.

351
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,380
If you miss anything,

352
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,300
you'll be guilty of deceiving us.

353
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,630
Do you know it's a crime?

354
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
How inappropriate!

355
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,100
Mr. Lu,

356
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,940
please.

357
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,190
You can question me here.

358
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,100
Where did you go last night?

359
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,020
Luo Xiaoqi.

360
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,540
Why ask when you know the answer.

361
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,980
Where did you go last night?

362
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,430
Flower Pavilion.

363
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,190
Do you have any witness?

364
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,180
You.

365
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,490
Duke Lu.

366
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,110
Grandfather.

367
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,160
I...

368
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,040
Duke Lu.

369
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,850
Please.

370
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,080
Lord Shen.

371
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,740
So many guards here!

372
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,260
It's how I investigate a case.

373
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,630
Investigate a case?

374
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,980
Forgive me for being ignorant.

375
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,820
Lord Shen,

376
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,100
What is this major case about?

377
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,970
Is it so important that

378
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,160
you have the whole Lu family

379
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
and officials in contact with us

380
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,270
here at the administration of Beidian?

381
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,580
It is

382
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,150
Miss Yue’s case.

383
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Princess Changle

384
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,220
lost her beloved pet last night.

385
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,070
So she assaulted Yue in public,

386
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,970
causing Yue's miscarriage.

387
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,420
The farce in front of Duke Dingbei’s Mansion

388
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,550
is heatedly discussed in the capital.

389
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,140
Everyone in the city knew that

390
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,220
Yue committed suicide

391
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,220
by jumping into the river because she's heartbroken.

392
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,560
If you are investigating Yue's case,

393
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,620
then, where is Liu Ling?

394
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,580
Mr. Lu

395
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,570
stayed at the Flower Pavilion all night.

396
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,730
But you are

397
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,480
very well-informed

398
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,140
about what happened outside.

399
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,340
Shen Yan.

400
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,550
I know

401
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,420
you and Princess Changle

402
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,820
fell in love.

403
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,010
the princess is sad,

404
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,490
so you are unhappy.

405
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,020
You want to revenge for her,

406
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,620
You can take it out

407
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,820
on me.

408
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,460
But you can't do this.

409
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,500
Using public office for private gain,

410
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,760
framing the innocent.

411
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,980
That's right.

412
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,780
How could he

413
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,730
get us involved?

414
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,540
It's not good.

415
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,060
Jinlin Guard never

416
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,780
follows orders

417
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,540
from you.

418
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,620
Who told you to stop?

419
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,150
Continue!

420
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,100
-Yes. -Yes.

421
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,180
Why do you ask?

422
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,140
Again?

423
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,770
Are you done?

424
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,280
They are causing delays.

425
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,640
[Duke Dingbei's Mansion]

426
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Why is she not here already?

427
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:52,940
Father.

428
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,740
I'm hungry.

429
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,630
I'll eat first.

430
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,690
I can't stay here anymore.

431
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,110
She's just a junior.

432
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,900
How can she

433
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,580
keep the elderly waiting for her to eat?

434
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,980
Enough, stop talking.

435
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,620
What's wrong with that?

436
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,340
Ling.

437
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,760
-Grandpa. -Come here.

438
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,830
Sit down and eat.

439
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,450
Ling,

440
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,740
I heard

441
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,390
you went out last night

442
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,510
with Shen Yan?

443
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,540
Yesterday,

444
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,620
I was in trouble.

445
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,270
Lord Shen saved me,

446
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,710
Did you hear that?

447
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,530
You were ridiculous!

448
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,730
Yes.

449
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,020
I was ridiculous.

450
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,620
I wronged Ling.

451
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,540
Ling,

452
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,220
I will reward Shen Yan

453
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,020
for helping you.

454
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,780
But there is one thing.

455
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,980
From now on,

456
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,780
you should

457
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,810
stay away from him.

458
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,470
Okay?

459
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,650
Grandpa,

460
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,750
you don’t like Shen Yan?

461
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,340
Marriage is a major issue.

462
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,530
It's totally different from

463
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,290
liking someone.

464
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,860
-Grandpa, I... -Enough.

465
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,260
I can let you do anything else you want.

466
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,110
But you have to listen to me

467
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,610
on this one.

468
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm not feeling well.

469
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,520
I'll go back to my room.

470
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,660
Ling.

471
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,790
All you care about is eating. Enough!

472
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,850
Uh...

473
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,970
Now,

474
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,260
There's a lot of gossip

475
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,180
about Ling and Shen Yan

476
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,460
in the capital.

477
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,380
Tell me,

478
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,980
what should we do?

479
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,490
Why do we need to do anything?

480
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,730
This is a good thing, father.

481
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,060
Who is Shen Yan?

482
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,780
The commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard!

483
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,290
He is favored by His Majesty

484
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,810
and His Grace.

485
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,930
If they get married,

486
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,120
our Duke Dingbei’s family

487
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,540
will have a close relation

488
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,300
with the administration of Beidian.

489
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,140
Nonsense!

490
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,300
All you think about is marrying into power.

491
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,100
You don't care about Ling at all.

492
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,660
Royal family issues

493
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,020
are complicated.

494
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Ling and her father became enemies.

495
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,300
I'm the only one

496
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,620
holding them together.

497
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm old now.

498
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,330
What would Ling do

499
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,530
when I'm gone one day?

500
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,850
Didn’t she fall in love with Shen Yan?

501
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,650
With Shen Yan there,

502
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,630
who dares to offend her?

503
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,560
Shen Yan is one of the Jinlin Guard.

504
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,660
What's his job like?

505
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,820
It looks glamorous.

506
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,560
But actually,

507
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,510
it is an extremely dangerous job

508
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,200
with too many uncertainties.

509
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
If Ling marries him,

510
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
she will be considered as

511
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,980
a widow-to-be.

512
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,740
You are her uncle.

513
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,460
Why aren't you worried at all?

514
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,380
Yes.

515
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,300
Father.

516
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,230
You are right.

517
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,060
This marriage brings nothing

518
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,900
but harm.

519
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,100
She cannot

520
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,900
be with Shen Yan!

521
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,210
Father,

522
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,060
if you

523
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,220
break them apart,

524
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,830
aren’t you afraid that Ling will hate you?

525
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,960
Of course I'm afraid she'll hate me.

526
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,330
She's my treasure.

527
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,740
How can I not be afraid?

528
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,060
Then, what should we do?

529
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,860
You go.

530
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,940
You!

531
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,490
I...

532
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,300
My lord.

533
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:21,900
Everyone,

534
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,900
let's call it a day.

535
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,420
This homicide case involves many people.

536
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,550
In the next few days,

537
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,750
I'll have to bother you with it.

538
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,900
Luo Fan.

539
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,460
Yes.

540
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,220
See them out.

541
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,180
This is ridiculous!

542
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,100
I think

543
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,890
you're acting like you are impartial.

544
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,950
But in fact, he's using his power for personal gains

545
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,210
and personal revenge.

546
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,210
-Isn't he? -He is!

547
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,410
How could you do that?

548
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,690
Your Excellencies.

549
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,620
-What's with all this! -Please.

550
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,180
The Duke is

551
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,550
so unrighteous.

552
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,870
He has been

553
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,930
spoiling Ling.

554
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,130
Now he has a plan that will upset Ling.

555
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,050
He hides up

556
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,540
and pushed me out to be the bad guy.

557
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,310
Be gentle.

558
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,500
Legs.

559
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,060
You're right.

560
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Your father

561
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,480
doesn't like you

562
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,970
for a long time.

563
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,360
Today,

564
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,330
he asked you to break them up

565
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,620
and then let Ling deal with you.

566
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,730
Making others take the hit for him.

567
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,640
Killing two birds with one stone.

568
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,900
Young Duke, Madam.

569
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,260
Lady-in-waiting Xu is here.

570
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,590
Let her in.

571
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,290
Yes.

572
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,500
Greetings, young master.

573
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,600
Greetings, Madam.

574
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
-Rise. -Rise.

575
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,520
Please have a seat.

576
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,100
Your Ladyship

577
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,500
called me here in a hurry.

578
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,000
Is there anything urgent?

579
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,450
Yes.

580
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,650
You and Ling are close friends.

581
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,130
Do you know anything about

582
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,180
her and Shen Yan?

583
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,460
A little.

584
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,820
The members of the Jinlin Guard

585
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,020
deals with officials

586
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,690
and criminals

587
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,370
They can easily cause hatred.

588
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,460
His Lordship cares for Ling.

589
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,940
It's reasonable if he

590
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,450
wants to break up

591
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,900
Ling and Shen Yan.

592
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,980
What reasonable?

593
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,220
The Duke

594
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,900
wants to break Ling and Shen up,

595
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,760
but he doesn't want to upset Ling.

596
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,540
So he dumped the responsibility on me.

597
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,060
I...

598
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,220
You are Ling's uncle.

599
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,220
Of course

600
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,900
you wish her well.

601
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,540
Yes.

602
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,460
It's just that

603
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
Ling has never showed respect to us.

604
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,020
If we go and talk to her,

605
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,390
I'm afraid

606
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,260
she won't listen to us.

607
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,640
Right.

608
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,510
Lady-in-waiting Xu, you are

609
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,340
the best fit for this job.

610
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,660
In that case,

611
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,770
I'll give it a try.

612
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,550
Great.

613
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,700
Very good.

614
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,940
I'll take Ling out

615
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
for a walk later.

616
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,460
Young Master,

617
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,860
please go to

618
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,380
the administration of Beidian later

619
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,820
and ask Lord Shen to come here.

620
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,780
Please tell him

621
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,860
Ling has something important to tell him.

622
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,590
When he arrives at Ling's door,

623
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,530
just cough a little.

624
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:30,980
Okay.

625
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,230
I'll go get Ling.

626
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,650
What an interesting family！

627
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,060
He's afraid of offending the princess

628
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,330
so he wanted you to take the blame.

629
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,810
Why did you help them

630
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,490
and get involved in this mess?

631
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,120
I'm not helping them.

632
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm helping Ling.

633
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,310
Will Madam Shen

634
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,880
go to Hong Luo Temple today?

635
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,740
Yes.

636
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
I've asked around

637
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,620
for you.

638
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,380
She will leave around eight to pray for

639
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,240
happy marriages for her two sons.

640
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,330
Got it.

641
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,470
[All Wishes Will Be Granted]

642
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,100
Jin!

643
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,060
Why did you bring me here?

644
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Ling, did you know

645
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,060
Hong Luo Temple is famous for

646
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,350
praying for marriage?

647
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,140
Really?

648
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,370
You can try it

649
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,900
to see if it works.

650
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,150
Why don't you try it?

651
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,290
Go now.

652
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,060
"Amorous is also heartless.

653
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,700
What's left is

654
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,250
sadness with wine."

655
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,450
Jin,

656
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,180
it's an unlucky draw.

657
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,280
It doesn't matter.

658
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,160
Let's burn it

659
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,460
in the incense burner,

660
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,570
then it won't work.

661
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,810
-Really? -Yes.

662
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,730
Let's go.

663
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,600
Madam Shen.

664
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,500
It’s God’s will.

665
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,920
Why are you so stubborn?

666
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,330
You just did

667
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,300
a sinful thing.

668
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,200
How dare you come to the Buddha to make a wish?

669
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,380
I didn't know

670
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,610
about her pregnancy.

671
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
Pregnancy?

672
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,620
Did you know

673
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,870
Yue Ling

674
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,990
is dead?

675
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,800
Madam, you are a wise lady.

676
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,380
Although people in the capital

677
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,410
said Yue Ling jumped into the lake

678
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,040
because she had a miscarriage.

679
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,170
In my opinion,

680
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,720
there's something fishy about this.

681
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,480
I'm afraid from the beginning,

682
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,530
someone plotted it against Her Highness.

683
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,020
Madam Shen,

684
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,950
do you think

685
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,050
I killed someone

686
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,510
because of jealousy?

687
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,380
What I think

688
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,740
doesn't matter.

689
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,540
But Yue died

690
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,910
because of your

691
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,130
flashy personality.

692
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,340
We dare not to have someone like you

693
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,860
marry into our family.

694
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,290
Please have some mercy

695
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,260
and let go of Yan.

696
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,710
Let’s go.

697
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,500
Ling.

698
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,850
He is just a commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard.

699
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,060
How dare he act

700
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,810
so arrogantly?

701
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,860
He's relying on the Crown Prince.

702
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,560
I think he's determined to

703
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,990
act against your family

704
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,340
and us,

705
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,670
the veteran officials.

706
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,360
Lord Liu,

707
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,020
don't worry.

708
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,660
Even His Majesty can't do it.

709
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,380
The Crown Prince

710
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,610
can't do anything about it.

711
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,140
Without his right-hand men,

712
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,780
he won't be able to

713
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,900
make any trouble.

714
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,930
You mean...

715
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,480
What funny things

716
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,460
did you hear?

717
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,260
A nobody

718
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,390
has

719
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,610
great expectations.

720
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,660
What follows will be

721
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,730
more amusing.

722
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,050
Take a seat.

723
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,580
You are making me dizzy.

724
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,180
Jin,

725
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,900
did you plan my meeting

726
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,220
with Mrs. Shen?

727
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,620
You'll have to face it

728
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,500
sooner or later.

729
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,380
You can't avoid it.

730
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,660
What should I do now?

731
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,900
Mrs. Shen and grandpa

732
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,730
won't allow me to be with Shen Yan.

733
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,180
When we had breakfast today,

734
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,740
grandpa

735
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,380
forbade me to talk to Shen Yan.

736
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,700
Since I came back to Yejing,

737
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,900
troubles followed me

738
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,860
wherever I went.

739
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,580
It feels like there's no end.

740
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,820
That's how life is.

741
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,380
Especially with love,

742
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,040
things are more complicated.

743
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,260
You've only been back a few days.

744
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,980
Your relationship

745
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,320
has been obstructed by many.

746
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,600
It must be hard for you.

747
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,860
Jin,

748
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,300
you don't support us

749
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,630
being together as well?

750
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,740
I do.

751
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,220
Shen Yan is a good man.

752
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,500
When you are with him,

753
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
you look different.

754
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,460
Ling, did you know

755
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,890
when you were with him,

756
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,250
you had the brightest smile

757
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,070
that I haven't seen

758
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,190
for many years.

759
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,030
But...

760
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,260
But what?

761
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,460
But

762
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,680
I’ve been wondering.

763
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,420
The mistakes your parents made

764
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,300
when you were little

765
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,500
traumatized you.

766
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,850
All these years,

767
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,420
you haven't

768
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,060
fallen in love with any man,

769
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,670
right?

770
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,060
Then why is Shen Yan

771
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,659
an exception?

772
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,139
Shen Yan

773
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,460
is different!

774
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,620
Please.

775
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,460
Ling,

776
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,929
if you are not sure about your heart,

777
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,139
listen to my advice,

778
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,620
break up with him for good.

779
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,820
Stop falling for him.

780
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,500
Why do you say that?

781
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,030
Do you know

782
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,310
what you have to overcome

783
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,639
for your relationship?

784
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,380
Mrs. Shen?

785
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,860
Grandpa?

786
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,500
And Family Lu?

787
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,660
No.

788
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
You have to face your mother's death

789
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,780
and solve your own issue.

790
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,250
Let’s leave other things for now.

791
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,090
Ling,

792
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,140
tell me with certainty

793
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,100
right now that

794
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,020
you love Shen Yan

795
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,850
with all your heart.

796
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,180
And you believe

797
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
you and he

798
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,740
will love each other for life

799
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,000
and grow old together.

800
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,660
You have no doubts about that.

801
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,490
I do love him

802
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,140
whole-heartedly.

803
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,140
But

804
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,100
I'm not sure about

805
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,960
loving each other for life

806
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,180
and growing old together.

807
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,420
As you said,

808
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,860
my mother's death

809
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,470
and my own issues

810
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,800
scare me.

811
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,660
So,

812
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,140
I don't know and don't dare to

813
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,060
think about the future.

814
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,450
I...

815
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,470
I don't know

816
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,760
what will happen in a lifetime.

817
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,280
Shen Yan!

818
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,860
Shen Yan, I...

819
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,380
Shen Yan!

820
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,500
If you are uncertain,

821
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,540
what's the use of going after him?

822
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,140
Did you

823
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,610
do it on purpose?

824
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,900
You may think

825
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,540
I'm trying to break you up.

826
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,700
But Ling,

827
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,730
I hope

828
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,260
you can listen to me on this.

829
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,620
Although Shen Yan is

830
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,220
a member of the Jinlin Guard,

831
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,300
his family is not as powerful

832
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,620
as the Liu and Lu families.

833
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,940
Your Mr. Shen

834
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,500
can’t stand

835
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,420
the schemes and changes in Yejing.

836
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,980
If you are uncertain,

837
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,020
you might as well stop right now.

838
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,260
Otherwise,

839
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,350
if Shen Yan

840
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,560
risks his life for you in the future,

841
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
I'm worried about you.

842
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,580
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

843
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,540
You're here.

844
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,880
How is the investigation going

845
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,960
about the jade?

846
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,680
This is the only place

847
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,370
to find clues about the jade?

848
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,720
Even with your skills,

849
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,340
you can't

850
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,740
walk freely there?

851
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,620
Fine.

852
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,140
It looks like

853
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,540
I need to do it myself.

854
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,570
"You love Shen Yan

855
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,340
with all your heart.

856
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,660
And you believe

857
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,100
you and he will love each other for life

858
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,470
and grow old together.

859
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,430
You have no doubts about that."

860
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,300
"I do love him

861
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,930
whole-heartedly.

862
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,820
But

863
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,340
I'm not sure about

864
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,360
loving each other for life

865
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,560
and growing old together.

866
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,420
As you said,

867
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,940
my mother's death

868
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,040
and my own issues

869
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,260
all scare me.

870
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,720
I don't know and don't dare to

871
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,700
think about the future.

872
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,860
I don't know

873
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,970
what will happen in a lifetime."

874
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,640
Your Highness.

875
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,460
Your Highness.

876
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,460
I just came here

877
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,010
and saw the light on in your room.

878
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,260
Why are you still up?

879
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
I can't sleep.

880
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,300
Let me chat with you.

881
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,340
If a woman

882
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,500
really falls in love with someone,

883
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,560
there should be signs?

884
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,180
Signs?

885
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,620
Your Highness,

886
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,500
I remember.

887
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,160
I served a lady

888
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,610
at Duke Dingbei’s Mansion.

889
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,270
She said there are thousands of bitterness in the world.

890
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,100
Living as a human is the most painful thing.

891
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,460
She also said

892
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,260
she fell in love with a man.

893
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,020
But when she wanted to see him

894
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,180
but couldn't,

895
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,420
she cried very often.

896
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,630
She cried very often?

897
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,020
You have a point.

898
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,100
I know.

899
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,600
From tomorrow onwards,

900
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,040
I won't see Lord Shen.

901
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,110
If I can cry

902
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,370
because I miss him,

903
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,720
it means

904
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,220
I really love him.

905
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,380
That way,

906
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,060
I can stand in front of him

907
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,480
to express my feelings.

-Lord. -Lord Shen.

910
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,140
You're awake.

911
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,610
My lord,

912
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,050
it's just seven in the morning,

913
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,900
why are you here?

914
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,110
Wake up the brothers.

915
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,700
Get up and work on the case.

916
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,630
Work on the case?

917
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,160
Why are you in such a hurry?

918
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,290
We're not in a hurry.

919
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,170
We need to let some people feel anxious.

920
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,860
Yes.

My lord.

925
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,220
Look how scared someone is.

926
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:10,660
Open the door.

927

I still don't understand

what we are searching for.

Open the door!

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,760
It doesn't matter if you don't understand.

Mr. Lu understands.

935

Okay.

We'll search it

937

Shen Yan.

You keep saying

946
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,740
you wanted to investigate Yue's death.

00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,940

Okay.

I'll let you search today.

how will you explain it?

Why don't we make a bet

961

you can hide it.
