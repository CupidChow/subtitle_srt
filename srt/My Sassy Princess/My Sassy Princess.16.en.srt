00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,120
Liu Ling.

179
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,030
Seven is drunk.

180
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,790
Let's go.

181
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,290
A toast to you.

182
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,780
Seven, come on.

183
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,080
Let's go.

184
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,660
You...

185
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,710
Don't pull me.

186
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,070
I want to propose a toast.

187
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,950
Come on.

188
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,540
I...

189
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,030
can drink.

190
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,050
Go.

191
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,070
The administration of Beidian.

192
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,420
Commander Shen.

193
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Nice to meet you.

194
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,060
Cheers.

195
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,140
Drinking is bad for your health.

196
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,090
You should drink less.

197
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,180
Princess.

198
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,630
What are you doing?

199
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,050
I've been waiting for you all night.

200
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,000
You finally talk to me.

201
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,260
Today is

202
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,890
a good day.

203
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,380
I'm here to give a gift.

204
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,230
Do you know that?

205
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,160
I know.

206
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,790
You don't know.

207
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,140
I'm here

208
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,210
not to give Seven a gift.

209
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm here to give you a gift.

210
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,230
For you.

211
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,820
Do you like it?

212
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,420
You don't want to talk to me,

213
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,330
but I've made up my mind.

214
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,380
I want to leave you all

215
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,840
before I go.

216
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,970
Only after you left

217
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,560
did I realize that

218
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,490
the person in my heart was not

219
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,680
as good as those who could be seen and touched.

220
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,390
♫ My longing for you runs like an endless song ♫

221
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,780
Shen Yan,

222
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,500
you can't give me

223
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,530
what I really want.

224
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,770
Why should we waste time

225
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,820
♫ I love you to the moon and back ♫

226
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,460
to compromise to each other?

227
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,040
I return it

228
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,630
♫ I promise to love you always ♫

229
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,380
to you.

230
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,030
My heart is not with you.

231
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,040
♫ I never want to say goodbyes to you ♫

232
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,270
It's useless for me.

233
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,300
Give it to others.

234
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,750
♫ You are in my dreams; you are in my heart ♫

235

♫ My untold thoughts, my lovesickness ♫

236

♫ Your love for me is like my love for you ♫

237
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,140
Ling Bi.

238
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:09,560
♫ We’ll never feel lonely in the world ♫

239
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,680
Princess.

240
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,980
The princess is drunk.

241
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,720
Send her back.

242
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,110
♫ I’ll share your wishes in the coming years ♫

243
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,010
Send the princess back.

244
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,450
♫ All the love poems fail to portray my love for you ♫

245
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,500
Lord Shen said I was drunk.

246
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,600
♫ I promise to take your hand and grow old with you ♫

247
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,220
That means I'm drunk.

248
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,010
♫ Don't ask about the way home. I just want to be by your side for life ♫

249
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,280
But I won't be drunk

250
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,760
♫ I will give you a lifelong promise, just as you wish ♫

251
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,570
like this again.

252
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,780
♫ Your every wish will come true. It's worth the wait ♫

253
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,480
♫ I only want to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

254
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,180
♫ And indulge in the world holding your hand ♫

255
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,340
Princess.

256
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:06,620
♫ And indulge in the world holding your hand ♫

257
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,690
How is it?

258
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,730
Come on.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,730
Have a drink.

260
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,120
Have some food.

261
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,080
These are the chopsticks the princess used.

262
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,100
This is the princess's cup.

263
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,460
What do you think

264
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,970
Liu Ling is?

265
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,069
Princess Peace

266
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
is a very beautiful girl.

267
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
And?

268
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,400
Although she has a bad temper,

269
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,650
she's a good girl.

270
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,080
How do you know

271
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,230
she's a good girl?

272
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,040
Because she's Jin's friend.

273
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,300
Shen Er,

274
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,730
you're drunk.

275
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,170
I'm drunk.

276
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,630
Princess.

277
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,120
Princess, you are drunk.

278
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,740
Why are you

279
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,020
walking alone?

280
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,580
Princess,

281
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,430
there seems to be a pharmacy ahead.

282
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,490
I'll go take a look.

283
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,100
Wait for me here.

284
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,440
Wait for me here.

285
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,890
Hi.

286
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,460
Do you have any

287
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,700
anti-alcohol drugs?

288
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,500
We have a secret recipe

289
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,810
for hangover.

290
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,900
Wait here.

291
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,050
I'll bring her over.

292
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,890
Where is the princess?

293
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,610
Princess.

294
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,110

I'm serious about this.

299

you don't have to be tough.

as the butler said.

347
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,780
She is really

348
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,200
different.

349
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,760
It's not strange.

350
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,690
She wanted

351
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,330
to meet Shen Yan there.

352
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,690
To meet Lord Shen?

353
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,570
I feel sorry for them.

354
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,950
At this time,

355
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,930
the marriage is almost settled.

356
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,900
But Ling

357
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,440
still wanted to meet Shen Yan.

358
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,640
What do you want to say

359
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,410
to the princess?

360
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,740
It's not easy for Ling to meet Shen Yan.

361
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,090
When we get to Seven's house,

362
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,460
don't disturb them.

363
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,460
Park the carriage

364
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,550
outside and

365
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,780
wait for Ling.

366
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,420
Miss, look.

367
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
Isn't that the princess?

368
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,820
Jin.

369
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,180
I regret it so much.

370
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,470
At that time,

371
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,430
I fell off the cliff

372
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,850
with Shen Yan.

373
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,190
When he said he was coming back,

374
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,950
I was really scared.

375
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,890
I thought

376
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,870
I was scared of

377
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,300
Yejing.

378
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,210
It was complicated.

379
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,350
It was inevitable that

380
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
there would be

381
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,370
many unnecessary troubles.

382
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,460
But now I know

383
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,620
it's not like that.

384
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,410
It's not like that.

385
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,130
It's fine. Don't talk about it.

386
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,940
It's fine.

387
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,970
I was wrong.

388
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,320
I was really wrong.

389
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,220
Actually, God

390
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,960
gave me and Shen Yan a chance

391
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,790
to escape from

392
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,390
our destinies.

393
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,090
But I missed it.

394
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,860
I...

395
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,200
I...

396
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,450
I didn't escape.

397
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,210
So,

398
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,260
I didn't seize that chance.

399
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,160
Jin.

400
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,720
I love Shen Yan.

401
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
I really love him.

402
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,260
We had agreed

403
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,550
to hold hands

404
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,350
and grow old together.

405
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,730
But what should we do now?

406
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,300
I pissed him off.

407
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,970
It's too late.

408
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,390
It's too late, Jin.

409
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,890
I pissed him off.

410
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,800
Alright, don't cry.

411
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,440
Ling.

412
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,260
What should I do?

413
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,610
Ling, you're awake.

414
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,380
I made porridge for you.

415
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,370
Get up and have some

416
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,570
to warm your stomach.

417
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,270
It's okay.

418
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,350
I’m not eating. I’m leaving.

419
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,020
Ling.

420
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,700
If you ask me,

421
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,900
I will save you.

422
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,820
This is my business.

423
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,580
Lord Shen doesn't have to get involved.

424
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,690
Neither do you.

425
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,060
What about you?

426
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,730
Are you really going to marry

427
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,700
Tuoba Lie?

428
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,650
I accept my fate.

429
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
I will suffer less

430
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,260
by accepting it.

431
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,040
What Prince Guangping said makes sense.

432
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,980
Right?

433
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,540
I’m leaving.

434
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,060
Ling,

435
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
think carefully.

436
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,130
If it is easy for you

437
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,070
to help me,

438
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,900
you don't have to ask me.

439
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,780
You don't even

440
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,590
need to tell me

441
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,140
and settle everything.

442
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,280
You want me to ask you

443
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,740
because

444
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,260
although you can help me,

445
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,620
this is

446
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,800
very dangerous.

447
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,700
So you want me

448
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,530
to give you a reason

449
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,720
to do it,

450
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,410
right?

451
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,620
Ling,

452
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,980
sometimes I really hope

453
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,510
you don't know me that well.

454
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,430
So Jin,

455
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,030
don't do anything meaningless.

456
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
You should have your own happiness.

457
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,270
Silly Ling.

458
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,230
If I had a way,

459
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,980
how would I watch you

460
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,020
marry Tuoba Lie?

461
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,300
How would I live

462
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,580
without a care

463
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,380
in the future?

464
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,180
What did it say in the letter

465
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,840
from the Xu family last night?

466
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,970
Your Royal Highness,

467
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,130
Miss Xu said

468
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,950
she had a night chat with the princess.

469
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,690
She will be back early this morning.

470
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,680
Early?

471
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,290
It's almost noon.

472
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,460
Why isn't she back yet?

473
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,260
Should I send someone

474
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,020
to ask?

475
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,740
No need.

476
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,350
She and Miss Xu are friends.

477
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,760
She must feel sad

478
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,900
before leaving.

479
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,740
Yes.

480
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,590
Ling.

481
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,340
Get in.

482
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,320
Your luggage

483
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,560
is packed.

484
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,400
His Royal Highness is not feeling well.

485
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,460
I've already informed him.

486
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,060
I'm going back to my bedroom and take a look.

487
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,120
What's that about?

488
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,030
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

489
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,350
If you can't wait,

490
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,990
you can leave by yourself.

491
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,320
Don't be unreasonable.

492
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,150
Liu Ling.

493
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,570
At that time,

494
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,600
he was lying here

495
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,190
and pretending to ignore me.

496
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
But I know

497
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,170
he cared about me.

498
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,430
He gave me a red string

499
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,690
and said he would marry me.

500
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,080
He asked me to wait for him.

501
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,500
It's my fault.

502
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,740
I can't wait anymore.

503
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,580
I'm thinking of him like this.

504
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,900
I remember

505
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,830
everything between us.

506
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,010
Do you think

507
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,540
will he think of me?

508
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,510
Will he

509
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,860
think of these things

510
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,940
when he comes here one day?

511
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,720
Will he feel as sad as I do?

512
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,890
Princess.

513
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,390
Princess, stop talking.

514
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,900
Lord Shen will never

515
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,110
forget you.

516
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,900
No.

517
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,590
I can't leave like this.

518
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,290
After I leave,

519
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,730
everything here

520
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,860
will slowly disappear.

521
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,180
One day,

522
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,830
everything between me and Shen Yan

523
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,830
will vanish

524
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,370
like it never happened.

525
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,200
Ling Bi.

526
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Tell me.

527
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,620
What does "never forget each other" mean?

528
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,370
That means

529
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,060
people don't forget each other.

530
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,750
Even if they can't see each other,

531
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,670
they will think of each other.

532
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,190
Go to the market

533
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,540
and find the best painter

534
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,300
to draw a portrait for me.

535
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,210
No, princess.

536
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,020
Don't blame me for talking too much.

537
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,540
His Royal Highness.

538
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,180
He is still waiting outside.

539
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,260
You've always been cold

540
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,520
to His Royal Highness.

541
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,220
If you

542
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,340
draw the portrait again,

543
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,460
he will say...

544
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,300
Then just tell him

545
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,580
to find a painter

546
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,860
for me.

547
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,740
That way,

548
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,660
I show my respect.

549
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,010
Go.

550
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,300
Remember,

551
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,910
I want the best painter.

552
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,100
Miss,

553
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,060
have you made up your mind?

554
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,300
I know

555
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,610
you have always been careful

556
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,600
and determined.

557
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,300
But...

558
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,340
It's just that...

559
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,780
I want to remind you

560
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,659
His Grace

561
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,030
always respect you

562
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,460
and rarely get involved.

563
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,420
But the other day

564
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,820
he told you

565
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,120
not to

566
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,560
do any

567
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,719
unnecessary things.

568
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,860
I know at this critical moment,

569
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,340
lots of people

570
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,660
will keep an eye on me

571
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,680
Do you know

572
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,180
once we do it,

573
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,990
everything and

574
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,260
all our efforts

575
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,960
may be in vain.

576
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,510
In a lifetime,

577
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,980
if we don't do crazy things

578
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,380
and fight for ourselves,

579
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,600
we'll forget that we're still alive.

580
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,590
Nuanxiang,

581
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,050
bring me a pen and paper.

582
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,920
I'm going to make a deal

583
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,070
with Lord Shen.

584
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,980
[The administration of Beidian]

585
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,750
Lord Shen, Lady-in-waiting Xu wants to see you.

586
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,700
I didn't expect

587
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,420
to meet you

588
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,610
in such a short time.

589
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,080
What brings you here

590
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,570
in the middle of the night?

591
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,660
I think

592
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,770
Ling should be in Jiangzhou now.

593
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,800
I met her on the street that night.

594
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,430
She walked on the street alone

595
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,350
and drenched

596
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,980
looking for a red string.

597
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,840
Have you seen it?

598
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,290
What are you trying to say?

599
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,340
I came here at night

600
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,260
to discuss something with you.

601
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,600
If it works,

602
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,820
Ling will be able to escape from

603
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,420
the fate of marriage to Yigu.

604
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,690
The money in Jiangzhou

605
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,760
is here.

606
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,700
I will bring up

607
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,790
the Jiangzhou case

608
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,180
on Ling's way to Yigu.

609
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,340
And I will prove the innocence

610
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,970
to the Xu family.

611
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,270
After that,

612
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,380
the stolen money

613
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,620
will be revealed.

614
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,860
As long as we arrange it well,

615
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,670
the conflict

616
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,580
between Wei

617
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,980
and Yigu

618
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,080
will be triggered.

619
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,220
The marriage

620
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
will be breached.

621
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,920
What you need to do

622
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,720
is to visit the Crown Prince tomorrow

623
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,150
by the excuse of spying on Yigu's information,

624
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,080
to get the position of escort team.

625
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,950
When Yigu's escort team begins to fight,

626
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,590
you can help Ling escape

627
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,150
and return to Wei safely.

628
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,700
Princess Peace has returned to Jiangzhou for her wedding.

629
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,420
I will try to forget her.

630
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,570
What has past is past.

631
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,140
Thank you

632
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,180
for your concern.

633
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,470
It's getting late.

634
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,820
Lady-in-waiting,

635
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,820
please leave.

636
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,580
The marriage

637
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,040
wasn't Ling's intention.

638
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,200
Don't you know that?

639
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,220
I know.

640
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
You’re afraid of being exposed.

641
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,980
And it will offend the emperor

642
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,710
and implicate the Shen family.

643
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I can't give

644
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,160
what she wants.

645
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,180
I can't stop

646
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,110
her choice.

647
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,780
Her choice?

648
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,150
In her life,

649
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,580
she had carried too much.

650
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,380
She had carried her mother's life

651
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,780
and Duke Dingbei's life.

652
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,230
Now,

653
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,900
she is carrying the safety of the people of Wei

654
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,980
on her.

655
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,780
Now you say it's her choice.

656
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,980
Did she have a choice?

657
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,460
She did,

658
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,230
but she didn't give me

659
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,290
a chance to choose.

660
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,900
She gave up

661
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,450
and became a deserter.

662
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,790
She was drunk yesterday

663
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,830
and kept calling your name.

664
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,820
I know you are proud

665
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,350
and won't turn back easily.

666
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,780
Within seven days,

667
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,500
if you still care about Ling,

668
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,990
and change your mind,

669
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,250
come to me.

670
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,430
Miss.

671
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,940
How is it going?

672
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,900
Before she left,

673
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,330
she must have said

674
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,790
something hurting to Shen Yan.

675
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,200
Shen Yan is arrogant.

676
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,580
It's difficult.

677
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,390
By the way,

678
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,300
after you left,

679
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,170
the Crown Prince sent someone here.

680
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,560
I said you went out for a walk

681
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,690
to the people sent by the Crown Prince.

682
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,920
Recently,

683
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,170
he seems to come here a lot.

684
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,690
His Grace is suspicious

685
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,750
recently.

686
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,660
If you stop now,

687
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,330
you can still hide it.

688
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,260
Ling is going to a dangerous place.

689
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,630
How could I do nothing about it?

690
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,180
But...

691
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,870
Miss,

692
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,960
you have tried your best.

693
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,300
Now Princess Peace didn't ask for help and

694
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,220
Lord Shen remains silent.

695
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,040
Miss, why do you insist

696
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,780
to do that?

697
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,530
Life or death,

698
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,100
it's a result.

699
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,210
It's better than

700
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,700
being a living corpse.

701
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,410
It's much easier.

702
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,490
Tomorrow, send this letter

703
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,060
to the administration of Nandian,

704
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,010
Shen Yu.

705
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,330
Now he is the only one

706
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,960
who can persuade Shen Yan.

707
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,660
Miss,

708
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,100
is it really

709
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,460
worth it?

710
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,850
If we want

711
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,380
to save Ling this time,

712
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,110
we have to pay a price.

713
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,020
Go.

714
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:21,740
My lord.

715
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,180
Here is a letter from

716
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,970
a girl named

717
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,650
Nuanxiang.

718
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:42,680
My lord.

719
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,790
You haven't read it yet.

720
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,230
Why...

721
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,930
I can't help her.

722
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,880
What's the point of reading this letter?

723
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,140
My lord.

724
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,160
The evidence is solid that you colluded with the foreign enemies.

725
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,710
Seven

726
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,270
Yes.

727
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,940
Take him back.

728
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,610
Yes.

729
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:24,710
Take him.
