[Episode 2]

4
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,210
It gets stuck.

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,430
You are good at driving a carriage.

6
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,750
You always go where there is a pit.

7
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,150
You!

8
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,780
Yes.

9
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,580
It did get stuck.

10
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,460
You!

11
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,100
What do you mean?

12
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,270
It seems the carriage can't move.

13
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,020
-Can you make it? -You're right.

14
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,710
Girls,

15
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:57,670
you just stay here.

16
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,509
Buddies, go.

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,380
Why do you look on here?

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
You, stand there.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,770
Stand there.

20
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,380
I think you'd better

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,650
get the wheel out

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,310
before Lord Shen and princess

23
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,419
come back.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,360
What if I say no?

25
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,540
Lord Shen will definitely punish you.

26
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,850
Girl,

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,740
there's no need to worry for us.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
See, your princess

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,020
is constantly following

30
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,180
our lord.

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,180
Does she have a crush on

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,060
our lord?

33
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,650
Stop talking nonsense.

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,390
You're bringing shame on princess's reputation.

35
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,790
What are you laughing at?

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,920
Behave yourself.

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,490
You!

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,110
You want our lord

39
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,120
to escort your princess to the capital.

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
You're obviously

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,610
asking

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,620
for

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,910
the

44
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,320
moon.

45
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,930
Is my riding skill

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,350
good enough to grab Lord Shen's attention?

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
To stay with me alone,

48
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,090
Lord Shen really cudgeled your brains.

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,560
If I had gone against you,

50
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,380
I would have wasted your effort.

51
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,820
Let's negotiate about it.

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,660
About what?

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,820
Lord Shen should escort me off.

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,950
When we arrive Yejing,

55
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,510
I'll return the waist token to you.

56
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,750
What if I disagree?

57
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,180
Then I will take this waist token

58
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,890
and cry in front of your men.

59
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,660
Do you really think

60
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,230
I won't snatch it back?

61
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,490
If Lord Shen resorts to force,

62
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,340
I'll have no way to resist

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,540
as a weak girl.

64
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,670
I am tired of waiting.

65
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,500
Has Lord Shen made up your mind?

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,060
We won't take the same route.

67
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,079
Since we are both going to Yejing,

68
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,079
how could it be?

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,079
I'll go along the mountain roads,

70
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,900
and you'll go along broad roads.

71
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,770
It's quiet in the mountains.

72
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm willing to go with you.

73
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,020
We need to brave the wind and dew.

74
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,090
I'm afraid Your Highness will feel wronged.

75
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm not afraid of that.

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,750
Alright.

77
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,870
So you agree?

78
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,500
When we arrive in Yejing,

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,920
you should return my waist token back.

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,960
Don't forget

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
your promise.

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,040
Shen Yan.

83
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,810
No.128, stop.

84
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,870
Where shall I find it?

85
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,750
It turns to be in the forest.

86
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,540
For life or for death, however separated,

87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,270
to my beloved I pledged my word.

88
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,850
I held his hand.

89
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,760
We are to grow old together.

90
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,260
My Lord,

91
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,370
I've assisted you in handling cases for years

92
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,800
and I've never seen whom you can't handle with.

93
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,530
But why can't you

94
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,170
deal with this crazy girl?

95
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,020
She will follow us

96
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,680
whether I agree or not.

97
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,090
But it is dangerous

98
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,170
of this trip.

99
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,800
We need to escort Yun Yi off.

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,300
And now,

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,430
we need to protect a princess.

102
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,540
If she really meets some danger,

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,550
we have to send some men to protect her.

104
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,830
It is a hassle.

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
But,

106
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,620
a hassle has its own advantages.

107
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,730
[Courier Station]

108
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,250
Who's there?

109
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,180
Lord Shen,

110
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,420
this man somehow

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,570
trespassed on here.

112
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,570
Your Highness,

113
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,920
Bodyguard Yang is here.

114
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,750
I have a question.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,400
And I wish you can answer it for me.

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Say it.

117
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,930
Why would your bodyguard know

118
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,650
where I was going to stop?

119
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,650
Yang Ye.

120
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,930
Reply to Lord Shen.

121
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,230
Lord Shen came to Jiangzhou

122
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,190
in order to arrest Yun Yi.

123
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,590
Yun Yi hid himself in Jiangzhou City,

124
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,320
so Lord Shen purposely

125
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,400
left him an exit

126
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,790
to lead him out

127
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,680
and ambushed him outside the city.

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,940
After arresting the criminal,

129
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,400
you went along mountain roads

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,880
and finally rested

131
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,400
at Jinlin Guard's camp.

132
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,740
Princess's bodyguard looks like a martial master.

133
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,270
He can pry for messages

134
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,330
of Jin Lin Guard so clearly.

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,940
I valued Lord Shen so much

136
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,350
that I wanted to know

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,130
every move and every act of you.

138
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,860
So, outside Jiangzhou City,

139
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,780
it was

140
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,290
not a coincidence

141
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,590
that princess came over in a carriage.

142
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,450
Although our meeting was

143
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,170
not a coincidence,

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,360
there are always many things

145
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,600
out of expectation.

146
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,970
Am I right, my Lord?

147
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,190
What's your purpose

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,700
of racking your brains to

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
go with Jin Lin Guard?

150
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,100
My purpose?

151
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,510
Of course

152
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,170
for Lord Shen.

153
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,900
She did all these for Lord Shen?

154
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,750
What are you doing here?

155
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,880
Go pack your luggage.

156
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,890
Yes.

157
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,770
My Lord,

158
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,800
you should go back and have a rest.

159
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,560
Wait.

160
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,110
Princess likes this one.

161
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,460
So, we will live in this.

162
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,790
This is always

163
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,420
Lord Shen's room.

164
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,909
And that is mine.

165
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,970
As for this big one,

166
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,880
it is the one where our men live

167
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
and handle cases.

168
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,460
If you want to live,

169
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,100
live in that one.

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,320
I don't care.

171
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,409
As princess likes this one,

172
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,440
we should live in this one.

173
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,040
You!

174
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,460
My Lord,

175
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,070
She's being unreasonable.

176
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,660
Let's go.

177
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,980
Let's go, too.

178
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,250
My Lord,

179
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,130
Princess Changle was...

180
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,050
As a noble lady,

181
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,810
she just felt bored

182
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,180
and was killing time here.

183
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,110
Just ignore her.

184
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,070
We can ignore her.

185
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,030
But see

186
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,690
how she acted just now.

187
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,730
She'll

188
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,059
surely delay our trip.

189
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,730
That

190
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,620
is exactly what I want.

191
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,580
Tell our men to prepare

192
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,580
more food and dried firewood.

193
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,309
We'll live here for extra days.

194
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,330
Live here?

195
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,160
Invite him into the jar?

196
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,410
Is Lord

197
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,900
[Invite him into the jar]

198
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,150
making Yun Yi a bait

199
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,300
and going with the flow?

200
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,260
You are actually fishing,

201
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,860
my Lord.

202
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,090
To bring them out,

203
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,790
we should give the fish

204
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,390
an opportunity to sound out.

205
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,390
On our way to escort a criminal back to the capital,

206
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,570
we happened to meet

207
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,540
a wicked princess

208
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,140
and needed to escort her off.

209
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,360
If this piece of news

210
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,760
is passed to the capital,

211
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,980
those hungry fish that are eager for food

212
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,380
will surely take action.

213
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,930
Isn't it a Heaven-sent chance?

214
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,620
So clever of you, my lord.

215
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,170
[Lu Mansion]

216
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,020
[Lu Mingshan A concubine's child in Lu Family]

217
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,890
You must have been overwhelmed by the anger.

218
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,240
The prince now inspects the state as the imperial edict said.

219
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,660
What he wants is of course contribution

220
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,600
and achievement.

221
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,900
Accordingly, taking Jiangzhou's money back

222
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,160
is the best achievement he can complete.

223
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,650
The Lady-in-waiting of Family Xu awaits the proper moment

224
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,990
and goes with the flow.

225
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,030
She is surely a clever woman.

226
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,490
You know nothing.

227
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,060
That humble woman is not a threat at all.

228
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,610
What worries me

229
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,360
is Stern-faced Yama, Shen Yan.

230
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,870
If he really succeeds in

231
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,030
arresting Yun Yi,

232
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,320
the Lu Family

233
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,860
will be under threat.

234
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,600
Grandpa, don't worry.

235
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
You can just leave this matter to me.

236
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,070
What can you do?

237
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,870
Grandpa,

238
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,940
however smart Shen Yan is,

239
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,380
he is an ordinary man

240
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,590
anyway.

241
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,800
So,

242
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,280
we can somehow find his weakness.

243
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,970
Ling Bi,

244
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,740
see.

245
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,230
The air is so fresh.

246
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,590
Another chance encounter.

247
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,710
It seems that it is fate

248
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,190
that leads us two

249
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,210
together.

250
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,790
We have no way to resist.

251
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,830
I'm engaged. I'm leaving.

252
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,670
Your Highness,

253
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,310
see.

254
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,480
They're talking behind our backs.

255
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,630
They must be speaking ill of us.

256
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,360
Stop that.

257
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,810
Lord Shen has lost heart to me

258
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,900
at first sight.

259
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,060
He said that

260
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,700
just because he felt shy.

261
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
Princess Changle

262
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,810
is quite unusual.

263
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,230
Captain Luo,

264
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,630
what did you say?

265
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,270
You bold Luo Fan.

266
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,550
You meant disrespect to princess.

267
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,300
You're offending your superior.

268
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,830
Are you aware of your crime?

269
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,220
It's I who said that.

270
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,100
Your Highness,

271
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,340
please don't embarrass others.

272
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,150
Your Highness,

273
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,450
My lord didn't say that.

274
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,290
It's me.

275
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,010
He was speaking the truth.

276
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,010
What's wrong with that?

277
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,670
It's okay.

278
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,670
Lord Shen is unique.

279
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,770
Others can't offend me.

280
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,720
But you can.

281
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,390
It's just that

282
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,820
we'd better talk about that in private.

283
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,640
Your Highness.

284
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,700
Stop standing still.

285
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,570
Do what you are supposed to do.

286
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,970
Your Highness,

287
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,940
Shen Yan was obviously

288
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,580
covering up his man's crime.

289
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,020
He ignored Your Highness's prestige,

290
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,150
but why didn't you call him to account?

291
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,560
Did you see

292
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,940
Lord Shen's expression

293
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,460
at that moment?

294
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,940
What expression?

295
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,780
He smiled.

296
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,020
Did he?

297
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,300
A smile of Lord Shen is worth much.

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,470
And what else did I need

299
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,430
to care about?

300
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,940
You don't care about these.

301
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,180
This room,

302
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,360
this room is small and broken,

303
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,420
but you don't care about this.

304
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,620
And this bed.

305
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,560
This bed is dirty, hard and broken, too.

306
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,200
It's even wet but you don't care about this.

307
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
And this door.

308
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,110
There are some leaks in the door.

309
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,450
But you still don't care about that.

310
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,220
Why do you

311
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,720
need to compromise?

312
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,460
And that Shen Yan.

313
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,840
Every time he sees us,

314
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,870
as he thinks we are a burden to them,

315
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,690
he always pulls a face

316
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,610
to us.

317
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,350
Ling Bi,

318
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,910
Ling Bi really can't understand

319
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,540
why you

320
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,580
insisted to follow Shen Yan

321
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,500
here to the wilderness

322
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,900
and receive cold stares.

323
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,250
Silly girl,

324
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,660
why are you angry?

325
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,760
Now that I am here,

326
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,130
I've already got a plan.

327
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,980
Do you know which three tricks

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,240
are always there

329
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,390
in love stories of those talented scholars and lovely ladies

330
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,070
however creative they are?

331
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,210
Ling Bi doesn't know.

332
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,410
Favorable climatic,

333
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,490
geographical condition

334
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,900
and coincidence.

335
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,780
And now,

336
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
Lord Shen and I live and go together.

337
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,570
I have held the trump card in terms of geographical condition.

338
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,300
A waterfront pavilion gets the moonlight first.

339
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,100
Now I'll carefully devise a scheme

340
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,020
to date Shen Yan.

341
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,490
The concern of the thief

342
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,240
is worse than the theft itself.

343
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,380
Dear pigeon,

344
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
tell me why we would

345
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,830
meet such a girl.

346
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,130
Lord Shen

347
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,820
is going to suffer.

has held banquets for three consecutive days

Having rich food all day,

00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,390
I'm tired of even hearing that

365

but they haven't got tired yet.

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,100
What did they talk?

367
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,080
It seems that

368
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,590
Zhang wants to get an official post

369
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,110
with the Lu Family's help.

at dinner today?

373
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,520
Crown Prince was drunk last night.

374
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
So he had a poor appetite.

375
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,650
It was Lady Xu

376

who waited upon him

377
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,390

according to an ancient recipe.

Only with that and Five-bean Soup to relieve summer-heat

380
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,360
did Crown Prince eat some.

four or five hours.

386
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,490
Lady Xu is so scrupulous.

387
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,900
Alright, you go back.

388
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,110
-Yes. -Yes.

389

Actually what?

He

404
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
actually got into a love affair.

405
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,220
A love affair?

406

Lord Shen, is that

407
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,859
true?

408
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,700
It is an anecdote anyway.

it is both real and sham.

that Lord Shen is a lady-killer

If we continue,

to create coincidence.

So,

504
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,420
I must find him.

505

Even if I would pass out,

506
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,850
I should pass out in front of Lord Shen.

507
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,890
What Lord Shen?

508
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,750
I think he's

509
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,760
a dangerous beauty.

510
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,550
See, your Highness,

But he still doesn't want to see you.

and everyone shrinks away from them.

517

Especially Shen Yan,

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,530
how does people in Jiangzhou

525
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,680
describe me?

526
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,660
Princess Changle acts superciliously,

527
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,070
loves bullying others,

528
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,260
has no idea about law and discipline rite,

529
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,500
always covets beauty

530
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,640
and commit all manners of crimes.

531
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,420
She can be called as the wickedest girl in Jiangzhou.

532
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
Then,

533
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,660
I am a jinx too.

534
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,950
No, no.

535
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,290
Your Highness, they're talking nonsense.

536
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,490
Don't think too much.

537
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,560
You should know that

538
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,750
to know a man,

539
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,640
you need to observe

540
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,870
his attitude towards the world.

541
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,100
I think

542
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,120
a frank poker face

543
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,870
is more precious than

544
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,110
those fake smiles.

545
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,460
Do you understand?

546
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,820
Forget it.

547
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,710
Lord Shen has his own charm.

548
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,100
A little girl won't know that.

549
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,020
But I

550
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,290
fell for it.

551
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,020
A snake!

552
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,330
Your... Your Highness.

553
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,290
A snake. A snake.

554
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,160
Your Highness, what should we do?

555
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,170
Shen Yan,

556
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,360
you're pressing my...

557
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,070
I fainted.

558
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,820
I must have

559
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,110
been bit by that poisonous snake.

560
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,830
I might die soon.

561
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,050
Your Highness,

562
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,810
you are bold and powerful.

563
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,110
Why do you put a grass snake in the wrong?

564
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,420
You are following me?

565
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,560
You saw it?

566
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,060
I've searched for a long while

567
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
and now have

568
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,400
used up my strength.

569
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,750
If you dare escape again,

570
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,170
I'll set up a stall in the market

571
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,710
to sell your waist token.

572
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,500
A token of a commander

573
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,140
must worth a lot.

574
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,210
Aren't you

575
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,990
afraid of breaking the law

576
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,100
and getting punished?

577
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,930
You're right.

578
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,740
Then I'll change one.

579
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,140
I'll ask my men

580
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,900
to make many copies

581
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,950
of this No.128 waist token

582
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,610
and spread them in the market.

583
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,780
At that time, Jinlin Guard is everywhere

584
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,050
while everyone can be a commander.

585
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,550
Isn't that interesting?

586
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,080
Have you finished?

587
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,580
No.

588
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,570
If you don't behave yourself,

589
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,880
I'll throw you down.

590
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,680
Lord Shen,

591
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,790
come here.

592
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,280
About my conversation with Ling Bi,

593
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,890
what did you hear?

594
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,890
Lord Shen has his own charm.

595
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,660
Although you can't understand that,

596
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,790
I fell for it.

597
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,240
You fell so easily.

598
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,920
Get some ginger decoction

599
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,950
to stave off princess's chill.

600
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,640
Yes.

601
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,450
Lord Shen.

602
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,780
Lord Shen, please stay.

603
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,800
It's cold of rain in the mountains.

604
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,530
You'd better hold an umbrella.

605
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,060
But this umbrella seems broken.

606
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,690
Now that you know it's cold of the rain,

607
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,700
you should go in and take a rest.

608
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,560
I am engaged and will leave first.

609
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,550
Take it.

610
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,930
Your Highness.

611
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,400
Your Highness.

612
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,640
I haven't cooked the ginger decoction yet.

613
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
Why are you out?

614
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
Hurry back.

615
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,510
It's raining.

616
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,860
Ling Bi,

617
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,180
let me ask you.

618
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,220
Have you noticed that

619
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,140
Lord Shen's attitude towards me

620
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,120
is shifted?

621
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,830
I think there's no difference.

622
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,900
You're inexperienced.

623
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,060
I just asked in vain.

624
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,590
Let me tell you.

625
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,410
Lord Shen

626
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,020
smiled at me.

627
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,540
Tang Bohu and Qiuxiang went steady with three smiles.

628
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,440
So I guess

629
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,140
Lord Shen's heart

630
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,420
will soon be here.

631
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,820
Alright. Alright.

632
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,420
Your Highness,

633
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,730
if you needs to play more tricks,

634
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,260
you should wait after he's back, right?

635
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,010
It's raining heavily.

636
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,120
We must go back.

637
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,860
Or you might get down

638
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,410
with illness.

639
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,280
No, I can't.

640
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,020
I have played

641
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,280
two of my three tricks.

642
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,820
And now the timely rain

643
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,370
shows me the best chance.

644
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,050
For tonight,

645
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,610
I will encounter the beauty

646
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,680
at a rainy night

647
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,860
and gain his heart with three smiles.

648
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,180
What do you mean?

649
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,760
It's rainy and windy.

650
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,670
Why not come back to Liaison Office with me

651
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,910
and have a drink?

652
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,080
In this forest,

653
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,310
why does everywhere look the same?

654
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,790
I am ignorant about

655
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,920
where Shen Yan went.

656
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,110
Encountering the beauty at a rainy night is bullshit.

657
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,830
If I hadn't been that lucky,

658
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,240
I would have died.

659
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,790
What did you say?

660
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,970
I said you were good-looking.

661
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,170
Didn't you

662
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,770
get wet enough in the rain

663
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,860
to calm yourself down?

664
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,520
Pull your hands away.

665
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,180
Shen Yan.

666
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,020
You got all wet in the rain

667
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,460
and will easily catch a cold

668
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,810
or suffer a fever.

669
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,040
So, it is for your sake.

670
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,670
You have ever studied medicine, haven't you?

671
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,920
Only a smattering. It doesn't deserve mentioning.

672
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,650
During my leisure time

673
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,960
in Jiangzhou,

674
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,250
I have learned something from teachers.

675
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,930
Anyway,

676
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,920
it is a long trip.

677
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,740
You can get to know

678
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,120
my advantages bit by bit.

679
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,040
Small as this bamboo cabin is,

680
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,710
we don't need

681
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,020
to be so close.

682
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,840
The bed is here.

683
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,760
You'd better take an early rest.

684
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,170
Behave.

685
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,920
I am a patient.

686
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,290
Since you are,

687
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,630
sleep early.

688
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,840
I will be here.

689
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,980
Lord Shen,

690
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,250
since your surname is Shen

691
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,220
and you are a Jinlin Guard,

692
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,750
are you a relative of the Shens in Yejing?

693
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,820
Yes.

694
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,820
Then do you know the Lord Shen in Yejing?

695
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,040
He's my father.

696
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,750
But I often went to

697
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,590
Shen Mansion when I was a kid.

698
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,130
Why haven't I seen you?

699
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,360
I have hated making contact

700
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,310
with strangers ever since I was a kid.

701
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,720
It's normal

702
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,410
that Your Highness doesn't remember me.

703
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,460
[Liu Ling as a kid]

704
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,370
[Shen Yan as a kid]

705
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,740
Lord Shen.

706
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,500
You're awake.

707
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,020
Let's go.

708
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,960
Lord Shen.

709
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,710
Lord Shen, please stay.

710
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,950
We've spent the beautiful night together.

711
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,100
Before going back,

712
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,900
shouldn't you

713
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
give me an answer?

714
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,080
Luo Fan,

715
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,210
why don't you go search for princess?

716
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,080
What are you doing here?

717
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,870
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

718
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,550
What?

719
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,900
What are you doing here?

720
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,550
Your...

721
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,050
We stayed over night at that cabin in the forest

722
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,400
by accident.

723
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,110
I didn't do anything improper

724
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,120
or offensive to you.

725
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,410
As you put the blame on me,

726
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,640
did misunderstand something?

727
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,880
Misunderstand?

728
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,910
Ling.

729
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,880
Lu Mingshan.

730
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,990
Ling.

731
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,400
Are you crazy?

732
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,660
How dare you

733
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,130
call me by my maiden name?

734
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,070
Ling,

735
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,560
you've been on a trip

736
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
and might haven't received the news yet.

737
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,620
My grandfather has send betrothal gifts

738
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,550
to Prince Guangping

739
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,190
and His Royal Highness has agreed.

740
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,900
Now,

741
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,350
I

742
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,390
am your

743
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,480
betrothed.

744
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,500
What betrothed?

745
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,110
Why shall I believe you?

746
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,780
Ling,

747
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,670
it's been so long since we met last time.

748
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,200
But you are still childish.

749
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,010
How can we

750
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,240
make fun of marriage?

751
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,910
This is the post for you.

752
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,130
Ling,

753
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,790
what are you doing?

754
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,820
Ling,

755
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,880
the moment I knew that you had left Jiangzhou,

756
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,250
I hurried over.

757
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,240
Look at yourself.

758
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
You look haggard.

759
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,990
Along the trip,

760
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,910
you must have suffered a lot.

761
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,880
Mr. Lu,

762
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,520
go back early

763
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,700
if you don't have anything to do.

764
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,690
I'm afraid you can hardly

765
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,950
bear the blame for spying on information of Jinlin Guard.

766
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,070
Am I right?

767
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,250
Luo Fan,

768
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,430
-You are to blame. -I was scared.

769
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,230
-How dare you laugh? -Go, go, go.

770
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,290
Go, go, go.

771
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,820
Your Highness.

772
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,320
-My lord. -My lord. -My lord.

773
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,450
Princess's betrothed is here.

774
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,260
Prepare a guest room

775
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,930
for Mr. Lu.

776
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,290
Go.

777
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,270
Yes.

778
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,200
Mr Lord,

779
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,860
it is troublesome enough

780
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,460
with Princess Changle here.

781
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,110
What's worse, Lu Mingshan came.

782
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,920
Do they really

783
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,640
think this trip an outing in spring?

784
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,910
At this special moment,

785
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,370
he came to Liaison Office.

786
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,660
I don't think it's that simple.

787
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,990
Then why did you leave him here,

788
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,560
my lord?

789
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,690
He is princess's betrothed.

790
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,870
What else can I do?

791
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,870
I'll send some men to keep watch on him.

792
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,560
No.

793
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,150
Now that Mr. Lu has been here,

794
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,930
just leave him here.

795
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,160
Your Highness,

796
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,740
please stay.

797
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,940
So bold of you.

798
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,440
As a captain,

799
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,600
how dare you stop a princess?

800
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,350
I'm sorry.

801
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,450
This is the campsite of Jinlin Guard.

802
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,880
And Lord Shen's room

803
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,750
is doubtlessly an important place for military secret.

804
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,460
The betrothed

805
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,190
of princess can hardly

806
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,380
bear the blame for

807
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,440
spying on information of Jinlin Guard.

808
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,930
I'm afraid your Highness

809
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
can't bear that either.

810
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,870
I

811
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,380
won't act up for no reason.

812
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,710
And I know Lord Shen is engaged.

813
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,030
But I wonder

814
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,450
whether he can spare a little time

815
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,780
to answer one question.

816
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,760
Now that he has ruined

817
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,270
a girl's reputation,

818
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,910
is he going to forsake me

819
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,540
by avoiding me?

820
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:05,920
What?

821
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,240
Reputation?

822
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,070
Your Highness...

823
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,690
Yes.

824
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,200
It's me.

825
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,570
Your Highness.

826
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,050
Why are you still here?

827
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:15,820
Go ask him.

828
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,760
My Lord...

829
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,030
Her Highness asked me to...

830
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,960
I've heard that.

831
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,410
Tell Her Highness that

832
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,850
her reputation has nothing

833
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,160
to do with me.

834
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,630
I don't understand

835
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,910
what she meant.

836
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,530
Princess and I

837
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,390
haven't begun yet.

838
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,590
Why would she mention "forsake"?

839
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,540
Your Highness,

840
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,140
Lord Shen said...

841
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,760
Go back.

842
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:56,920
Ask him.

843
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,100
What does he mean by "we haven't begun"?

844
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,300
You haven't begun...

845
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,080
There's no need to explain for that, is there?

846
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,750
You haven't begun.

847
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,260
In other words,

848
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,540
you're not dating.

849
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,760
Since it's a misunderstanding,

850
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,470
Ling,

851
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,300
just stop here

852
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,740
as you are a bigger person.

853
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,270
Let's go.

854
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,870
We are not dating.

855
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,940
Then I'd like to ask Lord Shen.

856
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,510
With what Lord Shen

857
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,910
and I did

858
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,180
in that cabin

859
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,180
last night,

860
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
aren't we dating?

861
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,300
What does she mean?

862
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,180
What, what did you do?

863
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,580
Go ask him.

864
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,240
No, Your Highness, you are...

865
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,760
Yes.

866
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,550
My Lord.

867
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:37,880
I...

868
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,910
Tell her.

869
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,540
I examined myself and still have a clear conscience.

870
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,430
If Her Highness insists on

871
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,160
turning the facts upside down,

872
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,500
she can

873
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,890
go ahead to Yejing

874
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,150
and appeal to the imperial court.

875
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,860
Whether I will be killed or punished,

876
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,300
I'll listen to His Majesty's order.

877
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,710
Ling.

878
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,120
Shen Yan.

879
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:58,910
Ling.

880
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,280
Are you driving me away?

881
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,930
To stay or to leave,

882
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,410
it's up to you.

883
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,710
It's time for dinner.

884
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,510
Please go back.

885
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,620
Don't affect my appetite.

886
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,060
So this is Lord Shen.

887
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,250
At this time,

888
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,020
we have just

889
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,280
had lunch.

890
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,890
With so many excuses,

891
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,630
Lord Shen is clearly

892
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,030
humiliating

893
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:23,950
Her Highness.

894
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,400
It is far from humiliating.

895
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,890
Maybe

896
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,050
perfunctory words.

897
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,460
But Lord Shen

898
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,220
was just talking in a jovial mood

899
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,660
with me.

900
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,650
Why have you been as cold as marble

901
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,410
since Mr. Lu arrived?

902
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,730
Could it be that

903
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,020
you feel jealous?
