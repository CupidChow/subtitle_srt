[My Sassy Princess]

[Episode 4]

4
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,900
Coming.

5
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,500
My lord.

6
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,920
Miss Ling Bi,

7
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,640
it's so early in the morning.

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,440
Why don't you let me sleep more?

9
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,310
Why did you rush into my room?

10
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,900
What do you want?

11
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,560
I wasn't rushing into your...

12
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,540
No. Did I

13
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,630
say it wrong?

14
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,230
Bah!

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,630
If lord Shen hasn't asked me to deliver the message,

16
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,910
who would come to you?

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,150
Deliver the message?

18
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,870
By you?

19
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Save it.

20
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,440
What's wrong with me?

21
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,530
Listen carefully.

22
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,740
Our princess was pissed off by lord Shen

23
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,470
and left the camp in the midnight.

24
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,810
Lord Shen felt sorry for this.

25
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,510
He went to look for our princess in the middle of the night.

26
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,300
Before he left, he asked me to tell you

27
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,230
to deal with all the works

28
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,600
at the Liaison Office.

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,560
Am I understood?

30
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,280
What?

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,630
It's a big deal to escort the criminals.

32
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,990
Your princess ran away.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,020
Why is my lord

34
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,290
worried so much?

35
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,380
Luo Fan.

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,200
What's going on here?

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,930
Turn around.

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,760
Stop talking nonsense

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,970
and get things done quickly.

40
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,190
If you dare to complain,

41
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,240
you will be sent to

42
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,660
the Jiangzhou Jin Lin Military Camp.

43
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,280
Well, you...

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,210
You're a girl.

45
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,730
Why are you being so crazy?

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,460
If Luo Fan dares to complain,

47
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,040
tell him my words.

48
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,870
-You! -This is said by lord Shen!

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,040
Lord Shen.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,079
Lord Shen.

51
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,079
So you do whatever

52
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,010
lord Shen asked you to do?

53
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,010
You kicked me because he told you to?

54
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,530
No, it's not that.

55
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,680
The kicking just now

56
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,160
was a reward from me.

57
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,310
You...

58
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,060
You're such a naughty girl!

59
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,940
Did Shen Yan leave the military camp

60
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,780
for Liu Ling?

61
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,740
Yes.

62
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,120
He did leave the camp.

63
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,860
Go and find them.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I need to know

65
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,720
every move they made.

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
I want to check

67
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,840
whether the romantic story

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,780
of them

69
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,829
is real

70
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,740
or not.

71
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,460
Yes.

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,420
Sugar-coated haws!

73
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,190
Come and have a look.

74
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,560
Have one if you like it.

75
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Bravo!

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,900
Miss.

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,890
Bravo!

78
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,650
Bravo!

79
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
My husband...

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,140
Beautiful sachets!

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Bravo! Bravo!

82
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,780
Bravo!

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,700
Excuse me.

84
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,350
Sir.

85
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,190
Don't...

86
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,720
Don't...

87
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,940
Sir! Sir!

88
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,770
Sugar-coated haws!

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,870
Sugar-coated haws!

90
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,450
You, don't run!

91
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,550
Let's go.

92
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,620
Are you okay?

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,010
I'm fine.

94
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,260
Thank you.

95
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,220
Have a look at the lotus root.

96
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,550
Come and try this please.

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,850
It's sweet and crispy.

98
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,990
Mom, let me eat it now.

99
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,050
Don't let the cat out of the bag, you know?

100
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,380
If your Father finds out

101
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,370
again this time,

102
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,830
I will never pick lotus root for you anymore.

103
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,290
Have a look at the lotus root.

104
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,400
Sweet and crispy.

105
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,070
Have a taste please.

106
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,950
Do you want some?

107
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,770
No need.

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,950
I'll buy it myself.

109
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,210
I'll take all of these.

110
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,690
It's hot. Have a look.

111
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,900
Take a look.

112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
Steamed buns.

113
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,700
Arrows! Arrows!

114
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,660
Ten cents per arrow.

115
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
Ten cents per arrow.

116
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,210
Come and have a look.

117
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,580
Don't miss it.

118
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,240
Wait.

119
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,750
Ten cents per arrow.

120
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,610
Ten cents.

121
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,220
Come and have a look.

122
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,500
Don't miss the chance.

123
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,060
Take a look, everyone.

124
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,300
Ten cents per arrow.

125
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,560
Take whatever you hit.

126
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,520
Let me do it.

127
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,710
This young master is really rich.

128
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,850
Yes.

129
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,280
Come on.

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
Heroes are always cultivated from childhood.

131
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,710
Come on.

132
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,750
Look at him.

133
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,330
What a pity.

134
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,180
It almost hit.

135
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,400
Little hero,

136
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,110
do you want to try again?

137
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,660
Come back with me.

138
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,380
No.

139
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,140
He is ambitious.

140
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,820
Look at him.

141
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,800
-Let me do it again. -The kid is not bad.

142
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
He's rich.

143
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,080
It's not enough.

144
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,900
Not bad.

145
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,490
Fine.

146
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,000
He is ambitious.

147
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,220
Come on. Try again.

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,290
Judging from the situation,

149
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,420
I think he can hit it.

150
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,780
You didn't make it again. But almost.

151
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,700
Little hero,

152
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,330
go back and practice.

153
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,350
Come back when you're ready.

154
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,150
You cheated.

155
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Hey, little kid.

156
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,890
Although you're very young,

157
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,790
you're good at talking nonsense.

158
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm not.

159
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,510
I practiced for a long time.

160
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,860
I can hit it every time.

161
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,470
Go away.

162
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,070
What are you talking here?

163
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,200
You must admit defeat, you know?

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
Go away.

165
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,360
What did the man do?

166
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,070
He tried to fool the kid.

167
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,480
Don't just watch.

168
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,300
Try it. Try it.

169
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,340
It's okay to lose the game.

170
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
Those earrings are useless for you.

171
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,590
Why are you so upset?

172
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,230
My mom lost her earrings

173
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,290
when she went to pick the lotus roots.

174
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,800
I saw her crying.

175
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,860
I saw those earrings.

176
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,870
They are exactly the same as my mom's.

177
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,270
So I just want to get them.

178
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
Don't be sad.

179
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,500
Let's try again.

180
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,690
Ten cents per arrow.

181
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,940
Ten cents per arrow.

182
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,070
Ten cents per arrow.

183
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,050
Sir.

184
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,440
I want to get arrows with my bracelet.

185
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,580
How generous.

186
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,350
Look at this!

187
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,750
The finest white nephire bracelet with sculptures.

188
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,540
This is so precious.

189
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,710
It worths at least this much.

190
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,660
That much?

191
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,070
Let's make a deal first.

192
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,940
Although the jade is delicate,

193
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,800
you can only get one arrow with it.

194
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,390
Everyone here,

195
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,780
please be my witness.

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,830
No. No. No.

197
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,550
Please don't do this!

198
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,170
This girl is amazing.

199
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,210
She's amazing.

200
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,600
No, she didn't hit the target.

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
It doesn't count.

202
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,790
No way.

203
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,770
If I fail this time again,

204
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,780
I'll destroy your booth.

205
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,520
How dare you!

206
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,560
Let's see.

207
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,450
Miss, don't be angry.

208
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,500
Since you like the earrings,

209
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll give you the top prize for free.

210
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,350
Come over.

211
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,300
Take them off.

212
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,020
He said he wanted to give them to you.

213
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,940
Do you want them?

214
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,140
I believe you can win.

215
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,670
Who cares about his gift?

216
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Then we must win the earrings by ourselves.

217
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,320
This...

218
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,760
Miss,

219
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,220
even if you are rich and powerful,

220
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,380
you can't bully me like this.

221
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,640
I'll give you another chance.

222
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,770
Remove the gimmick.

223
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,410
Gimmick?

224
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,030
What's that?

225
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,100
Your aim

226
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,940
only depends on your own ability.

227
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,500
How could you

228
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,100
wrong a good person?

229
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,740
This girl is so generous.

230
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,580
Why does she

231
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,670
do this to a civilian?

232
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,510
That's right.

233
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,180
You are a rich lady.

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,010
Are you feeling bored

235
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,740
at home?

236
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,870
You purposely came here

237
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,020
to ruin other's business

238
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,250
-for fun, didn't you? -We all saw it, didn't we?

239
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,850
Yes.

240
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,410
Look, everyone.

241
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,690
She's bullying me.

242
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,300
Please help me.

243
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,460
I have a big family to support.

244
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,010
They've gone too far!

245
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,420
Is it great to be rich?

246
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,930
How can you bully

247
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,210
the civilians like me?

248
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,980
Is it easy for me?

249
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,850
It's not easy to earn money with my small business.

250
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,040
We are all civilians.

251
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,320
Please help me.

252
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
They can't bully others like that.

253
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,050
She even has a helper.

254
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,730
Am I right?

255
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,050
Fine, fine. How unlucky I am today.

256
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,050
Shoot if you want.

257
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,700
Your archery skill

258
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,370
hasn't improved at all.

259
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,520
Leave me alone. Go away.

260
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,220
Don't move.

261
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,030
Keep your hands flat.

262
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,670
Follow my instruction.

263
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,610
Shoot when I'm done counting.

264
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,300
One.

265
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,500
Two.

266
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,350
Three.

267
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,520
They got it!

268
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,210
They make it this time!

269
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,580
Amazing. What is that?

270
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,910
What fell on the ground?

271
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,780
Kid,

272
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
take back what you won.

273
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,240
Okay.

274
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,030
[Feng Xiang]

275
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,460
Are you still running away, Your Highness?

276
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,230
It's hard to meet, and it's hard to part too.

277
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm not leaving.

278
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,920
Lord Shen,

279
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,990
do you think

280
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,380
us meeting on the broken bridge

281
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,840
is like what they sing in the opera?

282
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,830
So princess，

283
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,030
you compared yourself to Bai Suzhen,

284
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,680
but compared me to Xu Xian?

285
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,090
Isn't that good?

286
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Fine.

287
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,210
Bai Suzhen caused troubles to the mortal world.

288
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,270
In the end, she was caught by Fa Hai,

289
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,400
and trapped under the Leifeng Pagoda.

290
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,610
If it could really be as you said

291
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,820
that we could have similar stories as theirs,

292
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,710
I would have an expectation then.

293
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,140
An expectation?

294
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,820
Last night,

295
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,720
you threatened me and

296
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,040
said that you were not someone

297
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,150
I could mess with.

298
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,870
But today, you came to find me.

299
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,580
You're playing hard to get, you know.

300
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,930
What's your expectation

301
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,920
indeed?

302
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,990
I expect you to come back.

303
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,550
Alright, let's go back.

304
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,560
What if I don't want to go back?

305
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
It's not safe here recently.

306
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,100
For your own safety,

307
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,300
don't blame me for making the decision for you.

308
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,950
Shen Yan,

309
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,040
let go of me!

310
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,780
Shen Yan!

311
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,810
Shen Yan!

312
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,550
How could you do this?

313
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,270
How can you be

314
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,790
a villain who abandoned his wife and son?

315
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,120
Abandoned wife and son?

316
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,740
When did I have a family?

317
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,730
Although we're not married yet,

318
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,260
we are engaged.

319
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,400
How could you do this to me?

320
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,530
Have you ever considered my feelings?

321
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,170
Stop it. Let's go.

322
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,650
What are you doing?

323
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,430
Let's go!

324
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,580
Young man.

325
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,830
Young man.

326
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,360
It's normal for a man

327
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,660
to have multiple wives.

328
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,390
But now

329
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,070
you bully a girl on the street.

330
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,420
-As we've seen it... -How can you bully a girl?

331
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,620
we can't ignore it.

332
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
Am I right?

333
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,620
That's right.

334
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,830
Miss, is this yours?

335
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,650
Thank you.

336
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,530
Look at him.

337
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,580
He looks decent and handsome.

338
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,410
He must be a scholar.

339
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,970
How could he do such a thing?

340
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,160
You even abandoned your wife and son?

341
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,790
What did the books

342
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,860
teach you?

343
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,600
Sir,

344
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,700
look at you.

345
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,320
You can't do this anymore!

346
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,960
Jin,

347
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,730
all moves you made

348
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,490
in this game

349
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,920
are methodical.

350
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,540
Unfortunately,

351
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,920
it's hard to defeat me this time.

352
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,320
You made the same mistake

353
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,420
in the issues related to Family Lu.

354
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,730
My patience

355
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,150
is almost worn out by you.

356
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,740
Allow me to explain, Your Highness.

357
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,940
I think

358
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,660
the power between families

359
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,130
are in the same situation

360
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,370
the chess board shows.

361
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,030
The Family Lu is full of power,

362
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,300
and dominates others.

363
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,130
Your Highness, if you want to bring down the Family Lu,

364
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,090
even if we gather the power of Family Xu and Shen,

365
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,310
it's still hard to say we will win.

366
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,100
When the enemy is strong and we are weak,

367
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,830
it's better

368
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,570
to wait.

369
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,050
We'd better see what the opponents want to do,

370
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,980
and what they need.

371
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,790
Isn't a good plan?

372
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,510
Since

373
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,270
you have seen so much,

374
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,130
what exactly

375
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,750
did you see clearly?

376
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:19,869
[Gao Peng Inn]

377
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,480
Sir.

378
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,250
Miss.

379
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,430
No one else

380
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,589
can come in tonight.

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,750
Got it?

382
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,020
Thank you. Don't worry.

383
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,450
I'll lock the door now.

384
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,700
I guarantee that

385
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,070
even a fly can't come in.

386
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,640
Miss, please come with me.

387
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,150
This way, please.

388
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,110
Miss，

389
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,320
this is the best room

390
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
at our inn.

391
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,890
Miss, please come in.

392
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,520
Please have a look.

393
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,780
Help yourself, Miss.

394
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,310
I'll make arrangements now.

395
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,790
Okay.

396
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,060
Jin.

397
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,800
Are you confident

398
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,950
to win this game?

399
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,310
I dare not.

400
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm just waiting for the chance.

401
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,040
Let me ask you.

402
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,180
Do you know Shen Yu,

403
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,390
the administrator of Nandian?

404
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,630
He was an old friend when I was young.

405
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,140
After I entered the palace,

406
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,670
we gradually lost contact.

407
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,660
Why do you ask about him, Your Highness?

408
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,500
Today,

409
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,940
he told me

410
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,040
a romantic story.

411
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,220
He said that when Shen Yan escorted the criminals,

412
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,820
there was another noble lady

413
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,860
to help.

414
00:18:59,290 --> 00:18:59,980
Noble Lady?

415
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,990
Who?

416
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,420
Princess Changle,

417
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,290
Liu Ling.

418
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,690
It's strange.

419
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,700
I don't understand

420
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,620
why she would like Shen Yan?

421
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,160
She's been chasing after him all the way,

422
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,170
and made the stern-faced Yama, Shen Yan

423
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,620
lose his sense and sanity.

424
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,940
He was in a dilemma!

425
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,350
You're so smart, Jin.

426
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,430
Why did you

427
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,460
fall into my trap?

428
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,550
You're wise, Your Highness.

429
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,410
I was careless.

430
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,740
I've long heard

431
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,760
that you have known the princess since childhood,

432
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,970
and that you are very close.

433
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,900
Now it seems

434
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,250
it's true.

435
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,450
When Ling was in the capital,

436
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,010
she always helped me.

437
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,200
She and I

438
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,290
were indeed

439
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,570
close friends by then.

440
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,350
Shen Yan is in a very dangerous situation

441
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,160
when he escorts the criminals.

442
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,420
Liu Ling is favored by Father.

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,520
If you want,

444
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,100
I...

445
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,790
can order

446
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,710
to bring Liu Ling back

447
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,000
from that dangerous place.

448
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,560
No,

449
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,220
Your Highness.

450
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,050
If we send someone

451
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,640
to bring her back in advance,

452
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,210
I'm afraid we'll alert others

453
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,010
and delay the national affairs.

454
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,140
You convinced me.

455
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,090
The crime in Jiangzhou is a national affair.

456
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,810
It's the most essential thing.

457
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,840
After we kill those

458
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,710
disobedient dogs in Family Lu,

459
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,840
there will be wild wolves behind them.

460
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,080
It's unwise to risk big things for the sake of small ones.

461
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,170
As for Liu Ling,

462
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,180
we don't need to worry about her.

463
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,530
With Shen Yan's protection,

464
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,190
I think nothing will go wrong.

465
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,060
Looks like I have to

466
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,940
let my cousin suffer a little this time.

467
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,670
Jin,

468
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,670
your carelessness made

469
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,990
you lose completely.

470
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,690
You were in such a good situation.

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,760
You should have won.

472
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,430
What a pity.

473
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,660
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

474
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,460
You are good at go, Your Highness.

475
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,310
You're supposed

476
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,310
to win the game.

477
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,830
It's late.

478
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,610
Rest early, Your Highness.

479
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,830
I'll take my leave.

480
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,980
You're just a pawn.

481
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,170
Being obedient

482
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,100
is your obligation.

483
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,710
Dogs and wolves are supposed to be obedient.

484
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,900
So is the cub, Shen Yan.

485
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,450
Shen Yan,

486
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,880
sharpen your claws

487
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,930
and help me defeat those dogs and wolves.

488
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,320
Lord Shen, you look righteous,

489
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,350
but why are you being so sneaky lately?

490
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,550
It seems like you're

491
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,800
getting better at doing these things.

492
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,640
I was rude last night.

493
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,910
Please forgive me.

494
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,460
You've been shopping

495
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,670
for a whole day.

496
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,840
You should feel better now.

497
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,250
It's getting late.

498
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,370
We should go back.

499
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,390
No way.

500
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,550
I've spent money on the inn.

501
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,820
And I'm sleepy now.

502
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,420
I'll stay here today.

503
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,140
If you don't mind,

504
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,630
you can stay here too.

505
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,620
Changing places occasionally

506
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,140
is quite romantic.

507
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:46,780
No need.

508
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,060
I don't like

509
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,210
unfamiliar places.

510
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,650
Please go back with me.

511
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,010
Not at all.

512
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,530
You're the one who is tired.

513
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,870
You've been shopping with me all day long.

514
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,130
You must be exhausted.

515
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,660
Alright.

516
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,830
Liu Ling,

517
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
come back with me.

518
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,600
Let's go.

519
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,430
Let's eat now.

520
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,300
We'll leave in two hours.

521
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,350
Eat more please.

522
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,730
After this meal,

523
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,430
there might be no next meal.

524
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,800
[Gao Peng Inn]

525
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,280
You got up so early, lord Shen.

526
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,920
It Looks like the tea yesterday

527
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,790
was too bland.

528
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,740
Since you are up,

529
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,090
let's go.

530
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,170
Lord Shen,

531
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,100
an hour in the morning is worth two in the evening.

532
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,900
Lord Shen,

533
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,800
why are you still so upset

534
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,130
even you are in such a pleasant place?

535
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,410
You think I'm affecting your good mood?

536
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,780
No.

537
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,700
It's just that

538
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,980
there is hot air everywhere.

539
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,790
I'm afraid you'll get heated up and melted.

540
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,560
Let's go.

541
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,420
Follow me.

542
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,970
Stop!

543
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,510
I'll kill you!

544
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,150
Stop!

545
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,900
You bastard!

546
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,160
How dare you to run!

547
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,640
I...

548
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,960
That was close!

549
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,090
That's right.

550
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,020
Miss,

551
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,040
nice catch.

552
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,310
Give it back to me.

553
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,050
Why?

554
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,870
It will be dead if I give it to you.

555
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,120
If you don't give it to me, you're dead.

556
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,760
Got it?

557
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,980
Ouch. It hurts.

558
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,390
Who are you?

559
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,970
Are you trying to steal my pig?

560
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,730
Listen,

561
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,660
I won't fight with you.

562
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,260
If you want my pig,

563
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,990
I'll sue you.

564
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,560
Enough.

565
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,020
I'll buy

566
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,790
this pig.

567
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,840
Let's go.

568
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,430
After you, please.

569
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,750
Lord Shen,

570
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,780
why did you buy me a pig back then?

571
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,530
To remind you.

572
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,160
A reminder?

573
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,030
It's just a piglet.

574
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,600
What's there to remind?

575
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,420
When a pig was bullied,

576
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,360
it knows to squeal and ran away.

577
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,150
I gave this pig to you,

578
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,980
hoping that you

579
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,100
can learn from it.

580
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,160
Don't be a paper tiger.

581
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,340
Shen Yan,

582
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,360
what are you trying to say?

583
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,510
I mean

584
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,920
you don't have to be tough all the time.

585
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,980
If someone bullies you in the future,

586
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,920
you can tell me.

587
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,540
Tell you?

588
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,670
If I tell you,

589
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,020
will you protect me?

590
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,270
No, I won't.

591
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,930
But I'll consider whether to save you.

592
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,540
Let's go.

593
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,450
Sir.

594
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,220
What would you like to eat?

595
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,030
My stall is not big,

596
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,770
but it's full of tasty food.

597
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,150
Pick whatever you want.

598
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,130
Order anything you like.

599
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,210
Five pots of Baozi.

600
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,560
Ten sesame pancakes.

601
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,220
Three bowls of fried rice.

602
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,350
Two bowls of Douhua.

603
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,890
Miss,

604
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,890
are you really going to eat that much?

605
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,530
Yes.

606
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,680
Here you are.

607
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,280
Tell me if it's not enough.

608
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,100
Okay.

609
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,690
Why are you staring at me?

610
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,550
Even if you don't want to eat,

611
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,910
the piggy does.

612
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,130
Lord Shen,

613
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,510
why don't we

614
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,750
name this piggy?

615
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,300
Name it as your wish.

616
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,290
It keeps making the sound.

617
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,960
Why don't we call it Oink?

618
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
Since it already has the name now,

619
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,680
its surname should be...

620
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,240
Shen!

621
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,400
Look.

622
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,880
You saved its life.

623
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,150
It must be indebted to you.

624
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,620
Then you are closer than its biological parents.

625
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,370
So,

626
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,040
your surname should be Shen.

627
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,140
Right?

628
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,320
Look, it says yes.

629
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,590
Good boy.

630
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Shen Oink.

631
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,540
You have a name now.

632
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,890
Five pots of Baozi.

633
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,410
Rice. Here you are.

634
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,820
Lord Shen.

635
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,820
Lord Shen?

636
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,150
Lord Shen!

637
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,470
Your father doesn't want to eat,

638
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,670
so you can have it now.

639
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,440
Shen Oink.

640
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,850
Lord Shen!

641
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,500
Lord Shen!

642
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,580
Have you seen our princess?

643
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,140
Where is she?

644
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,000
She's outside.

645
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,740
Okay.

646
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,860
You came alone in broad daylight.

647
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,460
Who sent you here?

648
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:04,520
[Xu]

649
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,420
More than twenty people came.

650
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,610
The leader was

651
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:11,810
Hu Xiao!

652
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,290
Hu Xiao?

653
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,630
Isn't he

654
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,980
the top wanted person in the black market?

655
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,100
Is the information solid?

656
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,489
My lord,

657
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,909
how likely it is for us

658
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,190
to win Hu Xiao?

659
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,429
Hu Xiao.

660
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,130
In terms of martial arts,

661
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,650
he is the master.

662
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,310
But this man is evil,

663
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,920
fierce and domineering.

664
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,300
He has many enemies.

665
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,480
He's been at the top of the Interpol Red Notice

666
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,050
in the black market for ten years.

667
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,960
Even your former commander

668
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,020
was also killed by him.

669
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,120
What makes you think

670
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,719
you can win?

671
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,150
My lord,

672
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,030
there is only scrap metal

673
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,710
in the Liaison Office.

674
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,130
We can't expect the arrows to be accurate.

675
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,100
We would be lucky

676
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,100
if they doesn't hit our feet,

677
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,780
when we

678
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,860
fire them out.

679
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,310
What should we do then?

680
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,660
We've done everything we could.

681
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,460
The only thing

682
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,480
we can do now is to wait.

683
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,360
Let's see what else we can use.

684
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,580
Lord Shen.

685
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,590
What happened to them?

686
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,850
Did something happen?

687
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,530
Nothing.

688
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,050
Don't worry.

689
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,300
Come out!

690
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,500
It's me.

691
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,560
Greetings, Young Master.

692
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,580
Good.

693
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,360
You're indeed the elite

694
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,860
cultivated by Family Lu for years.

695
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
You are punctual.

696
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,040
Under the order of Lord Lu,

697
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,020
we must kill Yun Yi

698
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,700
before he enters the capital.

699
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,880
Little lord Shen, let's give it a try.

700
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,960
-Is it like this? -Let me do it.

701
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,480
You can't make it like that.

702
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,680
Your fingers are all thumbs. Let me cut.

703
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,970
Be careful.

704
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,490
This looks good.

705
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,720
So does this one.

706
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,860
Let me help you.

707
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,880
-Make sure to sew neatly. -This color doesn't fit it.

708
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,400
Okay.

709
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,240
How about this one?

710
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,840
Almost. Let's try this on it.

711
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,710
Okay, that's it.

712
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
It's pretty good.

713
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,130
Let's use this one.

714
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,050
Yes, this one.

715
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,030
This one？

716
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,530
I like the color of it.

717
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,770
Fine.

718
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,180
And cut it here.

719
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

720
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,860
What do you mean?

721
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,310
It was a good idea

722
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,490
to boost everyone's morale.

723
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,620
I'm not that good.

724
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,290
As the owner of the piggy. I just worried about it.

725
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,580
I was afraid that

726
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,120
our little Shen...Yan

727
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,200
will get cold.

728
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,720
It really looks like a lord.

729
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,390
This little cute piggy.

730
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,200
Let me do it.

731
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,540
Come here.

732
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,620
You know what?

733
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,330
Once we tied the belt for it,

734
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,220
it looks

735
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,330
just like lord Shen.

736
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,940
Where are you going，little lord Shen?

737
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,980
Let's follow it.

738
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,900
Let's go.

739
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,630
Little lord?

740
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,290
Tonight...

741
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,590
You can manage it,

742
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,540
can't you?

743
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,790
I don't know.

744
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,740
But I hope you can

745
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,650
promise me one thing.

746
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,020
Go ahead.

747
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,460
Please go back to your room with Ling Bi,

748
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,310
with all the doors and windows locked.

749
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,440
Without my order,

750
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,150
don't come out.

751
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,380
No matter what happens outside.

752
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,820
Okay.
