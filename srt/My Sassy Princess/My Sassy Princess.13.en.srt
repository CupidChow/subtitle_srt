173
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,420
Ling Bi.

174
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,980
Your Highness.

175
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,410
There are so many lanterns.

176
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,610
How can we know

177
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,140
which one was released by Lord Shen?

178
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,100
I just know it.

179
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,600
Well...

180
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,260
[Wish you good]

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,260
[I dare not wish you to get everything you want.]

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,260
[I just hope you won't lose what you have now and live a carefree life.]

183
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,890
♫ I’ll share your wishes in the coming years ♫

184
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,950
Wish you good.

185
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,170
I dare not wish you

186
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,230
♫ All the love poems fail to portray my love for you ♫

187
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,580
to get everything you want.

188
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,540
I just hope you won't lose

189
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,000
♫ I promise to take your hand and grow old with you ♫

190
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,540
what you have now

191
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,530
and live a carefree life.

192
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:44,730
♫ Don't ask about the way home. I just want to be by your side for life ♫

193
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,490
♫ I will give you a lifelong promise, just as you wish ♫

194
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,520
♫ Your every wish will come true. It's worth the wait ♫

195
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,060
♫ I only want to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

196
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,770
♫ And indulge in the world holding your hand ♫

197
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,230
Your Highness.

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,980
On this paper,

199
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,480
there are just a few words.

200
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,800
You've read it for days.

201
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,060
Aren't you tired of it?

202
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,260
Hiding someone

203
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,780
in the heart.

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,220
And one will hope the one

205
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,940
to be happy

206
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,190
and everything goes smoothly.

207
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,900
These three words

208
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,260
can withstand

209
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,210
all sweet words in the world.

210
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,980
How could I get tired of it?

211
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,380
Yang Ye is back.

212
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,310
Princess, here.

213
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll get the door.

214
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,510
Your Highness.

215
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,630
I have found out

216
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,930
the trace of Mrs. Shen.

217
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,060
Today is the first day of the month.

218
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,380
Mrs. Shen went to Guanyin Temple this morning.

219
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,300
At noon,

220
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,970
she will go to Shuxiang Hall

221
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,770
to have vegetarian food.

222
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,180
Shuxiang Hall.

223
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,120
Have vegetarian food.

224
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,190
Got it. Prepare the carriage.

225
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,350
Your Highness.

226
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,020
Your Highness.

227
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,510
Your Highness.

228
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,660
You have known where Mrs. Shen is.

229
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,340
Are you going to visit her?

230
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,940
But you know

231
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,500
Mrs. Shen doesn't like you.

232
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,190
You still want to provoke her?

233
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,430
Why bother?

234
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,120
I know she doesn't like me.

235
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,910
But I've made up my mind.

236
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,230
Lord Shen is not in the capital.

237
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,780
I can't leave all the difficulties

238
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,620
to him.

239
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,380
I'm going to do it myself.

240
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,020
I'll show my affection and reasoning.

241
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,260
Besides,

242
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,920
I have a way to take down Lord Shen,

243
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,120
and then I can take his mother down, too.

244
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,990
This one looks better, right?

245
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,320
This is more elegant.

246
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,030
It's light.

247
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,020
I think Mrs. Shen

248
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,050
will like it.

249
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,730
Then wear this.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,970
Your Highness.

251
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,550
I still don't understand.

252
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,180
Since Mrs. Shen

253
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,370
doesn't want to see you,

254
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,990
why do you

255
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,060
bother her

256
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,540
and make yourself unhappy?

257
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,800
Lord Shen went north

258
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,650
hoping to take the contribution to

259
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,220
exchange for the decree of the marriage.

260
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,460
He's so sincere.

261
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,660
How can I

262
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
do nothing?

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,300
Mrs. Shen,

264
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
I was in a mood today

265
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,020
to use some vegetarian food.

266
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,020
I didn't expect

267
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,540
to meet you here.

268
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,830
What a coincidence.

269
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,300
Your makeup and dress

270
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,780
are perfectly matched.

271
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,660
You must have put a lot of efforts.

272
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,260
How can this

273
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,960
be explained

274
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,090
by coincidence?

275
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,340
Mrs. Shen has a unique taste.

276
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,740
I heard that

277
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,490
Shuxiang Hall is always quiet.

278
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,400
It's inevitable for Mrs. Shen to be lonely

279
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,390
to eat here.

280
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,060
So I came here to accompany you.

281
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,420
May I sit with you?

282
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
Please forgive me.

283
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,630
I've always liked quietness and been shy.

284
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,240
I don't want to sit and eat

285
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,290
with outsiders.

286
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,560
Waiter, serve the dishes.

287
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,200
OK.

288
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,180
Waiter.

289
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,120
Did you serve the wrong dishes today?

290
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,100
No.

291
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,860
Madam,

292
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,140
this red peach blossom and green willow

293
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,350
was given to you

294
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,580
by the neighbor desk.

295
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,580
Enjoy.

296
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,980
I heard that there is

297
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,480
a new chef here.

298
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,820
He's a good cook.

299
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,430
This dish is

300
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,810
his specialty.

301
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,860
So I decided on my own

302
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,680
to invite you

303
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,840
to have a taste.

304
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,660
No need.

305
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,220
A flashy thing

306
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,740
only has appearance.

307
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,280
I never like such things.

308
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,560
Whether it just has looks or not,

309
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,260
how do you know if you don't taste it carefully?

310
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,780
What if it does taste good

311
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,680
after you taste it?

312
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,540
One dish,

313
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,640
even if it doesn't taste good or pleasant to heart,

314
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,120
I can still tolerate it.

315
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,380
But people

316
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,190
are different.

317
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,290
Your Highness.

318
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,020
since we have reached

319
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,300
to this point today,

320
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,940
I can make it more clear.

321
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,540
You don't have to

322
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,900
make more efforts on me.

323
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,020
Don't even think about

324
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,390
my son,

325
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,690
in case it will ruin your life.

326
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,860
What do you mean, Mrs. Shen?

327
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,270
For the wife of Family Shen,

328
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,910
Yan's wife.

329
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,310
I have already had

330
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,270
someone I like.

331
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,210
Who is it?

332
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,339
Princess Wuyou，

333
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,180
Qin Ning.

334
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,260
Please enjoy.

335
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,920
I’m leaving.

336
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,920
Your Highness.

337
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,240
Who is Qin Ning?

338
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,800
I think someone might know

339
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,660
who Qin Ning is.

340
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,900
We can find Luo Fan.

341
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,370
Luo Fan is with Lord Shen.

342
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,630
[Administrator of Beidian]

343
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,340
Yang Ye.

344
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,680
Your Highness.

345
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,660
Luo Fan.

346
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,620
I’ve been waiting for you.

347
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,540
Isn't this...

348
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,520
Although my lord is not here,

349
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,060
I dare not

350
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,140
neglect work.

351
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,700
Don't grin cheekily

352
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,460
here.

353
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,420
Let me ask you.

354
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,580
Do you know

355
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,720
Princess Wuyou, Qin Ning?

356
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,430
You know everything?

357
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,860
Tell me.

358
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,580
The paper can't cover the fire.

359
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,270
No.

360
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,240
You can't blame me, Your Highness.

361
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,810
I told my lord long ago that

362
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,410
he should tell you about this.

363
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,740
But my lord keeps saying

364
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,540
no need.

365
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,660
It's fine.

366
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,340
I think

367
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,300
after all the engagement

368
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,790
was settled by Princess Wuyou herself

369
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,470
because Mrs. Shen

370
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
likes her.

371
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,490
-Engagement？ -Say it.

372
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,070
Say it again.

373
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,960
Shen Yan is engaged to her?

374
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,910
You didn't know?

375
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,530
My mouth....

376
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,300
I should get hit.

377
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,020
Luo Fan,

378
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,900
don’t talk nonsense in front of the princess.

379
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,580
I'm not. I'm not.

380
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,980
You can't tell nonsense.

381
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,780
No.

382
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,190
Princess.

383
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,780
Don't cry.

384
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,100
This was

385
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,250
a few years ago.

386
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,450
The engagement has long been canceled.

387
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,380
Canceled?

388
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,550
Mrs. Shen likes her so much.

389
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,100
How could she

390
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
give up so easily?

391
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,620
You don’t know.

392
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,260
Princess Wuyou

393
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,420
is always unpredictable.

394
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,270
She's even more... than you...

395
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,940
No.

396
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,300
It's just strange.

397
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,750
This engagement

398
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,600
was arranged by her.

399
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,650
But unexpectedly a few months later,

400
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,850
Duke Zhennan's Mansion

401
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,850
sent someone here

402
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,660
saying

403
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,680
Princess Wuyou went out for a trip

404
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,230
and they couldn’t find her.

405
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,740
So the wedding has to be canceled.

406
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,820
Isn't it strange?

407
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,740
If she really takes

408
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,110
Shen Yan on her heart,

409
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,810
even if she went out,

410
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,010
she wouldn't break off the engagement.

411
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,180
Princess, you...

412
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:13,850
I think

413
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,060
it's because the falling flowers are intentional,

414
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,180
but the water is ruthless.

415
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,310
Princess Wuyou

416
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,420
knew that Lord Shen

417
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,600
had no interest in her.

418
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,310
So she wanted to find an out

419
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,390
to step down.

420
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:22,930
Yes.

421
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,350
Miss Ling Bi is smart.

422
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,150
You have a point.

423
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,050
I've been with Lord Shen

424
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,560
for so many years.

425
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,500
From the engagement to cancelling the engagement,

426
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,260
Lord Shen

427
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,980
didn't take it seriously.

428
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,300
But

429
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,220
Princess Wuyou did go out

430
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,260
for a trip.

431
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,350
Someone said

432
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,460
she went to the mountain to learn martial arts.

433
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,300
Some even said

434
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,620
she went out to travel around the world

435
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,660
and help others.

436
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,180
But I heard

437
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,980
Princess Wuyou

438
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,600
fell in love with a swordsman

439
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,140
and left a letter

440
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,650
and eloped.

441
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,020
Eloped?

442
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,200
Duke Zhennan’s family

443
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,140
couldn't find her,

444
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,620
and they were afraid of offending Family Shen,

445
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,660
so they could only cancel the engagement.

446
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,810
Since she didn’t care about

447
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,810
Shen Yan,

448
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,110
why did Mrs. Shen still care about her?

449
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,930
Your Highness.

450
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,250
you don’t know.

451
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,540
Princess Wuyou’s mother

452
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,530
and Mrs. Shen

453
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,330
are like sisters.

454
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
She is in poor health.

455
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,860
Duke Zhennan

456
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,590
leads troops outside for war all the time.

457
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,830
Princess Wuyou

458
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,210
grew up being taken care of

459
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,290
Mrs. Shen.

460
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,100
It's understandable that

461
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,630
they have a good relation?

462
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,460
I think

463
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,540
since Princess Wuyou

464
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
has no intention

465
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,700
on Lord Shen,

466
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,530
no matter how much Lord Shen cares about her,

467
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,860
there's nothing he can do.

468
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,120
Don’t take it to heart.

469
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,220
You cannot

470
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,500
say that.

471
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,700
Your Highness.

472
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
I got the news.

473
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,300
Princess Wuyou

474
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,540
has returned to the capital

475
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,260
in the past few days.

476
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Really?

477
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,780
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

478
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,940
Did you help Lord Shen to hide it

479
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,500
from me?

480
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,650
No.

481
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,740
She's just in time.

482
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,620
I want to see what she looks like.

483
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,750
Let's go.

484
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,320
Your Highness.

485
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,320
Everyone please

486
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
have some tea.

487
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,990
Your Highness.

488
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,100
we've searched everywhere in the government

489
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,630
and even the black market and gambling house.

490
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,820
We've been to every place

491
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,740
where there is information.

492
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,380
But there is no trace of

493
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,660
Princess Wuyou.

494
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,540
If we keep finding like

495
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,860
looking for a needle in a haystack,

496
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,260
when will it end?

497
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,210
You're right.

498
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,070
It's not good to have no direction.

499
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,420
There must be a way.

500
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,530
Direction?

501
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,560
How should we find the direction?

502
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,300
Help look for people and stuff.

503
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,320
Let's go.

504
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,030
Help look for someone and stuff and tell the fortune.

505
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,940
Sir.

506
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,690
I'm looking for someone.

507
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,590
Sure.

508
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,430
Miss,

509
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,670
just write a word in you mind

510
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,340
on the paper.

511
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,210
Red.

512
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,300
It's not good.

513
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,780
Too bad.

514
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,540
Not good?

515
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,900
How?

516
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,450
Take a look.

517
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,490
The red word is silk on the left,

518
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,600
[Red]

519
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,050
and the right is work.

520
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,540
Work is the bottom of emptiness.

521
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,320
All the love

522
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,620
will be in vain.

523
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,620
The person you're looking for

524
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,940
is in danger.

525
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,100
He is in danger.

526
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,220
Don't listen to him.

527
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,130
How can you believe

528
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,390
what a fortune teller says?

529
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,360
Girl,

530
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,550
watch your mouth.

531
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,580
Are you serious?

532
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,780
Of course.

533
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,980
If a man's life and death

534
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,520
can be determined by just one word,

535
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,720
what do we need the doctors or the government offices for?

536
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,180
What you said

537
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
makes sense.

538
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,820
Since you love

539
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,900
this man that much,

540
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,800
you have to believe

541
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,150
that he will be somewhere,

542
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,740
waiting to be reunited with you.

543
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,090
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

544
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,200
you can't give up.

545
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,420
Remember.

546
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,300
Man's will, not Heaven, decides.

547
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,180
Thank you for your advice.

548
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,590
I'm also looking for someone today.

549
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,860
I've been looking for him all day,

550
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,100
but there's no news.

551
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,940
But you said

552
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,380
man's will, not Heaven, decides.

553
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,060
I trust you.

554
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,100
What does your lover

555
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,430
look like?

556
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,580
He...

557
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,660
...is handsome

558
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,340
and extraordinary.

559
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,010
He is young,

560
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,320
but his sword skills

561
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,740
are very good.

562
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,580
In this world,

563
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,430
he's one of the best swordsmen.

564
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,860
Guard Yang?

565
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,080
Your Highness.

566
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,720
The one she said

567
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,450
is quite similar to Guard Yang.

568
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,260
Unfortunately, we've been apart for three years.

569
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,980
I've been to many places

570
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,820
but I couldn't find him.

571
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
I don't know

572
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,770
where he is now

573
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,120
and how he is.

574
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,110
It's okay.

575
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,310
After the lunch,

576
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,980
I'll take you to the the administration of Beidian.

577
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,820
Tell me

578
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,620
the characteristics of your lover's appearance

579
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,780
and his background.

580
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,300
I'll ask someone to keep an eye on it for you.

581
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,360
There will be news.

582
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,140
We martial artists

583
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,340
always repay kindness and

584
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,660
take revenge for grudges.

585
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,700
You're so helpful today.

586
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,460
If you need me

587
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,620
in the future,

588
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,300
I'll definitely do all my best

589
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
to help you.

590
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,940
Okay.

591
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,400
Who are you looking for?

592
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,980
If he's a martial artist,

593
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,100
I might know him.

594
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,190
That's possible.

595
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,550
I'm not looking for a martial artist.

596
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,830
She is a princess.

597
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,210
Princess Wuyou, Qin Ning.

598
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,250
Why are you laughing?

599
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,110
I'm laughing at you.

600
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,460
The person you're looking for

601
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,980
is actually

602
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,390
right in front of you.

603
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,250
Are you Qin Ning?

604
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,140
We never change our names.

605
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,540
Martial artists are all like this.

606
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,130
I wonder why you're

607
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,450
looking for me.

608
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,800
Let's go.

609
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,620
They are all fresh.

610
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,850
Take a look.

611
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,690
Shen Yan that nerd

612
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,720
actually has a girl he likes.

613
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,300
Interesting.

614
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,310
Mrs. Shen.

615
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,710
I didn't

616
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,070
recognize you just now.

617
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,730
Forgive me.

618
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,190
Princess Wuyou, don't call her that.

619
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,720
She's not married yet.

620
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,700
Whether I'm married or not,

621
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,740
I'm his wife.

622
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,400
Cheers.

623
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,740
Liu Ling,

624
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,420
you are really good.

625
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,340
You are totally different

626
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,420
from those pretentious ladies

627
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,460
in the capital.

628
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,300
I like you.

629
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,980
I've just said

630
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,540
if you need me

631
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,860
in the future,

632
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,210
I will do all my best

633
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,050
to help you.

634
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,230
Today,

635
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,140
as Shen's mother

636
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,510
recognizes me as her daughter-in-law,

637
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,570
you're in a pickle.

638
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,020
I will help you.

639
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,220
But before I help you,

640
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,600
you have to prove to me that

641
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,350
Changming does love you.

642
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,060
Changming?

643
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,600
This is his secondary personal name.

644
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,180
You don't even know this?

645
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,200
And you said he wanted to marry you.

646
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,750
I...

647
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,580
I have this.

648
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,680
Lord Shen gave it to me.

649
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,210
As long as I'm willing,

650
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,800
I can stay at his mansion

651
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,490
to relieve our lovesickness.

652
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
What do you think?

653
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,470
Since you have the token as the proof,

654
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,180
I will keep my word

655
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,040
and help you.

656
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,180
Cheers.

657
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,570
Okay.

658
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,500
See you.

659
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:07,890
Sir,

660
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,260
would you like to eat something

661
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
or live in the inn?

662
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,620
A pot of good wine and two dishes.

663
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,220
No problem.

664
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,820
Sir,

665
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,170
have some tea first.

666
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,740
Sir,

667
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,500
you've traveled so far here.

668
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,420
Are you here to visit your friends

669
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,730
or

670
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,500
traveling around the country?

671
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,300
Let me ask you.

672
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,340
Is there anyone who's

673
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,540
good at making mechanisms in this town?

674
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,930
Mechanisms?

675
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,700
I don't know.

676
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,420
If you are looking for someone,

677
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,220
you can go to the southeast of the town

678
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,530
to find Carrion Beetle.

679
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,500
Carrion Beetle?

680
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,980
His real name is Chen A'san.

681
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,620
He used to be a corpse collector in Yejing.

682
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,500
After a long time,

683
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,700
he started to trade in the corpses with no owner.

684
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,300
He bought them at a low price,

685
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,060
and sold them at a high price.

686
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,610
He ran such business

687
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,300
and sold them after getting here.

688
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,420
In this way,

689
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,780
he earned a lot of money.

690
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,060
I mean

691
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,260
he

692
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,870
has been to many places.

693
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,220
He must know

694
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,100
many people from all walks of life.

695
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,420
Why don't you try your luck?

696
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,410
Mother! Mother!

697
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,210
Don't hit me!

698
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,550
Again.

699
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Who is it?

700
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,040
May I ask who you are?

701
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,120
Are you Carrion Beetle?

702
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,490
Who are you?

703
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,710
What do you want?

704
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,950
I'm looking for someone.

705
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,950
He's in this town.

706
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,390
I heard you have a lot of connections here.

707
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,120
So I came to ask for your advice.

708
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,020
Come on.

709
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,350
Are you from the capital?

710
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,010
Who are you looking for?

711
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,460
Lu He.

712
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,100
No, I've never heard of him.

713
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,540
You're doing the business

714
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,460
of auctioning dead people's belongs.

715
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,330
I don't do business with strangers.

716
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,260
Don't come over.

717
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,830
Don't come over!

718
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,680
Don't come over!

719
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,350
Don't come over!

720
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,940
Stand up!

721
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,020
Stand up!

722
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,700
Sir, please spare my life.

723
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,380
Take whatever you want in the house.

724
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,710
Take whatever you want.

725
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,770
Don't worry.

726
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,820
I won't take your things,

727
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,860
and I will give you something good.

728
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,380
Something good?

729
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,720
I want you to take this

730
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,180
to your place for auction.

731
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,080
Can you do that?

732
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,280
Yes, I can.

733
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,590
Well,

734
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,700
for the money earned from the auction...

735
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,560
It'll be yours.

736
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,740
But it needs to be sold

737
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,590
for 100 taels of silver.

738
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,980
100 taels?

739
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,280
That's not possible.

740
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,630
In a poor place like this,

741
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,830
it can only be sold for ten taels at most.

742
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,250
If no one bids,

743
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,660
I will buy it.

744
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,700
Lanterns.

745
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,300
The lanterns are beautiful.

746
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,150
-Do you want one? -What colors do you have?

747
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,900
Come and take a look.

748
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,540
Come on, Miss.

749
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,650
[Shen Mansion]

750
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,730
I haven't returned for years.

751
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,260
I didn't expect

752
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,630
to visit Mrs. Shen today

753
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,620
in order to repay your kindness.

754
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,060
Wait here.

755
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
It's almost time.

756
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,210
Let's go in.

757
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,620
You...

758
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,710
You haven't told me

759
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,020
how to help me.

760
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,100
I make friends

761
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,440
based on loyalty.

762
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,590
If you don't trust me,

763
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,540
it means you don't treat me as your friend.

764
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,580
Then

765
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,580
let's quit it.

766
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,970
I trust you.

767
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,980
I trust you.

768
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,910
Let's go.

769
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,380
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen.

770
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,500
I'm back.

771
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,250
Ning.

772
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,140
It's you!

773
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,440
You're finally back.

774
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,700
Girl,

775
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,100
you're finally back.

776
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,940
Why didn't you

777
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,060
inform us in advance?

778
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,830
I just

779
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,540
miss your cooking.

780
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,940
That's why I'm back.

781
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,900
It seems I'm back

782
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,220
at the right time.

783
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,050
Mrs. Shen.

784
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,790
Princess Changle is here, too.

785
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,690
Why are you with her?

786
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,320
I'm not with her.

787
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,190
She badgered me

788
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,650
and insisted on coming.

789
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,070
Come on. Sit down.

790
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,750
You

791
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,180
are really lucky today.

792
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,420
These days,

793
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,320
I've always

794
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,680
thought of you.

795
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,060
The dishes I've made today

796
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,340
are also your favorite foods

797
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,540
when you were a child.

798
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,020
Come quickly.

799
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,090
Give Princess Wuyou a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.

800
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:24,810
Yes.

801
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,390
Since you've come with her,

802
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,580
you must have not eaten yet.

803
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,170
If you don't mind,

804
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,220
sit down and try my wife's cooking.

805
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,660
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

806
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,520
OK.

807
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,110
Add a bowl and a pair of chopsticks for Her Highness.

808
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,880
Yes.

809
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,460
Mrs. Shen,

810
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,570
have some soup first.

811
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,620
This soup

812
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,180
is the best for your stomach.

813
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,210
Alright.

814
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,670
No need to look after me.

815
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,300
To travel outside, it's not like being at home.

816
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,060
You should eat more.

817
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,680
Come on.

818
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,230
I knew it.

819
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,300
Mrs. Shen

820
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,430
loves Ning the most.

821
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,880
Of course.

822
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,900
How is it?

823
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Is it good?

824
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,170
Come on.

825
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
Try this.

826
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:09,920
Ning.

827
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,480
Tell me.

828
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,750
Where have you been

829
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,280
in the past three years?

830
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,580
I haven't heard from you.

831
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,030
Your and Yan's

832
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,810
marriage

833
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,290
is delayed.

834
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,429
What a pity.

835
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,989
Speaking of this,

836
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,530
I feel so angry.

837
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,610
I only had a small conflict

838
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,230
with Changming.

839
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,219
How come a girl suddenly

840
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,489
appeared and tried to take him away?

841
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,750
I got anxious

842
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,820
as soon as I knew it,

843
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,250
so I came back at once.

844
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,840
Why did you kick me?

845
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,770
You...

846
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,980
It seems

847
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,810
our table is too small

848
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,230
for Princess Changle.

849
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,770
What's wrong?

850
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,540
What's wrong, Ning?

851
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,200
Do you not like the food?

852
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,300
-Ning. You...-Mrs. Shen, wait. I'll go and check.

853
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,000
You...

854
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,110
I'll take a look, too.

855
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,930
Qin Ning!

856
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,740
Qin Ning!

857
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,720
What do you mean?

858
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,620
Liu Ling,

859
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,420
to be honest,

860
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,100
I...

861
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,480
I'm pregnant with Shen Yan's baby.

862
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,440
What?

863
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,340
You...

864
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,250
I beg you.

865
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,260
Please leave him, okay?

866
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,390
Nonsense!

867
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,600
In the past few months,

868
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,100
apart from working in Jiangzhou,

869
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,110
he was always with me.

870
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,860
How could you

871
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,780
get pregnant with his child?

872
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,700
So what?

873
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,220
I said this child

874
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,340
belongs to Changming.

875
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,980
Then he's Changming's child.

876
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,260
You also saw

877
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,300
Mrs. Shen's attitudes towards you just now.

878
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,660
If you expose me now,

879
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,410
just see

880
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,990
whether she trusts you or me.

881
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,720
Qin Ning.

882
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,160
Shen Yan is just out on a case.

883
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,270
He will be back soon.

884
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,090
How long can you

885
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,420
keep this lie from them?

886
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,370
Changming cares about me so much.

887
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,410
If he comes back, I'll cry and beg him.

888
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,360
He'll definitely protect my reputation

889
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,770
and accept this child.

890
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,460
Qin Ning.

891
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,410
You keep calling him Changming.

892
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,110
But secretly,

893
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,400
you plot against him like this.

894
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,600
I shouldn't have trusted you.

895
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,040
What can I do?

896
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,980
If this child is born,

897
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,960
someone has to be his father.

898
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,670
If you are sensible,

899
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,970
leave now.

900
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,970
Otherwise,

901
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,650
don't blame me for embarrassing you.

902
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,180
I...

903
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,040
Who are you going to embarrass?

904
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,060
Mrs. Shen.

905
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,830
Ning.

906
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,190
I treated you like my own child.

907
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,130
How dare you plot against

908
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,550
my son?

909
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,910
When you left without saying goodbye,

910
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,700
I also heard

911
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,820
some rumors.

912
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,700
They said you didn't behave yourself

913
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,560
and eloped with a martial artist.

914
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,380
I know your personality well.

915
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,960
I've never taken

916
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,940
it to heart.

917
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,790
I didn't expect

918
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,660
you to have such thoughts.

919
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,370
I...

920
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,900
My son

921
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,270
has fallen in love with

922
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,870
Princess Changle, Liu Ling.

923
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,610
When he comes back from work,

924
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,810
I will ask His Majesty

925
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,450
for an edict

926
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,850
to grant

927
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,380
their marriage.

928
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,580
If Changming

929
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,690
marries Liu Ling,

930
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,250
what about

931
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,190
my baby?

932
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,530
Just go find the child's father.

933
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,000
It has nothing to do

934
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,330
with my son.

935
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,270
Mrs. Shen.

936
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,820
You've watched me

937
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,810
grow up.

938
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,430
You can't be so cruel.

939
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,660
If I can't be

940
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,800
Changming's wife,

941
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,400
then I...

942
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,960
I...

943
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,730
I can be his concubine.

944
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,770
I beg you.

945
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,300
Help me and my child out.

946
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,060
OK?

947
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,160
Our Shen Family is a clean family.

948
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,920
How can you mess around here?

949
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,800
Leave now.

950
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,820
Mrs. Shen.

951
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,790
I'll come another day.

952
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,200
Your Highness.

953
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,570
Your Highness.

954
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,130
Oh, Qin Ning!

955
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,480
You scared me just now.

956
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,380
The world is dangerous.

957
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,330
I know some tricks

958
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,690
to mix up truth with falsehood.

959
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,370
Although it's not decent,

960
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,660
it can

961
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,000
save my life.

962
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,220
But if you do this,

963
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,230
it will break Mrs. Shen's heart.

964
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,130
Loyalty, filial piety and righteousness

965
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,810
can hardly be fulfilled at the same time.

966
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,620
I hurt her today

967
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,680
so as to help her

968
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,340
find a good daughter-in-law.

969
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,660
Liu Ling,

970
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,980
listen carefully.

971
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,940
When you marry into the Shen family,

972
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,380
you must

973
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,910
take good care of Mrs. Shen.

974
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,900
If I know

975
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,260
you disregard her

976
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,460
as you're a princess,

977
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,340
I will come back to take your life.

978
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,540
Got it.

979
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,940
I won’t let you down.

980
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,940
Alright.

981
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,230
It's getting late.

982
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,970
Goodbye.

983
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,980
See you again.

984
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,900
Aren't you looking for your lover?

985
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,140
Then you will stay in Yejing

986
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,300
for some days, huh?

987
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,500
Of course.

988
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,980
How about this?

989
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
Go to my mansion

990
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,140
and settle down.

991
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,660
Then I can tell you in time

992
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,980
if there's any news.

993
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,530
You're so kind,

994
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,320
and I'm

995
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,670
also a grateful person.

996
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,890
I will help you

997
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,100
to the end.

998
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,580
Liu Ling.

999
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,820
Although you are not a martial artist,

1000
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,770
you have the disposition

1001
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,340
of a martial artist.

1002
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,250
It makes me like you more and more.

1003
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,380
Okay.

1004
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,410
I'll go with you.

1005
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,100
If you dare to play any tricks,

1006
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,180
I'll be merciless.

1007
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,630
If you're worried,

1008
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,060
you can sell it yourself.

1009
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,220
Cut the crap.

1010
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,270
Attention.

1011
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,440
This small copper cauldron

1012
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,430
is the first item

1013
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,170
we're going to sell today.

1014
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,750
Come on.

1015
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,910
Look at its pattern.

1016
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,180
Isn't it beautiful?

1017
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,070
Isn't the sculpture very exquisite?

1018
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,920
It looks good.

1019
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,930
Get out of the way!

1020
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,300
Move!

1021
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,870
Come on.

1022
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,390
Nice to see you, Mr. Shen.

1023
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,030
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

1024
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,760
You've used such a good tactic.

1025
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,760
I admire you.

1026
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,790
-You shouldn't stay in such a place of trouble for so long. -I'll pay thirty.

1027
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,590
-Leave this to me. -Okay. Got it.

1028
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,080
Miss,

1029
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,910
-please go back. -Thirty-five.

1030
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,260
Whether to stay or leave,

1031
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,460
I know what to do.

1032
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,370
I went from the capital

1033
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,830
to here with some servants

1034
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,970
-in order to help you. -Forty. Any other offer?

1035
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,780
Mr. Shen,

1036
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,190
-just do as you wish. -Okay. Forty. Deal!

1037
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,630
Don't worry about me.

1038
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,700
Congratulations!

1039
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,870
The last one

1040
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,340
is a rare item.

1041
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,490
The original owner of this item is

1042
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,890
Yun Yi, the principal criminal who robbed

1043
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,820
the official vault in Jiangzhou,

1044
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,030
This item

1045
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,750
is the treasure he protected with his life.

1046
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,780
The silver lost in Jiangzhou

1047
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,140
might be hidden in it.

1048
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,900
Keep your eyes wide open.

1049
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,180
Watch carefully.

1050
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,480
What is this?

1051
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,340
He stole my stuff.

1052
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,050
He stole my stuff.

1053
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,610
What are you doing?

1054
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,920
Don't take my stuff.

1055
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,660
It's fake.

1056
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:45,860
Stop!

1057
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,600
It looks like

1058
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,570
neither of us

1059
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,080
can get out tonight.

1060
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,500
Although we can't leave,

1061
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,440
it's a big gain

1062
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,460
to find Mr. Lu He.

1063
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,350
My lord,

1064
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,730
why are you making things difficult for me?

1065
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,210
I'm just

1066
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,670
a village man.

1067
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,880
But this village man conspired with Carrion Beetle

1068
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,300
to replace the jade,

1069
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,990
lure out the assassins of the Lu family,

1070
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,280
and force the three of us

1071
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,710
into a desperate situation.

1072
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,080
You though of such a good plan.

1073
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,000
I admire you.

1074
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,270
Same to you.

1075
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,670
Sir,

1076
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,780
we have never met you before.

1077
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,600
Why did you plot to kill us

1078
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,610
again and again?

1079
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,150
Why?

1080
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,090
Since we've never met,

1081
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,100
then why did you use

1082
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,540
the Qian and Kun jade

1083
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,870
to lure me out?

1084
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,800
You know what?

1085
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,820
This jade

1086
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,980
was handed to me

1087
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,390
by Yun Yi before he died,

1088
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,940
so that I could

1089
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,260
meet you one day.

1090
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,490
That's a lie!

1091
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,860
Nonsense!

1092
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,810
If he didn't say it himself,

1093
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,620
how would we know

1094
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,940
you're hiding here?

1095
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,710
Besides,

1096
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,490
you have

1097
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,070
the box of Qian and Kun jade,

1098
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,620
which contains the evidence of the Jiangzhou case.

1099
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,700
Before Lianshan died,

1100
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,570
what else did he tell you?

1101
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,430
He specifically told us

1102
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,670
to go north to Xuanwu Town

1103
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,550
to find his master there,

1104
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,010
get back the box,

1105
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,960
and avenge his death.

1106
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,260
In that case,

1107
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,740
come with me.
