Only after resigning from office will you feel secure.

5
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,580
It's indeed superficial.

Lieutenant Shen Yan

226
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,560
did a great job

227

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,940
As the emperor and the crown prince instructed,

229
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,300
he is appointed as

230
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,320
the commander-in-chief of the Jin Lin Military Camp.

231

Besides,

232
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,290
since Princess Peace is about to marry into Yigu,

233
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,390
Shen Yan is appointed as the wedding envoy.

234
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,630
Please go to Jiangzhou immediately

235
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,700

236
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,910
Princess Peace to Yigu.

Shen Yan.

238
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,119
Accept the decree.

239
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,420
Lord Shen,

240
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,490
you have been working for me and His Majesty.

241
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,510
You must have suffered a lot.

242
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,619
Now,

243
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,640
your returning from the south

244
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,160
coincides with Princess Peace's marriage.

245
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,700
At this critical moment,

246
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I specially asked Father

247
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,540
to appoint you as the commander-in-chief

248
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,099
and the wedding envoy.

249
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,060
We entrust the both tasks to you.

250
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Do you understand

251
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,790
my intention?

252
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,680
I

253
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,410
will not let you down.

254
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,420
Rise.

255
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

256
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,220
Lord Shen,

257
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,800
a great man never worries that he won't have a wife.

258
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,610
After you

259
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,550
escort Princess Peace to Yigu,

260
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,200
your wish

261
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,840
will be fulfilled.

262
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,580
Yigu

263
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,480
is vicious and ambitious.

264
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,510
I should stay in the palace,

265
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,260
so I can't watch what Yigu's doing.

266
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,300
In this trip,

267
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,260
you are my eyes.

268
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,580
Everything you see and hear

269
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,680
should be

270
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,740
reported to me.

271
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

272
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,140
You may leave.

273
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,770
Sister.

274
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,970
Sister Liu Ling.

275
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,420
Sister.

276
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,080
Who are you drawing?

277
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,560
Who are you?

278
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,530
Who let you in?

279
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm Run.

280
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,220
My mother asked me to bring you

281
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,740
some newly-made snacks from the kitchen.

282
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,340
Who is your mother?

283
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,980
She works in the mansion.

284
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,090
They call her Nanny Wang.

285
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,770
Then why did she

286
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,770
send snacks to me?

287
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,500
Mother said you're a good person.

288
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,980
But the people here are not good to you.

289
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,420
They are sophisticated.

290
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,300
Maybe they even don't

291
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,000
give you snacks to eat.

292
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,270
You're going to marry

293
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,380
into a faraway place.

294
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
From now on,

295
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,060
you may never eat snacks from your home.

296
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,500
So she specially asked me

297
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,100
to give these to you.

298
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,380
Oh no.

299
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,340
Mother doesn't want me

300
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,040
to tell these to others.

301
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,410
Otherwise, I'll be flogged.

302
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,750
You won't tell anyone, will you?

303
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,990
Don't worry.

304
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,440
I won't tell anyone.

305
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,000
Thank your mother for me.

306
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,700
Go.

307
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,530
Sister.

308
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,680
Mother said you should eat the snacks while they're hot.

309
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,670
They're tender when hot.

310
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,500
They are extremely delicious.

311
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,110
Do you want some?

312
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,340
Here.

313
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,650
Delicious?

314
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,520
Run,

315
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,780
have you been to the street market?

316
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,980
Mother once asked me

317
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,640
to buy stitches and plates,

318
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,660
but I've never walked around.

319
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,110
Let me tell you.

320
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,650
The food in the street market

321
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,130
is 100 times better

322
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,560
than that in the mansion.

323
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,480
I'll take you to the market

324
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,020
to eat delicious food, okay?

325
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,660
Sure. Sure.

326
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,660
Let's go.

327
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,460
Come.

328
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,420
Let's go.

329
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,690
Here you are.

330
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,370
-The check, please. -Can't be cheaper.

331
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,220
Run,

332
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,900
Ling Bi, go after him!

333
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,660
Run!

334
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,240
Run, come back!

335
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,430
Miss.

336
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,130
Take a look at our hairpins.

337
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,310
There are also bracelets and necklaces.

338
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,240
So many choices.

339
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,350
Our jewelry

340
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,120
is beautiful.

341
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Have a look, Miss.

342
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,090
You're here.

343
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,900
Shen Yan,

344
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,930
I miss you so much.

345
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,580
I know.

346
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,700
You are in my imagination.

347
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,690
It's fine.

348
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,420
If you're in my imagination,

349
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,780
you'll promise me

350
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,620
whatever I say

351
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,320
and smile at me.

352
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,960
If you buy me this bracelet,

353
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,730
I'll elope with you.

354
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,060
OK?

355
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,400
No.

356
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,200
♫ My longing for you runs like an endless song ♫

357
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,750
♫ I love you to the moon and back ♫

358
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,640
♫ I promise to love you always ♫

359
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,530
♫ I never want to say goodbyes to you ♫

360
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,610
♫ You are in my dreams; you are in my heart ♫

361
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,120
♫ My untold thoughts, my lovesickness ♫

362
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,810
♫ Your love for me is like my love for you ♫

363
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:59,870
♫ We’ll never feel lonely in the world ♫

364
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,000
♫ I’ll share your wishes in the coming years ♫

365
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,980
♫ All the love poems fail to portray my love for you ♫

366
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,300
♫ I promise to take your hand and grow old with you ♫

367
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,810
♫ Don't ask about the way home. I just want to be by your side for life ♫

368
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,590
♫ I will give you a lifelong promise, just as you wish ♫

369
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,230
♫ Your every wish will come true. It's worth the wait ♫

370
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,140
♫ I only want to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

371
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,110
♫ And indulge in the world holding your hand ♫

372
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,850
You are so lucky, young master.

373
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,300
Well,

374
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,560
two taels of silver for the bracelet.

375
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,260
Young master.

376
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,060
Stay away!

377
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,460
Although she is a woman,

378
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,500
she is a bad ass.

379
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,980
She committed robbery.

380
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,970
Back off.

381
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,040
Judging from your outfit,

382
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,250
you may be a rich lady.

383
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,360
Why did you commit robbery?

384
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,480
I want this room.

385
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,000
This one?

386
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,150
Do you need

387
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,500
some good wine and dishes?

388
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,230
Do I need to make the bed for you?

389
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,260
Sure.

390
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,630
What are you thinking?

391
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,670
Where are you now?

392
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,620
Do you think this is an inn?

393
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,480
This is a prison

394
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,160
where prisoners are locked up.

395
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm a princess.

396
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,990
Princess?

397
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,420
Will a princess rob on the street?

398
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,550
Who are you fooling?

399
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,900
Go in.

400
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,980
Why are you laughing?

401
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,980
You don't want to elope with me,

402
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,580
but you don't have to sacrifice yourself

403
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,910
for two taels of silver.

404
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,590
Lord Shen,

405
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,260
you didn't bring money with you?

406
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,900
You should

407
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,860
ask me this question

408
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,520
before you bought something.

409
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,300
Shen Yan,

410
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,260
what are you doing in Jiangzhou?

411
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,810
I came for you.

412
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,550
You ran away from me.

413
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,060
I came to catch you.

414
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,150
Really?

415
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,460
But if you just leave like this,

416
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,520
Family Shen will also be implicated.

417
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,070
I did come here

418
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,180
to take you away.

419
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,500
But

420
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,500
it's not a elope.

421
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,980
You have a plan?

422
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,460
Tell me.

423
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,040
My lord, remember.

424
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,980
Don't let Ling

425
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,940
know about this.

426
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,490
If she has any concerns,

427
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,040
things will be difficult.

428
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
Shen Yan,

429
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,960
what are you thinking?

430
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,510
Do you trust me?

431
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,420
If you believe me,

432
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,650
don't ask anything.

433
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,070
Just know that

434
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,350
I will marry you.

435
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,920
Let me ask you.

436
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,810
Do you still want to marry me?

437
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,710
Shen Yan,

438
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,530
do you love me?

439
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,380
I don't know what love is.

440
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,160
But I know

441
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,620
you are the only person

442
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,240
in this world

443
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,420
who keeps spinning in my mind.

444
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,180
I want to marry you.

445
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,630
I'm willing to give up everything

446
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,240
to be with you forever.

447
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,950
Do you think

448
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,970
this is love?

449
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,040
Why are you laughing?

450
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,420
The Stern-faced Yama

451
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,580
is really good at saying words of love.

452
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,290
Are you blind?

453
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,060
How dare you bring the princess here?

454
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,340
If the duke finds out,

455
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,620
all of you will be beheaded.

456
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,900
Yes, you're right.

457
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,570
It's all his fault.

458
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,180
-Princess, are you alright? -You've been working for 30 years and you are still a constable.

459
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,900
I'm fine.

460
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,460
I was ignorant and offended you.

461
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,390
I deserve to die.

462
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,540
Let them go!

463
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,500
Hurry up!

464
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,070
Turn around! Turn around!

465
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,000
♫ With time flying by ♫

466
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,660
You haven't answered the question

467

♫ We sometimes laugh, sometimes sigh ♫

468
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,190
I asked you.

469
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,000
♫ It seems we don't care about anything ♫

470
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
I gave you my heart long ago.

471

♫ But we can't hide from the fateful meeting ♫

472
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,220
Even if you take me to hell,

473
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,900
I will trust you,

474

♫ Everything else is just passing ♫

475
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,260
follow you,

476

and marry you.

477
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,330
♫ I'm so lucky as your love is undying ♫

478
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,250
♫ We can't be parted, even if we're at the end of the earth ♫

479
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,240
But...

480
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,940
What?

481
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,070
♫ The only thing I'm sure of is this truth ♫

482
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:26,980
But if I

483
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,640
ask you this next time,

484
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,580
you have to say you love me.

485
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,490
♫ Never ask for forever, just for days and nights ♫

486

♫ I come to you, across the sea and mountains ♫

491
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,710
Love you.

492
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,510
♫ No more words, no more explanations ♫

493
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,650

Don't worry.

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,640
I'll go in with you.

496
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,370
There are some things

497
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,810
should be made clear to Prince Guangping.

498
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,280
About what you have to talk to him?

499
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,860
You.

500
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,860
Since you're

501
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,440
the wedding envoy appointed by His Majesty,

502
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,080
you may stay here for now.

503
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,620
Go and arrange a room

504
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,820
for Lord Shen.

505
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,660
Yes.

506
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,160
Princess of Guangping, please wait.

507
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,960
Prince Guangping,

508
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,720
I'm here today

509
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,530
to make a deal with you.

510
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,220
What deal?

511
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,620
From now on,

512
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,220
Princess Peace's matter

513
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,220
has nothing to do with you.

514
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,890
Please kindly be informed.

515
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,210
Shen Yan, how dare you!

516
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,540
What's the condition?

517
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
The condition is

518
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,590
the peace in Prince Guangping’s Mansion.

519
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,780
Who are you

520
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,170
to care about

521
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,660
the peace in my mansion?

522
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,740
House of Duke Dingbei

523
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,650
has been out of contact with House of Prince Guangping

524
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,980
for decades.

525
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,300
Duke Dingbei was poisoned.

526
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,220
so Junior Duke became the one

527
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,250
in charge of the mansion.

528
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,600
Soon he brought Prince Guangping into the duke's mansion.

529
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,210
What a coincidence!

530
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,420
I think the prince and the Princess of Guangping

531
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,690
must have known

532
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,810
the poison thing long ago.

533
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,380
Also,

534
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,820
the former Princess of Guangping,

535
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,780
Zhang Yun, jumped into the lake and died.

536
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,620
Everyone in Jiangzhou said

537
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,570
that it was Liu Ling who forced her.

538
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,170
But I don’t understand one thing.

539
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,540
Tell me.

540
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,180
People in Jiangzhou said

541
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,610
Liu Ling

542
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,200
forced his mother to death at five

543
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,110
and stabbed her father at seven.

544
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,100
But how could

545
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,620
a young girl

546
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,340
be so capable?

547
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,980
Even if she's the reincarnation of the Demon of Chaos,

548
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,620
how could such a disgrace

549
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,740
be known to all

550
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,500
since she was in a noble family.

551
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,140
Your Highness made Liu Ling

552
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,470
the target of the public

553
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,540
to confuse people.

554
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,700
If you say there is

555
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,420
no ulterior motive,

556
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,020
I definitely don't believe it.

557
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,840
Lord Shen,

558
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,530
you threatened us

559
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,510
with the safety of the House of Prince Guangping

560
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,910
and said with certainty.

561
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,550
Do you have any evidence?

562
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,780
No.

563
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,860
But if Your Highness

564
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,120
doesn't approve of me,

565
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,140
I will do my best

566
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,910
to dig out

567
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,180
all the secrets

568
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,090
of the House of Prince Guangping.

569
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,260
Shen Yan.

570
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,740
Thank you.

571
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,230
I don't want to

572
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,500
stay here any longer.

573
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,980
Let's go, okay?

574
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,710
No.

575
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,170
According to the rituals,

576
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,180
on the day of the marriage,

577
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,110
you should set out from Prince Guangping's Mansion.

578
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,820
Then wait for me in your room.

579
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,570
I know you care about me.

580
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,060
You must have traveled here day and night without stopping.

581
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
I'll ask Ling Bi to cook some dishes for you

582
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,370
as a welcome, okay?

583
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,760
Your Highness,

584
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,250
Ling hasn't married yet.

585
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,540
It's inappropriate for her to do that.

586
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,220
Ling,

587
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,660
the path you've chosen

588
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,580
is definitely not a easy one.

589
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,320
Have you made up your mind?

590
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,080
Yes.

591
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,690
Here. Slowly.

592
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,020
It's done.

593
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,420
Ling Bi.

594
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,890
Am I beautiful?

595
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,460
You're as beautiful as a fairy.

596
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,830
I think the woman in the painting

597
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,160
is not as pretty as you.

598
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,580
But I

599
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,340
don't understand one thing.

600
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,240
Since you

601
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,870
don't like Tuoba Lie,

602
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,580
why did you make an effort

603
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,020
to dress up?

604
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,450
It's not for him.

605
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,200
I

606
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,260
dress up for Shen Yan.

607
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,380
If he doesn't keep his promise

608
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
to marry me,

609
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,820
then this beautiful lady

610
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,670
would be someone else's bride.

611
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:17,889
Princess,

612
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,650
it's time to go.

613
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,570
Coming.

614
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,170
[Shen]

615
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,450
Wait.

616
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,960
Wait.

617
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,270
Stop!

618
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,650
Qin Ning?

619
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,570
Who are you?

620
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,140
I’m Princess Wuyou,

621
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,890
a close friend of the princess.

622
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm here to see her off.

623
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,660
Ling.

624
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,090
Are you tired?

625
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,890
I'm fine.

626
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:33,830
Okay.

627
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,150
You guys talk.

628
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,520
Why are you here?

629
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,740
Brother Changming asked me to come.

630
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,060
This whole marriage thing

631
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
was caused by me.

632
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,880
So when he came to me and Brother Hong for help,

633
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,320
I immediately agreed.

634
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,800
Shen Yan?

635
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,630
What did he ask you to do?

636
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,380
I can't tell you more.

637
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,190
You will know one day.

638
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,450
On the way to Yigu,

639
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,050
you only need to do one thing.

640
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,570
In one word,

641
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,910
delay.

642
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,280
Why did he

643
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,340
tell Qin Ning but didn't tell me?

644
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,250
What did he say to Qin Ning?

645
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,180
Shen Yan!

646
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,280
The wedding envoy!

647
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,170
Lord Shen!

648
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,340
The wedding envoy!

649
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,050
Why is he ignoring me?

650
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,890
I called him so many times,

651
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,490
but he didn't even look at me.

652
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,950
Why did he...

653
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,410
He told Qin Ning everything,

654
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,630
but he didn't tell me.

655
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,870
Ling Bi,

656
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,460
it's too heavy.

657
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,610
I'm so tired.

658
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,630
Stop.

659
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,010
Stop.

660
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,720
Princess.

661
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,260
Ling.

662
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,420
What’s wrong?

663
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,060
It's so bumpy.

664
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,250
I feel sore all over.

665
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,510
I want to rest here.

666
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,820
Yes.

667
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,390
It's a long journey.

668
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,370
You must have

669
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,480
suffered a lot.

670
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,900
This is my first time to step out of the border.

671
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,120
The view here is nice.

672
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,880
I want to stay here for a while.

673
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,740
Here?

674
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,000
There are many beautiful views outside the pass.

675
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,440
The scenery is more beautiful than that of this place.

676
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,570
I will take you

677
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,840
to enjoy the views.

678
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,870
Tuoba Lie,

679
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,930
I will be your wife,

680
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,410
and you don't even agree over

681
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,670
these small requests?

682
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,660
I agree.

683
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,840
I didn't expect that

684
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,900
it's difficult to pick wild flowers here.

685
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Hope you like it.

686
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

687
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,850
Do you like it?

688
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,990
It smells good.

689
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,810
It smells so good.

690
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,200
I think the view here is beautiful.

691
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,180
But you are more beautiful

692
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,580
than the view.

693
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,170
What bullshit princess?

694
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,130
We've only traveled for less than half a day and she wanted to rest.

695
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,380
Even if I rode a sheep,

696
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,690
I wouldn't have been as sluggish as her.

697
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,180
Are you drunk again?

698
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,180
We just left the border of Wei.

699
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,410
We should be careful with our words.

700
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,650
Bullshit!

701
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,260
Wait till I get my hands on

702
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,460
these women of Wei,

703
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,780
I'll sort them out!

704
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,330
Enough, stop arguing.

705
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,160
Listen to me.

706
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,780
This thing

707
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,370
is called silk.

708
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,580
It was made of the things

709
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,220
spitted out from bugs.

710
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,460
Nonsense!

711
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,960
Why can we put on the things

712
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,550
spitted out from bugs?

713
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,500
Why not?

714
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,750
-Let's go to have a look. -I tell you.

715
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,830
This is very precious.

716
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,100
This thing

717
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,810
feels soft and smooth

718
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,500
if you wear it.

719
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,640
It feels

720
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,830
far smoother than the faces

721
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,800
of your women!

722
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,470
What are you doing?

723
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,000
Nothing.

724
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,890
Look.

725
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,500
Wei people are so vicious.

726
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,280
They want to use these things

727
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,100
to lower the morale

728
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,150
of our Yigu warriors.

729
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Bring me the fire.

730
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,730
General.

731
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
You can't do that.

732
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,120
These things

733
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,920
are dowries

734
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,580
of the Princess of Wei.

735
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,130
If they're burnt,

736
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,760
the Wei people will...

737
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,020
Cut the crap. Piss off.

738
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,570
Beautiful.

739
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,720
Your Highness.

740
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,940
What is it?

741
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,820
General Mu burned

742
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,080
the princess's dowry.

743
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,500
I have something to deal with.

744
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
I'll be back soon.

745
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,060
Put out the fire immediately!

746
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Yes. Hurry up.

747
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,850
What do you mean, you sod?

748
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,820
It's my wedding day.

749
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,580
Why are you making troubles for me?

750
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,180
It's not me. It's them.

751
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,380
Don't talk bullshit.

752
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,560
You...

753
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,220
Princess.

754
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,100
Qin Ning told me

755
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,300
to delay the trip

756
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,540
on the way.

757
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,780
It was your idea?

758
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,980
You're right.

759
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,200
You told Qin Ning

760
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,600
about your plan,

761
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,180
but why can't you tell me?

762
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,790
That day, you said

763
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,080
you gave your heart to me.

764
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,060
Even if I

765
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,180
take you to hell,

766
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,000
you'll trust me and stay with me.

767
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:22,940
Now what?

768
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,820
You regret now?

769
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,490
I'm just curious.

770
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,710
So I asked you.

771
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,500
Are you curious

772
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,820
or are you jealous for no reason?

773
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,740
Jealous.

774
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,030
I'll go take a look.
