180
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,860
Nanyuan?

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,880
Princess.

182
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,320
You are the one who yelled, not me.

183
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,480
Beauty skin, beauty bones.

184
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,920
Beautiful but tiger-like.

185
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,420
She stabbed her dad and killed her mom.

186
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,700
She even eats up children alive.

187
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,910
The tiger is coming.

188
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,750
Run!

189
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,130
Lord Shen,

190
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,620
the net you want is ready.

191
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,360
Make a cup of good tea

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
to welcome the guest.

193
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,610
OK.

194
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,680
[Warrant]

195
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,200
[Shen Yan]

196
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,200
[Administration of Beidian, the commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard]

197
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,920
Sir,

198
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,110
have a drink.

199
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,940
The Jingfeng Sword?

200
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,250
So you're the Jinlin Guard.

201
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,640
Are you the Stern-faced Yama,

202
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,980
Shen Yan?

203
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,390
You're flattering me.

204
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,590
You're just playing tricks.

205
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Go to die!

206
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,940
Protect the people!

207
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,870
Put out the fire!

208
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,450
Yes.

209
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,830
[Nanyuan]

210
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,970
Please come in.

211
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,520
I've reserved a table for you.

212
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,620
Please.

213
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,680
Drink another cup!

214
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,740
You're such a good drinker!

215
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,650
I haven't been here for a long time.

216
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,490
This way.

217
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,900
Who told you to change the tune?

218
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,500
I said I want to listen to

219
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,870
The Book of Songs!

220
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,130
I grasped your hand.

221
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,440
Together with you I was to grow old.

222
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,720
It's all fake.

223
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,900
Your Highness, you are drunk.

224
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Are you missing Her Highness again?

225
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,480
The more I miss,

226
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,430
the lonelier I feel.

227
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,090
My dear princess,

228
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,700
you can't drink anymore.

229
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,930
You have listened to the music

230
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,680
and drunk a lot.

231
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,810
It's time to go home.

232
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,170
Princess,

233
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,010
you haven't got married yet.

234
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,060
If His Highness finds out

235
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,890
you're in such a place of carnal pleasure,

236
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,550
it'll be beneath his dignity.

237
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,420
His dignity has nothing to do with me.

238
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,100
Whether I'm happy

239
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,360
or sad,

240
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,330
who cares

241
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,490
in this world?

242
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,670
Who cares?

243
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,960
Shen Yan,

244
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,880
you asked for it.

245
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,300
Everybody has gone.

246
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,870
Why are you still here?

247
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,470
Do you

248
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,630
stay here with me

249
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,010
to celebrate

250
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,590
my 20th birthday?

251
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,220
Fine.

252
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,020
Anyway,

253
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,780
the world is full of hypocrisy.

254
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,680
It's rare to have someone

255
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,240
solitary and lonely

256
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,450
stay here.

257
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
We can be each other's company.

258
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,750
The scar at the corner of your eyes

259
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,260
is like a tear mole.

260
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,940
♫Never expect to savor the taste of life♫

261
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,470
I like it very much.

♫How lucky I am to have you around♫

263

What happened?

270
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,160
You knocked into someone!

271
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,990
How careless you are!

272
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,160
Who is that?

273
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,170

Shen Yan.

281
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,720
You just flirted with me,

282
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,980
and now you want to leave me?

283
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,300
Your Highness.

284
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,890
Rumor has it

285
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,440
that you

286
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,080
wanted to reopen the robbery case of

287
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,430
Jiangzhou treasury

288
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,140
and sent the commander Shen Yan

289
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,420
to investigate it.

290
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,670
Is that true?

291
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,410
Yes.

292
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,770
The Jiangzhou case

293
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,640
has been suspended for years.

294
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,110
When Father ordered me to supervise the country,

295
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
this case

296
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,270
was a sore trial to him.

297
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,420
The principal criminals, which are Xu and his wife,

298
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,450
committed suicide

299
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,870
after the crime was done.

300
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,870
Only the accomplice Yun Yi is still alive,

Do you mention the case again

304
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,080
because Yun Yi

305
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,950
has been found?

306
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,940
You're right.

307
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,400
This bandit has been hiding for years,

[The Crown Prince who temporarily governs the nation]

310
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,100
but there must be a flaw.

311
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,990
He exposed his whereabouts

312
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,440
in Jiangzhou.

313
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,030
How wise you are, Your Highness!

314
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,160
Yun Yi colluded with the Xus

315
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,040
to rob the official vault of Jiangzhou

316
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,770
and killed the soldiers of Wei.

317
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,030
His evil deeds are obvious.

318
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,200
It's unforgivable.

319
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,780
But Commander Shen is still young.

320
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,190
I'm afraid he won't be able to take the responsibility.

321
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,510
I volunteer

322
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,320
to head for Jiangzhou

323
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,470
and kill the bandit on the spot

324
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,710
to relieve your worries.

325
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,210
Please allow me.

326
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,170
Look.

327
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,140
The tea aroma arrives

328
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,830
sooner than the person.

329
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,340

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,830

This is Biluochun tea picked before Qingming Festival, right?

336
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,680
Smelling the fragrance of the tea

337
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,750
makes me

338
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,550
refreshed.

fragrance can nurture your spirit.

341

This bowl of Biluochun tea

342
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,820
will calm your mind.

Have a taste of it.

344

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,790
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,910
Tell me then,

354
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
is Shen Yan

355
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,680
able to investigate this case?

356
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,820
Your Highness,

357
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,430
Commander Shen is young and capable.

358
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,560
His ability is unrivaled.

359
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,760
Most importantly,

360
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,530
he is loyal

361
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,850
to the court.

362
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,670
If you can entrust him with important tasks,

363
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,000
it must be a blessing for the people of Wei.

364
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,300
OK.

365
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,450
Tell me,

366
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,230
do you think Yun Yi

367
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,250
should be killed?

368
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,920
Yun Yi violated the law, so he should be killed.

369
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,210
But there are many doubts

370
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,780
about the Jiangzhou case.

371
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,160
If we kill Yun Yi now,

372
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,140
I'm afraid it's difficult to

373
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,800
uncover the truth of the case.

374
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,290
I'm a descendant of Family Xu.

375
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,950
My parents died of injustice,

376
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,060
and my family was reviled.

377
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,360
I dare not forget it.

378
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,080
Your Highness,

379
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,740
I beg you to spare Yun Yi's life for the moment

380
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,660
and help Family Xu clear the name.

381
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,240
Xu Shijin!

382
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,840
We have solid evidence for the Jiangzhou case.

383
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,520
The Xu couple committed suicide after they left a letter.

384
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,470
The case was closed.

385
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,430
You are the daughter of a sinner.

386
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,400
How dare you talk nonsense here?

387
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,620
What do you want?

388
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,800
Jin is just a woman.

389
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,190
It doesn't matter what she says.

390
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,830
Lord Lu,

391
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,340
why are you so irritated?

392
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,470
Lord Lu,

393
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,940
you are the pillar of Wei State.

394
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,470
How can you let you investigate

395
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,190
such a trivial case in person?

396
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,150
I've asked Commander Shen

397
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,010
to handle this case.

398
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,890
Just wait for the result

399
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,490
in the capital.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,860
Your Highness.

401
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,100
The Biluochun tea

402
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,560
is cold.

403
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,740
I'll make a new bowl

404
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,940
for you.

405
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,860
- Please think twice, Your Highness. -The tea need to be savored quietly.

406
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,660
Lord Lu,

407
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,240
please leave.

408
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,640
Jin!

409
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,870
Pour some tea.

410
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,440
My lord,

411
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,320
are you really not gonna

412
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,680
see a doctor?

413
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,110
No need.

414
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,050
It's such a dirty trick.

415
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,760
Only Yun Yi,

416
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,870
the bandit,

417
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,820
can do it.

418
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,310
Although Yun Yi is a bandit,

419
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,500
he's quite capable.

420
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,390
Otherwise,

421
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,800
how could he escape from

422
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,990
the administrator of Nandian

423
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,790
and disappear for so many years?

424
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
I

425
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,060
underestimated the enemy.

426
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,660
My lord,

427
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,190
You don't have to be too harsh on yourself.

428
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,310
That villain.

429
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,570
is so despicable.

430
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,920
My lord, what are you looking for?

431
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,770
Did you see my waist token

432
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,300
when you tidied my clothes?

433
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,520
Waist token?

434
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,360
No.

435
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,000
My lord.

436
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,720
We have searched the city

437
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,830
for hours

438
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,820
but couldn't find Yun Yi.

439
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,340
Is it possible that Yun Yi has...

440
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,070
Impossible.

441
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,610
We have arranged our men

442
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,720
at the city gate.

443
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,400
He can't escape.

444
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,130
I'll take our men to

445
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,630
nose around the city.

446
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,610
We must catch him.

447
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,540
Be quick.

448
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Yes.

449
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,230
My lord, where are you going?

450
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,830
My lord,

451
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,040
[Shen Yan]

452
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,040
[The commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard]

453
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,040
[No.128]

454
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,460
Shen Yan,

455
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,900
Princess,

456
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,570
His Highness is back.

457
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,340
He asked you to go over.

458
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,480
Got it.

459
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,180
Kneel down!

460
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,240
Apologize to your mother.

461
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,780
My mother?

462
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,910
My mother died long ago.

463
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,280
Your Highness.

464
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,780
Ling is still young.

465
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,440
Don't make it hard for her.

466
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,620
Mother.

467
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,920
She hit you first.

468
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,260
Why are you still protecting her?

469
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
She's the one who was wrong.

470
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,930
Xiang, shut up.

471
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,030
I told you not to tell your father.

472
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,850
Why didn't you listen to me?

473
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,830
You made your eldest sister scolded by your father.

474
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,830
Are you happy now?

475
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,720
Mother.

476
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,900
-I'll beat you! -Enough!

477
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,780
Father.

478
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,430
Is this what you want to see?

479
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,260
Make it quick,

480
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,590
or I'm going to sleep.

481
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,030
Your Highness.

482
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,430
Mother.

483
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,060
I'll say it again.

484
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,950
Apologize to your mother.

485
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,250
My mother

486
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,310
died long ago.

487
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,420
Princess.

488
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
You knew that His Highness would hit you hard.

489
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,920
Why did you

490
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,430
talk back to him?

491
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,230
Alright.

492
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,850
Don't be sad.

493
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,580
I know you care about me.

494
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,930
Ling Bi,

495
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,410
I want to be alone for a while.

496
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,450
You can leave now.

497
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,620
Be careful.

498
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,190
Come here.

499
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,940
Be careful.

500
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,860
Come here.

501
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,980
His Highness locked her inside,

502
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,820
and the new princess didn't let her eat and drink.

503
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,000
She's still so young.

504
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,130
How can she get by?

505
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,700
Shen Yan.

506
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,670
Lord Shen is so unusual.

507
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,240
You turned me down in the daytime

508
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,860
and escaped from the window.

509
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,630
At midnight,

510
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,370
you jumped over my window.

511
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,730
You are really in a good mood, huh?

512
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,410
You should know

513
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,130
why I came here.

514
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,260
Why?

515
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,110
Give it to me.

516
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,450
I mean waist token.

517
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,690
Waist token?

518
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,500
What token?

519
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,870
I don't know.

520
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,520
I've never seen it.

521
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,310
If you haven't seen it,

522
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,389
how did you know

523
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,489
my name?

524
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,139
It’s a gift from His Majesty.

525
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,310
Please give it back.

526
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,050
I said no.

527
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,610
If you don't believe me,

528
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,639
you can search me.

529
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,469
See? It's not here.

530
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,440
Shen Yan,

531
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,719
What are you doing?

532
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,550
Are you trying to

533
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,960
do bad things to me while searching?

534
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,020
You worry too much.

535
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,590
I just want you

536
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,480
to stop moving.

537
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,710
If you don't hand over my waist token,

538
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,850
don't blame me for being rude.

539
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm a princess.

540
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,719
How dare you!

541
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,550
Give me my waist token,

542
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,739
and I'll free you.

543
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,350
[Yang Ye]

544
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,350
[Princess Changle's bodyguard]

545
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,920
Help!

546
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,510
Help!

547
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,160
Shen Yan, you bully me!

548
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,350
I said I didn't see your token

549
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,190
and I meant it.

550
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,810
I won't give it to you even if I have it.

551
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,820
Help!

552
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,020
Anyone helps me?

553
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,580
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

554
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,320
If you insist on

555
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
not returning my token,

556
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,900
I will

557
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,490
come for it another day.

558
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
This medicine

559
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,240
will help you recover.

560
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,130
Stop chasing.

561
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,750
How is the investigation

562
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,150
I asked you to do going on?

563
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,270
I've found out.

564
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,470
Shen Yan came to Jiangzhou

565
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,750
to catch the criminal

566
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,630
and go back to Yejing for trial.

567
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,040
Yejing?

568
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,860
Next,

569
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,570
keep an eye on Jiangzhou Jin Lin Military Camp.

570
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,420
I want to know everything

571
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,500
about Lord Shen.

572
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,440
Shen Yan.

573
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,500
Yun Yi.

574
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,700
You're taking such a big step.

575
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,120
Aren't you afraid of hurting your crotch?

576
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,950
Under the order of the Crown Prince,

577
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,940
we are here to arrest you.

578
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,140
Surrender yourself.

579
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,620
You Jinlin lackey!

580
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,190
how dare you!

581
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,040
Array!

582
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,510
Back off!

583
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,700
Run!

584
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,390
Why not keep running?

585
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,780
Take him down!

586
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,610
What happened?

587
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,470
Lord Shen.

588
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,190
We meet again.

589
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,290
Holy crap!

590
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,550
The carriage is stuck!

591
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,140
Your Highness, the carriage is stuck.

592
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,730
Give me my crossbow.

593
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,790
Lord Shen.

594
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,950
Why not keep moving?

595
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,500
What's wrong?

596
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Just one word.

597
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,850
Don't use

598
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,280
your crossbow anymore.

599
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,290
You're afraid I'll hurt people?

600
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,730
Your raised your arms too low,

601
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,300
and shoot too late.

602
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,250
Anyway,

603
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,210
you're a bad shooter.

604
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,080
It's embarrassing

605
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,850
to show off.

606
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,780
Are you escorting the prisoners

607
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,090
to Yejing?

608
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,480
What a coincidence!

609
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,550
I'm going to Yejing, too.

610
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,350
I think

611
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,980
what you just said makes sense.

612
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,920
The bandits are rampant in the mountain,

613
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,670
and I'm such an incapable shooter.

614
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,570
So I might need you

615
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,100
to protect me along the way.

616
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,680
It’s a long journey to escort the prisoners.

617
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,760
I'm afraid you...

618
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,390
Help!

619
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,160
Lord Shen!

620
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,950
Help!

621
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,650
Something seems wrong

622
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,940
with the Princess’s horse.

623
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,000
I'll go take a look.

624
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,940
Help, Lord Shen!

625
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,590
Lord Shen, help me!

626
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,400
Lord Shen!

627
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,700
Help!

628
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,120
Lord Shen, help me!

629
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,900
Give me my waist token.

630
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,430
Help me!

631
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,900
No!

632
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,040
Are you sure?

633
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,260
No!

634
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,940
There's no one here.

635
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,150
If I let your horse

636
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,140
keep going wild,

637
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,780
you'll have to resign yourself to the fate.

638
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,530
Really?
