[Episode 5]

4
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,380
-What is it doing? -What are you doing?

5
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,130
Stop running.

6
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,390
Where are you going?

7
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,830
Little Lord.

8
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,940
What are you digging?

9
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,940
What is it doing?

10
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,470
Did anyone put food in here?

11
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,060
Be good, Little Lord.

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,979
Here.

13
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,980
Little Lord.

14
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,530
Gunpowder.

15
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,170
Be good.

16
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,000
This gunpowder...

17
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,400
This really shows that

18
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,480
a wise goose never lays a tame egg.

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,780
Lord Shen,

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,560
I found something.

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,690
Shen Yan,

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,640
be careful.

23
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,390
Don't forget your promise.

24
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,130
Yang Ye,

25
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,380
you stay here to help Lord Shen

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,690
guard the camp tonight.

27
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,140
Sure.

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
Lord Shen,

29
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,660
the gunpowder was found

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,120
outside the princess's room by Little Lord.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,610
I think the only person

32
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,829
who can do such a thing

33
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,260
under our noses

34
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,060
is Mr. Lu.

35
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,010
The dose of the gunpowder is so small.

36
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,220
Did he

37
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,690
bury a firecracker?

38
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,900
Lord Shen,

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
what do you think?

40
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,970
It's a diversion plan.

41
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,380
-Number Seven. -Yes.

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,260
Give me the map.

43
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,700
Here.

44
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,610
Our Liaison Office

45
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,150
is against a cliff,

46
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,820
so it is easy to defend but hard to attack.

47
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,690
If the incomings want to break into the camp,

48
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,750
they must attack from the front gate.

49
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,930
The gunpowder is buried

50
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,340
outside the princess's room.

51
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,800
The gunpowder is not much.

52
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,860
But in the chaos,

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
once it's ignited

54
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,540
in the case that the enemy is more than us

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,020
and we don't know their strength,

56
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,260
we wouldn't be able to attend to everything at once.

57
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,860
When the cell is unguarded,

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,540
it will be the best time for them

59
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,620
to break in and kill him.

60
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,790
Don't forget that

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,980
they only have one purpose,

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,900
to kill Yi Yun.

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,930
♫ The river water is still... ♫

64
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,020
Your voice is like a bell

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,950
-And your face is rosy. -Lord Shen.

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,340
You must be having a good time

67
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,620
these days.

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,820
♫ It makes... ♫

69
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,730
The people behind you

70
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,880
will take action tonight.

71
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,480
If you have any last words,

72
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,530
you can tell me now.

73
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,220
Shen Yan,

74
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,540
don't worry about me.

75
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,600
Even if you and your men outside

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,730
are all dead,

77
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,140
I'll still be fine.

78
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,220
You are so sure

79
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,260
about life and death.

80
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,860
What you are betting on is

81
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,750
not the code of the brotherhood

82
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,300
but what they want

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
that is in your hands.

84
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,150
If I'm right,

85
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,020
your bargaining chip

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,110
is not only the silver

87
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,230
lost from the Jiangzhou Treasury,

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,010
but also the evidence of the ringleader

89
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,740
behind the Crime in Jiangzhou.

90
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,140
Stern-faced Yama,

91
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,150
you are really smart like a ghost!

92
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,220
Now,

93
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,470
do you still think

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,110
I will die here?

95
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,380
Of course.

96
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,320
The silver and the evidence

97
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,550
are both objects that can't speak.

98
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,550
After they kill you,

99
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,580
they can

100
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,370
find these objects slowly.

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,730
However,

102
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,020
as long as you stay alive,

103
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,100
you are their biggest hidden trouble.

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
I get it.

105
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,210
On one hand, you trapped me here

106
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,040
to attract the ringleader behind the Crime in Jiangzhou

107
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
to kill me.

108
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,940
On the other hand,

109
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,970
you also force me to give you the evidence

110
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,630
through this way.

111
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,530
What a series of schemes!

112
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,580
Shen yan,

113
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,540
you're really a good strategist.

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,760
Thank you, sir,

115
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,310
for the compliment.

116
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,740
If I help you,

117
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,730
can you spare my life?

118
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,350
Honestly,

119
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,370
robbing the treasury sliver,

120
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,700
is a capital crime.

121
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,620
Even if you survive today,

122
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,600
you will still be executed

123
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,520
when you are sent back to Yeijing.

124
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,700
But I can promise that

125
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,100
if you can help me find out

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,560
the one behind this crime,

127
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,020
even if you die,

128
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,580
you won't have to

129
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,700
take the blame for someone else.

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,480
Good talk about the capital crime!

131
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,510
If so,

132
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,140
I don't want you to win either.

133
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,260
Aren't you going to help me

134
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,909
clean my name?

135
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,740
Fine.

136
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,260
You can wait

137
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,659
and do that

138
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,330
after I die.

139
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:43,980
Alright?

140
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,350
Here you are.

141
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,140
You flunky Jinlin Guard!

142
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,140
As long as I'm alive,

143
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,130
you won't know anything from me.

144
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,100
Don't you want the evidence?

145
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,970
Fine.

146
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,020
Go ask my dead body for it.

147
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,900
Young Master, you've only been here a few days,

148
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,030
but you already know

149
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,650
everything about this Liaison Office

150
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,890
so well.

151
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,430
I admire you so much!

152
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,980
Unfortunately,

153
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
Princess Changle

154
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,470
was just engaged to you.

155
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,070
But she has committed adultery with Shen Yan now.

156
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,350
This betrothed

157
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,110
is not good enough for you.

158
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,840
It doesn't matter if Liu Ling cheats on me or not.

159
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,539
It's just an engagement.

160
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,539
As long as it doesn't affect

161
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,940
our family's interests,

162
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,090
I can sacrifice anything.

163
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,669
As far as I know,

164
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,080
Shen Yan is also an experienced commander

165
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,740
who has won many real battles.

166
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,260
If he knows

167
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,100
your plan

168
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,800
and leads the army to defend,

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
what should we do?

170
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Have you

171
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,640
heard of these words?

172
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,410
The fake

173
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,190
can also become real.

174
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,130
Number Seven,

175
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,180
why are you nervous?

176
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,970
Shut up!

177
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm not nervous.

178
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,970
I just miss my wife.

179
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,920
Your Highness,

180
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
will they be alright?

181
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Lord Shen is here.

182
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,470
It will be fine.

183
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,670
Kill them.

184
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,110
Your Highness.

185
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,380
Shen Yan is here.

186
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,190
We will definitely be fine.

187
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,090
When the enemy comes,

188
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,470
you stay in Yun Yi's room

189
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,750
and wait to catch them.

190
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,260
Damn it!

191
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,780
We fell into the trap of the Stern-faced Yama.

192
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,320
You don't have to pretend to be strong.

193
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,530
If someone wants to hurt you,

194
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,860
you can tell me.

195
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,980
Shen...

196
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,190
Shen Yan.

197
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,710
Let her go!

198
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,460
It's not up to you now.

199
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,850
Let her go!

200
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,380
Put down the sword.

201
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,780
Shen Yan,

202
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,320
leave me alone.

203
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,780
Go!

204
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,010
Put it down.

205
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,030
If you are a real men,

206
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,420
don't hurt a woman.

207
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,980
Shen Yan,

208
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,800
if you want to save her,

209
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,980
give me your life for exchange.

210
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,580
Fine.

211
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
I'll use my life

212
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,700
to exchange for hers.

213
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,700
Shen Yan,

214
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,630
I don't need your help.

215
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,640
Go!

216
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,630
Go away!

217
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,860
Stop!

218
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,859
The Stern-faced Yama

219
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,190
would sacrifice his life

220
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,740
for a woman.

221
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,180
I've changed my mind now.

222
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,390
If you want to save her,

223
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,619
kneel down.

224
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,140
No!

225
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,369
♫ The night is not spent yet as affection spreads far and wide ♫

226
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,339
No!

227
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,700
Shen Yan!

228
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,940
No!

229
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,780
No!

230
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,260
♫ Never expect to savor the taste of life ♫

231
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,890
I told you to kneel!

232
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,780
Let her go!

233
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,060
Shen Yan,

234
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:41,160
♫ How lucky I am to have you around ♫

235
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,590
Shen Yan,

236
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:51,470
♫ Night and day, we stay together. Never forget each other ♫

237
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,670
Shen Yan,

238
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,400
Aren't you the commander

239
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,020
of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard?

240
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,470
Aren't you capable of anything?

241
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,260
Listen!

242
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:59,110
♫ The red candle lights up the road we've been through ♫

243
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,700
If you die,

244
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,730
it's all because of yourself.

245
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,100
You are a loser.

246
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,950
You are

247
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,330
a good-for-nothing loser.

248
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,420
Go to hell!

249
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:06,940
♫ I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

250
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,940
Go!

251
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,370
♫ Wherever I go, if you can't go with me ♫

252
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,040
♫ I'll take a curtain call of my free will ♫

253
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:22,980
♫ I wish you all the best and I give you all my heart ♫

254
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,580
Liu Ling!

255
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,180
Mom,

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,670
you sang, "grow old along with me, the best is yet to be."

257
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,820
What does it mean?

258
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,140
The lyrics refer to

259
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,160
what all women in this world

260
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,370
wish for.

261
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,460
One day,

262
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,080
when my little girl grows up,

263
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,240
you will also meet a man,

264
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,680
a handsome and brave man.

265
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,170
He will love you and protect you.

266
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,780
He will treasure you

267
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,880
more than his life.

268
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,060
He will hold your hand

269
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,110
and grow old together with you.

270
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,640
Then, you will never

271
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,630
feel lonely.

272
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,910
Brother Luo,

273
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,390
I've checked everything.

274
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,230
Other than the dead,

275
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,890
there are no clues left for us.

276
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Okay.

277
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,850
They were really careful.

278
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,670
Brother Luo,

279
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,660
this thief is dead.

280
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,060
How do we report our failures

281
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,650
to the Emperor and the Crown Prince.

282
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,930
Seal this room.

283
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,670
Leave the bodies here.

284
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,500
Listen up.

285
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,690
The news of his death

286
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,940
and even the smell of the dead

287
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,670
can't be spread to the outside.

288
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,850
We'll wait for Lord Shen to come back

289
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,060
to decide all these things.

290
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,860
-Yes. -Yes.

291
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
There has just been trouble in the camp.

292
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,260
Why are you here now

293
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,740
instead of

294
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,700
staying in your own room?

295
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm waiting.

296
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,210
Waiting?

297
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,860
It seems that, Mr. Lu,

298
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,640
you really care

299
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
about the situation inside.

300
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,380
Is it because that you know

301
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,900
Yun Yi is still alive?

302
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,620
Then you can't sleep well

303
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,160
and come here to wait for him to die.

304
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,020
Just a few bandits.

305
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,300
Whether they are dead or alive is none of my business.

306
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,550
What I care about

307
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,690
is my betrothed,

308
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,780
Princess Changle’s safety.

309
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,140
Princess Changle

310
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,660
is protected by Lord Shen

311
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,400
and certainly will be safe.

312
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,700
Mr. Lu,

313
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,930
these are not your business.

314
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,260
You're right.

315
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,120
After all, compared to you, Captain Luo,

316
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,740
my worries

317
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,420
are nothing.

318
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
What do you mean?

319
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
You, the Jinlin Guard,

320
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
are responsible for protecting the princess.

321
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,060
If Shen Yan

322
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,320
can bring the princess back

323
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,870
safely,

324
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,910
it will be fine.

325
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm just afraid that if he acts rashly

326
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,290
and dies outside,

327
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,140
you will be blamed eventually,

328
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,050
Captain Luo.

329
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,210
Bullshit!

330
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,780
Think about it.

331
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,080
If the princess was killed

332
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,940
and the prisoner

333
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,010
was lost,

334
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,220
what will happen when the news reaches Yejing?

335
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,820
It's good to be dead by then.

336
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,140
I'm afraid that

337
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,720
you pawns who survive

338
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,250
will have worse endings

339
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,770
due to the Emperor's wrath.

340
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,140
Lu Mingshan!

341
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,510
Stop talking nonsense.

342
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,570
I meant well.

343
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,460
If you don't appreciate it,

344
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,320
just forget it.

345
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
As they say

346
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,390
when words get sour,

347
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
adding words is useless.

348
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,080
I'll just go back to my room and wait for the news.

349
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,680
Shen Yan,

350
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
if you want to save her,

351
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,340
give me your life for exchange.

352
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,940
Fine.

353
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,730
I'll use my life

354
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,980
to exchange hers.

355
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,690
I've changed my mind now.

356
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,960
If you want to save her,

357
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,130
kneel down.

358
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,440
You're awake.

359
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,990
Your wound...

360
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,470
It's okay.

361
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,810
I saw a cave ahead.

362
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,210
We can

363
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,580
have a rest there.

364
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,220
Let's go.

365
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,630
Don't be afraid.

366
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,740
I'm here.

367
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,250
Watch your step.

368
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,600
Be careful.

369
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,130
You can have a rest here now.

370
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,000
What about you?

371
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,210
Stay with me.

372
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,760
I'll guard outside.

373
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,020
Shen Yan, stop!

374
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,980
You saved me

375
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,330
and took care of me.

376
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,340
You blew hot and cold

377
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,310
with me.

378
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,660
Did I do something wrong that offended you

379
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,790
or made you unhappy?

380
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,260
You and me

381
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,040
just met by chance.

382
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,300
How could you offend me?

383
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,770
You protected me with your life.

384
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,020
Is that what you called meeting by chance?

385
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
That's my duty.

386
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,420
You don't need to care about that.

387
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,040
Did you save me

388
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,500
only because of your duty?

389
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,300
Shen Yan.

390
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,500
I have to find the way up the mountain first.

391
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,460
You're injured.

392
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,200
I'll leave.

393
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,990
Listen.

394
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,740
I don't believe a word you said.

395
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,020
But for the things you did for me,

396
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,660
I will remember

397
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,600
all of them.

398
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,710
I order you

399
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,640
to rest here now.

400
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,770
I'll guard outside.

401
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,100
Little fool.

402
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,380
Brother Luo,

403
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,140
we are all very worried.

404
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,290
Could you stop walking back and forth?

405
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,070
Brother Luo,

406
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,530
stop it, please.

407
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,340
You make me nervous.

408
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,020
Do you think,

409
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,900
according to Lord Shen's normal speed,

410
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
he should have come back last night.

411
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,820
It's now another day later.

412
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,440
We still haven't seen him.

413
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,810
Do you think

414
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,950
he's in danger?

415
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,740
Nonsense!

416
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,630
What are you saying?

417
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,440
Fine, forget it.

418
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,660
You two stay here and guard the camp.

419
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,260
The rest of you, follow me to find him.

420
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,790
Let's go.

421
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,660
Guard Yang, let's...

422
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,190
Let's go.

423
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,740
Guard Yang.

424
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,020
Good morning, Young Master.

425
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,800
Morning.

426
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,300
It was a tough battle last night.

427
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,900
Thank you for your hard work.

428
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,860
Well done!

429
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,940
Yong Master, you are fine now.

430
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,500
The Stern-faced Yama, Shen Yan,

431
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,820
must have been killed.

432
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,860
The Stern-faced Yama?

433
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,410
Nothing more than a name.

434
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,430
He was stabbed by me last night

435
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,310
and fell off the cliff

436
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,490
with that wicked girl.

437
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,660
I'll ask two men

438
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,980
to search under the cliff now.

439
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,460
After we find their bodies,

440
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,260
I'll come back and report to you.

441
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,110
Help me!

442
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,910
Help me!

443
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,560
Help me!

444
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,660
Help!

445
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,690
Help me!

446
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,490
Lord Shen.

447
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,710
It's you.

448
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,930
It's getting late.

449
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,770
Go back early.

450
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,640
No.

451
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,170
Seeing such a beautiful view

452
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,460
with you

453
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,420
is just like an immortal couple in the wonderland.

454
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,740
An immortal couple?

455
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,620
I've never seen that before.

456
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,300
But there are many wolves and leopards

457
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,540
in the mountain.

458
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,130
Aren't you afraid?

459
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,410
No.

460
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,420
With you,

461
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,010
I'm not afraid of anything.

462
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,420
I'm afraid.

463
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,820
Lord Shen,

464
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,180
I picked up some fruits.

465
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,660
You're injured.

466
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,930
The fruits can stop the bleeding.

467
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,120
Maybe it's good for your wound.

468
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,100
Later,

469
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,940
I'll light some bonfire

470
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,760
and cook these fruits.

471
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,750
You can taste the delicacies

472
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,510
facing the beautiful view.

473
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,580
It is finally worth

474
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,940
my hard work.

475
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,850
Unexpectedly,

476
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,820
you can make a fire and cook.

477
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,610
Of course.

478
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,520
I learned it from the chef

479
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,140
of the Dingbei Duke Mansion.

480
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,860
This is the secret cooking method they taught me.

481
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,340
BBQ fruits.

482
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,320
But before making a fire,

483
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,310
I need to borrow a thing

484
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,390
from you.

485
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,210
What are you looking for?

486
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,360
The lighter.

487
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,080
It's here.

488
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,100
Seeing

489
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,370
you are fully dressed,

490
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,660
I was wondering

491
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,590
what you used to bandage the wound.

492
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,980
Until I was looking for the lighter just now,

493
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,020
I didn't realise

494
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,300
you had used your underwear

495
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,740
to bandage the wound.

496
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,460
[Xu Mansion]

497
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,650
Here.

498
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:50,900
Master.

499
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,200
[Yun Yi is died, Liu and Shen are missing.]

500
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,680
It's just sent by the Ghost.

501
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,740
Look at it.

502
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,940
The situation about the Crime in Jiangzhou has changed a lot.

503
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,460
You'd better

504
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,060
go to the imperial palace

505
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,060
and tell this

506
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,659
to the Crown Prince.

507
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,850
Go to ask if there is

508
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,350
any room for negotiation.

509
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,300
I'll have a carriage prepared for you now.

510
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,860
Grandpa,

511
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,500
about this,

512
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,520
please give me a little more time.

513
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,040
Are you...

514
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,179
Are you

515
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,060
going to keep this under wraps?

516
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,420
Yes.

517
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,060
Girl,

518
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,980
in this situation,

519
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,820
the Crown Prince's trust in you

520
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,820
is the only thing you can rely on now.

521
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,310
You can't lose it.

522
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,380
Our family has been wronged for many years.

523
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,900
If we can't clear our name this time,

524
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,630
we can wait for the next chance.

525
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,570
We have patience,

526
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,670
but the Crown Prince

527
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,600
has run out of it.

528
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,340
The Crown Prince seems to care about

529
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,800
our family's grievances,

530
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,790
but in fact,

531
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,470
it's just an excuse for him.

532
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,540
Grandpa, as wise as you are,

533
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,750
you must have thought of this already.

534
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,060
Indeed, only we care about

535
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,060
how to clean our name.

536
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,540
What the Crown Prince wants

537
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,620
is only the silver

538
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,470
missing in Jiangzhou.

539
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,100
I know

540
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,690
all of this.

541
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,120
But my little girl,

542
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,760
Yun Yi is died already.

543
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,240
It can't be

544
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,080
kept under wraps forever.

545
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,620
If you want to hide it,

546
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,130
how many days can it be?

547
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,220
To be honest,

548
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,530
I don't know either.

549
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,030
Now, we can only keep it under wraps as long as possible,

550
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,630
and then plan what to do next.

551
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,950
Even if it will finally be known by them,

552
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,620
we can still waiting for a chance

553
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,260
during these days.

554
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,160
You are so calm

555
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,100
at such a young age.

556
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,540
It's just like

557
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,450
your father died innocently.

558
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,460
It is unfair.

559
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,860
It's always the good people paying the price

560
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,990
and the bad guys being let off the hook.

561
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,100
If Ling really died because of that,

562
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,980
I will

563
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,740
make the Family Lu

564
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,660
pay for this.

565
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,610
Shen Yan,

566
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,860
I can't light it.

567
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,890
Help me.

568
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,040
Do it yourself.

569
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,210
Cheapskate.

570
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,310
It's on fire.

571
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,850
You look at me like this.

572
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,820
Do you have another evil idea

573
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,550
on your mind?

574
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,430
♫ With time flying by ♫

575
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,230
Yes.

576
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,790
♫ We sometimes laugh, sometimes sigh ♫

577
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,620
I'm thinking of spending the rest of my life with you and never parting from you.

578
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,050
Is that an evil idea?

579
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,960
♫ It seems we don't care about anything ♫

580
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,100
♫ But we can't hide from the fateful meeting ♫

581
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,980
♫ Everything else is just passing ♫

582
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,800
♫ I'm so lucky as your love is undying ♫

583
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,110
You think too much.

584
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,580
♫ We can't be parted, even if we're at the end of the earth ♫

585
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,540
♫ The only thing I'm sure of is this truth ♫

586
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,690
♫ Never ask for forever, just for days and nights ♫

587
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,220
♫ With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything ♫

588
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,260
♫ Your eyes are smiling, is it because you know I'm missing? ♫

589
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,200
♫ We already knew what each other was thinking ♫

590
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,270
♫ Never ask for forever, just for days and nights ♫

591
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,500
♫ I come to you, across the sea and mountains ♫

592
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,780
♫ No more words, no more explanations ♫

593
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,420
♫ I have understood your unspoken promise ♫

594
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,180
Stand up.

595
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,330
No.

596
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,890
You're on my wound.
