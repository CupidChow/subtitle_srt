[Episode 3]

4
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,740
But Lord Shen.

5
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,660
We were having such a good time

6
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,090
a moment ago.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,100
Why did you become so cold,

8
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,610
right after Mr. Lu came?

9
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,979
Could it be...

10
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,259
that you're jealous?

11
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,930
Let's go, Ling Bi.

12
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,080
Your Highness.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,740
What did Lord Shen mean by that?

14
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,380
He's brushing me off.

15
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,170
But I

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,530
wouldn't brush him off.

17
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,150
He's my beloved one.

18
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,240
He deserves to be treated carefully.

19
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,000
Yang Ye.

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,470
Yes.

21
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,110
Let's go.

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,590
Well...

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,030
Why did she leave suddenly?

24
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,140
I have no idea.

25
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,360
Where do you think

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,950
her Highness is going?

27
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,790
Lord Shen.

28
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,500
Lu Mingshan, son of Lord Lu.

29
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,780
Did you know him?

30
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,490
What would happen if I do?

31
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,660
What if...

32
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,030
I don't know him?

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,600
He's here.

34
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,780
In my opinion,

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,630
this person is up to no good.

36
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,090
What do you think?

37
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,370
I have no contact with Family Lu.

38
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,630
Him being here

39
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,620
has nothing to do with me.

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,510
It better be.

41
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,900
Otherwise,

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,850
you won’t be able to get to Yejing alive.

43
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,550
Princess,

44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,630
what are we doing?

45
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,200
Waiting for someone.

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Waiting for someone?

47
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,780
For whom?

48
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,330
Look, your Highness.

49
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,280
Is it him?

50
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,670
He looks like

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,460
he's been starving for days.

52
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,240
It's not him.

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,120
Give him some silver.

54
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,440
Here.

55
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,990
This is from our Princess.

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,220
Thank you. Thank you.

57
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,490
Your Highness.

58
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,070
Is it him?

59
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,350
He's like a cow chewing peony.

60
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,260
He can't tell good food

61
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,900
from bad for sure.

62
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Not him.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,060
My lady.

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,590
Is this the place?

65
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,860
Yes.

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,810
It's him.

67
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,210
When will you bring me to try it?

68
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,450
How about tomorrow?

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,720
I've been waiting for you.

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,330
W-Waiting for me.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,250
How dare you?

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,010
How dare you lie to me and cheat on me?

73
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,940
I just wanted to ask him something.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,150
Where is the best restaurant

75
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,880
around here?

76
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,240
Restaurant?

77
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,300
My lady.

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,060
The Xichun House is the best.

79
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,040
Xichun House?

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,630
Chef.

81
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,510
I want all

82
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,210
the best dishes you've got.

83
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,710
If the food tastes good,

84
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,410
the Princess will reward you.

85
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,160
She won't be disappointed.

86
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,220
Tofu Skin Spinach Rolls.

87
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,000
It can increase your appetite

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,130
and help digestion.

89
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,000
Reward him.

90
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,910
Mianyang Steam.

91
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,180
Fresh, tender and soft.

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,240
Fat but not greasy.

93
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,510
I like this one.

94
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,510
Reward him again.

95
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,420
Fried cabbage.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,530
It can strengthen your bones

97
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,860
and soothe your organs.

98
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,800
-So many food. -Awesome.

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Reward him again.

100
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,040
Great.

101
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,730
That's a lot.

102
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,570
So much food.

103
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,350
So much...

104
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,670
I've never had

105
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,870
something like this.

106
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,710
I've never seen...

107
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,150
Look at all the dishes.

108
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,220
His lordship said he wanted to have dinner.

109
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,580
The Princess then

110
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,270
invited the best chef in town.

111
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,440
You are right.

112
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,210
Everyone will envy him.

113
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,650
Guys,

114
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,930
that's some benefits we got

115
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,150
following Lord Shen.

116
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,170
Hear, hear.

117
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,780
Luo.

118
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,920
Look at this one.

119
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,600
It looks so delicious.

120
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,410
Yes.

121
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,360
It looks so good.

122
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,110
And so green.

123
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,830
Speaking of green,

124
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,360
who is as green as that Mr. Green?

125
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,630
Why are you all standing?

126
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,900
Have a seat and eat with me.

127
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
-Thank you, Your Highness. -Thank you so much.

128
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,060
Ling Bi.

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,940
Go ask Lord Shen to join us.

130
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,490
Yes.

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
This seat is saved for Lord Shen.

132
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,420
-Move. -Move.

133
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,470
Mr. Lu has sharp eyes.

134
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,840
When Lord Shen comes,

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,630
he won't be able to eat under your watchful eyes.

136
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,270
Luo Fan.

137
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,680
Block it.

138
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Go.

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,870
Go. Go.

140
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,460
Hurry up. Let's go.

141
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,090
Your Highness.

142
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,940
I've got wind of

143
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,900
people talking in Yejing.

144
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,980
They said that Yun Yi, the prime culprit

145
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,340
behind Jiangzhou Treasury Silver Robbery

146
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,700
has been captured by Jinlin Guard

147
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,180
sent by your Highness.

148
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,100
Is that true?

149
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,260
Shen Yan did mention this capture

150
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,040
in the letter he sent to me.

151
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,290
Your Highness is very decisive and effective.

152
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,550
It's a blessing for the people of Wei.

153
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,200
[Lord Xu]

154
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,130
I'd like to propose a toast

155
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,570
to your Highness.

156
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,270
I wish your Highness every success!

157
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,370
I wish your Highness every success!

158
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,380
You are all indispensable

159
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,690
to the Wei.

160
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,580
Please feel at home tonight.

161
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,780
Father appreciated your hard work.

162
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,150
You and I

163
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,850
will hold this banquet here in the Eastern Palace.

164
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,420
Let's not talk about national affairs tonight.

165
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,690
I want all of you to drink as much as you want.

166
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,820
And enjoy the night.

167
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,470
Cheers!

168
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

169
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,020
Did you hear that?

170
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,740
His Highness just mentioned

171
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,020
the name of the second son of Family Shen.

172
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,000
Seems like Lord Shen has a young successor.

173
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,760
You will not have to worry about your future.

174
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,670
[Lord Shen]

175
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,030
Lord Lu,

176
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,910
we are no match to him now.

177
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,890
Back then,

178
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,950
my son made a grave mistake

179
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,430
in the old Jiangzhou Case.

180
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,210
Our Xu Family also suffered because of this.

181
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,230
His Majesty is kind and generous.

182
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,220
He spared the lives

183
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,030
-of my family. -Your Highness.

184
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,420
For so many years,

185
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,260
I've been feeling uneasy.

186
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,650
I wonder...

187
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,980
His Highness ordered

188
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,740
to re-investigate this case.

189
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,760
Could there be more

190
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,120
than we saw of this case?

191
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,350
The only thing His Highness cares about

192
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,780
is the Treasury Silver

193
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,770
that went missing.

194
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,350
If there's indeed something more behind this case

195
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,960
that could clear the name of Family Xu.

196
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,620
That would be great.

197
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,750
But I'm afraid

198
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,760
that after investigating,

199
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,500
they didn't find anything.

200
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,940
Instead, after being solved

201
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,400
for so many years,

202
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,330
this case managed to get noticed by His Majesty.

203
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,510
By then,

204
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,840
I don't know

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,370
if it's a blessing or a curse for you, Lord Xu.

206
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,490
What do you think, Lord Shen?

207
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,240
As far as I'm concerned,

208
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,250
a blessing, a curse,

209
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
what will happen will happen.

210
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,480
Why are the three of us sitting here

211
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,570
speculating others for no reason?

212
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,840
I suggest

213
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,520
that we drink

214
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,750
as much as we can.

215
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,230
Come on. Bottoms up!

216
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,510
Cheers.

217
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,160
You're so thoughtful, Lord Lu.

218
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,350
But Yun Yi

219
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,140
was arrested

220
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,170
by the second son of the Family Shen.

221
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,420
The rumor

222
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,370
has been widely spread in Yejing.

223
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,500
A blessing, or a curse.

224
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,900
I'm afraid we'll find out soon.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,050
Why are you so worried, Lord Xu?

226
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,480
If I remembered correctly,

227
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,610
the Xu and Shen Family

228
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,780
almost became in-laws.

229
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,340
Why is this marriage

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,940
dropped afterwards?

231
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,820
I guess Miss Xu

232
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,570
must feel proud and superior.

233
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,540
Anyway,

234
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,460
although she didn't marry the young Lord Shen,

235
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,240
since she entered the Royal Palace,

236
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,300
she has made her way up to the Prince's side.

237
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,620
Remarkable skills.

238
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,410
From now on, the Crown Prince will support Family Xu.

239
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,260
Even if something bad happens,

240
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,190
Family Xu will be able to avoid bad luck,

241
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,740
and get a blessing instead of a curse.

242
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,010
She's just a court lady.

243
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,050
She can't be that lucky.

244
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,990
Speaking of which,

245
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,730
why didn't I see

246
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,710
your youngest son come to the banquet today?

247
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,100
He's just a son of a concubine.

248
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,500
I wouldn't count on him to be successful.

249
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,420
Well,

250
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,380
I heard that his betrothed,

251
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,630
Princess Changle is on her way to the Capital City.

252
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,700
He was ready early in the morning

253
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,200
and went outside of the city to wait for her.

254
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,660
Shen Yu,

255
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,560
what a thankless role you played.

256
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,030
These old foxes

257
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,620
fight against each other.

258
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,010
Now you are caught in the crossfire, too.

259
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,650
Such good liquor.

260
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,110
Now I have no appetite.

261
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,420
-Why isn't he here yet? -Is he coming?

262
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,160
Where is Lord Shen?

263
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,270
He said he's not hungry.

264
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,700
He's not eating tonight.

265
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,620
Come on, let's eat.

266
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,360
Stop.

267
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,190
Eat.

268
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,150
Go get me a lunch box.

269
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,300
This one.

270
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,420
This one.

271
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,540
And that one.

272
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,980
Come on...

273
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,420
Hurry up.

274
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,780
That one.

275
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,180
Your Highness.

276
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,710
-I don't want to hear it. -The lord doesn't...

277
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,710
Your Highness.

278
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
What should we do?

279
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,580
Should we eat first

280
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,600
or watch the drama first?

281
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,930
Are you stupid?

282
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,250
Of course we're eating while watching.

283
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,190
Come on.

284
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,010
You should have told me earlier.

285
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,250
Lord Shen.

286
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,980
Lord Shen.

287
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,070
Would you like to try the food?

288
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,190
They cooked so many delicious dishes.

289
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,790
You really don't want to try?

290
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,740
It smells so nice.

291
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,460
Do you want to try it?

292
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,740
It's mouthwatering.

293
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,860
Ling Bi, check the door.

294
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,080
Is the door locked?

295
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,040
Lord Shen.

296
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,900
I brought you some tasty

297
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,670
Eight Treasure Duck Gizzards,

298
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,000
Phoenix Tail Shark Fin,

299
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,350
Dried Scallops Balls,

300
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,950
Buddhist Hand Pork Rolls.

301
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,590
You scared me.

302
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,350
Your Highness,

303
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,140
you don't know yet, do you?

304
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,430
Lord Shen is different from us.

305
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
Different how?

306
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,240
Tell me.

307
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,510
Our Lord Shen

308
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,580
doesn't eat meat.

309
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,940
He's vegetarian.

310
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,020
Vegetarian?

311
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,140
He's a grown man.

312
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Why is he picky about food like a child?

313
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,940
You're right.

314
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,470
Vegetarian.

315
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,180
All the chicken, duck and fish.

316
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,290
Seems like we have to eat for Lord Shen.

317
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,200
Luo Fan,

318
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,860
you knew that

319
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,700
Lord Shen doesn't eat meat.

320
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,300
You deliberately

321
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,160
lied to our Princess, didn't you?

322
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,860
I...

323
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,780
Your Highness,

324
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,490
why do you bother so much

325
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,760
to please our lord?

326
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,300
You are already betrothed to a man.

327
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,940
Even if you go out alone,

328
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,610
you don't need to make it so wildly known.

329
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,890
Besides,

330
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,740
your future...

331
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,600
Mr. Green,

332
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,270
no,

333
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,490
Mr. Lu

334
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,640
is watching over there.

335
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,590
It's none of your business.

336
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,579
Ling.

337
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,579
Come with me. We need to talk.

338
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,910
Come.

339
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,339
-Let go. -Your Highness.

340
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,710
The young couple are talking.

341
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,079
Why are you interrupting?

342
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,920
No, you...

343
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,020
You are senseless.

344
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,760
Stop eating!

345
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,700
I...

346
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,300
Let go of me!

347
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,930
Come here.

348
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,620
Let go of me!

349
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,990
Come here.

350
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,590
Liu Ling.

351
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,210
Stop playing

352
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,590
and put an end to this farce!

353
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,990
You're not a kid anymore.

354
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,910
You should know

355
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,310
what our marriage means.

356
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
I don't.

357
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,440
I don't want to know either.

358
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,590
It doesn't matter if you don't want to know.

359
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,880
But let me tell you this,

360
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,750
this is not

361
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,970
just about the two of us.

362
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,430
This is about the House of Prince Guangping

363
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,830
and Family Lu. It's huge.

364
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,130
I respect you in front of everybody

365
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,230
because I like you,

366
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,110
and because I respect

367
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,170
Prince Guangping.

368
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,020
But if you keep

369
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,110
behaving like this,

370
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,140
the Lu family

371
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,160
will not treat you like before.

372
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,890
I won't be able to save you then.

373
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,350
Why are you laughing?

374
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,480
I'm laughing at you.

375
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,680
You keep talking about marriage

376
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,830
and something huge.

377
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,430
It's like you already have it all.

378
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,510
But in the end,

379
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,570
you don't even

380
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,250
know the woman you will marry.

381
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,220
It's okay.

382
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,380
Let me tell you this.

383
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,420
The favorite thing

384
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,300
Princess Changle likes to do

385
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,900
is to embarrass

386
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,230
those hypocrites

387
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,700
in front of everybody.

388
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,670
Liu Ling!

389
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,730
You really think you are so popular, don't you?

390
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,830
Well then you're wrong.

391
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,340
Other women at your age

392
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,640
are already married.

393
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,040
It's just my friendly advice.

394
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,270
If you miss this marriage

395
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,710
to Family Lu.

396
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,430
Even if you have this

397
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,310
Princess title,

398
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,070
you'll never ever get married.

399
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,900
So what?

400
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,750
The misfortune of women in the world

401
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,410
is mostly caused by marriage.

402
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,140
If I, Liu Ling,

403
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,350
can't find someone

404
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,660
I truly love,

405
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,980
I'd rather stay single forever.

406
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,940
Your Highness.

407
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,410
Sorry that I'm not feeling so well.

408
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,980
Please excuse me.

409
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,450
In that case,

410
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,630
Lord Lu,

411
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,590
you should leave and rest early.

412
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,050
Thank you, Your Highness.

413
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,160
Your Highness.

414
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,970
I think I caught a cold

415
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,120
and have a headache.

416
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,470
I think I'll take a leave from Your Highness.

417
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,670
I shall take my leave.

418
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,460
Jin.

419
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,030
If you really want to leave,

420
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,430
you can go back and rest.

421
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,500
But don't worry.

422
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,930
I will ask Lord Xu

423
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,280
to pay you a visit later.

424
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,430
Thank you for your understanding, Your Highness.

425
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,140
Court Lady Xu.

426
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,870
Go get His Highness' cloak.

427
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,950
The night is cold, and the wine is strong.

428
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,730
Don't let His Highness catch a cold.

429
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,460
Yes.

430
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,360
Also,

431
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,890
after getting the cloak,

432
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,830
prepare the Tai Qing Red Cloud Wine.

433
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,750
After a while,

434
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,130
His Highness will want to treat the lords

435
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,390
with something light.

436
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,980
Jin.

437
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,710
You are being so considerate of me.

438
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,760
How can I

439
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,300
let you go?

440
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,970
If that's the case,

441
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,630
I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

442
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,890
I'll take my leave.

443
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,740
Eunuch Li.

444
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,730
Send Lord Xu to the Eastern Palace.

445
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,630
Yes.

446
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,200
It's a small world, isn't it?

447
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,110
Did something bother you, Court Lady Xu?

448
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,640
That's why you're leaving.

449
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,070
Isn’t it the same for you, Lord Shen?

450
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,520
The wine in the Palace is good,

451
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,530
but drinking it,

452
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,730
can't make me happy.

453
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,800
Lord Shen is a simple person.

454
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,690
You need to be at ease while drinking.

455
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,220
The Palace makes one feel restrained.

456
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,520
No matter how good the wine is,

457
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,180
I'm afraid you can't taste it.

458
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,760
What an interpretation.

459
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,220
No wonder Court Lady Xu

460
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,550
can win over the Prince

461
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,460
and became so successful in the Eastern Palace.

462
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,270
It's just a small trick.

463
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,470
It's nothing impressive for Lord Shen.

464
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,570
I dare not disturb your good mood.

465
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,970
I shall take my leave.

466
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,820
It's hard to walk at night.

467
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,320
Court Lady Xu,

468
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,600
be careful.

469
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,070
Please don't let me bother you.

470
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm already used to it,

471
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,710
walking in the dark in the Palace.

472
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,030
My lord.

473
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,170
Lord Shen.

474
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,990
My lord.

475
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,060
You've been busy all day.

476
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,320
Have something to eat.

477
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,780
My lord.

478
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,970
Does the fish we're catching

479
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,770
really have something to do with the Family Lu?

480
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,420
I wasn't sure before.

481
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,080
After this whole Princess business,

482
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,410
I’m sure of it.

483
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,480
What do you mean?

484
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,620
Lu Mingshan is arrogant.

485
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,620
If he really came here

486
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,110
as the the future husband

487
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,940
of Princess,

488
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,100
after being humiliated by the Princess,

489
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,940
even he didn't dare cancel the engagement,

490
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,540
he should at least have left.

491
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,540
But now?

492
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,640
In order to stay in Liaison Office,

493
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,770
he doesn't care about his reputation.

494
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,940
So, my Lord.

495
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,040
you purposely didn't come out of your room today

496
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,050
to provoke Princess Changle?

497
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,820
Shen Yan.

498
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,020
Shen Yan, come out!

499
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,740
Shen Yan.

500
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,800
You...

501
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,210
Are you really not willing to see me?

502
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,140
My lord,

503
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,310
why don't you...

504
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,270
You really gonna ignore me?

505
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,950
Fine.

506
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,470
[Toilet]

507
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,750
Your Highness.

508
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,270
Fine.

509
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,430
I can't do it anymore.

510
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,620
Your Highness.

511
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,640
Luo.

512
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,330
Luo.

513
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,610
I can't hold it anymore.

514
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,340
Please go and beg her.

515
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,240
Why is it always me?

516
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,460
-I... -You're the most experienced with her.

517
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,720
Luo, please. I beg you.

518
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,190
Besides...

519
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,640
-We can't walk. -Go!

520
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,220
She...

521
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,580
Princess! Princess!

522
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,850
Please, Your Highness.

523
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,600
-What? -Please have mercy.

524
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,780
Please let us through.

525
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,220
I beg you.

526
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,110
What did I do?

527
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,340
What do you want?

528
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,600
Just one joss stick's time.

529
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,390
Just one joss stick, Your Highness.

530
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,100
After that,

531
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,020
I'll ask them to come out in time.

532
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,380
Yes.

533
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,300
We'll do whatever you want us to do.

534
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,700
I beg you, Your Highness.

535
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,170
You want to use the toilet?

536
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,130
One joss stick's time, two joss sticks' time.

537
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,210
I won't stop you

538
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,470
even if you sleep in there.

539
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,950
Fine.

540
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,440
But you need

541
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,300
to let me see Lord Shen first.

542
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,160
My goodness.

543
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,010
Princess, please don't whistle.

544
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,940
Stop whistling.

545
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,680
I can't hold it anymore.

546
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,430
I can't hold it anymore.

547
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,240
Come in.

548
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,180
My lord.

549
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
My lord, my good lord.

550
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,110
I beg you.

551
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,120
We really have no choice.

552
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,020
We can't stand it anymore.

553
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,260
Ignore her.

554
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,020
Just go to the toilet as usual.

555
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,070
How can we ignore her, my lord?

556
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,860
When we are in the toilet,

557
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,970
thinking that the Princess is outside...

558
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,780
W-Who can ignore her?

559
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,930
Then go outside.

560
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,870
Outside?

561
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,060
There hasn't been scented.

562
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,320
Those poisonous insects in the wild...

563
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,760
are d-

564
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,740
dangerous for a reason,

565
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,740
my lord.

566
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,170
Please, my good lord.

567
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
Please help us.

568
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,000
I can't...

569
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hurry up, my lord.

570
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,460
-Right here. -He's here.

571
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,690
My lord!

572
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,520
My lord! My lord! Help!

573
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,600
My lord.

574
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,420
Lord Shen is here.

575
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,760
Finally wanna see me?

576
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,820
Make way, Your Highness.

577
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Don't make things difficult for us.

578
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,170
No.

579
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,620
We haven't talked yet.

580
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,840
I can't leave.

581
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
You mean it?

582
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,810
Yes.

583
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,900
Then sorry in advance.

584
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,140
Your Highness.

585
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,770
I'll go first.

586
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,630
Your Highness.

587
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,070
Don't push. I'll go first.

588
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,140
Stop fighting!

589
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,190
I'm so close...

590
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,620
Stop!

591
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,670
It's late at night.

592
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,180
Now you locked me

593
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,500
in your room, Lord Shen.

594
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,420
For what?

595
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,400
For protecting others from your harassment,

596
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,170
I'm here

597
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,340
because I want to tell you

598
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,620
in person.

599
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,420
My engagement with Lu Mingshan

600
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,110
was made by Prince Guangping alone.

601
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,060
I don’t like him.

602
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,250
Nor will I marry him.

603
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,810
So,

604
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,100
are you relieved now?

605
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,600
Yes.

606
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,110
Whether you marry him or not is your business.

607
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,640
It has nothing to do with me.

608
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,700
Why should I not be relieved?

609
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,790
Shen Yan, you...

610
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,520
You don't trust me?

611
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,780
You know what?

612
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,150
If the princess doesn't leave,

613
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,030
we won't have one good day.

614
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,370
You're right.

615
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,070
Alright, Princess.

616
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,010
Go back.

617
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,060
Save all your tricks

618
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,310
for Yejing

619
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,410
and use them to your Mr. Lu.

620
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,210
My tricks

621
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,810
can’t be saved for Yejing.

622
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,260
Guards!

623
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,030
Let me out!

624
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,360
Lord Shen!

625
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,440
What are you doing, Lord Shen?

626
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
What?

627
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,890
-Let me out! -Lord Shen!

628
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,760
Y-You dare assault our princess!

629
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,820
I'm a Princess.

630
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,550
How could you lock me

631
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,630
in your room?

632
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,260
-Your Highness! -Lord Shen!

633
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,040
Lord Shen.

634
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,000
Why did you blow out the candles?

635
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,840
Help!

636
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,220
Help!

637
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,020
Guard Yang.

638
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,860
Don't shout.

639
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,740
What's going on?

640
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,690
Y-Your lord

641
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,090
assaulted our Princess!

642
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,300
Nonsense.

643
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,390
-Don't talk nonsense. -Yeah.

644
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,580
I'm telling the truth!

645
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,790
What are you talking about?

646
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,210
-Our lord is not that kind of person. -Stop, Lord Shen!

647
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,770
How do you know what kind of person he is?

648
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,900
You're bullying me!

649
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,740
Lord Shen,

650
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,420
why did you

651
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
lock me up in here?

652
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,280
Lord Shen.

653
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,240
Don't come over!

654
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,540
Lord Shen!

655
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,540
Liu Ling.

656
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,790
Are you out of your mind?

657
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,820
You don't believe me.

658
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,730
Of course I have to prove it to you.

659
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,270
People will talk.

660
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,840
Before I'm in Yejing,

661
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,570
you will be mine.

662
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,180
Are you threatening me?

663
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,670
What if I am?

664
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,880
Help!

665
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,400
Is anyone here?

666
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,480
Help!

667
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,210
Shen Yan.

668
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Why did you stop yelling, Princess?

669
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,390
I will yell.

670
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,420
Since you are determined

671
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,830
to get involved with me,

672
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,500
I’ll make it clear.

673
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,440
We are not the same kind of people.

674
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,900
Right now,

675
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,350
maybe you want to make things difficult for me,

676
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,390
or

677
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,190
maybe you just want to have fun.

678
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,690
But I’m not an easy person.

679
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,850
Once I think you're The One,

680
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,600
I will be yours

681
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,870
forever.

682
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,460
By then,

683
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,000
even if you are annoyed

684
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,250
and tired of me,

685
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,550
and had your fun,

686
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,230
I will follow you wherever you go.

687
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,180
You can’t get rid of me.

688
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,210
I suggest you think about it.

689
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,770
Are you ready for this?

690
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,470
Liu Ling.

691
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,590
Listen carefully.

692
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,890
I'm not someone you can mess with.

693
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,800
Put on your clothes

694
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,740
And get lost.

695
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,950
Your Highness.

696
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,350
Why did she stop yelling?

697
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,660
Your Highness.

698
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,590
Your Highness.

699
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,990
Princess, what's wrong?

700
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,990
Princess, are you alright?

701
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,390
What's wrong?

702
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,780
Your Highness.

703
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,660
Your Highness.

704
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,820
Is she crying?

705
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,060
Not just crying.

706
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,690
Yes.

707
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,580
She's crying with her clothes mussed up

708
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,660
and ran out of

709
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,680
the lord's room.

710
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,830
-Luo. -Luo.

711
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,100
Did something went wrong?

712
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,770
Something happened?

713
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,770
Is that true, Luo?

714
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,300
Wait here. I'll go check it out.

715
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,050
Go ahead.

716
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:15,780
Go.

717
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,100
-Go! -Go!

718
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,150
My lord.

719
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,460
The princess was...

720
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,699
What?

721
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,880
S-She went back to her room.

722
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,560
It's windy outside.

723
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,570
I...

724
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,130
I'll close the door for you.

725
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,100
Court Lady Xu.

726
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,110
Lord Xu is here with the imperial doctor.

727
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,830
Come in.

728
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,860
Girl.

729
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,810
Girl.

730
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,930
I heard that His Highness said

731
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,900
you didn't feel well during the banquet.

732
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,300
I've brought an imperial doctor

733
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,410
to take care of you.

734
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,820
It's okay, grandpa.

735
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,420
I'll be fine after some rest.

736
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Court Lady Xu is all well in general.

737
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,890
She's just over-thinking

738
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,420
and has some disorder in heart and spleen.

739
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,960
Besides,

740
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,310
she might have caught a cold at night,

741
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,160
which explains her headache.

742
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,100
She will be fine after taking medicine.

743
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,960
I'll go prepare the medicine for the Court Lady.

744
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,230
I've brought

745
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,680
the person you asked.

746
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,540
Come in.

747
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,480
His name is Ghost-face.

748
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,940
He's a mute.

749
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,710
He won't show his face

750
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,260
because his face was injured.

751
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,440
He is a bit strange,

752
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,850
but he's loyal

753
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,750
and skilled in martial arts.

754
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,010
You can rest assured.

755
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,010
The news of Yun Yi's arrest

756
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,070
has spread so fast in Yejing.

757
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,070
It’s beyond my expectation.

758
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,520
After today's banquet,

759
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,710
the Family Lu

760
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,790
will be restless.

761
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,880
Ghost-face.

762
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,120
In the following days,

763
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,110
you will keep an close eye

764
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,110
on Family Lu.

765
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,790
Once they take action,

766
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,850
you must report to me immediately.

767
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,670
[Lu Mansion]

768
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,160
Greetings, my lord.

769
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,700
Is Shan there now?

770
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,030
Don't worry, my lord.

771
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,950
Young Master sent a letter today.

772
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,660
He's made his way

773
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,990
into the Liaison Office

774
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,760
as the Princess' betrothed.

775
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,990
What about the Tiger Wings Camp?

776
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,310
Are they ready?

777
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,630
Before Master Lu left,

778
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,620
he had made sure everything is ready.

779
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,130
Tiger Wings Camp will join him

780
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,280
in three days.

781
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,450
We can't wait any longer.

782
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,190
The day after tomorrow.

783
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,830
No.

784
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,860
You will set out tomorrow.

785
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,970
Tell Shan for me

786
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,990
to do it as soon as possible

787
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,290
in case there will be more troubles.

788
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,220
Yes.

789
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,680
Right now,

790
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
maybe you want to make things difficult for me,

791
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,160
or maybe you just

792
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,600
want to have fun with me.

793
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,810
But I

794
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,280
am not an easy person.

795
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,680
Once I think you're The One,

796
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,020
I will be yours

797
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,070
forever.

798
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,720
Listen carefully.

799
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm not someone you can mess with.

800
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,660
Put on your clothes

801
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,740
And get lost!

802
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,770
Come in.

803
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,540
My lord,

804
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,880
this is the latest pigeon mail.

805
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,940
Please have a look.

806
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,850
I'll take my leave.

807
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,220
Greetings, Shen Yan.

808
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,370
The trap is set.

809
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,480
Be careful.

810
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,710
The prey is cunning and suspicious.

811
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,650
Be careful not to fall into the water if you fail to catch,

812
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,170
and suffer a double loss.

813
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,590
Your Highness, the water is here.

814
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,310
Your Highness.

815
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Lord Shen.

816
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,220
Lord Shen.

817
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,540
Our princess is missing.

818
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,570
I've searched everywhere

819
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,650
and she's not here.

820
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,430
[I will get lost.]

821
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,460
I will get lost.

822
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,300
The enemy is in front of us.

823
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,290
And the Princess went out alone.

824
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,660
I will find her myself.

825
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,530
But...

826
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,170
Come here.

827
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,940
C-Can I do it?

828
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,870
Don't worry.

829
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,980
Tomorrow morning,

830
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,390
just do as I say.

831
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,050
I’ll take care

832
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,050
of the Princess' safety.

833
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,390
Lord Shen,

834
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,410
you must bring

835
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,500
our Princess back.

836
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,140
Let's set out.

837
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,040
Come in.

838
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,130
How is it?

839
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,390
Hu Xiao.

840
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,280
Have you seen him clearly?

841
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,570
Even bandits like Hu Xiao

842
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,900
were under his command.

843
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,120
The Family Lu is truly outrageous.

844
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,460
Now they dare to do

845
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,970
something so bold as

846
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,050
to kill someone.

847
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,680
Ghost-face.

848
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,740
Meet up with Shen Yan as soon as possible

849
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,140
and help the Jinlin Guard protect the camp.

850
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,790
I'm safe here in the Palace.

851
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,720
But Ling is not.

852
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,760
Take care of her for me.

853
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,010
If things went south,

854
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,360
just make sure Ling is alive.

855
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,290
Anything else

856
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,880
is irrelevant.

857
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,020
Ling, Ling.

858
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,600
Of all the places you could be,

859
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,130
why did you have to go there?

860
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,960
What should I do

861
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,850
if something happens to you?
