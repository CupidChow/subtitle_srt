00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,780
We were

179
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,180
childhood sweethearts.

180
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,600
You convinced grandfather.

181
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,300
You disguised as Family Xu's servant Ghost-face

182
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,540
and stayed by my side.

183
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,540
Shen Xiaoyu.

184
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,050
It's not enough for me

185
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,540
to say thank you.

186
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,920
I didn't know how to thank you before,

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,700
and in the future

188
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,270
I won't be able to thank you as well.

189
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,060
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,680
What if you have to pay me back?

191
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,820
Owing and not paying back.

192
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,280
Owing and not paying back.

193
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,930
The way Lady-in-waiting Xu socializes with people

194
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,010
after so many years

195
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,440
is still deadly boring.

196
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,410
Indeed.

197
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,810
Speaking of fun,

198
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,780
I am no match for

199
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,580
Mr. Shen's girls friends.

200
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,060
Jin,

201
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,060
I'll give you

202
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,110
a chance to return the favor, okay?

203
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,480
Mr. Shen, please go ahead.

204
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,700
If it's for me,

205
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,470
will you stay?

206
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,620
No?

207
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,130
I knew it.

208
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,970
Do you know how I feel?

209
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,620
I am thinking

210
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,980
although Jin doesn't want me,

211
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,100
she's still here.

212
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,940
She may be happy,

213
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,460
sad,

214
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,170
disappointed,

215
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,290
or angry,

216
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,350
as long as I want,

217
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,610
in this familiar place,

218
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,430
I can always find traces of her being.

219
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,620
No matter how time flies,

220
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,420
I can still know where she is.

221
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,290
That's enough.

222
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,620
But now,

223
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,950
you’re leaving Yejing.

224
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,910
In the future,

225
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,630
in these familiar places,

226
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,250
there will only be memories.

227
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,440
From now on,

228
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,750
you will be there no more.

229
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,180
Right?

230
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,740
Jin,

231
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,800
be my wife!

232
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,640
I'll take you away.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
I'll be with you wherever you go.

234
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,280
Okay?

235
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Shen Xiaoyu,

236
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,910
from the moment I entered the palace,

237
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,910
being trusted by the Eastern Palace,

238
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,860
I had no chance going back.

239
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,460
About Ling.

240
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,820
I wanted to help her,

241
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,980
but it's also the chance

242
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,350
to have things settled down between Liu Wang and me.

243
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,210
I don't want to

244
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,200
and can't implicate you.

245
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,580
Fire!

246
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,940
Fire!

247
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,250
Hurry up!

248
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,810
Fire!

249
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,620
Go!

250
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,600
Hurry up!

251
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,350
Shen Xiaoyu!

252
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,900
Get up!

253
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,220
Shen Xiaoyu!

254
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,570
Shen Xiaoyu, wake up!

255
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,540
Shen Xiaoyu!

256
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,750
If you don't wake up,

257
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,130
we will die here.

258
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,120
You'd rather to die with me

259
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,230
than live with me?

260
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,900
Are you pretending to be drunk?

261
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,010
Half drunk.

262
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,710
Half awake.

263
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,690
Watch out!

264
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,080
♪ The night is not spent yet as affection spreads far and wide ♪

265
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,250
♪ Never expect to savor the taste of life ♪

266
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,720
♪ How lucky I am to have you around ♪

267
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,370
Shen Xiaoyu, have you had enough?

268
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:53,140
♪ Night and day, we stay together ♪

269
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,340
Put me down!

270
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,460
Are you okay?

271
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,620
Wait, my lord.

272
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,700
I'm leaving.

273
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,050
Having no clue about where the fire

274
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,410
got started?

275
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,650
It's burning up wildly.

276
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,380
That's right. It's so strange!

277
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,610
Such a big music workshop!

278
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,770
It's all gone.

279
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,580
You say it!

280
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,870
Young master!

281
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,600
Are the girls alright?

282
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,640
Don't worry.

283
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,350
Under your orders,

284
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,570
we are safe and sound.

285
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,130
Good.

286
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,100
I want to entrust you with the money

287
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,760
earned through the bank.

288
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,020
Distribute the money.

289
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,730
Although the Flower Pavilion is gone,

290
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,380
you can

291
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,620
have a stable living.

292
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,480
Hurry.

293
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,290
Yes.

294
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,100
When I settle it down,

295
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,720
I'll then say goodbye to you.

296
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,190
OK.

297
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:23,980
Go.

298
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,260
Water.

299
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,460
Go.

300
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,390
Hurry!

301
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,570
Jin,

302
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,260
As long as you really want it,

303
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,700
in this world,

304
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,660
nothing is too late.

305
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,820
Good.

306
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,260
Bravo!

307
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,590
Ling,

308
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,310
How is it?

309
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,070
My warriors of Yigu

310
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,150
are so cute when dancing.

311
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,020
Here.

312
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,710
Cheers.

313
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,700
Great!

314
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,660
Come on.

315
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,140
Great!

316
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,780
Great!

317
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,840
Liquor is bad for your health.

318
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,360
You Highness,

319
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,320
you shouldn't drink too much.

320
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,020
Lord Shen is right.

321
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,720
But

322
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,960
it's a pity

323
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,060
to ignore the delicious food and good drinks.

324
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,820
Okay.

325
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,180
How about

326
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,920
giving my cup to Lord Shen?

327
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,980
Come on. Drink.

328
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,660
Drink.

329
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,380
Your Highness giving me the drink

330
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,180
is to comply with my suggestion.

331
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,720
But I'm responsible

332
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,260
to protect the princess.

333
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't dare to drink it for fear of negligence of my duty.

334
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,920
Great!

335
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,890
Lord Shen is indeed dutiful and responsible.

336
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,020
You are indeed

337
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,350
a loyal minister of Wei.

338
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,870
I'm very pleased.

339
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,640
It's getting late.

340
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,940
Go back and rest.

341
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:49,970
Ling,

342
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,190
let's go.

343
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,530
Dance with me.

344
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,610
Prince Tuoba,

345
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,670
Her Highness is drunk now.

346
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,860
Who said I'm drunk?

347
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,829
I'm here for the Loyal Intermarriage.

348
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,910
I will become

349
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,530
the wife of the crown prince.

350
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,430
Why can't we dance

351
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,890
if the prince invites me.

352
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,300
My lord,

353
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,980
the princess

354
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,210
and Tuoba Lie

355
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,830
acted like that.

356
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,030
-How you... -Shut up.

357
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,060
I'm tired.

358
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,490
I want to go back and rest.

359
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,270
The wedding envoy?

360
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,800
Here.

361
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,070
Yes.

362
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,340
I'm tired.

363
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm going to go back and rest.

364
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,570
Yes.

365
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,500
Princess.

366
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,800
Ling,

367
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,900
why do you get tired out of a sudden?

368
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,230
Are you feeling unwell?

369
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,900
I noticed that

370
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,860
you ate few at dinner.

371
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,620
How about this?

372
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,380
I'll send someone

373
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,640
to bring you some food.

374
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,900
No need.

375
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,760
I just want to go back and rest.

376
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,540
Prince Tuoba, please help yourself.

377
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,270
Help myself!

378
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,410
OK. Help myself.

379
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,210
I've never been to your tent.

380
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,280
Come.

381
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,180
Let's see how the decoration is.

382
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,500
Shen Yan.

383
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,000
Prince Tuoba has entered my tent.

385
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,130
Didn't you see that?

386
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,100
Yes.

387
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,220
Did you enjoy

388
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,020
the dance just now?

389
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,500
Yes.

390
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,940
And I didn't enjoy myself to the most degree.

391
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,660
Now I can

392
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,060
talk with him still more.

393
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Wait for me here.

394
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,710
Why are you here?

395
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,460
Wedding Envoy Shen Yan.

396
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,040
Greetings, Prince Tuoba.

397
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,700
Where is Ling?

398
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,970
You broke into the princess's tent.

399
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,700
So the princess didn't dare to enter.

400
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,860
Please go,

401
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,810
in case words get out

402
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,840
and ruin the princess' reputation.

403
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,770
Reputation?

404
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,470
She is my wife.

405
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,860
The princess is not married yet.

406
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,760
She's not your wife yet.

407
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,340
Get out.

408
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,710
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude to you.

409
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,560
How dare you!

410
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,100
It's well decorated,

411
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,400
despite the slippery wet floor.

412
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,730
You offended me.

413
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,490
I'm in a good mood today

414
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,270
so I'll let you go.

415
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,050
It's you who offended the princess first.

416
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,190
I had no choice.

417
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,660
If you

418
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,200
still entertain grievances,

419
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,000
you can report it to the emperor.

420
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,000
I

421
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,820
will be at the disposal of His Majesty.

422
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,660
Shen Yan,

423
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
I'll remember you.

424
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,420
Prince Tuoba,

425
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,460
Please.

426
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,250
Ling,

427
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,280
have an early rest.

428
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
See you tomorrow.

429
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,940
Okay.

430
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,130
Come on! Drink!

431
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,900
Come in with me.

432
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,360
Here.

433
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,210
Pour the liquor.

434
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,020
Right.

435
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,740
Liu Ling, let me tell you.

436
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,460
I have something important to do.

437
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,190
I can't be with you all the time.

438
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,980
Behave yourself.

439
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,990
Leave him alone.

440
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,280
I didn't come onto him.

441
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,440
He's my future husband after all.

442
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,660
Although he is much much less than

443
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,380
Lord Shen,

444
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,220
he is free and attentive.

445
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,610
In front of me,

446
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
he has no secret.

447
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,890
If you dare to provoke me again,

448
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,570
don't blame me for being rude to you.

449
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,840
I didn't provoke you.

450
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,330
Shen Yan.

451
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,540
You want the well-being of the king

452
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,220
and of the people.

453
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,740
In your heart

454
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,980
lies numerous stuff.

455
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,780
Aren't you busy?

456
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,020
Don't you have no time

457
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,340
to look after me at all times?

458
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,980
Go!

459
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,740
Go!

460
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,620
Liu Ling,

461
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,950
What on earth do you want me to do?

462
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,220
Shen Yan,

463
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,100
I want to be with you forever.

464
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,270
You said you would marry me.

465
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,180
But

466
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,020
you sent me in person

467
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,680
for the Royal Intermarriage.

468
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,210
You didn't tell me anything.

469
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,690
I feel uneasy.

470
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,340
Do you know?

471
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,540
If you hadn't come to Jiangzhou

472
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,020
to says those words,

473
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,570
I would have married him.

474
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,630
How dare you!

475
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,260
Listen to me.

476
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,200
The battle between two countries

477
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,560
is all up to the kings.

478
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yigu

479
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,530
wanted to send troops to Wei long ago.

480
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,180
This marriage

481
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,100
is the beginning of

482
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
learning each other's bottom line.

483
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,580
What I want to do this time

484
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,610
is to make this war come

485
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,460
sooner.

486
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,140
If it goes well,

487
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,570
your marriage with Tuoba Lie

488
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,090
will be canceled halfway.

489
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,460
If it doesn't go well,

490
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,910
I will be informed.

491
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
By then,

492
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,760
I will abandon everything

493
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,910
and take you to a faraway place.

494
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,520
That's all

495
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
I can tell you.

496
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,540
So,

497
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,100
feel better now?

498
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,150
So soon?

499
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,360
My lord,

500
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,300
along the way,

501
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,180
you and the princess

502
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,820
are getting closer.

503
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,560
You can't see each other all of a sudden.

504
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,640
How bad it is!

505
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,450
The princess comes for marriage while Ling Bi accompanying her.

506
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,890
I'm not the only one

507
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,260
who can't meet whom I love.

508
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,820
W...Who else?

509
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,060
L...Ling Bi.

510
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,720
No.

511
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,480
My lord.

512
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,580
There's nothing between me and Miss Ling Bi.

513
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,390
We...

514
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,650
There is nothing.

515
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,560
No, my lord.

516
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,390
Enough.

517
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,740
If you succeed in finishing the task

518
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,900
entrusted by me,

519
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,380
the princess and Ling Bi

520
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,140
can go back to Wei with us.

521
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,860
Really?

522
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,260
My lord, tell me.

523
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,770
Come in with me.

524
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,920
Lu Mingshan,

525
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,820
The reason you

526
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,460
come to see me today,

527
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,060
after all the talking,

528
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,740
is that you want to tell me

529
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,440
the mastermind of the Jiangzhou case

530
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,620
is your grandfather?

531
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,580
Your Majesty,

532
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,780
I have some clues

533
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,740
in terms of the hiding place of the money

534
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,900
after research.

535
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,560
If we want evidence,

536
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,300
I'm afraid

537
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,410
it will take some time.

538
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,680
Should I praise you

539
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,370
for your resourcefulness,

540
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,940
or prudence

541
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,260
and self-protection?

542
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,340
Your Majesty.

543
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,620
I came to report it till today

544
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,740
because of my ignorance.

545
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,900
If I hadn't heard

546
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,940
Prince Guangping and Grandfather

547
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,620
quarrel over the money,

548
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,730
I'm afraid

549
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,830
I wouldn't know it at all.

550
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,860
Fine.

551
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,570
Holding the candle to the evil.

552
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,910
Holding the candle to the evil?

553
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,220
Are you implying that

554
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,260
Prince Guangping and Duke Lu

555
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,700
have plotted a big event.

556
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,220
Your Majesty is wise.

557
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,900
If you don't mind,

558
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm willing to forsake the evil and follow the good

559
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,530
and eliminate the rebels for Your Majesty

560
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,540
at any cost.

561
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,690
I'll do my best.

562
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,170
I understand

563
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,220
what you meant.

564
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,880
Go back first.

565
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,640
Do what you should do.

566
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
If I

567
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,090
need you,

568
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,970
I'll call for you.

569
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,100
Move.

570
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,270
Your Grace.

571
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,850
Alright.

572
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,500
The carriage is ready.

573
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,460
Tie it more tightly.

574
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,480
More tightly!

575
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,720
Here you are.

576
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:02,980
Ling,

577
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,580
You're in a good mood.

578
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,460
Did you sleep well

579
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,120
last night?

580
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,860
Very well.

581
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,970
Good.

582
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,500
Let's go.

583
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,190
Your Highness, watch out for the slippery road.

584
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,900
Your Highness. Help!

585
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,740
-Princess! -What are you doing?

586
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,900
Your Highness, save us!

587
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,340
Save us, Your Highness!

588
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,650
Step back!

589
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,500
What are you doing?

590
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,030
Go back.

591
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,960
Save us!

592
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,890
Your Highness!

593
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,480
Back off!

594
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,350
Help, Your Highness!

595
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,900
Step back.

596
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,410
Ling,

597
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,630
don’t go there.

598
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,710
Let them handle it.

599
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,670
Step back.

600
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,750
Who are you?

601
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,390
How dare you offend me!

602
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,060
Help!

603
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,300
Guards, drive them away!

604
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,230
-Go back! -Wait.

605
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,100
Who are you?

606
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,640
Your Highness,

607
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,840
we were from Wei.

608
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,510
We lived in a small village

609
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,420
near Wei.

610
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,680
A few years ago,

611
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,520
a few bandits from Yigu

612
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,730
invaded our village.

613
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,140
We were no match for them.

614
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,730
As a result, we were abducted and became slaves.

615
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,060
We had no way to seek help

616
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,620
and suffered greatly.

617
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,930
Wei people?

618
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,880
Judging from your faces,

619
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,830
I can't tell which state you're from.

620
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,140
Since you said you are from Wei,

621
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,060
do you have relatives in Wei

622
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,140
to testify for you?

623
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,760
Yes.

624
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,900
My sister is in the capital,

625
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,560
as a servant for a rich family.

626
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,980
She can testify for me.

627
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,930
My aunt is in Kaifeng,

628
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,460
and my daughter is in Baoding Mansion.

629
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,390
How dare you!

630
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,460
Throwing accusations around without proof!

631
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,330
You're talking nonsense in front of the princess

632
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,700
to sow discord between us.

633
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,880
Guards, take them away.

634
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,810
-Wait for a second -Your Highness.

635
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,180
You said they were throwing accusations around without proof.

636
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
But I think

637
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,310
they seem very convincing.

638
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,450
It doesn't seem like a false accusation.

639
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,530
I will not let go of

640
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,750
this matter.

641
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,850
How about this?

642
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,260
You send someone

643
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,600
to bring their portraits

644
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,160
back to Wei to investigate.

645
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,860
Then we'll know

646
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,900
the truth.

647
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,460
In that case,

648
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,840
ten or twenty days

649
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,060
should be enough.

650
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,740
I'm afraid we can't leave today.

651
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,860
As I

652
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,420
look at them carefully,

653
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,750
I find that

654
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,750
they do not seem cunning.

655
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,470
What they said seems real.

656
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,420
My father demanded time and again

657
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,190
the leaders of the borders to stop wrong doings.

658
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,420
I didn't expect

659
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,140
they never listened.

660
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,580
How despicable!

661
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,970
Don't worry.

662
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,070
In terms of this matter,

663
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,650
I will

664
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,060
have a thorough investigation.

665
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,190
I won't tolerate it.

666
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
It's getting late.

667
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,710
Let's begin our journey.

668
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,250
Didn't you just say that

669
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,900
you will investigate this matter thoroughly?

670
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,230
Well, you see.

671
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,830
The title of Peace

672
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,960
given by the king of Wei

673
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,430
is for the Royal Intermarriages

674
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,070
between Yigu and Wei.

675
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,140
When you

676
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,700
proposed to me in Wei,

677
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,100
didn't you say that you wanted long-term harmony between the two states and between us?

678
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,900
You lied to me.

679
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,990
You lied to Wei.

680
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:54,980
Ling,

681
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,030
you're being too harsh.

682
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,820
Yes.

683
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,730
In your opinion,

684
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
what should we do?

685
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,240
How about this?

686
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,900
Ling Bi.

687
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,520
Yes.

688
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,290
Take these people aside.

689
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,690
Prepare the brush and ink

690
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,240
and let them tell us

691
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,380
the people of Wei who were abducted.

692
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,090
Write them down one by one

693
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,480
and give it to Prince Tuoba.

694
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,720
Please

695
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,660
go to the leaders of each tribe

696
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,090
and bring my Wei people here

697
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,280
safe and sound.

698
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,300
It is a demonstration of

699
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,020
your sincerity

700
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,410
of maintaining long-term harmony.

701
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,340
What do you think?

702
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,910
I...

703
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,340
Ling, I...

704
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,640
It’s settled.

705
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,130
The wedding envoy.

706
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,930
Prince Tuoba said

707
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,210
we won't leave today.

708
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Prepare the tent.

709
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,160
Thank you, Your Grace.

710
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,750
Ling.

711
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,300
What does Lord Shen think of

712
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,580
my performance

713
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,580
What do you think?

714
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,200
Not bad.

715
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,520
Your Grace.

716
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,710
Your Grace, she...

717
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,219
You all get up.

718
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,460
Tell me your names.

719
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,440
Come on.

720
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,920
Okay.

721
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,469
Come.

722
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,380
Come with me.

723
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,949
She let me find the slaves.

724
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:44,760
Tell me.

725
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,440
Liu Ling keeps picking on us

726
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,590
and stalls for time.

727
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:51,980
Does she

728
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,560
neither like me

729
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,360
nor want to marry me?

730
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,550
Your Grace,

731
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,070
we'll fight with Wei sooner or later.

732
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,540
Why do we bother putting on a show with that chick?

733
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,740
In my opinion,

734
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,790
we should just kill them

735
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,110
and take her away.

736
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,230
Don't you

737
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
act recklessly.

738
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,770
Do you think I don't want to?

739
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,850
Let me wait for it.

740
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,500
Lord, here's a letter.

741
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,570
You may leave.

742
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,080
Yes.

743
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,440
[The lost has been found and is safe in the pocket]

744
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,540
Shener is in a hurry to get married

745
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,500
yet he has done such a good job.

746
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,600
The old thief of Family Lu.

747
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,280
Today, on behalf of Jin,

748
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,620
I give you a big present.

749
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,170
Shen Yu's letter

750
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,360
is indeed interesting.

751
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,460
It says

752
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,140
the eldest son and daughter-in-law of the Xu family

753
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,600
didn't commit suicide to escape punishment

754
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,500
and the mastermind

755
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
is

756
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,100
the head of the Lu family.

757
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,290
Your Majesty.

758
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,060
Your Majesty.

759
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,560
The whole Xus

760
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,320
suffered great injustice

761
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,290
in the Jiangzhou case.

762
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,270
I hope Your Majesty will make a wise decision

763
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,270
to restore the reputation of the Xus

764
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,830
and that of my eldest son and daughter-in-law

765
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,460
after their death.

766
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,460
Duke Lu,

767
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,260
some said by name that

768
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,920
you have a hand in it.

769
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,350
Your...

770
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,250
What did they say?

771
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,820
I hope Your Majesty will make a wise decision.

772
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,300
Learning that

773
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,620
this morning

774
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,080
these two made up stories,

775
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,910
I don't know why I'm here.

776
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
I

777
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,570
seem to be in a dream

778
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,490
and for now I don't know

779
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,780
how to answer.

780
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,670
Your Majesty.

781
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,130
Minister of Zhen Mansion of the Administration of Nandian

782
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,900
Shen Yu

783
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,330
is not someone who will make up stories.

784
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,490
How about Your Majesty inviting him to the court

785
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,190
and letting us confront the truth?

786
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,100
Lord Li.

787
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,170
Summon Shen Yu to the court.

788
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,700
I, Shen Yu.

789
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,020
Greetings, Your Majesty.

790
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,300
Long live Your Majesty!

791
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,340
You claimed

792
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,550
to have solid evidence for the case in Jiangzhou.

793
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,100
Tell me.

794
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,610
Yes.

795
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,010
I have something

796
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,250
obtained by Shen Yan

797
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,870
when he went north to Xuanwu Town.

798
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,110
Please have a look.

799
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,250
I've seen it.

800
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,510
It belongs to Yun Yi.

801
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,900
But what is

802
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
this box?

803
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,200
Your Majesty,

804
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,730
it's the box of Qian and Kun jade.

805
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
It was made by gimmick master Lu He.

806
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,540
The gimmick is very sophisticated.

807
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,930
Without the Qian and Kun jade,

808
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,460
if we break the box by force,

809
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,160
it will be destroyed on its own.

810
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,420
Such a breathtaking thing

811
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,060
is perfect for

812
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,010
hiding important articles

813
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,050
and documents.

814
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,260
Lu He has a disciple

815
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,670
called Lu Lianshan.

816
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,340
This is the name Yun Yi wrote

817
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,860
with blood before his death.

818
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,320
According to your letter,

819
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,860
Lu Lianshan,

820
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,460
ordered by Duke Lu,

821
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,080
hid from the world by pretending to be dead

822
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,740
and changed his name to Yun Yi,

823
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,930
and became a retainer of the Xu family.

824
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,160
What you implied is that

825
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,640
the case in Jiangzhou

826
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,730
was plotted by

827
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,010
Family Lu?

828
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,720
Your Majesty is wise.

829
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,320
I often heard that the administrator of Nandian is very capable.

830
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,660
Today, it seems that

831
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,300
you're average.

832
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,340
How dare you make up stories

833
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,890
and make a false charge against those who are loyal and upright.

834
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,420
Is the imperial court of Wei

835
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,190
so despicable?

836
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,060
Don't be so impatient.

837
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,860
The evidence you want

838
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,580
is in the box.

839
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
Is this

840
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,620
the evidence you mentioned?

841
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,860
Your Majesty,

842
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,060
the notebook seems to have nothing special

843
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,420
at first glance.

844
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,810
But after careful observation,

845
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,860
you'll find some revealing clues.

846
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,820
The first clue

847
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,830
is written on page 6.

848
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
Bao Qing Mansion.

849
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
Feng Prefecture.

850
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,050
Bao Qing Mansion.

851
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,900
Feng Prefecture.

852
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,350
Among the subordinate prefectures of Bao Qing Mansion,

853
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,410
I've never heard of Feng Prefecture.

854
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,740
It's not because you're ignorant.

855
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,750
When I first read it, I also doubted.

856
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,190
After some research,

857
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
there is no such prefecture.

858
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,400
We can think of the reason but can't decide

859
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,390
why Yun Yi wrote Feng Prefecture

860
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,390
on purpose.

861
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,230
Could it be...

862
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,710
He's not talking about Feng Prefecture

863
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,300
but Feng?

864
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,630
Feng...

865
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,090
Feng is not a prefecture

866
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,080
but a surname.

867
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,380
There seem to be

868
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,430
some other mistakes as well.

869
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,280
The number of the pages that bears these six surnames

870
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,720
is six, twelve, eighteen.

871
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,110
If we add them up,

872
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,120
it's the number of gods of heaven.

873
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,030
After adding up the gods of heaven and demons of earth,

874
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,030
I then used the number eight and nine to search the word.

875
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,940
As expected, I found nine mistakes

876
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,220
I found nine mistakes

877
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,520
in the nine pages.

878
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,200
Six surnames

879
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,650
and nine first names.

880
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,820
The 15 characters

881
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,360
in this notebook

882
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,580
are the names

883
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,460
of the six ministers in the court.

884
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,960
These six people

885
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,290
are indeed important and well-trusted ministers

886
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,220
of Wei.

887
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,290
I was eager to verify its authenticity.

888
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,490
So, yesterday, I

889
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,740
invited six of them

890
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,620
to the administration of Nandian.

891
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,460
These six people

892
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,180
have confessed

893
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,180
their crimes.

894
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,030
All of them testified that

895
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,260
the mastermind of the case in Jiangzhou

896
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,870
was Duke Lu.

897
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,700
According to the words of some,

898
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,760
the official silver stolen by Lu Lianshan

899
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,710
must have been hidden in Yigu.

900
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,340
That's why no matter how hard

901
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,220
Jinlin Guard

902
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,530
searched in Wei,

903
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,870
there was no way to solve the case.

904
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,670
We have witnesses and evidence.

905
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,020
Do you still have any excuse?

906
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,060
Your Majesty, you're wrong.

907
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,050
The administrator of Nandian

908
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,250
had an engagement

909
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,650
with Xu Shijin, the eldest granddaughter of Family Xu.

910
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,330
Their close relationship

911
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
is known by everyone in the capital.

912
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,190
The story made up by the administrator of Nandian today

913
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,400
is indeed fascinating.

914
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,420
But from my mind,

915
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,340
they are make-believe

916
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,220
and not true.

917
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,100
In my opinion,

918
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,560
the administrator of Nandian

919
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,420
was fooled by the charm of beauty.

920
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,370
He colluded with the daughter of Family Xu,

921
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,760
taking a advantage of Yun Yi's death

922
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,150
and lacking evidence,

923
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,860
and intended to frame Family Lu

924
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,060
by severe tortures and implausible evidence.
