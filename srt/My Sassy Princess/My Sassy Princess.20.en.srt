[Episode 20]

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Shen Yan.

5
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,340
Can you get in there with me now?

6
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,979
Call him grandpa with me.

7
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,440
You want me to change the way I address him now？

8
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,500
In the most difficult time of my life,

9
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,420
it was grandpa

10
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,940
who saved me from Prince Guangping’s Mansion.

11
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,020
He raised me up and took care of me.

12
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,080
He even took Jin out of Family Xu

13
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,520
to accompany me.

14
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,419
He has done

15
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,700
a lot of things for me.

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,780
I want to get married soon

17
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,480
so that he can concentrate on his treatment.

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,300
However,

19
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,570
the wedding date was set by the Ministry of Rites.

20
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,860
I know it's against the rule

21
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,720
to change the way you call him now,

22
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,300
but this thing...

23
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,420
Sure.

24
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,820
Let's go.

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,780
Grandpa,

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,190
I'm your grandson-in-law, Shen Yan.

27
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,920
Hope you're all well, grandpa.

28
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,180
Get up.

29
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,980
Get up.

30
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,200
Get up.

31
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,420
Get up.

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,130
Grandpa.

33
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,220
My Ling has grown up.

34
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,740
She's gonna get married.

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,840
Although Family Shen tends to go down

36
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,350
in all royal families,

37
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,180
your father has always done well

38
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,530
between the royal and all other families.

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,300
Shen Yan,

40
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,380
please take good care of Ling.

41
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,120
She has suffered a lot since she was young.

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,000
People who don't know her

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,960
think she is obedient.

44
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,190
But actually,

45
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,020
it's because she's so exhausted.

46
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,180
You must

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,870
take good care of her

48
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,860
in my place.

49
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,700
Treat her the way like I do.

50
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,820
Protect her.

51
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,260
Don't let others bully her.

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,220
Can you do that?

53
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,280
Don't worry, grandpa.

54
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,820
I will

55
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,550
take care of Ling much more.

56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,720
Look after her.

57
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,950
Protect her.

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,900
I won't let anyone bully her.

59
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,660
Let's go.

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,010
Let's go.

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,900
Let's go.

62
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,460
Let's go.

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,450
Father.

64
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,400
They all left.

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
Go back to your room and rest.

66
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,540
I heard that in this house,

67
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,300
you've got a hidden coffer.

68
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,660
Alright.

69
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,270
You've got a hidden coffer?

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,910
It hurts.

71
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
That's not true, father.

72
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,220
Who is

73
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,660
gossiping?

74
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,660
This is just a rumor.

75
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,570
No one knows his son better than himself.

76
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,180
As her uncle,

77
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,460
why are you so stingy?

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,060
You're so stingy.

79
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,350
Aren't you ashamed?

80
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,950
Isn't it shameless?

81
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,860
Father.

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,460
It's not that I don't want to pay more.

83
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,330
I'm broke myself.

84
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,060
Hurry up.

85
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,860
Give me all the money

86
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,260
from your hidden coffer.

87
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,390
Father!

88
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,340
No, father.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,390
Is there any wiggle room?

90
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,390
-No way.
-Father.

91
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,300
Are you still worried about grandpa's health?

92
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,050
He needs to rest.

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,270
Besides...

94
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,390
The other four out of five

95
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,910
is the price

96
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,490
for the favor Prince Guangping

97
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,560
do for me.

98
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,790
Besides what?

99
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,420
Nothing.

100
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,330
I just think

101
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,130
half year is too long.

102
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,300
But the Ministry of Rites...

103
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,620
Don't worry about the Ministry of Rites.

104
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,700
Just wait

105
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,140
to marry me.

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,720
[Shen Mansion]

107
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,020
What?

108
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,500
Two months?

109
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,860
Are you kidding me?

110
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,460
I'm not kidding.

111
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
I just can't wait.

112
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,700
The imperial edict for the marriage has been issued.

113
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,940
What's the rush?

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm really anxious.

115
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,530
You...

116
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,820
You kid...

117
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,420
Mother.

118
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,560
Brother is in such a hurry.

119
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,880
Please help him.

120
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,820
That's easy for you to say.

121
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,420
Marriage

122
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,380
is a big thing in life.

123
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,060
Our Family Shen

124
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,290
is a big family.

125
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,850
How can we

126
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,310
be so hasty in marriage?

127
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,690
He must have his reason

128
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,110
for being in a rush.

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,300
Although I'm not married yet,

130
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,900
I have many female friends

131
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,210
around me.

132
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,100
Look at him.

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,220
He...

134
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,880
What's wrong with him?

135
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,740
Look.

136
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,850
He looks like a black-faced demon.

137
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,140
He's not young anymore.

138
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,540
He finally gets a wife.

139
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,860
How can he not want to get it done quickly?

140
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,940
We can't do that.

141
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,600
It's only two months.

142
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,230
This is ridiculous.

143
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,480
Mother.

144
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,070
The silly son of the director of the Ministry of Works

145
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,510
who's drooling all day

146
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,770
is going to get married in three months.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
What?

148
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,520
Really?

149
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,460
Look at our Shen Er.

150
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,800
He's valiant.

151
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,800
How can he lose to

152
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,110
that silly son?

153
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,600
What do you say, mother?

154
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,220
I'll go to the palace

155
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,650
to meet the Noble Consort

156
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,340
and discuss Yan's wedding.

157
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,300
Servants, prepare the sedan.

158
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,240
Mother, take care.

159
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,730
You don't have to thank me.

160
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,179
Mr. Chen,

161
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,940
have you finished the design

162
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,860
of the wedding sedan?

163
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,539
My lord.

164
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,830
It'll be done soon.

165
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Are you slacking off? Hurry up.

166
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,780
How come the material list

167
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,100
of Her Highness's Phoenix Crown is not ready yet?

168
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,400
The Silver Production Bureau requests it urgently.

169
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Come, show it to His Lord.

170
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,380
My lord.

171
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,620
Is this the dowry list for the princess?

172
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,260
She is a princess.

173
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,820
Do you think it's for your family's wedding?

174
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,140
After the Needlework Bureau

175
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,940
measures the princess,

176
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,540
you send it to House of Duke Dingbei immediately.

177
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,940
The Duke wants to

178
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,540
take charge of

179
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,290
Her Highness's wedding dress.

180
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,940
All people from Silver Production Bureau, Scarf and Hat Bureau,

181
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,460
and Weaving and Dyeing Bureau,

182
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,620
work hard.

183
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,540
Don't make any mistake!

184
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,820
Jin.

185
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,580
Why is it so noisy outside?

186
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,620
I'm still sleepy.

187
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,940
You don't know.

188
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,220
Last night,

189
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,900
Madam Shen went to the Noble Consort in the palace

190
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,380
who's in charge of your wedding.

191
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,540
She put away her pride

192
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,820
and said they couldn't wait for half a year.

193
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,940
She insisted on bringing forward the wedding

194
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,180
four months ahead.

195
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,230
So that's two months from now?

196
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,820
The Noble Consort

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,540
didn't want to

198
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,060
hurt Madam Shen's feeling.

199
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,280
She also knew His Majesty's intention.

200
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,320
So she agreed.

201
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,010
It will be a hard time for the Ministry of Rites

202
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,270
in the next two months.

203
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,610
All right.

204
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,530
Well, then will I

205
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,570
have many things to do

206
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,580
in the following two months?

207
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,690
Don't overthink.

208
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,580
Let's go out and take a look first.

209
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,100
I don't want to go.

210
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,040
Come on.

211
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,820
Jin.

212
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,460
Let's go.

213
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,060
Princess Peace.

214
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
No need to stand on ceremony.

215
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Minister Qi.

216
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,680
I haven't had breakfast yet.

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,490
I'll go to the Ministry of Rites to see you

218
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,500
after breakfast.

219
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,100
OK?

220
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,430
Don't worry, Your Highness.

221
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,780
I'll go get some food

222
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,950
for Your Highness

223
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,370
to suppress your hunger.

224
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,100
Thank you, Lady-in-waiting Xu.

225
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,600
Your Highness.

226
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,830
Please.

227
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,420
What are you waiting for?

228
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,560
Take measurements for Her Highness.

229
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,810
Hurry up.

230
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,900
Come on.

231
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,780
Drink with me.

232
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,940
I'm busy.

233
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,170
Commander, your big day is coming soon.

234
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,720
Yet you're busy with work.

235
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,260
You are really a role model for the people of Wei.

236
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,180
I admire you.

237
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,300
Why?

238
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,020
I can't sit in your chair?

239
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,980
Ling.

240
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,300
Tomorrow is your wedding day.

241
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,580
Are you nervous?

242
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,380
Nervous?

243
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Not really.

244
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,820
I just feel

245
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,250
it's not true.

246
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,910
Actually, I feel the same too.

247
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,160
I can't believe two months have passed

248
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,520
in the blink of an eye.

249
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,070
But tomorrow is your wedding.

250
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,140
I will leave Yejing then.

251
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,220
I thought

252
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,300
I might not have the chance

253
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,140
to say goodbye to you.

254
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,870
So I'm saying goodbye tonight.

255
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,260
So soon?

256
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,530
It's ridiculous.

257
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,550
I thought I was good at socializing.

258
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,940
But when I'm about to leave,

259
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,700
I found you're the only person

260
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,340
who doesn't want me to leave.

261
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,180
But before I leave,

262
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,900
it's great to see you

263
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,180
get married happily.

264
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,140
That's great!

265
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,820
Jin.

266
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
No matter where you go,

267
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,540
when you are going to get married one day,

268
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,860
you must tell me in advance.

269
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,460
I'll be there no matter what.

270
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,910
OK.

271
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,200
Your Highness. Lady-in-waiting Xu.

272
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,970
The Needlework Bureau

273
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,770
has sent the wedding dress over.

274
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,460
Your Highness.

275
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,470
Your Highness.

276
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,060
I heard from people working at the Needlework Bureau that

277
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,360
this wedding dress is made by

278
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,020
the best embroiderer in Yejing

279
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,380
whom His Royal Highness has found.

280
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,740
His Royal Highness also said

281
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,250
the pattern on this wedding dress

282
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,380
is Your Highness's mother's favorite.

283
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,740
Your Highness's mother said

284
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,290
she would embroider these patterns herself

285
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,150
when Your Highness gets married.

286
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,300
His Royal Highness

287
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,340
still remembers it.

288
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,270
So he asked someone to embroider this wedding dress.

289
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,730
My mother?

290
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,860
His Royal Highness is really considerate.

291
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,860
Ling.

292
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,180
Although your mother

293
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
has passed away,

294
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,860
tomorrow is your wedding day,

295
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,100
when you wear this,

296
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
it will be like

297
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,700
she's by your side.

298
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,660
Try it on.

299
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,580
Ling is so beautiful.

300
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,290
Your Highness is so beautiful.

301
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,580
It's time.

302
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,900
Raise the sedan.

303
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,300
Good!

304
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,580

Father-in-law. Mother-in-law.

347
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,700
I'm gonna take my husband with me.

348
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,010
I'll leave the rest

349
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,820
to you.

350
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,090
Let's go.

351
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,170
Okay.

352
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,020
We can finally get into the bridal chamber.

353
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,230
You can't leave tonight.

354
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,150
After I send you in,

355
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,150
I have to come out.

356
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,310
Why?

357
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,460
Getting married is so troublesome.

358
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,390
What do you want?

359
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,930
I want...

360
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,820
Good!

361
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Well...

362
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,680
Well... Those young people...

363
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,920
They're energetic.

364
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,670
So energetic.

365
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,340
Everyone,

366
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,590
please be seated.

367
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,830
OK. OK. Take a seat.

368
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,270
Take a seat.

369
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,810
Let's go.

370
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,620
Dig in.

371
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,440
Go.

372
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,100
Go.

373
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,740
Shen Yan.

374
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,380
Don't underestimate me.

375
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,550
I'm very demure.

376
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,890
Demure?

377
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,060
When did Your Highness

378
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,120
learn to be demure?

379
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,940
Well...

380
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,020
Jin said

381
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,520
I should sit with a red candle on our wedding day.

382
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
What does it mean?

383
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,900
It means,

384
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,260
on our wedding day,

385
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,790
the candles in the room can't be blown out.

386
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,460
I have to wait until it burns out

387
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,620
then we can have sex.

388
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,040
Otherwise, I will be looked down upon by my husband's family.

389
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,820
It sounds interesting.

390
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,040
Well,

391
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,650
go sit with the red candle.

392
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,370
I'll wait for you here.

393
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,440
Not that one.

394
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,870
It's this one.

395
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,520
What a big candle.

396
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,430
It won't be burnt out by tomorrow.

397
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,960
I think it's perfect.

398
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,930
It's perfect

399
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,730
for your demureness.

400
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,270
I...

401
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,450
Your Highness just stay here

402
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,310
and sit with the red candle.

403
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,960
And I

404
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
will be right here

405
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,180
with you.

406
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,100
Your Grace.

407
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,460
How is the wedding

408
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,540
of Princess Peace going?

409
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
Your Grace.

410
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
Her Highness was passionate and straightforward.

411
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,140
She dragged Lord Shen

412
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,000
into the bridal chamber quickly.

413
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,980
Fortunately, Duchess Shen and Duke Shen

414
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,290
were outside serving the guests.

415
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,500
It was quite lively.

416
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,420
That's just like her.

417
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,140
What about Lady-in-waiting Xu?

418
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,060
She is a sensible lady.

419
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,020
Even now,

420
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,300
she's still busy serving the guests.

421
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,510
They have a deep sister relationship.

422
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,040
Has the gate of Yejing

423
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
been closed?

424
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,900
Yes.

425
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,140
I've followed Your Grace's order

426
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,660
and instructed the guards

427
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,180
that no one would be allowed to get in or out.

428
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,300
After tonight,

429
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,980
I finally

430
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,690
make a decision

431
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,630
about Jin.

432
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm tired and exhausted.

433
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,970
Tomorrow,

434
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,620
ask Lady-in-waiting Xu over

435
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,660
to chat with me.

436
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,660
Yes.

437
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,970
I'll take my leave.

438
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,410
Be careful.

439
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,120
Watch the steps.

440
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,610
Grandpa, you have a headache.

441
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,400
How could you drink this much?

442
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,090
Duke Shen was happy

443
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,340
and persistently persuaded me to drink more.

444
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,220
How could I turn him down?

445
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,100
Jin still needs to be out there to serve the guests.

446
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,900
Grandpa, take a rest here.

447
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,700
If you need anything,

448
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,300
send someone to ask Jin over.

449
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,430
Go.

450
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,220
Mr. Xu.

452
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,040
Any news?

453
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,400
The one from the Eastern Palace

454
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,730
is going to take action.

455
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,920
How about

456
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,460
sending Jin out of the city tonight?

457
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,220
Don't bother.

458
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,580
Tomorrow is the right time.

459
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,490
You just need to follow the plan.

460
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,290
Leave the rest

461
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,900
to me.

462
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,190
Shen Yu.

463
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,170
Are you really going to

464
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,390
go this far?

465
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,540
If I don't do that,

466
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,420
with her personality,

467
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,160
she won't go with me.

468
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,620
If that's the case,

469
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,470
we have no choice.

470
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,260
Go.

471
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,010
If I knew who had bought the red candle,

472
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,810
I wouldn't forgive that person.

473
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,180
I bought it.

474
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,910
What are you gonna do?

475
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,020
Shen Yan, you cheated!

476
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,330
We agreed not to blow it out.

477
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,640
You've already been married.

478
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,570
Shouldn't you call me husband now?

479
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Husband sounds boring.

480
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,500
It's not romantic at all.

481
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,360
What do you want to call me?

482
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,380
You look silly everyday.

483
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,190
Shall I call you a nerd?

484
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,140
How should I call you then?

485
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,510
I'm so gorgeous.

486
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,860
Of course you're gonna call me Gorgeous.

I should call you...

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,750
you were born as a girl in our Family Xu.

522
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,020
Grandpa.

523
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,330
I'm gonna go now.

524
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,500
Lady-in-waiting Xu, wait.

525
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,580
Mr. Xu.

526
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,460
Lord Li,

527
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,690
what brought you here?

528
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,530
I came here

529
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,540
with the order of His Grace

530
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,680
to invite Lady-in-waiting to the palace for a chat.

531
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,920
Lady-in-waiting.

532
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,860
Please.

533
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,560
What happened?

534
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,880
It's early in the morning.

535
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,430
Why is it so noisy out there?

536
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,100
Come on.

537
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Give me the money.

538
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,180
What money?

539
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,180
You're a newlywed.

540
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,340
Of course you don't know my feelings.

541
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,860
My spy reported

542
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,540
that you two

543
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,040
had been making noises

544
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,670
all night.

545
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,420
He finally

546
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,750
waited until midnight,

547
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,780
and thought there would be no more thing

548
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,620
after you two fell asleep.

549
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
Who would expect

550
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,540
that Her Highness

551
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,140
to say more than 300 love sentences

552
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,060
to Commander in her dream?

553
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,180
My poor subordinate

554
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,420
is now totally

555
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,730
stagnant and distracted.

556
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,350
He's gone crazy.

557
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,740
I had no other choice

558
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,140
but to come to you

559
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,210
for some money for medicine,

560
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,140
so I can take him to the doctor.

561
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,220
In my opinion,

562
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,860
you came here

563
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,340
not to ask for money,

564
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,620
but to wake me up

565
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,660
to help you get someone for you.

566
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,640
Shen Yu.

567
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,380
Mr. Xu.

568
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,300
Mr. Xu.

569
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,410
Shen Yu.

570
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,660
A carriage from the Eastern Palace came

571
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,100
and took Jin away.

572
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,060
Her Highness is ready.

573
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,060
We're gonna

574
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,280
head to the palace.

575
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,380
Your Highness. Please.

576
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,620
Xu Shijin.

577
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,350
Guards!

578
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,850
How dare you!

579
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,700
How dare you poison His Grace?

580
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,010
Arrest her!

581
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,950
Wait.

582
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,810
Brother,

583
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,420
Jin had been working for you for years.

584
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,950
She wouldn't do such thing.

585
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,180
She must have been framed.

586
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,620
Please investigate this, Your Grace.

587
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,300
My cousin.

588
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,660
Someone wants to kill me.

589
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
There's solid evidence.

590
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,080
Would I

591
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,210
lie to my cousin?

592
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,170
Stop messing around.

593
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,920
Your Grace.

594
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,170
Since Lady-in-waiting Xu

595
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,540
is suspected to have poisoned Your Grace,

596
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,470
I will escort her

597
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,260
in person

598
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,810
to the administration of Beidian

599
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,010
and interrogate her.

600
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,460
Lady-in-waiting Xu.

601
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,260
Please.

602
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,300
Jin.

603
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,460
Shen Yan.

604
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,200
Jin is not that kind of person.

605
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,030
Let's go.

606
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Shen Yu.

607
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,730
Jin was framed by Liu Wang.

608
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,390
Why aren't you worried at all?

609
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,489
Your Highness, calm down.

610
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,820
When Shen Er comes back,

611
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,929
you will understand then.

612
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:11,530
You...

613
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,340
My dear.

614
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,219
My dear, you're back.

615
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,620
How is Jin?

616
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,889
She's in the prison.

617
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,230
She's under surveillance by the Supreme Court.

618
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,900
Even if the Eastern Palace wants to hurt her,

619
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,560
they have to follow the rules.

620
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,219
I asked her when I went there.

621
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,219
According to what Lady-in-waiting Xu said,

622
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,550
the Eastern Palace ordered her to make tea

623
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,190
for the reason of seeing her off.

624
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,270
All the tools used

625
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,389
were what Lady-in-waiting used on a daily basis.

626
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,159
However,

627
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,980
someone had messed with it.

628
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,880
Can you find out who did it?

629
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,340
Don't bother.

630
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,500
Since the Eastern Palace

631
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,940
wants to kill Jin,

632
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,270
it's likely that His Grace did it himself.

633
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,150
How can we ask His Majesty

634
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,760
to arrest his own son,

635
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,620
His Grace, by himself?

636
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,680
I think she must

637
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,780
have known this,

638
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,950
so she said nothing

639
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,980
and signed the indictment.

640
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,100
She signed it?

641
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,980
She didn't do it.

642
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,110
Why did she confess?

643
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,250
She's trying to make no way back.

644
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,860
She made no room for us

645
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,620
to save her.

646
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,540
She's afraid that if she infuriates the Eastern Palace,

647
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,270
more lives will be sacrificed.

648
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,610
What should we do now?

649
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,510
I'll save her.

650
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,980
You?

651
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,890
How?

652
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,260
Break into the prison.

653
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,500
Take her away.

654
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,560
Are you crazy?

655
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,700
My dear.

656
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,620
You urged me to get up early in the morning

657
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,950
and to go to the palace to give our regards to the royal family.

658
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,520
Did you

659
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,370
plan this on purpose

660
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,430
and hide it from me?

661
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,880
How dare you

662
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,380
hide such an important thing from me?

663
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,800
If we hadn't hidden it from you,

664
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,330
how could we hide it from Lady-in-waiting Xu?

665
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,050
Break into the prison and take her away?

666
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,170
The imperial prison is heavily guarded.

667
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:06,930
There are many martial arts masters.

668
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,410
How can you get Jin out?

669
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,700
Even if you successfully get her out,

670
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,460
how can you

671
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,620
escape from Yejing?

672
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,540
Alright.

673
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,440
Don't worry.

674
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,500
Shen Yu has arranged everything.

675
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,900
If it was only him,

676
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,200
I wouldn't care about it!

677
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,440
What about Jin?

678
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,820
No matter where

679
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,490
you two go,

680
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,890
you will be wanted by the imperial court.

681
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,160
Your so-called "leaving away"

682
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,200
is running away

683
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,420
until you get caught?

684
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,300
Don't worry, Your Highness.

685
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,930
When the time comes,

686
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,030
I'll have my own way

687
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,150
to let Jin pretend to die so she can escape.

688
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,420
Now everything is ready

689
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,740
except one thing

690
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,380
for which I still need help from Your Highness.

691
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,150
What is it?

692
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,460
After I break into the prison,

693
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,490
please get her out of the town

694
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,770
fair and square.

695
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,820
Fair and square?

696
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,520
[Eastern Palace]

697
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,380
Please don't get mad, Your Grace.

698
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,910
What a ridiculous copycat.

699
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:57,830
Your Grace.

700
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
How is it going with Lady-in-waiting Xu?

701
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,790
Lady-in-waiting Xu

702
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,100
has signed the indictment.

703
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,980
She signed it?

704
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,260
My little Jin.

705
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,860
You would rather confess

706
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,690
than bow to me.

707
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,780
Your Grace.

708
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,820
Shall we give Lady-in-waiting more time

709
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,020
to think it over?

710
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,560
No.

711
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,520
A stone can't be warmed up

712
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,860
will drop on feet sooner or later.

713
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Lord Li.

714
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,340
Do it quick.

715
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,580
Don't make her suffer too much.

716
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,650
Yes.

717
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,980
Lord Li.

718
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,580
-Yes.
-Yes.

719
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,740
Why are you so late?

720
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

721
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,360
Lady-in-waiting is a sensible person.

722
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,240
I suppose

723
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,730
I don't have to do it myself.

724
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,020
Thank you, Lord Li.

725
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,970
Please spare my life.

726
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,410
Let's go.

727
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,620
Who asked you to save me?

728
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,220
Go!

729
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,700
Okay.
