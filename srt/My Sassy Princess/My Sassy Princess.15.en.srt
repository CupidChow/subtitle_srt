[Episode 15]

4
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,420
Your Grace,

5
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,060
you're finally here.

6
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,820
I've said a lot,

7
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,979
but it doesn't work.

8
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,759
Please talk to them.

9
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,660
It's a hot summer.

10
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
Duke Dingbei

11
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,150
is the pillar of our country.

12
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,820
How can you

13
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,300
treat your body like this?

14
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,860
Stand up.

15
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,580
I've made up my mind.

16
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,110
Your Grace, there is no need to persuade me.

17
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,810
My father

18
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,290
and you have known each other for many years.

19
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,620
How could he not know that

20
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,680
you love your granddaughter so much?

21
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,200
If it's because of the marriage,

22
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,900
even though Tuoba Lie

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
wants to marry my cousin,

24
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,440
my father will definitely not agree.

25
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,030
The young man from Yigu has wild ambitions.

26
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,980
If he threatens us with war,

27
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,700
then Ling can't marry him.

28
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,030
I'm willing to ask the Marshal Seal

29
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,780
to lead the army in person

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,060
to establish prestige for Wei and suppress the rebellion.

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,140
Duke Dingbei,

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,200
you are so smart.

33
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,110
How did you get confused

34
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,220
in this matter?

35
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,100
If Yigu invades us today,

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,280
Wei

37
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,100
will fight to the end.

38
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,740
But they are not now.

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,010
Your Royal Highness,

40
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,210
have you ever thought

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,140
if the princess rejects the marriage

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,300
and ignited the war,

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,470
How do you expect the people of Wei

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,270
to think of Princess Peace

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
and

46
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,590
His Majesty?

47
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,390
Could it be that

48
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,680
in your eyes,

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,160
the people of Wei living and working in peace

50
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,520
is not as good as my cousin's marriage?

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,660
Don't you afraid

52
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,940
Princess Peace's refusal

53
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,180
to marry will

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,100
make the people of Wei

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,829
fall into war

56
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,220
and be written in history books?

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,880
So that you and Princess Peace

58
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,900
will be blamed

59
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,100
by the descendants?

63

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,860
Slow down.

69
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,160
What's going on?

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,170
Wait. Wait.

71
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,190
What's going on?

72
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:05,800
Be careful.

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,330
What happened to my father?

74
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,840
Wait.

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,440
What happened to my father?

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,460
Young duke,

77
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,180
I didn’t have time to ask.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,560
He was fine when he went out,

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,060
but when he came back, he was unconscious.

80
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,519
Well...

81
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll wait here.

82
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,410
Go and get the doctor.

83
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,860
Yes.

84
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,700
Hurry up.

85
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,500
Stop!

86
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,520
Can we talk about it later?

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,060
I am anxious to see my father.

88
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,180
Don't worry.

89
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,780
Your father is fine.

90
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,920
Look at them both blushing

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,140
and sweating.

92
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,700
It's probably because His Majesty refused to see him.

93
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,360
The old man was stubborn again

94
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,140
and insisted on waiting outside,

95
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,550
so he got a heatstroke.

96
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,420
No.

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,180
Even if he has a heatstroke, he's still my father.

98
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,510
I have to watch over him.

99
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,810
-You... -It hurts.

100
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,770
Has your brain been

101
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,250
taken away by a dog?

102
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,180
The old man

103
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,580
has always been healthy.

104
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,140
We can't act rashly.

105
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,820
But now,

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,620
he was sick

107
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,820
because of Liu Ling.

108
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
That thing

109
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,140
should come in handy.

110
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,910
As long as his illness doesn't get better,

111
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,020
you will be

112
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,080
the head of the House of Duke Dingbei.

113
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,820
You're right.

114
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,500
This time,

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,500
thanks to your great recommendation.

116
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,060
Come on.

117
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,820
You're welcome.

118
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,420
To you.

119
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,460
Tuoba,

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,190
don't say that.

121
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,220
Now that

122
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,470
we're talking about it.

123
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,850
I want to remind you.

124
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,420
Although she is beautiful,

125
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,130
she is very arrogant.

126
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
If she makes

127
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,860
you headache in the future,

128
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,300
don't blame me.

129
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,909
You don't understand.

130
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,080
A beauty

131
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,900
should have a temper.

132
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,700
You don't like it?

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,320
I like it.

134
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
OK. Come on.

135
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,010
Princess Peace and you

136
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,270
are a

137
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,540
perfect couple.

138
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,090
Tuoba.

139
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,370
Go out.

140
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,420
Ling.

141
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,820
I’m old.

142
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,470
I'm useless.

143
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,460
Grandpa,

144
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,340
I got you into trouble.

145
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,380
I thought about it.

146
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,060
Look,

147
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,700
the Crown Prince

148
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,580
didn't say anything definite.

149
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,520
And His Majesty

150
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,300
didn't punish us.

151
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,090
We can

152
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,840
do it again

153
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
and again.

154
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,980
There are many ways.

155
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,060
No wonder

156
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,740
people call me Little Devil.

157
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,780
Whenever I get into trouble,

158
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,100
you will always protect me.

159
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,700
Who called you Little Devil?

160
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,940
I'll go find him.

161
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,340
Ling.

162
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,900
It's been ten years.

163
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,500
Ten years ago,

164
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,620
when I brought you back

165
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,820
from Jiangzhou,

166
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,480
you were only like this tall.

167
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,820
Now,

168
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,900
you have grown into a big girl.

169
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm old.

170
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,460
I'm old.

171
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,740
You're not.

172
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,290
Here, it's getting cold.

173
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,170
No.

174
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,550
I'm not so old that

175
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,830
I can't even drink porridge by myself.

176
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,790
I want to feed you.

177
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,300
Be good.

178
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,150
Come on.

179
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,150
Father.

180
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,250
Father.

181
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,920
Time for medicine.

182
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,410
Grandpa.

183
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,710
I'll accompany you later.

184
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,880
Listen.

185
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,650
Do something for me now.

186
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,140
Find out

187
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,580
what Tuoba Lie likes

188
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,620
and loves.

189
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,740
Find it out.

190
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,230
Since His Majesty and Crown Prince

191
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
disagree,

192
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,500
then

193
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,980
we have to find a way

194
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,840
from Tuoba Lie.

195
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,350
I'm not going.

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Father,

197
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,290
listen to me.

198
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,500
You should give up.

199
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,140
What are you talking about?

200
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,300
Ling is Yun's daughter,

201
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,460
and she is my granddaughter.

202
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,180
She's in trouble now.

203
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,440
Can we leave her alone?

204
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Yes.

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Yes, father.

206
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,990
Don't be angry.

207
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,860
You're right.

208
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,980
You're right.

209
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,620
How about this?

210
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,470
Please

211
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,300
take this medicine

212
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,150
first.

213
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,080
Come on.

214
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,820
You came here in person.

215
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,330
I...

216
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,810
I'm flattered.

217
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,820
The Lu family was a puppet

218
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,900
in my hands.

219
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,080
Now this puppet is about to disperse.

220
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,120
I should come here

221
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,790
to say hello to Your Grace.

222
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,900
What are you

223
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,420
coming for?

224
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,340
You should know

225
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,940
the state of Wei

226
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,740
should have belonged to me.

227
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,760
If I can get

228
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,100
help from Yigu,

229
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
I will unify Wei soon.

230
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,960
But what's the benefit

231
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,470
for Yigu?

232
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,330
Yigu has been poor for years

233
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
because of a lack of arable land.

234
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,020
If Yigu

235
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,210
can help me ascend the throne.

236
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,560
Then Yigu King

237
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,580
can pick any fertile land on the border of Wei.

238
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,730
How about that?

239
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,900
Your Royal Highness, you are so sincere.

240
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,220
I'm very touched.

241
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,180
Don't worry, Your Royal Highness.

242
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,060
When I go back,

243
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,730
I will report this to my father

244
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,960
and give you a satisfying answer.

245
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,950
Your Royal Highness, please wait.

246
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,060
Since you want to

247
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,740
become friends with me,

248
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,500
you should

249
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,660
show some sincerity.

250
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,260
What do you want?

251
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,820
Princess Peace Liu Ling

252
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,700
is the eldest daughter of Your Royal Highness.

253
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,420
I heard that

254
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,030
she's not willing to marry me,

255
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,810
and caused a lot of troubles.

256
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,140
Since you want to join hands with me,

257
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,460
I think you should

258
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
have some sincerity.

259
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,500
[House of Duke Dingbei]

260
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,180
Princess.

261
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,220
Princess, bad news.

262
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,150
His Royal Highness vomited blood.

263
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,000
Liu Ling, stop!

264
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,430
Where are you going?

265
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm going to find grandpa.

266
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,810
Father is so sick.

267
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,020
It's all your fault.

268
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,140
How dare you come to find him?

269
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
Don't be angry.

270
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,100
Her surname is Liu,

271
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,210
not Zhang.

272
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,500
She is an outsider.

273
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,580
Liu Ling,

274
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
you are born to be a jinx.

275
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,710
If you still have a human heart,

276
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,220
and feel sorry for my father-in-law,

277
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,350
then just

278
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,810
go back to your room.

279
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,650
Don't come near him again.

280
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,100
I guess

281
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,810
you don't want to wear mourning

282
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,620
before you get married.

283
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,660
Princess.

284
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,550
Princess.

285
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,660
Princess.

286
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,260
Princess.

287
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,860
Liu Ling.

288
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,980
Don't be afraid.

289
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,820
It's okay.

290
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,220
When Shen Yan comes back,

291
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,660
grandpa will recover.

292
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,470
Everything will be fine

293
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
Everything will be fine.

294
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,660
Everything will be fine.

295
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,350
Everything will be fine.

296
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,980
Princess.

297
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,090
Princess.

298
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,470
Princess.

299
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,860
Let me go in and accompany you.

300
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,790
Shen Yan.

301
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,790
Where are you?

302
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,900
Where are you?

303
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,930
Where did you come from?

304
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,410
Why are you stealing?

305
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,580
Don't talk nonsense.

306
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,910
I just brought some food for the princess.

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,060
Whatever you said.

308
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,490
I said you stole the food.

309
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,050
You...

310
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,100
Butler, it's okay for you

311
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,230
to say that about me.

312
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,090
But princess

313
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,860
cares about His Royal Highness all day long.

314
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,780
She hasn't eaten anything all day.

315
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,240
If there's nothing to eat,

316
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm worried about her health.

317
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,370
I beg you.

318
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,490
Please.

319
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,840
If you want to beg for some food

320
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,250
for your master,

321
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,540
it's okay.

322
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,640
Go kneel in the front yard.

323
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,410
Maybe after seeing you,

324
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,580
madam will agree it with a soft heart.

325
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,690
Then she might give you some food.

326
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,650
Gentlemen,

327
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,430
I beg you.

328
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,180
Can you

329
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,780
give the princess some food?

330
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,660
The princess is not in good health.

331
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,240
Please.

332
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,580
Open the door!

333
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,380
Look who it is.

334
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,380
Who are you?

335
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,740
How dare you

336
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,940
shout

337
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,060
in my house?

338
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,660
You...

339
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,340
Brother-in-law.

340
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,140
Brother-in-law, you're here.

341
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,980
You must be tired

342
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,180
from this journey.

343
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,530
Go inside and have a rest.

344
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,050
Who asked her to kneel?

345
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,810
Even a dog

346
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,180
was kicked out of Prince Guangping’s Mansion,

347
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,860
has no reason

348
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
to kneel at someone else's house.

349
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,780
How dare you!

350
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,820
How dare you

351
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,330
punish people in his family?

352
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,820
I was wrong. I was wrong.

353
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,340
Brother-in-law.

354
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
This is a misunderstanding.

355
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,540
A misunderstanding.

356
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,890
Your Royal Highness.

357
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,060
The princess hasn't eaten anything

358
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,020
for days.

359
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,790
Please prepare some food for the princess.

360
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,940
Please.

361
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,500
Ask the kitchen to cook.

362
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,760
Yes.

363
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,700
Go and cook.

364
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,930
Yes.

365
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,140
Princess.

366
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,300
Princess.

367
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,910
His Royal Highness is here.

368
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
You may leave.

369
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,540
Yes.

370
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,640
Ling.

371
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,170
You are weak

372
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,589
and you can't stand it.

373
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,220
Come and eat.

374
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,140
I'm tired.

375
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,940
I'm going to bed.

376
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,100
Have you ever thought about Shen Yan?

377
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,180
You caused the House of Duke Dingbei to be punished.

378
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,500
The punishment is only the first step.

379
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,540
If you don't change,

380
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,270
more and more people will be implicated.

381
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,890
The House of Duke Dingbei,

382
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,300
Prince Guangping’s Mansion,

383
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,340
and your brothers and sisters.

384
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,530
I know

385
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,390
you don't care about these.

386
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,700
What about Shen Yan?

387
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,280
If you keep doing this,

388
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,730
do you think His Majesty and Crown Prince

389
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,930
will let Shen Yan and the Shen Family go?

390
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,200
So?

391
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,620
Should I obey you

392
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,960
like my mother at that time

393
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
and be manipulated

394
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,810
and bullied

395
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,040
by you wicked people?

396
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,660
Ling.

397
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,380
I know

398
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,260
you are unwilling.

399
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,840
But since you were born in a noble family,

400
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,780
many things

401
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,500
are predestined.

402
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,420
You can't change it.

403
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,100
You can't win over your life.

404
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,660
How about

405
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,780
admitting it?

406
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,770
So you can suffer less.

407
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,780
He can also...

408
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
Leave me alone.

409
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,580
Get out.

410
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,300
Father-in-law.

411
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,660
Liu Lishan.

412
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,340
Your trip to Yejing

413
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,060
is really on time.

414
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,970
It is.

415
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,060
I never thought that

416
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,970
my bastard son

417
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,220
would hang out

418
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,180
with you

419
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,500
and the Lu family,

420
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,210
forcing me

421
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,020
to this point.

422
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,500
Father-in-law,

423
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,500
why did you say that?

424
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,820
My...

425
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,730
My Yun died because of you.

426
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,080
I'm old now.

427
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,300
I can ignore everything

428
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,580
in the world.

429
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,970
Only Ling,

430
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,660
she is already 20 years old.

431
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,050
But

432
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,730
she has tasted all the hardships in the world.

433
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,160
You are her father,

434
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,340
can't you

435
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,770
do something for her?

436
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,930
It seems miserable

437
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,880
for her to marry Yigu,

438
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,680
but it maybe the safest place

439
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,870
for Ling.

440
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,620
In the end,

441
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,700
you still want...

442
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,800
Our emperor

443
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,770
has been on the throne for 20 years.

444
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,480
Twenty years.

445
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,790
Yun was dead

446
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,430
and Ling has grown up.

447
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,100
Only you

448
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,020
live a confused life

449
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,130
without progress.

450
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,750
But your heart hasn't

451
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,070
changed at all.

452
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,980
Liu Lishan,

453
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,110
there is an evil aura in your heart.

454
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,630
Because of this,

455
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,160
I didn't allow Yun to marry you

456
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,820
at that time.

457
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,650
Because this evil aura

458
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,190
will not only harm you

459
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,520
but also harm the people around you.

460
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,060
In the end,

461
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,740
even if you have a chance

462
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,300
to succeed,

463
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,780
so what?

464
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,540
You have the country,

465
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,100
but you're alone.

466
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,500
Is it worth it?

467
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,020
I understand

468
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,950
the grievance in your heart.

469
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,860
But the grievance in my heart...

470
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,750
Father-in-law,

471
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,130
do you understand?

472
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,620
When I was young,

473
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,740
it was the beginning of Wei's establishment,

474
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,980
and the border was unstable.

475
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,300
My father

476
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,500
decided to

477
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,100
govern the country with martial arts.

478
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,180
I was full of ambitions.

479
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,250
I practiced the art of war and martial arts hard.

480
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,340
With the determination to die,

481
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,380
I fought for

482
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,900
the country of Wei

483
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,260
and almost died.

484
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,860
When I returned to Wei,

485
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,940
my father had died

486
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,000
and the throne was inherited by someone else.

487
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
And I

488
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,500
only got a piece of fiefdom in Jiangzhou

489
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,620
and a title of Guangping.

490
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,740
Guangping?

491
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,220
What does it mean?

492
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,010
It means to bring peace to the world.

493
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,470
Most people think

494
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,590
I'm

495
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,380
a noble warrior.

496
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,820
The title granted by His Majesty

497
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,500
is the supreme honor.

498
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,180
But I know in my heart

499
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,580
that it was a humiliation to me

500
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,940
by my emperor brother.

501
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,860
He made me remember all my life,

502
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,120
even if I ended the chaos

503
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,490
with my own hands, and so what?

504
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,540
Even if I have

505
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,140
the power to bring peace to the world, so what?

506
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,580
I still have to give up

507
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,220
the throne of world domination.

508
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,550
Father-in-law.

509
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,730
When Yun was alive,

510
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,980
I never thought about going back.

511
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,100
Now that she's gone,

512
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,900
I do regret it.

513
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,140
But I know very well

514
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,660
I can't go back.

515
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,940
Forget it.

516
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,650
Leave here.

517
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,540
I'm useless.

518
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,740
The future

519
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,980
depends on

520
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,830
Ling's destiny.

521
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,540
[Yejing]

522
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,230
Lady-in-waiting Xu,

523
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,350
please take care of the case

524
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,190
in Jiangzhou.

525
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,820
I have something urgent to do. I have to go.

526
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,500
Goodbye.

527
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,940
You must be tired.

528
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,620
Did anything happen

529
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,900
during my leave?

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,680

Lady-in-waiting Xu, long time no see.

697
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,060
How have you been?

698
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,780
Enough.

699
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,450
I'm not here to see you sing.

700
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,530
Shen Yu,

701
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,530
I have something important

702
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,660
to discuss with you.

703
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,280
Good.

704
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,840
You're coming on strong.

705
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,310
It seems that you have found

706
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,070
the murderer of the Jiangzhou case,

707
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,060
and the evidence that can return the Xu Family's innocence.

708
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,740
Yes,

709
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,200
and no.

710
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,310
Look at the map.

711
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,900
Could it be...

712
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,860
Do you remember

713
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,020
what Lu He said?

714
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,060
Lu Lianshan's letter

715
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,580
to him said that

716
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,130
if he didn't return in two years,

717
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,340
he could make another ring jade

718
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,740
to open the treasure box.

719
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,970
And this map

720
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,460
was taken out

721
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,300
from the treasure box.

722
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,780
I don't know him.

723
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,090
How would I know that?

724
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,660
Okay.

725
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,840
Then let's pretend that

726
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,040
I just told you

727
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,600
and then you knew about it.

728
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,350
Take a look.

729
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,820
Where is it

730
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,010
on this map?

731
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,720
According to the terrain,

732
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,220
it seems not in Wei.

733
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:43,880
That's right.

734
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,760
It's not in Wei.

735
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,970
It's in Yigu.

736
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,060
I haven't told the Crown Prince about this.

737
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,190
Don't say it either.

738
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
What do you want?

739
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,100
Tuoba Lie wants to force Ling to be his wife.

740
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,150
The imperial edict of marriage has been announced.

741
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,260
Wei and Yigu are clearly enemies.

742
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,020
But no one wants to

743
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,170
start a war between the two countries.

744
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,340
The money was worth tens of thousands of taels,

745
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,780
But it was hidden in Yigu

746
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,040
by Lu Lianshan.

747
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,410
It's destiny.

748
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,730
Isn't this God's will?

749
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
You want to use the belongings of this money

750
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,710
to make trouble

751
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,940
between Wei and Yigu.

752
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,900
That's right.

753
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,110
This is the only way

754
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,140
to break

755
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,460
this ridiculous marriage.

756
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,190
It's dangerous for you to do it.

757
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,720
If you are careless,

758
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,150
you will be in danger.

759
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,740
How can you ask me to help you

760
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,750
with such a thing?

761
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,700
If you don't want to help me,

762
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,700
I won't force you.

763
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,940
Ling is my sister.

764
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,020
I'll figure it out.

765
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,400
The Crown Prince is suspicious and violent.

766
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,720
If they know about this,

767
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,020
he won't let it go.

768
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,820
I know what to do.

769
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,350
Please behave yourself.

770
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,740
Jin!

771
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,350
You're smart,

772
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,740
and you know what to do.

773
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,820
But why don't you

774
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,500
ever think about

775
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,370
your future?

776
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,550
Have you ever thought about it?

777
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,040
Have you thought about me?

778
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,450
How do you know I haven't?

779
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,520
Tell me then.

780
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,860
How did you think about me

781
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,570
in the past?

782
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,740
Jin!

783
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,310
I don't want you to take risks.

784
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,990
But if you have decided,

785
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,980
no matter what it is,

786
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,290
I'll be with you.

787
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,220
Jin!

788
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,620
It's difficult.

789
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,310
It's difficult.

790
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,060
Seven.

791
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,740
You can get married at any time.

792
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,400
Do you have to get married now?

793
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,830
Exactly.

794
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,830
If Lord Shen didn't come back

795
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,880
a few days ago,

796
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,040
it's fine.

797
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,530
But now that he's back,

798
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,040
it's reasonable for us

799
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,910
to tell him

800
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,370
about this wedding.

801
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,740
But Lord Shen

802
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,540
and the princess have broken up.

803
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
If he attends the wedding

804
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,900
at this time,

805
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,210
he will be

806
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,010
very sad.

807
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,980
Do you think

808
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,210
Princess Peace and Lord Shen

809
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,060
really broke up?

810
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,060
My lord.

811
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,380
-My lord. -Lord Shen.

812
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,260
My lord, I...

813
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,700
I didn't know you were here.

814
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,260
I...

815
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,540
Seven's wedding is a good thing.

816
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,220
Tonight,

817
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,560
I will go to congratulate him.

818
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,900
Princess,

819
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,940
you've been sitting here for a long time.

820
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,260
Have some more food.

821
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,740
Ling Bi.

822
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,820
From now on,

823
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,140
close the windows.

824
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,700
No need to open them.

825
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
Anyway,

826
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,740
he won't come again.

827
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,020
Princess,

828
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,410
I want to ask for a leave

829
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,580
and go out for two hours,

830
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,380
is it okay?

831
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,580
Luo.

832
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,890
Luo.

833
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,250
Luo.

834
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

835
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,690
How inappropriate!

836
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,460
A girl is looking for you,

837
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,060
called Ling...

838
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,240
Ling Bi.

839
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,020
I was about to send the invitation

840
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,950
to the administration of Nandian.

841
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,730
As soon as I went out,

842
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,390
I saw her standing at the door.

843
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,140
Am I handsome?

844
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,650
Yes.

845
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,490
Okay.

846
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,900
Miss Ling Bi.

847
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,660
Mr. Luo.

848
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,580
I beg you.

849
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,420
Don't kneel.

850
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,900
Tell me. What's wrong?

851
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Mr. Luo,

852
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,750
please do something.

853
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,380
Can you let Lord Shen

854
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,700
see our princess?

855
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,540
I have no choice.

856
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,300
It's already like this.

857
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:39,980
You know

858
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,580
Lord Shen is arrogant.

859
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
He may never

860
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,680
see your princess again.

861
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,570
But the princess

862
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,900
is so pitiful.

863
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,660
She doesn't eat or drink every day.

864
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,420
She just stared at

865
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,980
the window in the bedroom.

866
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,780
This marriage is wrong,

867
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,240
but is the princess wrong?

868
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,650
What should we do?

869
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,500
Why did they do this to her?

870
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,180
This kind of thing

871
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,820
are not meant to be.

872
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,300
Let your princess get over it.

873
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,660
The princess is going to Jiangzhou

874
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,340
to prepare for the marriage in a few days.

875
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,860
I will be with her

876
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,180
as her dowry maid.

877
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,980
But it's useless.

878
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,660
Everyone knows that the person

879
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,540
-the princess needs is not me. -Wait.

880
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,470
What did you say?

881
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,460
You going to Yigu

882
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,520
with the princess.

883
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,060
No.

884
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,150
Absolutely not.

885
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,500
What's wrong?

886
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,580
No.

887
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,220
I mean

888
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,740
we can't let the princess and Lord Shen

889
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,460
break up like this,

890
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,020
right?

891
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,900
Do you have any way?

892
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,060
Tonight,

893
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,230
Seven of the administration Beidian

894
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,400
will get married.

895
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,310
Lord Shen said

896
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,520
he would definitely go.

897
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,110
You

898
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,060
just let your princess

899
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,900
go to the ceremony,

900
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,460
and they will definitely meet.

901
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,380
That's great.

902
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,000
Really?

903
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,260
Of course.

904
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,020
Don't say I said it.

905
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,570
Fine.

906
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,580
I'll tell the princess now.

907
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,440
Okay, go ahead.

908
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,300
Ling...

909
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,200
Thank you.

910
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,150
Please come in.

911
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,250
Please come in.

912
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,630
Long time no see.

913
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,140
Take a seat.

914
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,500
Luo.

915
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,250
Come in.

916
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,380
Come in and help me.

917
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,100
Coming.

918
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,900
It's the auspicious time.

919
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,420
Bow.

920
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,380
Bow to heaven and earth.

921
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,300
Bow to your parents.

922
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,780
Bow to each other.

923
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,250
Bow.
