[Episode 14]

4
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,310
Kill!

5
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,350
Lianshan did ask someone

6
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,760
to hand over the box of the Kun jade

7
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,630
to me.

8
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,500
In the box

9
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,910
there was a handwriting letter of him.

10
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,579
In the letter,

11
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,650
he said

12
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,780
he risked his life

13
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,020
to steal money from the Jiangzhou treasury.

14
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,930
If he came back alive,

15
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,050
it meant he got rid of

16
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,890
those spies.

17
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,100
By then,

18
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,460
both of us

19
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,350
could take the money

20
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,880
and change our names

21
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,460
and live a carefree and wealthy life.

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,670
If he couldn't come back,

23
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,300
I can

24
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,220
make myself a Qian and Kun jade

25
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,940
to open the box

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,040
and get the money alone.

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,360
Lianshan

28
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,620
did such evil things,

29
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,130
but he never wants me to

30
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,870
get involved in the conflicts

31
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,180
between the government and Family Lu.

32
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,980
He kept reminding me

33
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,630
not to

34
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,450
revenge.

35
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,850
But you just said

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,780
Lianshan asked you to come to me

37
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,050
for the

38
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,480
box of Qian and Kun jade

39
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,880
in order to avenge him.

40
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,550
This is not

41
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,260
what Lianshan would do.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,440
That's right.

43
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,940
The box you want

44
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,500
is indeed

45
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,380
in my hands.

46
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,270
But unfortunately,

47
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,180
there's only one box.

48
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,000
If any of you can survive to the end,

49
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,900
I will

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,040
give it to him.

51
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm just a warrior.

52
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,410
I'm not

53
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,900
as graceful as you.

54
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,510
For you,

55
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,700
you can refuse to give the box of Qian and Kun jade

56
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,959
to the the Jinlin Guard

57
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,490
or Family Lu,

58
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,730
but if

59
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,000
Lady-in-waiting Xu outside

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,900
asks it from you,

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
you definitely can't refuse her.

62
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,140
My lord,

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,670
what do you mean?

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,220
In your eyes,

65
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,940
Lu Lianshan is your beloved disciple.

66
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,740
You treats him like your own son.

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,670
But in Lady-in-waiting Xu's eyes,

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,260
Lu Lianshan

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,180
is a villain who

70
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,790
worships money

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,550
and killed her parents.

72
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,100
The Lady-in-waiting's surname is Xu.

73
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,020
Could it be...

74
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,940
Yes.

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,740
In the Jiangzhou case,

76
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,060
the Xu couple who believed in Lu Lianshan

77
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,990
and was framed as the main culprit,

78
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,180
and ended up with death with unjust

79
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,010
are her parents.

80
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,830
Mr. Lu He.

81
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,650
The tea

82
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,540
is cold.

83
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,880
Mr. Lu He.

84
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,330
Don't break your promise!

85
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,659
The game is over.

86
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,700
You should keep your promise

87
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,380
and hand over the box of Qian and Kun jade.

88
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,300
You said

89
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,140
you lost your son,

90
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,070
and couldn't let it go.

91
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,080
But Lady-in-waiting Xu

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,700
lost her parents at an young age

93
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,340
just because of your son.

94
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,510
Don't you think

95
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,940
you should apologize to

96
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,140
Lady-in-waiting Xu?

97
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,740
Sir,

98
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,430
I've been planning for years.

99
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,350
I'm here today

100
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,670
to bring the real criminal

101
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,460
of the Jiangzhou Case into justice

102
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,260
and clear my parents' name.

103
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,260
Please give me the box

104
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,480
to help me express my filial devotion to my parents.

105
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,220
Please rise.

106
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,570
I feel unworthy of

107
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,430
your courtesy.

108
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,680
The innocence of the Xu family

109
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,850
was owed by Lianshan.

110
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,130
The box of Qian and Kun jade...

111
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,380
Just

112
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,380
take it.

113
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,020
The crime committed by my disciple

114
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,960
hurt your family so much.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,480
I

116
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,929
cannot deny it.

117
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,179
I feel guilty.

118
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,659
I hope

119
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,809
the thing in this box

120
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,980
can fulfill your wish

121
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,170
of clearing Family Xu's name.

122
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,820
Thank you, sir.

[Duke Dingbei's Mansion]

124
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,500
Is this your house?

125
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,660
Isn't it big?

126
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,020
Look.

127
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,410
There is a backyard.

128
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,350
Princess.

129
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,980
Ning?

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,290
Brother Hong?

131
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,100
Brother Hong?

132
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,890
Yuan Zhelin!

133
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,380
I've been wandering around for three years.

134
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,580
I've been looking for you for three years.

135
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,040
Since you're still alive,

136
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,370
why didn't you send a message

137
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,660
to me?

138
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,740
Ning.

139
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,580
Listen to me.

140
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,620
-I... -Shut up!

141
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,020
I'll kill you!

142
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,950
Ning.

143
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,220
So,

144
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,160
Yang Ye

145
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,590
is her Brother Hong.

146
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,350
It was Yang Ye who offended you.

147
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,540
Why are you fighting with this bottle?

148
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,980
He's not Yang Ye.

149
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,970
He's Yuan Zhelin.

150
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,370
Is he really

151
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,710
your Brother Hong,

152
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,410
or Yuan Zhelin?

153
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,420
It's a long story.

154
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,580
Three years ago,

155
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,540
Yuan promised to

156
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,900
retire

157
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,620
and live with me.

158
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,540
But he was

159
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,500
the leader of the best assassin gang

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,700
of the martial world.

161
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,790
It was not that easy

162
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,930
to escape safely.

163
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,530
As a leader,

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,490
he can't decide where to go.

165
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,460
Yuan Zhelin was planning

166
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,860
to retire.

167
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,150
The elders of the gang

168
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,860
knew they couldn't keep him.

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,180
After discussion,

170
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,680
they decided to make him

171
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,340
do something big for the gang.

172
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,520
That is to challenge

173
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,730
the masters of

174
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,580
the Four Righteous Sects

175
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,780
in the martial world.

176
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,740
Only Yuan and the four masters

177
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,890
knew the place

178
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,320
of the battle that day.

179
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,640
Nobody had the chance to watch it.

180
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,430
I was waiting for news at home.

181
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,630
I heard

182
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,450
he defeated the four masters.

183
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,220
I was very happy.

184
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,570
I thought as long as he came back,

185
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,300
I could be with him forever.

186
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,340
We could live a carefree life

187
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,460
together.

188
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,940
But I waited for him day after day,

189
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,900
and he never came back.

190
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,140
Now it seems

191
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,420
he must have been

192
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,620
severely injured

193
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,880
in that fierce battle.

194
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,430
After that, he ended up in Jiangzhou,

195
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,900
and was accidentally rescued

196
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,420
by you.

197
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,220
I thought

198
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,310
he was a hero.

199
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,440
I didn't expect

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,370
his background is so complicated.

201
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,580
You saved his life.

202
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,430
I have nothing to say if he wants to repay you.

203
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,930
But it's been three years.

204
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,520
Over 1,000 days and nights,

205
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,690
I was looking for him everywhere.

206
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,500
I was afraid he would be killed by his enemies.

207
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,030
I couldn't sleep tight.

208
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,640
But what about him?

209
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,330
He didn't even send a message

210
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,710
to me.

211
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,830
Maybe

212
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,230
he

213
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
did

214
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,110
send you a message.

215
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,570
In the past three years,

216
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,110
you've been traveling around

217
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,990
to look for him.

218
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,460
If he wrote to you,

219
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,890
you may fail to receive.

220
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,300
That's just an excuse.

221
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,260
If he wanted to tell me,

222
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
he will find me.

223
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,130
I, Qin Ning,

224
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,510
swear to revenge!

225
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,090
Still want to revenge?

226
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,020
When you were fighting just now,

227
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,100
he was obviously giving ground.

228
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,550
Even if you want him to die now,

229
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,220
he will give his life to you.

230
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,770
Heroine Qin,

231
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,720
do you really want to kill him

232
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,040
to solve the problem?

233
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,300
Qin Ning.

234
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,400
Life is short.

235
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,600
It's a pity for you

236
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,040
to waste three years.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
The top priority now is not

238
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,110
how to take revenge.

239
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,260
You should think about

240
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,380
how to stop him from repaying me

241
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,350
so that you can leave

242
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,510
and live together.

243
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,140
To repay you?

244
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,650
Yes.

245
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,920
Why didn’t I think of it?

246
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,570
Ling,

247
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,640
you enlightened me!

248
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,580
You are really my lucky star.

249
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,030
Yuan Zhelin

250
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
wanted to repay you for saving his life.

251
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,060
But for three years,

252
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,920
he hasn't found the opportunity.

253
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,480
If I can

254
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,060
repay you

255
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,980
before he does,

256
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,250
does that mean

257
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,180
he owes me

258
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,240
another big favor?

259
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,680
Then,

260
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,950
he has to think about

261
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,240
how to repay me.

262
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,990
He will rack his brains.

263
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,900
Then my revenge plan

264
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,820
will finish.

265
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,560
No.

266
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,890
That's not what I meant.

267
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,890
Calm down.

268
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
Let me think about

269
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,780
how to repay your kindness.

270
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,420
I'll discuss with you later.

271
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,140
How can I

272
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,780
repay your kindness?

273
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,870
You go on.

274
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,220
I'm going to bed.

275
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,100
If he can...

276
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,030
Today, the crown prince

277
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,540
summoned you to the palace.

278
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,600
What are you talking about?

279
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
What was he up to?

280
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,190
He began with some gossip,

281
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,280
and then we tried to sound out.

282
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,300
Maybe

283
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,060
he has noticed

284
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,520
what you and I planned?

285
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,370
Under such a circumstance,

286
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,310
how can you still laugh?

287
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,060
The father hid behind

288
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,200
and just sent his little son

289
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,080
to talk with me.

290
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,060
Isn't it funny?

291
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
Father, don't worry.

292
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,490
As long as what I'm doing in the camp

293
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,630
goes well,

294
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,430
we will succeed.

295
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,690
Then not to mention Liu Wang,

296
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,030
even His Majesty won't be a threat.

297
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,130
But as for the military expenses,

298
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,090
you need to work harder.

299
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,010
Tell me, how much more do you need?

300
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,540
Five million taels.

301
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,180
Liu Lishan,

302
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,100
do you want to

303
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,330
impoverish me?

304
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,450
What if I say yes?

305
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,610
Father,

306
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,100
you forced me

307
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,120
to marry your daughter

308
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,410
into our House of Guangping Prince

309
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,720
with the money of Jiangzhou

310
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,950
as a bargaining chip.

311
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,590
Weren't you planning for

312
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,290
the current situation?

313
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,070
Don't hesitate.

314
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,800
If I can succeed,

315
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,300
your family will be royal family.

316
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,490
If not,

317
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,350
the crime of treason

318
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,340
will cause execution.

319
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,640
Five million taels is not a small amount.

320
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,630
It will take some time.

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,100
Father,

322
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,910
be quick.

323
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,880
Your Highness,

324
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,020
even you know

325
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,190
Yigu State came to pay tribute.

326
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,710
It's such an honor to the state.

327
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,850
The situation is turbulent.

328
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,580
I heard that the emperor of Yigu

329
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,940
exhausted all resources to build up the military power.

330
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,540
I'm afraid he has been disloyal for a long time.

331
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,460
This time,

332
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,530
they came when the crown prince is in charge of supervising the state.

333
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,810
We should be careful.

334
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,220
In your opinion,

335
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,830
besides the tribute,

336
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,170
do they

337
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,020
have other plans?

338
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,450
I don't care.

339
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,910
As long as the request is not too much,

340
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,820
I believe

341
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,329
His Highness

342
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,010
will give them what they want.

343
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,430
Lord Li.

344
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,290
Summon Tuoba Lie.

345
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:21,339
Summon the Crown Prince of Yigu, Tuoba Lie.

346
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,230
[The Crown Prince of Yigu State, Tuoba Lie]

347
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,490
The Crown Prince of Yigu, Tuoba Lie,

348
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,820
is here to greet you, Your Highness.

349
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,420
You don't have to be so polite.

350
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,300
Please rise.

351
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

352
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,690
I heard that the Emperor of Wei

353
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,600
is sick.

354
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
My father couldn't sleep or eat well.

355
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,620
He ordered me to

356
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,900
bring some

357
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,950
rare herbs from Yigu to His Majesty

358
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,750
to show our sincerity.

359
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,280
I hope

360
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,580
the Emperor of Wei

361
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
can get well soon.

362
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,910
[List of tributes]

363
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,910
The Tuoba family is so thoughtful.

364
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,250
My father

365
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,770
is fine.

366
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,180
He was just busy with the court affairs.

367
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,860
So he was a little upset.

368
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,100
He

369
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,740
is resting in the palace.

370
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,420
Look at me.

371
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,510
I've been busy talking

372
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,020
with you.

373
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,820
I forgot to ask you

374
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,430
about an important matter.

375
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,060
I heard that at this time last year,

376
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,300
your father went hunting

377
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,920
and fell off the horse,

378
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,100
and was badly injured.

379
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,650
I wonder

380
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,790
whether he has recovered?

381
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,560
Thank you for your concern.

382
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,060
My father has recovered now.

383
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,150
It's just a minor injury.

384
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,300
No need to worry.

385
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,380
That's great.

386
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,210
Brother Tuoba,

387
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,920
you've been traveling

388
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,020
for a long time.

389
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,380
I've ordered someone to prepare a room for you.

390
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,660
You

391
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,680
can take a rest.

392
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,940
Later,

393
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,940
I'll hold a banquet

394
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,480
in the Eastern Palace

395
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,780
to welcome you.

396
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,060
Your Highness.

397
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,580
We didn't come here

398
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,340
just to pay tribute.

399
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,110
There is one more thing.

400
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,910
I hope Your Majesty and Your Highness could kindly permit.

401
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,200
Please go ahead.

402
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,770
Although I'm the Crown Prince of Yigu,

403
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,280
I haven't got a wife.

404
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,540
Following

405
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,910
my father's order,

406
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,380
I come here to

407
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,610
beg your permission

408
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,670
to allow me to marry a princess of Wei.

409
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,780
I hope Your Majesty and Your Highness

410
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,820
could help me

411
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,460
fulfill my wish.

412
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,540
The marriage will be a bond between our two countries

413
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,060
and a symbol of peace.

414
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,140
I already know

415
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,620
your request.

416
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,940
By the way,

417
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,980
I heard

418
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,020
you

419
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,930
and Lu Mingshan

420
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,910
got along well with each other.

421
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
I'll let him

422
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,350
accompany you to travel around the capital

423
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,300
for a few days.

424
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,960
As for the marriage,

425
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,760
let me

426
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,890
think about it.

427
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,590
I will surely give you

428
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,060
a satisfying answer.

429
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,340
Good.

430
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,540
I'll

431
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,360
wait for the good news.

432
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,180
How dare a barbarian

433
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,410
ask permission to

434
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,140
marry the Princess of Wei?

435
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,460
A symbol

436
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,260
of peace?

437
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,200
His disloyal heart

438
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,100
is already obvious.

439
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,180
Lord Li,

440
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,060
ask Lord Xu and Lord Shen

441
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,100
to the Eastern Palace for a meeting.

442
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,170
As for the rest,

443
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,640
let them go.

444
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,970
I don't want to see those losers.

445
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,810
You saw

446
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,120
what happened in the palace just now.

447
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,420
Tell me what you think.

448
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,280
Your Highness.

449
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,980
I think

450
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,060
Tuoba Lie

451
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,190
took the opportunity

452
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,590
of paying tribute

453
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,180
to propose marriage.

454
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,500
It's obviously a test.

455
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Last year,

456
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,620
they sent us a thousand boxes of pearls and jade.

457
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,810
But this year only a hundred.

458
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,110
Last years they sent us a hundred steeds.

459
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,840
This years only cows and sheep.

460
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,170
In your opinion,

461
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,210
should I approve of

462
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,730
the marriage

463
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,500
or not?

464
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,300
Your Highness.

465
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,410
You shouldn't

466
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,300
approve

467
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,570
or

468
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,210
disapprove.

469
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,490
What do you mean?

470
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,970
If Your Highness doesn't allow the marriage,

471
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,430
it will hurt the Tuoba family's reputation.

472
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,120
After he goes back,

473
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,450
he will use this as an excuse

474
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,180
to lead troops into the border.

475
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,450
If it's approved,

476
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
even if it solves the urgent matter,

477
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,020
but

478
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,990
they will find that

479
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,080
we are unwilling to start a war.

480
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,580
In the future,

481
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,010
they'll push us step by step.

482
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,190
The Tuoba family

483
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,110
only occupies a tiny piece of land.

484
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,240
In terms of wealth and military power,

485
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,240
how can it compare with Wei?

486
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,820
Instead of waiting for Yigu to attack us,

487
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,470
it's better for Wei

488
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,480
to deploy troops now

489
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,780
and strike first.

490
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,240
Your Highness,

491
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,100
I don't think it's appropriate.

492
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,540
If the war starts,

493
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,750
the people will suffer.

494
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,340
This is not

495
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,490
what you want to see.

496
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,550
In my opinion,

497
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,260
if Tuoba Lie

498
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
brings this up

499
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,030
again,

500
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,940
you may agree first

501
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,330
and choose a suitable candidate

502
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,870
to marry him.

503
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,470
That will

504
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,260
delay their plans.

505
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,340
And in this way,

506
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,660
you prioritize the welfare of the people

507
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,820
over the dignity of the royal family.

508
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,290
There is a saying that

509
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,450
a man who is not content is like a snake which tries to swallow an elephant.

510
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,850
When Tuoba Lie

511
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,630
gets carried away

512
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,600
or offends the dignity of Wei,

513
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,230
you can discuss with His Majesty

514
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,770
how to deploy troops.

515
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,100
Trying fair means before resorting to force.

516
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,090
What a brilliant idea, Lord Xu.

517
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,090
We will have room for manoeuvre.

518
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,650
Very good.

519
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,620
Lord Xu.

520
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,380
if it weren't for

521
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,170
the Jiangzhou case,

522
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,740
I think

523
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,620
you could have

524
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,020
enjoyed a higher rank

525
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,420
in Wei.

526
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,870
You flatter me, Your Highness.

527
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,340
After crossing the mountain ahead,

528
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,130
and then walking a few miles,

529
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,340
we will arrive at Yejing

530
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,420
within three days.

531
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,420
We've been on the go for days.

532
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,500
If you

533
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
feel tired,

534
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,820
I will go first,

535
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,540
and you can

536
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,500
walk slowly

537
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,530
with Ghost-face.

538
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,180
Let your feet have a rest.

539
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,100
It's fine.

540
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,460
Come to think of it,

541
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,820
I have been away from the capital

542
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,810
for a month.

543
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,530
I miss Ling

544
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,940
just like you do.

545
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
I want to go back as soon as possible.

546
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,780
Cheers, Brother Tuoba.

547
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,520
Crown Prince Tuoba,

548
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,450
you came all the way to the capital.

549
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,760
You must be exhausted.

550
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,370
Shan and I reserved

551
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,870
the Flower Pavilion

552
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,750
to entertain you.

553
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,990
I wonder whether the dance today

554
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,390
satisfies you.

555
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,780
The dance is not bad.

556
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,620
But...

557
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,860
When I proposed in the palace that day,

558
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,820
your crown prince

559
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,420
promised me that

560
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,050
he would give me

561
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,250
a satisfying answer.

562
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,660
But so many days have passed.

563
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,200
I haven't heard from him.

564
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,300
It seems

565
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,060
he looks down on

566
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,760
the Yigu State,

567
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,550
a small place near the border.

568
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,580
You worry too much.

569
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,580
Although Wei

570
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,060
is a large state,

571
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,700
but it's actually

572
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,340
outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

573
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,070
But Yigu is totally different.

574
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,940
With heroes like you

575
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,460
and the king of Yigu,

576
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,140
the Yigu State

577
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,260
will be

578
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,580
thriving and flourishing.

579
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,220
Bravo!

580
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,820
Bravo!

581
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,960
Brother Tuoba,

582
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,980
if you like the girl who is dancing,

583
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,360
after she finishes this song,

584
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,570
I'll order someone

585
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,020
to send her to your room,

586
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,730
and you can have an intimate talk.

587
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,600
Okay.

588
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,800
I'll be right back.

589
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,700
Young Master.

590
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,140
I heard that

591
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,310
Tiger Shou failed in Xuanwu Town.

592
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,300
He was killed by Shen Yan.

593
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,820
Where is the thing?

594
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,060
If the information is correct,

595
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,020
the thing

596
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,200
has fallen into Shen Yan's hands.

597
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,540
OK, I see.

598
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,490
You may leave.

599
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,890
OK.

600
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,300
Brother Lu,

601
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,090
the princess who

602
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,070
your crown prince will allow to marry me

603
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,190
should be

604
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,420
no less beautiful than

605
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,700
these girls.

606
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,680
Otherwise,

607
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,060
I won't accept it.

608
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,560
Brother Tuoba,

609
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,260
the Yigu State

610
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,570
is quite powerful now.

611
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,730
I think

612
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,160
instead of waiting for the approval,

613
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,380
you can choose a lady

614
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,940
you like

615
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,700
from the royal families.

616
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,710
Then you may ask permission from the crown prince.

617
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,790
If you just wait here,

618
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,280
I'm afraid you'll miss

619
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,190
an exceedingly beautiful noble lady.

620
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,950
Among the noble families of Wei,

621
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,260
is there an exceedingly beautiful lady?

622
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,180
If you don't believe me,

623
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,860
come with me

624
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,050
to see her.

625
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,240
Add wine and light up to have another feast.

626
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,050
Ling Bi.

627
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,320
I don't know what's wrong with me today.

628
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,140
I feel very nervous.

629
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,700
I quit.

630
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,330
Why is it so hard

631
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,010
to embroider Shen Yan's name?

632
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,650
So complicated!

633
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,360
I won't finish

634
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,780
before he comes back.

635
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,410
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

636
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,180
If you

637
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,790
think it's too complicated,

638
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,470
you can just embroider

639
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,580
two vertical bars

640
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,000
to represent the two characters.

641
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,540
That will save us a lot of trouble.

642
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,930
How dare you make fun of me?

643
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,210
I’ll beat you!

644
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,940
Ling.

645
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,820
Hurry.

646
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,710
I know

647
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,670
how to repay

648
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,590
your kindness as soon as possible.

649
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,860
Come with me.

650
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,190
Hurry up.

651
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,280
Where are we going?

652
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,460
Qin Ning.

653
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,680
Does your way to repay my kindness

654
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,850
has anything to do with the well?

655
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,260
It has something to do with the well.

656
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,660
I'll ask the Ling Bi

657
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,170
to bring Yuan Zhelin here.

658
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,250
When he comes,

659
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,890
you pretend to

660
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,460
accidentally fall into this well.

661
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,650
Then I will throw this bucket

662
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,400
down.

663
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,320
You just need to hold this bucket.

664
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,770
And then I'll

665
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,760
pull it up...

666
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,220
This...

667
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,200
This way doesn't work.

668
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,520
It's more effective to hang yourself from a beam.

669
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,260
You just need to stand on the chair.

670
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,940
When you kick the chair,

671
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,740
I will throw out my dagger.

672
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,940
Forget it.

673
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,860
I think you should

674
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,700
listen to me.

675
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,850
Just forget it.

676
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,450
Actually, I know

677
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,840
my methods

678
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,590
are against justice.

679
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,210
But

680
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,280
if I can end this matter,

681
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,750
I wouldn't have

682
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,410
made things difficult for you.

683
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,330
I know Yuan so well.

684
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,780
If he doesn't repay your kindness,

685
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,500
he won't leave with me.

686
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,180
Do you

687
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,550
really want to repay?

688
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,270
As soon as possible.

689
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,780
Alright.

690
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,770
You helped me

691
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,910
in front of Mrs. Shen.

692
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,950
I should help you this time.

693
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,320
Ling.

694
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,270
Are you serious?

695
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,460
Yes.

696
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,770
But we have a deal.

697
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,050
You have to follow my advice.

698
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,900
I'll listen to you.

699
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,110
[Duke Dingbei's Mansion]

700
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,130
My lord, you're here.

701
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,300
The Crown Prince of Tuoba condescends to

702
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,330
Duke Dingbei's Mansion.

703
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,620
We're honored to have you here.

704
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,130
Please.

705
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,960
Please.

706
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,040
Is Duke Dingbei here?

707
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,490
He has been waiting for a long time.

708
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,000
Please.

709
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,180
Father.

710
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,910
He's here.

711
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,650
I'm Lu Mingshan.

712
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,190
Greetings, My lord.

713
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,260
My lord.

714
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,960
This is the Crown Prince of Yigu,

715
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,680
Tuoba Lie.

716
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,640
Why don't you salute me

717
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,270
when you see me?

718
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,820
Well, you

719
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,270
confused me.

720
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,460
You are

721
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,410
the Crown Prince of Yigu.

722
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,980
I'm a minister of Wei.

723
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,430
We have nothing to do

724
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,110
with each other.

725
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,020
Salute?

726
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
Why should I salute you?

727
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,300
I could have refused to see you

728
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,220
since you came without informing me beforehand.

729
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
But considering

730
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,890
your father was a hero,

731
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,340
I give you some respect.

732
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,620
Tell me.

733
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,720
What brings you here

734
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,230
out of a sudden?

735
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,280
Good.

736
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,600
Straightforward.

737
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,260
I like it.

738
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,120
I came to the capital of Wei

739
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,500
to

740
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,820
marry a noble lady of Wei

741
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,940
to be

742
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,260
my Crown Princess.

743
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,659
I heard Princess Changle

744
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,300
is exceedingly beautiful.

745
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,940
So,

746
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,400
please ask her

747
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,170
to come here.

748
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,020
Let me

749
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,389
take a good look.

750
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,380
Crown Prince Tuoba,

751
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,860
if you're here for this,

752
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:30,080
I'll have to disappoint you.

753
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,389
Ling is not feeling well.

754
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,739
She can't come out.

755
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,889
Please go back.

756
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,659
Damn old man.

757
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,920
Calm down, Brother Tuoba.

758
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,630
Duke Dingbei has always been like this.

759
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,030
Don't take it seriously.

760
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,560
Let's go.

761
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,500
I heard Princess Wuyou

762
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,590
instigated Princess Changle to jump into the river.

763
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,460
I think we should forget it.

764
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,580
Ling.

765
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,670
Don’t be afraid.

766
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,740
Just close your eyes

767
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
and jump down.

768
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
I promise

769
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,340
nothing will happen.

770
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,100
You...

771
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,020
You...

772
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,690
That's easy for you to say.

773
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,910
You're not repaying my kindness for Yang Ye.

774
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,450
You're obviously seeking revenge!

775
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm repaying you.

776
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,060
Of course.

777
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,740
My dear Ling.

778
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,490
As long as you

779
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,820
fulfill my wish today,

780
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,010
I, Qin Ning,

781
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,310
will remember your kindness forever.

782
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,000
All right.

783
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,340
Over there.

784
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,130
Shen Yan,

785
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,300
for all these years, I've worked so hard,

786
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,100
but you ruined all of my efforts.

787
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,660
I should

788
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,470
repay you today.

789
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,580
You...

790
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,100
Who are you?

791
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,010
Shameless!

792
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,910
Gather your sweet rosebuds while you may.

793
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,270
Since you like

794
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,760
Princess Changle,

795
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,650
why don't you go to the palace

796
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,160
and ask the crown prince for permission?

797
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,180
Duke Dingbei is so tough.

798
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,250
What if the crown prince

799
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
doesn't approve?

800
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,530
Now the army of Yigu is strong.

801
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,980
Yigu is so powerful now.

802
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,610
And the Emperor of Wei

803
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,690
wants to avoid war.

804
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,430
If he doesn't agree,

805
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,980
why don't you

806
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,900
threaten him with the war?

807
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,710
Don't worry.

808
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
What you want is just a marriage.

809
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,450
Compared to the safety of the Wei people,

810
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,850
which is more important?

811
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,280
Are you still afraid

812
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,990
you can't get what you want?

813
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,680
[Duke Dingbei's Mansion]

814
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,050
The emperor issued this imperial edict:

815
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,860
Princess Changle, Liu Ling,

816
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,130
is noble, virtuous and polite.

817
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,510
Knowledgeable and intelligent.

818
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,170
elegant and prudent.

819
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,560
She has served the palace for a long time.

820
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,020
She has been a comfort to me.

821
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,050
I'm conferring the title of Princess Peace to her.

822
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,770
I allow her to marry Tuobo Lie.

823
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,670
By the emperor himself.

824
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,140
Princess Peace,

825
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,090
accept the edict.

826
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,900
What are you waiting for?

827
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,340
Go comfort her.

828
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,180
Go.

829
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,900
Look.

830
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,180
Virtuous and polite.

831
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,720
Knowledgeable and intelligent.

832
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,270
Such a compliment!

833
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,860
Ling,

834
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,940
since you are conferred Princess Peace by His Majesty,

835
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,520
from now on,

836
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,580
you are a member of the royal family.

837
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,860
Ling,

838
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,210
congratulations!

839
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,640
What?

840
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,210
What are you talking about?

841
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,570
Our Ling

842
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,980
has been

843
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,100
a member of the royal family.

844
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,900
In addition to being conferred,

845
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,700
she will marry the Crown Prince of Yigu.

846
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,600
Now she is the Crown Princess.

847
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,400
In the future,

848
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,280
she will be the Empress of Yigu.

849
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,040
She will be above everyone.

850
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,120
What a blessing!

851
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,320
But I

852
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,020
don't want such a blessing.

853
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,740
Do you like it?

854
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,580
If you like it,

855
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,860
write a divorce letter,

856
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,020
and divorce my uncle.

857
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,580
I can ask His Majesty

858
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,890
to make you

859
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,910
become the distinguished empress.

860
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,580
You...

861
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,450
If the imperial edict was about me,

862
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,020
I would be so willing to marry him.

863
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,580
This...

864
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,900
How dare you!

865
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,780
Yang Ye,

866
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,270
get the carriage ready.

867
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,840
Move.

868
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,710
-You can't go. -You can't go.

869
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,340
If you break into the palace arbitrarily,

870
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,690
His Majesty will be angry.

871
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,860
Our family will be in trouble.

872
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,930
If she should go against His Majesty's will,

873
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,450
I'm afraid all of us in Duke Dingbei's Mansion

874
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,970
would be in great trouble!

875
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,110
Father,

876
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,960
you can't indulge her anymore.

877
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,340
Father, please discipline her.

878
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,290
Discipline her.

879
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Ling.

880
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,060
Grandpa.

881
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,220
Are you going to stop me, too?

882
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,660
It's not easy to ask His Majesty

883
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,860
to retract the order.

884
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,000
I

885
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,430
have to go with you.

886
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,820
Let's go.

887
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,310
Father, you can't go! Father!

888
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,740
Move!

889
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,820
No, you really can't go, Father.

890
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,300
Move!

891
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,820
Father!

892
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,430
Father, you can't go!

893
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:30,920
This...

894
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,300
Oh no.

895
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,780
Our House of Duke Dingbei

896
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,360
is so miserable!

897
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,160
[Jinghe Palace]

898
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,240
What did His Majesty say?

899
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,450
Still the same.

900
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,920
Refuse to meet anyone.

901
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,160
Duke,

902
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,440
His Majesty is recuperating in the palace.

903
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,500
He won't see anyone without an edict.

904
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,720
You and princess broke into the palace like this.

905
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,520
It's against the heaven's will.

906
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,720
You should take the princess

907
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,110
to go back.

908
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,840
-Grandpa. -Duke Dingbei

909
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,140
and Princess Peace

910
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,470
are here to meet you, Your Majesty.

911
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,310
Please allow us, Your Majesty.

912
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,100
My dear duke,

913
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,770
you...

914
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,070
Why are you doing this?

915
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,700
Your request

916
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,830
really puts His Majesty in a difficult position.

917
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,150
His Majesty won't see you.

918
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,740
If you insist on it,

919
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,780
and it irritates His Majesty,

920
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,700
I am afraid that

921
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,580
something bad will happen.

922
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,830
Lord,

923
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,540
I understand

924
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,090
what you said.

925
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,310
But

926
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,220
I only have

927
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,790
one granddaughter.

928
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,420
She has suffered

929
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,290
a lot.

930
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,100
Well...

931
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,790
Grandpa.

932
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,290
Don't kneel anymore.

933
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,850
Since His Majesty wants me to marry him,

934
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,180
I should kneel myself.

935
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,500
This matter

936
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,030
has nothing to do with the House of Duke Dingbei.

937
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,430
Go back now.

938
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,190
Silly girl.

939
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,750
you can't

940
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,320
handle it

941
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,170
on your own.

942
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,840
It’s OK.

943
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,110
My body is not

944
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,450
as weak as you think.

945
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,740
Don’t worry.

946
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,400
Grandpa.
