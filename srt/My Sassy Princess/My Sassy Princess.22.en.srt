00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,780
In my lifetime,

5
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,100
if you don't leave me,

6
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,710
I won't abandon you.

7
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,370
You are the only person

8
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,380
that keeps spinning

9
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,750

Ling.

You scared me.

65
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,820
You scared me.

66
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,710
All right.

67
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,820
Stop crying.

68
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,280
I made you worry.

69
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,540
The whole thing

70
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,980
was just a trap

71
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,380
set by Prince Guangping.

72
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,740
I lied to you.

74
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,980
What trap?

75
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,420
That night, when I visited the mansion,

76
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,730
Prince Guangping said

77
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,760
he would give me an answer

78
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,390
after the anniversary of your mother's death,

79
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,659
I was

80
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,230
suspicious of him.

81
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,450
I took out the wine in the jar

82
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,630
and found that the wine was poisonous.

83
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,040
Although the poison is not fatal,

84
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,600
it'll weaken people's limbs

85
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,540
and cause people to vomit blood.

86
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,110
Since you knew

87
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,400
the wine was not fatal,

88
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,530
then why did you

89
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,460
jump off the cliff?

90
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,230
This is also Prince Guangping's trick

91
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,910
to deceive the world.

92
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,290
Shen Yu?

93
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,090
Why did he come?

94
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,580
He has always been well-informed.

95
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,980
He heard that you and I went to Jiangzhou

96
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,110
on imperial orders.

97
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,040
He and Lady-in-waiting Xu were worried.

98
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
That's why he secretly came to help.

99
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,860
Thanks to his help,

100
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,500
I have the chance

101
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,030
to sneak out of the prison

102
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,350
at night

103
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,960
and come to see you,

104
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,740
so that you can rest assured.

105
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,810
Since my father

106
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,780
decided to rebel,

107
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,300
why did you try so hard

108
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,890
to deceive Tuoba Lie

109
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,980
and Lu Mingshan?

110
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,550
I did that for you.

111
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,310
Prince Guangping wanted to kill me

112
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,320
in order to cooperate

113
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,280
with Tuoba Lie.

114
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,380
But in his heart,

115
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,100
he still cares about

116
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,580
the relationship between you and him.

117
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,660
That's why

118
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,700
he tried his best

119
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,260
to save my life.

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,520
Your father

121
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,860
is not a

122
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,780
cold-blooded and heartless person.

123
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,730
He was just

124
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,460
blinded by

125
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,020
power and wealth.

126
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,460
That's why

127
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
he couldn't extricate himself.

128
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,280
It doesn't matter whether

129
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,250
he cares about me or not.

130
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,650
For me,

131
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,300
I only want you.

132
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,100
I only want you back.

133
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,860
Ling,

134
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,100
this time I just came back

135
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,340
to tell you that I'm safe.

136
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,390
I have infiltrated the private army camp.

137
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,480
If I can figure out the situation as soon as possible,

138
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,760
maybe I could stop

139
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,230
a war in Jiangzhou,

140
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,180
and bring peace to the people.

141
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,710
You still want to leave?

142
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,970
No.

143
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,260
I won't let you go.

144
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,070
You know

145
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,500
it's a dangerous place.

146
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,040
Why are you still leaving?

147
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,820
Ling.

148
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,250
Prince Guangping and Tuoba Lie

149
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,760
decided to revolt three days later.

150
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,660
The time left for me

151
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,620
is limited.

152
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,740
Listen to me.

153
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,100
Stay here.

154
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,280
Don't go anywhere.

155
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,690
I promise you.

156
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,170
I will come back safely.

157
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:26,840
Okay?

158
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,820
Listen to me.

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,440
Ling.

160
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,560
Just do what I said.

161
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,620
If you lie to me,

162
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,580
I will hate you.

163
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,670
Don't worry.

164
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,760
I'll come back

165
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,860
when this matter comes to an end.

166
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,390
I'll stay with you forever.

167
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,320
Never separate.

168
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,060
Really?

169
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,290
I'll wait for you.

170
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,110
One.

171
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,000
Two.

172
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,340
Three.

173
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,300
Four.

174
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,170
Five.

175
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,990
Six.

176
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,010
Seven.

177
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,790
Eight.

178
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,650
Again.

179
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,320
One.

180
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:33,970
Two.

181
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,900
Three.

182
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,820
Four.

183
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,710
Five.

184
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,900
Six.

185
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,620
Seven.

186
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,460
Eight.

187
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,160
You're back, Shen Er.

188
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,510
Fire arrow machine?

189
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,619
Prince Guangping

190
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,980
is really interesting.

191
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,339
How many?

192
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,700
Six.

193
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,900
His Majesty and Liu Wang

194
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,220
left Yejing in disguise

195
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,700
and went to the temple on Mount Luoxian

196
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,420
for elixir.

197
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
If six fire arrow machines

198
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,380
are used to attack the mountain,

199
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,780
it will be very powerful.

200
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,780
His Majesty has always been cautious.

201
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,510
He knew Prince Guangping was eager to make a move,

202
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,500
but he insisted on

203
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,700
going to Mount Luoxian

204
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,070
in the suburbs of Jiangzhou with Liu Wang.

205
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,740
You should know

206
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,670
the meaning behind this, right?

207
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,420
Of course I know.

208
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,540
His Majesty wanted to lure Prince Guangping to take actions,

209
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,380
so that he can get rid of the hidden danger

210
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,060
to help the crown prince ascend the throne.

211
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
But

212
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,900
I don’t understand

213
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,700
what Prince Guangping is doing.

214
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,100
He is His Majesty's brother.

215
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,530
He should know

216
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,310
what His Majesty is thinking.

217
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,100
He staked his victory

218
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,790
on the fire arrow machines.

219
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,220
Brother,

220
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,650
I need you to find Old Six

221
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,260
and let him inform the crown prince

222
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,210
to wait for the opportunity

223
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,410
and not to alert them.

224
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,700
Old Three and Old Five are fast.

225
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,430
Let them

226
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,620
go to Haizhou and Pingzhou respectively

227
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,220
to bring reinforcements to help us as soon as possible.

228
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,660
What if the reinforcements failed to arrive in time?

229
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,540
Three days later,

230
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,880
when Prince Guangping starts the rebellion,

231
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,460
the number of soldiers in Jiangzhou

232
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,560
that he can mobilize

233
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,960
will be no more than 3000.

234
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,710
3000 versus 20000.

235
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,590
What an interesting scene!

236
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,460
Commander-in-chief,

237
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,640
are you confident?

238
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,960
How is the thing

239
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,620
I asked you to do going on?

240
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,600
If everything goes well,

241
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,340
within three days,

242
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,260
what you want

243
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,560
will be sent to Jin.

244
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,540
But even so,

245
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,940
there isn't much time left.

246
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,620
Whether your plan works or not

247
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,860
depends on fate.

248
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,820
Man proposes,

249
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,340
God disposes.

250
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,480
For the peace of the people of Wei,

251
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,460
we have to take a risk.

252
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Tuoba Lie

253
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,220
is now

254
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,020
in Jiangzhou City,

255
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,620
but he is

256
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,750
very cautious about his whereabouts.

257
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,930
However,

258
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,500
I exerted my utmost effort,

259
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,380
took great pains,

260
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,820
and went to the mountain of swords

261
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,980
and the sea of fire.

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,840
Where is he?

263
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,740
In the biggest hotel

264
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,280
in Jiangzhou City.

265
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,370
Look at him.

266
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,060
He is so good at hiding.

267
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,480
He found a good place to hide.

268
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,720
Captain Luo is right.

269
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,840
There are so many people

270
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,280
bustling in the hotel.

271
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,340
Even if we know he's in it,

272
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,100
it's not easy to get close.

273
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,020
He can slip away easily.

274
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,220
Tomorrow is the day

275
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,660
when Prince Guangping will revolt.

276
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,940
Time is pressing.

277
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,620
How can we make sure nothing goes wrong?

278
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,070
Why does Jin want to find Tuoba Lie?

279
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,480
Because

280
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,380
Shen Yan has a good plan

281
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,070
to make a thorough withdrawal.

282
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,000
Shen Yu wants me to help it succeed.

283
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,100
But the Bone Carving Pendant alone

284
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,380
is not enough.

285
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,250
We must hand it over

286
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,710
to Tuoba Lie.

287
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,710
It's not difficult

288
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
to find Tuoba Lie.

289
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,260
Do you have

290
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,210
any plan?

291
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,580
We'll know

292
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,720
tonight.

293
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,780
[Jiangzhou Hotel]

294
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,880
Come and take a look.

295
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,070
Your Grace.

296
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,600
Tomorrow is the time for the rebellion.

297
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,420
It's dangerous in crowded places.

298
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,220
You'd better

299
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,550
go back early tonight.

300
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,000
If you mention the word "back" again,

301
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,810
I'll ask you to piss off.

302
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,700
This way, please.

303
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,360
Please.

304
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,440
What would you like

305
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,700
to order?

306
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
Some of your specialties.

307
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,870
Waiter, serve the wine and dishes.

308
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,320
Your Grace.

309
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,940
After the dance,

310
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,830
ask the shopkeeper to come here for interrogation.

311
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,510
Yes.

312
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,900
Bravo! Bravo!

313
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,670
The shopkeeper!

314
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,170
Sir,

315
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,620
what can I do for you?

316
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,180
Are these two dancers

317
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,060
from your inn?

318
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,920
Yes.

319
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,180
Take me to meet them.

320
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,960
Sir.

321
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,860
Please.

322
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,490
Crown...

323
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,860
Brother Tuoba, wait.

324
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,500
Brother Tuoba.

325
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,060
These two girls from Yejing

326
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,940
are too strange.

327
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm afraid there's a trap.

328
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm very unhappy.

329
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Don't let me see you again today.

330
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,000
Brother Tuoba!

331
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,430
We meet again.

332
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,500
Ling.

333
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,070
It's really you.

334
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,230
Is this how you greet your husband?

335
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,100
I wonder

336
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,790
what your intention is?

337
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,940
The knife is on your neck.

338
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,240
Do you think I'm gonna drink with you?

339
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,190
At this point,

340
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,180
I can tell you.

341
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,340
Tomorrow,

342
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,660
the army of Yigu

343
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,540
will rise up with Prince Guangping.

344
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,900
Now,

345
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,100
I have handed over

346
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,450
the military power to Mu Kun.

347
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,480
Today,

348
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,530
even if you kill me,

349
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,640
you won't lower the morale

350
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,780
of our Yigu soldiers.

351
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,440
On the contrary,

352
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
it will make us

353
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,560
more powerful

354
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,660
to destroy Wei.

355
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,280
Blood will

356
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,420
have blood.

357
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,900
How did you get this?

358
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,740
Since you know this thing,

359
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,940
things will

360
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,420
get easier.

361
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,100
This Bone Carving Pendant

362
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,850
was sent by the spy

363
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,130
planted in Yigu State.

364
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,540
This thing

365
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,180
belongs to the king of Yigu.

366
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,810
You should know

367
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,780
this time

368
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
we only took a pendant,

369
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,180
but the next time

370
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,540
we might

371
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,100
take

372
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,460
the king of Yigu‘s life.

373
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,420
Jin,

374
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,760
Tuoba Lie is the crown prince.

375
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,590
If order is given to kill the king of Yigu,

376
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,270
wouldn't that help him?

377
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,170
If he's in Yigu right now,

378
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,840
it would help him.

379
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,660
Unfortunately,

380
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,340
he went to Wei

381
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,940
to achieve military merits.

382
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,500
At this critical moment,

383
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,860
if anything happens

384
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,180
to the king,

385
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,660
the situation of the court

386
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,440
will be fickle.

387
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm afraid when Crown Prince Tuoba

388
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,360
is still on his way to the funeral,

389
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,260
someone else will have

390
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,050
acceded to the throne.

391
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,030
Crown Prince Tuoba,

392
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,160

393
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,590
what to do now?

394

Your Highness.

395
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,580
There are only empty camps on the top of the mountain.

396
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,300
His Majesty and the crown prince are missing.

397
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,090
They only left a troop to ambush.

398
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,690
Many of our men were injured.

399

Shen Yan, the commander-in-chief of the Jin Lin Military Camp

00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,550
Luo Fan.

518
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,110
Who wants to be your sister?

519
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,470
You don't want to be my sister?

520
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,220
You...

521
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,180
You're such a dumb ass.

522
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,370
You will never find a wife.

523
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:02,900
Move.

524
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,810
Wife?

525
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,030
What are you doing?

526
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,560
♫ With time flying by ♫

527
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,820
♫ We sometimes laugh, sometimes sigh ♫

528
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,290
♫ It seems we don't care about anything ♫

529
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,090
♫ But we can't hide from the fateful meeting ♫

530
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,270
♫ Everything else is just passing ♫

531
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,920
♫ I'm so lucky as your love is undying ♫

532
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,070
♫ We can't be parted, even if we're at the end of the earth ♫

533
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,440
What did you see?

534
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,880
Is it that funny?

535
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,900
On my way here,

536
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,320
I saw two birds

537
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,440
♫ The only thing I'm sure of is this truth ♫

538
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,540
whispering love words.

539
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,630
When I think about it,

540
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,980
♫ Never ask for forever, just for days and nights ♫

541
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,300
I still find it interesting.

542
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,820
What are you playing with?

543
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,080
♫ With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything ♫

544
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,840
This thing

545
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,490
is called truelove knot.

546
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,310
♫ Your eyes are smiling, is it because you know I'm missing? ♫

547
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,810
It was brought by Ling

548
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,330
from the Weaver Girl Temple.

549
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,680
She said if it was hung

550
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,280
♫ We already knew what each other was thinking ♫

551
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,970
on the person one loves,

552
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,500
♫ Never ask for forever, just for days and nights ♫

553
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,270
the couple will be together forever.

554
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,670
♫ I come to you, across the sea and mountains ♫

555
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,550
Hang it on me.

556
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,960
♫ No more words, no more explanations ♫

557
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,180
Rascal.

558
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,190
Come on.

559
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:26,310
♫  I have understood your unspoken promise ♫

560
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,530
♫ No more words, no more explanations ♫

561
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,180
By the way,

562
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,190
the full-moon-birth party for

563
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:40,510
♫  The hidden words deep in your heart ♫

564
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,120
Ling and Shen Yan's child is over.

565
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,330
I plan to leave.

566
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,550
Did you say goodbye to Shen Yan?

567
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,160
Of course.

568
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,650
He...

569
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,370
This is...

570
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,180
Sit down.

571
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,730
This is a token of the Jinlin Guard.

572
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,870
He said His Majesty knew

573
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,260
you and I had suffered a lot.

574
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,590
But it's indeed inappropriate for me to

575
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,590
break into the prison

576
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,830
to save people.

577
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,340
Now I have a criminal record.

578
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,420
His Majesty had to

579
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,580
act by the law.

580
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,570
After consideration,

581
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,080
Shen gave the token to me.

582
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,290
Our Shen Er

583
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,830
didn't tell the truth.

584
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,490
This thing is obviously

585
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,150
begged from His Majesty by him.

586
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,300
But he insisted that

587
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,060
it was bestowed by His Majesty.

588
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,520
Lord Shen is so considerate.

589
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,830
The crown prince is fractious.

590
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,470
He won't let us go easily.

591
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,070
With this thing,

592
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,890
you are still His Majesty's man.

593
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,780
We are traveling around the martial world.

594
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,690
Even if the crown prince wants to catch us,

595
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,890
it won't be that easy.

596
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,050
I think

597
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,320
he's used to ordering people around.

598
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,870
He doesn't want me to be idle.

599
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,470
You don't have to defend him.

600
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,810
It's getting late.

601
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,260
Let's go.

602
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,660
Shen Chenxi!

603
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,760
Shen Chenxi!

604
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,510
You're being naughty again.

605
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,960
Our roof has been mended

606
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,400
three times this month.

607
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:28,860
Tell me.

608
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,140
Who did you take after?

609
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,770
You gave birth to me.

610
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,010
Of course I took after you.

611
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,690
In Yejing City,

612
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,220
aren't you the famous

613
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,820
Demon of Chaos that everybody resents?

614
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,920
Come down.

615
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,000
How dare you talk back?

616
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,880
I'll beat you.

617
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,580
I can't be like my father.

618
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,580
I want to be a real man.

619
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,160
You...

620
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,170
Brat.

621
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,650
Who are you talking about?

622
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,690
Come down now!

623
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,170
I've just figured out

624
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,520
how to deal with the Stern-faced Yama,

625
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,840
and now there's a little Yama.

626
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Little Yama?

627
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,800
I think he is

628
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,270
a little Demon of Chaos.

629
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,340
But after we had this brat,

630
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,820
you don't love me anymore.

631
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,770
I make a fuss with you every day.

632
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:17,790
Don't you think it's love?
