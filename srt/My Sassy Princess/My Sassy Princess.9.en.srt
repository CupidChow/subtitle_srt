00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,850
Is that you?

6
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,940
Did Duke Dingbei ordered someone

7
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,250
to seal this window?

8
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,500
I did.

9
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,250
As a noble lady,

10
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,740
how can I allow perverts

11
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,370
to break into my bedroom at night?

12
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,180
Since you're on guard against me,

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,910
I'm leaving.

Come in.

The window is sealed.

I can't open it.

19
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,140
Since Lord Shen is here,

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,780
how can I refuse to see him?

21
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,760
Dumbass.

won't break into a lady's bedroom at night.

26

It's my fault.

27

I disturbed you.

29
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,180
Nothing.

Since you escaped from death,

159
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,630
your archery skill

00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,020
has improved a lot.

161
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,660
It must be Lord Shen

162
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,140
who taught you privately.

163
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,260

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,860
Unlike you and Madam Lu,

170
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,620
Say it again.

172
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,460
and discuss with your mother.

173
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,420
Instead of wasting time here,

174
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
you'd better go home

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,500
and learn some skills.

176
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,050
Such as playing the trumpet or horn.

177
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,710
If one day

178
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,170
you are kicked out of

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,850
Prince Guangping's Mansion,

180
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,800
you'll find a way to make a living.

181
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,250
Princess Changle of House of Duke Dingbei.

182
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,000
Five out of five.

183
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,900
Liu Ling,

184
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,560
I’ll see how long you can be arrogant.

185
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Liu Ling,

186
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,580
Liu Yunxiang,

187
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,730
and Lu Mingshan

188
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,780
are the top three

189
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,500
and qualified for the final.

190
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,660
Lu Mingshan, please get ready on swing A.

191
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,700
Liu Ling, please get ready on swing B.

192
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,600
Liu Yunxiang, please get ready on swing C.

193
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,200
What a coincidence.

194
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,750
These three foes

195
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,600
meet at the competition of

196
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,150
canary shooting on swings.

197
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,300
Jin,

198
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,570
how interesting!

199
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,860
In my opinion,

200
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,150
the current situation

201
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,100
is caused

202
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,220
by Your Grace.

203
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,180
How dare you!

204
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,660
They don't get along.

205
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,630
After all,

206
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,590
it's a grudge between the Liu and Lu families.

207
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,430
How can you

208
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,460
blame me?

209
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
I heard

210
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,340
Princess Changle

211
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
and the young lord of Family Lu

212
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,280
are determined to win

213
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,610
the Dragon Jade Pendant

214
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,080
of Your Grace.

215
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,570
However,

216
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,030
one gets it

217
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,180
to ask for a permission to break off an engagement.

218
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,400
And the other one gets it

219
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
to ask for permission for marriage.

220
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,000
Your Grace,

221
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,600
you want whom to win?

222
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,940
I

223
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,920
hope

224
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,340
Princess Changle can win.

225
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,780
What do you mean?

226
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,880
If I

227
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,700
give an order

228
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,380
to break off the engagement,

229
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,460
Lu Mingshan

230
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,230
must be the anxious one.

231
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,790
If I

232
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,740
grant

233
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,890
a marriage.

234
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,830
I will be

235
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,950
the unlucky one.

236
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,370
They colluded

237
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,960
to make things difficult for you.

238
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,290
Remember to be careful

239
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,000
in the competition later.

240
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,570
You don't have to win.

241
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,700
No.

242
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,670
I must win this competition.

243
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,070
Only do I win

244
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,570
can I ask His Grace

245
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,380
to grant marriage

246
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,130
between us.

247
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,590
Listen to me.

248
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,020
If you fall down,

249
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,880
you might break your limbs

250
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,900
or die on the spot.

251
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,140
I know.

252
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,370
For you,

253
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,880
I'm not afraid of death.

254
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,580
Go.

255
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,910
Brother,

256
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,140
if I am careless

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,290
and hurt your Ling

258
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,460
in the competition later,

259
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,820
will you blame me?

260
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,470
Sister, you worry too much.

261
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
We are the Prime Minister's family.

262
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,250
if she is injured,

263
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,340
or even crippled,

264
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,810
we can afford it.

265
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,460
Come.

266
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,420
It's time.

267
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,590
The game begins.

268
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,100
In this round,

269
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,060
your scores will be based on

270
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,260
the height of the swing.

271
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,020
When the canary is shoot,

272
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,140
the higher swing wins.

273
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,050
The canary is out of the cage!

274
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,880
The winner is Princess Changle of House of Duke Dingbei!

275
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,220
You are so careless.

276
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,020
Do you want to die?

277
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,290
With you being here,

278
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,310
who can hurt me?

279
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,820
Your archery skill

280
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,460
really deserves your reputation.

281
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,900
You are as good as men.

282
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,590
You deserve my

283
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,210
Dragon Jade Pendant.

284
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,240
Thank you, Your Grace.

285
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,850
Your Grace,

286
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,070
I have a wish.

287
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,020
It's not an overclaim,

288
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,940
and it's not against the law of Wei.

289
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,070
Please keep your promise, Your Grace.

290
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,230
My dear sister!

291
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,490
You don't even want my jade pendant?

292
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,420
Well?

293
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,540
Do you

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,510
want to ask me

295
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,140
to break off the engagement?

296
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,060
How wise you are, Your Grace.

297
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,720
Your Grace.

298
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,480
Your Grace.

299
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Our marriage

300
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
was decided by Prince Guangping

301
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,430
and my grandfather.

302
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,990
It's not a child's play.

303
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,300
Your Grace.

304
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,050
Lu Mingshan.

305
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,080
How dare you!

306
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,060
The rules of the archery competition

307
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,320
was set by His Majesty.

308
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,620
The prize of the competition

309
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,280
was set by His Grace in public.

310
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,710
What is the child's play

311
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,100
you are referring to?

312
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,140
Lord Lu,

313
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,540
I said before the game starts that

314
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,820
whoever wins the jade pendant

315
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,730
will

316
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,210
get a promise from me.

317
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
You're not as good as others today.

318
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,030
Why don't you

319
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,550
do as what my cousin said?

320
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,720
Thank you, Your Grace.

321
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,770
Farewell, Your Highness.

322
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,340
You're such an

323
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,040
incompetent loser!

324
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,260
Yes, Grandpa.

325
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,260
Master.

326
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,660
Princess Changle is here.

327
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,540
She brought a box of things outside.

328
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,090
As I expected,

329
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,840
your family has been busy lately.

330
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,380
I don't think Mr. Lu

331
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,140
has time to send me

332
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,270
the Broken Engagement Announcement.

333
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,300
I'm just a princess

334
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,740
who has so lots of free time.

335
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,200
So I come and get it myself.

336
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,420
Princess Changle,

337
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,460
since you’ve got what you want,

338
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,000
why are you in such a hurry?

339
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,670
I'm worried about

340
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,380
Mr. Lu and Miss Yue Ling.

341
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,430
They are

342
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,660
a perfect match.

343
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,510
I just want to help them.

344
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,760
Although

345
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Yue Ling is just a maid servant,

346
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
she treats Mr. Lu very well.

347
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,320
If your young master marries her,

348
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,130
his life

349
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,150
will be full of comfort and joy.

350
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,630
Bring it up.

351
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,900
Today I come here

352
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,000
to send gifts

353
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,200
to express my best wishes.

354
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,530
Alright, Ling.

355
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,830
Stop it.

356
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,820
Madam Lu,

357
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,070
how busy you are!

358
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,640
When something happened to Family Lu,

359
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,590
you rushed back

360
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,550
in such a hurry.

361
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,660
Since you are determined

362
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,300
to break off this marriage,

363
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,400
and the Crown Prince also agreed,

364
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,020
I'll ask Shan to sign

365
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,590
the Broken Engagement Announcement.

366
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:06,900
Shan,

367
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,320
love cannot be forced.

368
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,590
Just sign it.

369
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,220
Since we have nothing to do with each other,

370
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,930
I shall take my leave.

371
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,500
See you.

372
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,580
How dare you ruin my plan

373
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,380
because of that bitch?

374
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,090
Do you forget who you are?

375
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,620
Do you really think

376
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,680
you're the young master of Family Lu?

377
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,170
You're just a boor

378
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,750
from the countryside.

379
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,450
Your mother is cheap and insignificant.

380
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,640
As for you,

381
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,740
you've never received

382
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,700
a decent education.

383
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,760
And now you're still

384
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,080
an useless son of a concubine

385
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,690
even if you're in Family Lu.

386
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,060
God doesn't bless me.

387
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,690
If Family Lu hadn't lost the legitimate son,

388
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,260
then...

389
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,880
Father.

390
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:29,840
Father!

391
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,670
Father!

392
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,990
Father!

393
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,520
Father.

394
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,440
You don't have to scold Shan.

395
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,900
Back then,

396
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,120
I asked Shan to marry Princess Changle

397
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,140
out of expediency.

398
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,700
I didn’t expect

399
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,860
Liu Ling is so ungrateful

400
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,780
and determined to

401
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,300
act against our Family Lu.

402
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,820
If only

403
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,150
she fell in love with others

404
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,750
rather than Commander Shen.

405
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm afraid her plan

406
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,170
is not that simple.

407
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,050
Princess Changle

408
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,210
is so scheming.

409
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,860
Shen Yan

410
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,380
is the commander of one of the fourteen armies of the Jinlin Guard.

411
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,020
Now,

412
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,480
he’s trying to reopen the Jiangzhou case.

413
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,550
Now Liu Ling is colluding with him.

414
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
If he really wants to

415
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,590
reopen the old case,

416
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,420
I'm afraid the Lu Family

417
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,530
and House of Prince Guangping

418
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,970
will be in trouble.

419
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,060
Father,

420
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,580
our priority

421
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,960
is to find a way

422
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,890
to stop them.

423
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,260
Were it not for this loser,

424
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,540
who lost the archery competition,

425
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,710
Family Lu

426
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,450
would not end up like this.

427
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,550
Grandpa, you're right.

428
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,850
Find a good doctor

429
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,770
to abort the child.

430
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,420
Your Highness!

431
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,690
It's my fault.

432
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,310
I seduced the young master.

433
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,220
But the child in my womb

434
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,250
belongs to Family Lu.

435
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,050
Please help me.

436
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,060
Family Lu

437
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,660
doesn't have such a bastard.

438
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,300
You should abort it.

439
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,330
Why did you come here to make people loathe you?

440
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,910
You are right, Your Highness.

441
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,750
But this bastard

442
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,670
has its own use.

443
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,790
If we can stop Princess Changle

444
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,020
from marrying into Family Shen,

445
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,220
the baby won't come to Family Lu in vain.

446
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,830
Go on.

447
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,140
I am a maid.

448
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,140
I was born to serve people.

449
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,350
If Your Highness

450
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,060
send me to the House of Duke Dingbei

451
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,940
in the name of

452
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,660
soothing the relationship between Liu and Lu.

453
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,300
I will find a way

454
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,430
to let Liu Ling

455
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,700
lose her reputation

456
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,150
in the capital.

457
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,820
If you are willing to serve in Duke Dingbei's Mansion,

458
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,320
we won't stop you.

459
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,260
Tell me.

460
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,670
What else do you want?

461
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,030
I dare not ask for anything.

462
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,570
I just hope

463
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,960
I can be with Mr. Lu forever.

464
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,770
I'll be grateful to Family Lu

465
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,130
for the rest of my life.

466
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,980
That's easy.

467
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,580
If you can revenge

468
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,950
for Family Lu,

469
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,060
and you are

470
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,760
carrying a child of Family Lu,

471
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,300
I will convince Father

472
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,440
to allow you

473
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,980
to be a concubine of Shan

474
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,730
and accompany him.

475
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,470
Thank you, Madam.

476
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,140
Royal Highness.

477
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,410
The drawings of the fire arrow machine

478
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,360
are done.

479
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,520
Please have a look.

480
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,140
Give them

481
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,270
to the craftsmen.

482
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,460
Keep an eye on them

483
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,780
and ask them to make it quickly.

484
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,890
After the weapons are made,

485
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,690
kill them all.

486
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,780
Yes.

487
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,360
What's the matter, Madam?

488
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,900
[Duke Dingbei's Mansion]

489
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,140
Go away.

490
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,580
Isn't this the distinguished

491
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,800
-Princess Guangping? -Leave.

492
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,320
I’m flattered.

493
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,930
Are you here to see Ling?

494
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,020
Come in.

495
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,700
Ling

496
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,800
has always hated me.

497
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,190
I won't go in.

498
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,540
What are you talking about?

499
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,820
I came here today

500
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,140
to apologize.

501
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,590
The feud between Ling and Family Lu

502
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,890
was caused by this maid.

503
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,790
As Ling's mother,

504
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,680
I know clearly

505
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,990
how she felt.

506
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,380
Now,

507
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,860
the marriage between the two families is cancelled,

508
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,380
but after all my nephew

509
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,970
broke her heart.

510
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,400
Not at all. Not at all.

511
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,920
Now that Ling

512
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,810
lives in Duke Dingbei's Mansion,

513
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,460
I sent this maid here

514
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,410
to serve

515
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,630
Ling.

516
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,420
It's Family Lu's

517
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,340
apology.

518
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,520
Here.

519
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,460
Your Highness.

520
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,280
Your Highness.

521
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,420
Lord Shen asked Luo Fan

522
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,230
to give this box

523
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,620
to you.

524
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,850
Your Highness, look.

525
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,500
You are quite close

526
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,030
with Luo Fan recently.

527
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,430
That's not true.

528
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,510
Your Highness, don't talk nonsense.

529
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,320
This little golden bell is so beautiful.

530
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,240
Your name Ling

531
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,610
also bears a meaning of bell.

532
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,870
How sweet of Lord Shen!

533
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,140
If I can't see him,

534
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,640
a gift won't satisfy me.

535
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,110
I don’t want it.

536
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,150
Are you sure?

537
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,160
I'll send the gift back now.

538
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,670
It's already a loss not to see him.

539
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,170
If we return the gift,

540
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,890
it will cause me a bigger loss.

541
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,960
Yes, yes.

542
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,830
Then I'll

543
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,970
put it on for you.

544
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Who said I'm going to wear it?

545
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,900
Come here.

546
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,800
Let's put on the little bell.

547
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,020
You are so beautiful.

548
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,820
Right?

549
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,740
This is a gift from your father.

550
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,500
Got it?

551
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,570
Fine.

552
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
From now on,

553
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,070
you can help here.

554
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,380
Yes.

555
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,140
Sister, let me do it.

556
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,490
My name is Yue Ling.

557
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,620
If you need anything,

558
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,980
just let me know.

559
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,170
OK.

560
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,020
Sit here.

561
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,690
Look.

562
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,860
The newcomer is quite diligent.

563
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,830
What's the point?

564
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,090
She's unlucky.

565
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,950
Let me tell you.

566
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,490
She used to be

567
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,760
a sexual maid of Mr. Lu.

568
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,010
What? You mean the Mr. Lu of Family Lu?

569
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,970
Sister, let me do it.

570
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,810
It's okay.

571
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,400
Let me.

572
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,490
Let me help you.

573
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,100
No need.

574
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,630
-Let me do it. -Thank you.

575
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,210
Let me help you.

576
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,100
Okay.

577
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,330
Yue Ling is really good.

578
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,660
After she came,

579
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,330
we have much more free time.

580
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,170
Of course.

581
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,580
She is

582
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,500
very agile

583
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,700
and diligent.

584
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,980
If she hadn't offended

585
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,820
our princess,

586
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,820
she wouldn't have

587
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,340
ended up like this.

588
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,340
Exactly.

589
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,590
Why are you here?

590
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,980
Who asked you to come?

591
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,530
I'm talking to you.

592
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,730
Who asked you to come?

593
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,150
Miss Yue Ling.

594
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,150
What happened?

595
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,490
Why did you fall down?

596
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,690
Miss Ling Bi.

597
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,970
What are you doing?

598
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,990
I... I didn't.

599
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,890
She lied to you.

600
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,920
You didn't?

601
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,550
Did she fall down by herself?

602
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,740
-Her master is unruly. -How could you do this?

603
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,950
She also

604
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,390
likes to bully others.

605
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,320
-Come here, Miss Yue Ling. -That's right.

606
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,710
-You must get hurt. -You can't do this to her.

607
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,430
Look.

608
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,690
Although she has a pretty face,

609
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,430
-she is actually so vicious. -Exactly!

610
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,010
Just ignore her.

611
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,280
She's such a bully.

612
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,420
Exactly.

613
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,450
Your Highness.

614
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,790
What took you so long?

615
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,720
Shen Oink almost caught a cold.

616
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,010
If he caught a cold,

617
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,560
how could I face his father?

618
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,440
Yes. Yes.

619
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,750
As a servant,

620
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,470
I am not as precious as

621
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,100
Lord Shen's pig son.

622
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,680
Who made Miss Ling Bi

623
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,430
angry?

624
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,810
It's...

625
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,030
Forget it. I'll stop talking about her.

626
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,680
If I tell you,

627
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,010
you'll get angry too.

628
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,380
You're so secretive.

629
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,580
I'm more curious.

630
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,740
Tell me.

631
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,960
Your Highness.

632
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,550
Do you remember Yue Ling?

633
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,700
Lu Mingshan's lover?

634
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,560
Yes, that's her.

635
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,260
I don't know who

636
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,200
brought her here

637
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,190
to be a maid.

638
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,140
She tried to win popular support

639
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,420
in the mansion.

640
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,390
Just now,

641
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,990
she deliberately set me up.

642
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,080
She just wanted to ruin...

643
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,340
Ruin your reputation.

644
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,610
I think

645
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
she was sent by Lu Qian.

646
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,630
I don't know

647
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,490
what evil deeds she is going to do.

648
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,030
Finished?

649
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,490
Yes.

650
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,100
Since she

651
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,880
is now a maid in Duke Dingbei’s Mansion,

652
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,080
it means she was abandoned by Family Lu.

653
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,410
But she still tries her best

654
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,620
to ruin my reputation

655
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,770
to please Family Lu.

656
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,030
Do you think she's hateful or pitiful?

657
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,290
Pitiful?

658
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,610
Since she is pitiful,

659
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,050
let her do what she wants.

660
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,889
Here.

661
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,530
Wipe its feet.

662
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,600
Your Highness,

663
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,810
why haven't you seen

664
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,989
Lord Shen recently?

665
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,860
Lord Shen told me

666
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,639
he's busy these days.

667
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,679
How can I bother him?

668
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Besides,

669
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,460
the marriage with Family Lu

670
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,590
has been cancelled.

671
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,980
I can wait for him.

672
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,100
No hurry.

673
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:38,980
By the way,

674
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:39,940
where has Yang Ye been

675
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,900
these days?

676
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,060
Guard Yang?

677
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,690
I met him today.

678
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,670
Didn't he always say

679
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,139
he wanted to compete with the Ghost?

680
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,800
He hasn't found the Ghost yet.

681
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,380
I don't know

682
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,580
when he can find him.

683
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,340
Ling Bi.

684
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,239
Look at Shen Oink.

685
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,150
Has it gained weight recently?

686
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,940
It seems so.

687
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,400
Your Highness,

688
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,380
they say that love tokens

689
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,660
will last forever.

690
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,290
But I think the love token

691
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,540
of you and Lord Shen

692
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,670
can not only run and scream,

693
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,750
but also can grow.

694
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
Grow?

695
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,430
Like father, like son.

696
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,220
Duke Dingbei

697
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,500
is a good man.

698
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,880
On the first and the fifteenth day of every lunar month,

699
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,390
he'll give alms to the poor.

700
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,870
It's almost time.

701
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,070
If we don't

702
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,890
wait here beforehand,

703
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,840
we won't get anything.

704
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,480
Yeah.

705
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,580
Give me one.

706
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,090
Don't grab!

707
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,190
Don't grab!

708
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,140
Don't grab!

709
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,580
Line up! Line up!

710
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,630
Line up. What are you fighting for?

711
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,100
There are plenty of steamed buns in our mansion.

712
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,030
Don't rush. Everyone will get one.

713
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,480
Thank you, Master.

714
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,840
-Everybody, remember! -Thank you.

715
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,920
It's the duke who gave these to you.

716
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,830
Thank you.

717
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,180
You should be grateful.

718
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,680
-Thank you. -Understand?

719
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,500
Take it.

720
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,130
Shen Oink.

721
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,320
Shen Xiaoyan.

722
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,020
Ling Bi.

723
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,080
Why is it so noisy outside?

724
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,580
Today is the 15th day of this month.

725
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,240
They are giving alms outside.

726
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,140
I guess they will leave soon.

727
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,560
I'll take a rest.

728
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,870
Wake me up

729
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,100
when dinner is ready.

730
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,020
Okay.

731
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,650
Oink. Oink.

732
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,500
Oink.

733
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,510
Your mother is sleeping.

734
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,730
Let's keep it down.

735
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,850
Be good. Let's go.

736
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,220
Oh, little master.

737
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,860
Lower your voice.

738
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
My little lord,

739
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,710
your mother is sleeping.

740
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,910
Keep your voice down.

741
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,860
Good boy.

742
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:10,980
Here.

743
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,430
Are you hungry?

744
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,770
Why do you keep barking?

745
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,220
Well,

746
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,140
I'll

747
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,700
get you some food from the kitchen.

748
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,500
Stay here

749
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,760
and don't go anywhere.

750
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,540
Oink.

751
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,280
Oink.

752
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,620
Shen Oink!

753
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,240
Come here.

754
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,950
Come here.

755
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,550
Let's go.

756
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,950
After you take this medicine,

757
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,630
the baby will be aborted

758
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,730
within an hour.

759
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,940
After all, it's a life.

760
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,430
Judging from your expression,

761
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,500
you feel reluctant.

762
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,840
Do you want to take this medicine?

763
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,340
Please think about it.

764
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,240
Your Highness.

765
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,740
Your Highness!

766
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,700
Bad news!

767
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,940
I didn't take good care of Oink.

768
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,260
It's missing.

769
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,440
Why are you crying?

770
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,450
I'll go with you.

771
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,720
Let's go.

772
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,650
Oink!

773
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,980
Shen Oink!

774
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,550
Have you seen Shen Oink?

775
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,150
No.

776
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,780
Oink!

777
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,080
Have you seen Shen Oink?

778
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,710
No.

779
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,750
Let's go and find it.

780
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,280
-Shen Oink. -Shen Oink.

781
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,040
Oink!

782
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,310
I'll open the door.

783
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,710
Oink!

784
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,940
Shen Oink!

785
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,100
-Oink! -Shen Oink!

786
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,610
It smells so good.

787
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,530
I haven't eaten meat for a long time.

788
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,130
Yeah.

789
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,490
What are you doing?

790
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,480
Barbecuing.

791
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,540
We're eating meat.

792
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,830
You want it?

793
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,740
Give it back to me.

794
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,970
Give it back to her?

795
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,550
How can you kill Princess Changle's

796
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,840
beloved pig?

797
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,510
This...

798
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,070
I'm so sorry, Your Highness.

799
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,190
Your Highness.

800
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,940
They are all refugees.

801
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,700
It's you.

802
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,480
You misunderstood.

803
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,920
I...

804
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,230
Calm down, Your Highness.

805
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,100
I'll go find Lord Shen.

806
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,900
Lord Shen.

807
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,070
They were just starving.

808
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,360
They didn't know

809
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,100
the piggy belongs to you.

810
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,540
That's why they committed such a serious crime.

811
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,980
If you want to punish someone,

812
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,500
just punish me.

813
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,540
Yue Ling,

814
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,420
do you think

815
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,300
you are smart?

816
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,020
I dare not.

817
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,560
Your Highness.

818
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,290
I'm guilty, Your Highness.

819
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,040
It's reasonable for you

820
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,390
to hate me.

821
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,770
Please don't abandon me.

822
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,100
I have nowhere to go.

823
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
You can punish me in any way you want.

824
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,340
I'm kowtowing to you.

825
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,050
I'm kowtowing to you.

826
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
My life is cheap.

827
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,970
If you want to take it,

828
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,100
I dare not disobey.

829
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,240
I just hope you can promise me

830
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,120
before I die

831
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,890
that you won't vent your anger on others.

832
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,850
I beg you.

833
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,500
I beg you.

834
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,940
-I beg you! -Let go of me.

835
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,210
Let go of me!

836
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,430
Something's wrong!

837
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,230
Something's wrong!

838
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,750
Leave! Leave!

839
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,260
Your Highness, you're so cruel.

840
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,660
Even if I did something wrong,

841
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,000
it's not my baby's fault.

842
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,240
Do you really think

843
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,590
a human's life

844
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,040
is more important

845
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,460
than an animal's?

846
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,370
The child in your womb is gone.

847
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,050
You can criticize me.

848
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,340
My Shen Oink

849
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,060
was skinned because of you.

850
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,220
Didn't you do it on purpose

851
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,200
and suffer the consequences?

852
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,510
Hurry up.

853
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,300
Here.

854
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,240
Be careful.

855
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,170
Be careful.

856
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,940
You are Princess Changle

857
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,270
granted by His Majesty.

858
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,940
How can you cry

859
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,400
in front of so many people?

860
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,550
Shen Oink.

861
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,190
Shen Oink is dead.

862
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,760
Alright.

863
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,320
If you stop crying,

864
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,100
I'll give you something better.

865
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,020
Alright.

866
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,310
Let's get out of here.

867
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,200
Come.

868
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,740
Sit tight.

869
