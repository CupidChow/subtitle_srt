[Episode 21]

4
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,640
I didn't ask you to save me.

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,240
Leave now.

6
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,370
Fine.

7
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,800
When the reinforcements arrive

8
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,230
and see me like this,

9
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,180
then,

10
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,220
whether you go with me or not,

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,920
there will be no turning back for me.

12
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,180
Shen Yu, are you crazy?

13
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,829
It will be your fault if I am.

14
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,430
If you don't pay me back the love debt,

15
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,100
I'll have no other choice

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,410
but to die with you.

17
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,390
You...

18
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,120
What are you doing?

19
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,280
You told me not to save you.

20
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
So, I'll stay here

21
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,700
with you.

22
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,500
You...

23
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,180
Rascal.

24
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,860
Let me tell you.

25
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,580
Since you met me,

26
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,990
I have been a rascal.

27
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,280
You owe me

28
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,180
for the rest of your life.

29
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,780
You...

30
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,840
You can't deny it

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,580
for one day, one hour or even one moment.

32
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,100
Someone is coming.

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,790
Go!

34
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,240
No.

35
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,110
Shen Yu!

36
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,780
Little Yu, you win.

37
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,350
I'll go with you.

38
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,450
You agreed?

39
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,460
Jin,

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,260
even if you have to vagabond with me

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,790
for the rest of your life,

42
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,570
won't you be afraid?

43
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,220
If you're not,

44
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,700
why should I be?

45
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,409
Let's go.

46
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,260
Your Grace.

47
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,050
Your Grace.

48
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,630
What's the rush?

49
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,330
Your Grace.

50
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,780
Shen Yu.

51
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,900
How dare he!

52
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,340
He broke into the imperial prison at night,

53
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,570
knocked me and the guards out

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,110
and took Lady-in-waiting Xu

55
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,060
away.

56
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,580
I told you

57
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,200
dealing with a ungrateful person

58
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,380
will shoot yourself in the foot.

59
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,850
I didn’t expect

60
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,260
Mr. Shen

61
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,170
would do such a thing for Jin.

62
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,250
Your Grace,

63
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,130
city gates are closed now.

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,000
They can't leave the city.

65
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,870
They must be hiding

66
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,530
in Xu Mansion or Shen Mansion.

67
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,020
How about we send someone

68
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,900
to seal the mansions and arrest them.

69
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,540
Bastard!

70
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,580
Do you think

71
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,460
you can seal these two mansions

72
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,860
just because you want to?

73
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,020
Besides,

74
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,100
Shen Yan is now

75
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,970
Prince Guangping's son-in-law.

76
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,830
If I want to defeat Prince Guangping,

77
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,640
I have to rely on him.

78
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,260
It's not worth doing that

79
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,780
for Xu Shijin.

80
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,700
You're back!

81
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,540
Jin!

82
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,520
Let me see. Are you okay?

83
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,659
Are you hurt?

84
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,820
Did the crown prince send someone

85
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,980
to search the two mansions?

86
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,460
As you expected, nothing happened.

87
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,740
They just sent people to set barriers

88
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,380
at the North Gate and the South Gate.

89
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,920
His Grace wants to take care of the dignity between His Majesty and his subjects,

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,270
so he won't send anyone to the mansions.

91
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,780
But there are barriers at the city gates.

92
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,140
If we can’t leave Yejing,

93
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,780
our whereabouts will be known sooner or later.

94
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,700
Don't worry.

95
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,659
Go to my mansion and sleep tonight.

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,450
Tomorrow morning,

97
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:54,980
I'll ask Shen Yan

98
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,640
to send you two out of the city.

99
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,540
All right, let's go.

100
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,440
Let's go.

101
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,220
Let's go.

102
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,800
[Yejing]

103
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,610
It's Princess Peace's husband.

104
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,210
Go to the North Gate.

105
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,100
Ask Lord Li

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,730
to bring all the men here from the North Gate.

107
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,680
Tell him Princess Peace's carriage

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,310
is here.

109
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,910
Yes.

110
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,450
Go.

111
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,130
Stop!

112
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,700
How dare you!

113
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,740
How dare you

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,940
stop Princess Peace?

115
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,380
It's Princess Peace

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,580
and the commander-in-chief.

117
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,900
Please forgive me.

118
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Your Highness, commander-in-chief,

119
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,260
please forgive me.

120
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,260
Now that you know,

121
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
make way now.

122
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,300
There are many suspects in the city recently.

123
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,159
His Grace has ordered that

124
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,100
anyone who enters or leaves the city

125
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,180
must be checked.

126
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,800
Your Highness, please get off.

127
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,700
My legs are sore today.

128
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,960
I don't want to get off.

129
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,740
Why don't you come in?

130
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,460
I dare not.

131
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,580
Forget it then.

132
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,300
Let's go.

133
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,320
You can't leave.

134
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,330
Lord Li.

135
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,909
What...

136
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,460
What should we do?

137
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,930
Lord Li,

138
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,780
what do you mean?

139
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,860
Commander-in-chief,

140
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,010
you know why, right?

141
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,700
It's a serious crime to hide a criminal.

142
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,060
Commander-in-chief, Your Highness,

143
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,770
how about handing them over now?

144
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,280
Then, I can report on my mission

145
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,590
to His Grace.

146
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,620
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,560
It's our duty to cooperate with the checking.

148
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,500
Besides, you brought so many men here.

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,140
Lord Li,

150
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,240
Please.

151
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,419
Would you like to take a look in the carriage?

152
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,059
What if I hide someone

153
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,059
in a wooden crack?

154
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,380
How is it?

155
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,570
Lord Li,

156
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,120
two people broke out of the South Gate.

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Did they run away?

158
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,640
Did you see their faces?

159
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,580
They were wearing hats

160
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,440
and sportswear.

161
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,220
Not to mention their faces,

162
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,980
I can't even tell

163
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,180
they are men or women.

164
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
Lord Li,

165
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,580
did you take all the men away

166
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,520
from the South Gate?

167
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,960
That's why the criminals escaped.

168
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,270
If there is nothing else,

169
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,670
I’m leaving.

170
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,260
Don't go, you two criminals!

171
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,860
Duke Shen.

172
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,110
Duke Xu.

173
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,870
You...

[The Eastern Palace]

175
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,500
Dukes, your ages add up to

176
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,420
over one hundred.

177
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,810
I'm still young.

178
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,590
You don't care about me.

179
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,480
It doesn't matter.

180
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,790
I just want to remind you.

181
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,580
My father, His Majesty,

182
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,690
doesn't like to see

183
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,770
the aristocratic families become arrogant.

184
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,900
Once the Jiangzhou case

185
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,420
was decided,

186
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,930
Duke Lu

187
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,020
was  sentenced to death.

188
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,580
Lu Qian, the eldest daughter of Family Lu,

189
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,980
and others in the family

190
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,940
were sentenced to exile.

191
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,410
As for Lu Mingshan,

192
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,410
my father thinks he corrected his mistake in time

193
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,060
and did a good job in reporting their crimes.

194
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,590
But the result of him is just

195
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,060
not being rewarded or punished,

196
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,860
as his merits offset his faults.

197
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,860
The Family Lu in Yejing

198
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,250
has fallen down.

199
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
You two dukes

200
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,130
are highly respected in Wei.

201
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,880
Don't disregard the law

202
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,080
and follow Family Lu's footsteps.

203
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,220
Your Grace,

204
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,970
thank you for reminding us.

205
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,460
However,

206
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,900
Your Grace, you said

207
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,400
we disregarded the law.

208
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,050
I dare not agree.

209
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,730
The Family Xu

210
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,700
has been wronged

211
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,330
and endured humiliation for years.

212
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,420
It's just because I remember

213
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,940
the law of Wei is strict.

214
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,610
It shows our loyalty to

215
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,760
the imperial court.

216
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,500
As for your decree

217
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,340
to set up barriers,

218
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,140
I didn't know that

219
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,940
until Lord Li chased me

220
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,530
and told me

221
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,980
that.

222
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,500
But

223
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,020
I heard from the guards that

224
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,860
you two didn't obey my decree

225
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
and rushed out through the city gate

226
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,540
on purpose?

227
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,760
Your Grace,

228
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,450
If you ask about this,

229
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,340
I think

230
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,320
you should blame Duke Shen.

231
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,980
Look.

232
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,530
He asked me to go fishing

233
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,170
in the suburbs this morning.

234
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
Now that I think about it,

235
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
what is his intention?

236
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,770
You old man! Nonsense!

237
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,570
Your Grace,

238
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,140
please allow me to report.

239
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,530
To go fishing

240
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,940
is my idea.

241
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,740
But,

242
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,420
it's Duke Xu's idea that

243
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,670
the one arriving late has to buy dinner and drinks.

244
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,150
I was ahead of him,

245
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,950
but he kept chasing after me.

246
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,540
That's why

247
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,900
I rushed out of the city.

248
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,040
Your Grace, please investigate this thoroughly.

249
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,190
Please punish Duke Xu.

250
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,040
If you hadn't rush out of the city

251
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,150
disregarding everything,

252
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,840
how could I

253
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,220
run out with you?

254
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,100
Shen,

255
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,690
don't think I don't know.

256
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,610
Your son is bold.

257
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,500
He broke into the Supreme Court and took a prisoner away from the imperial prison.

258
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,630
It's unforgivable.

259
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,710
Nonsense!

260
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,700
Why would my elder son

261
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,180
break into the imperial prison?

262
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,180
It's because your granddaughter

263
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,900
seduced him first.

264
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,620
What?

265
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,130
Now that something bad happened,

266
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,610
you're putting the blame

267
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,760
on us.

268
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,670
We must

269
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,180
clear the truth.

270
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,080
Let's go to see His Majesty now.

271
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,700
Ask His Majesty to judge

272
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,570
who is up to no good.

273
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,420
Fine. Let's go.

274
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,990
You have to go today.

275
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,770
Enough.

276
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,420
Both of you

277
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,450
are senior officials of Wei.

278
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,420
How rude are you!

279
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,900
Do you really have

280
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
no dignity at all?

281
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,220
Father has fallen ill from overwork

282
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,430
and is recuperating in the royal villa now.

283
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,620
I

284
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,840
don't want to bother him

285
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,450
for such a small thing.

286
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,220
Shen Yu and Xu Shijin

287
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,890
are your family members.

288
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,020
Domestic shame should not be made public.

289
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,780
I

290
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,540
will make the decision today

291
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,700
and give you enough respect.

292
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,780
This matter is over.

293
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,180
Duke Xu and Duke Shen,

294
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,710
I showed my mercy this time.

295
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't forget

296
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,790
to serve the imperial court

297
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,700
in time.

298
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,070
Yes, Your Grace.

299
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,770
We will

300
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,530
-do our best until death. -do our best until death.

301
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,340
Our crown prince

302
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,890
is very clever.

303
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,130
I'm afraid the mercy this time will lead to

304
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,890
another disaster.

305
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,990
You...

306
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,690
You mean the one in Jiangzhou?

307
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,610
It's time for him to take action.

308
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,420
As far as I know,

309
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,130
Prince Guangping has taken a lot

310
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,060
from the sliver lost in Jiangzhou.

311
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,440
Think about him.

312
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,900
He trained a private army

313
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,180
and...

314
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,940
and forged weapons without permission.

315
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,620
He might have long been powerful in his fiefdom.

316
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,090
It's not an easy job.

317
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
It seems that

318
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,500
your younger son needs to pay back

319
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,180
what your elder son owed.

320
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,340
They say having a son is good.

321
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,470
Having a son is good.

322
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,690
I don't know what's good about it.

323
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,420
My two sons

324
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,770
are all troublesome.

325
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,160
If there is a next life,

326
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,940
I won't have a son even if you kill me.

327
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,270
Daughters are better.

328
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,980
Having a daughter is better.

329
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Not necessarily.

330
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,460
[Shen Mansion]

331
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,280
My dear,

332
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,280
you're back.

333
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,350
Liu Wang urgently summoned you to the palace.

334
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,000
Is it because of

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,390
Jin and Shen Yu?

336
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,080
Did he give you a hard time?

337
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,060
No.

338
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,600
It's just for a job.

339
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,660
It's

340
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,010
a very difficult job.

341
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,660
A very difficult job?

342
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,109
His Grace ordered me to go to Jiangzhou

343
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,500
and collect evidence of the rebellion.

344
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,460
Rebellion?

345
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,140
Then...

346
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,140
what are you going to do?

347
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,930
Do my duty

348
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,460
and punish the mutineer impartially.

349
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,260
But

350
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,910
I’m afraid it will make you sad.

351
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,690
Will you blame me?

352
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,860
No.

353
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,180
Do you really

354
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,910
hate your father so much?

355
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,270
I've forgotten

356
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,050
the past.

357
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
But,

358
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,250
a wrongdoer

359
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,220
should be punished.

360
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,480
It's a principle

361
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,280
that even a three-year-old child can understand.

362
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,750
My mother's death anniversary is coming.

363
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,420
I'll go with you

364
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,150
to Jiangzhou this time.

365
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,850
If there is a chance

366
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,960
to persuade my father,

367
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,200
I will do my part

368
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,910
as his daughter in this life.

369
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,410
This trip is extremely dangerous.

370
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,540
I have to go.

371
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
You will be with me

372
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,870
and protect me.

373
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,300
Rascal.

374
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,580
Do we need to think of

375
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,460
a proper reason

376
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,600
why we go back?

377
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,580
What do you think?

378
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
We just got married.

379
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,860
According to the etiquette,

380
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,000
I should visit my family with my husband after the wedding.

381
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,440
How about this?

382
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,740
Okay.

383
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,980
[Prince Guangping’s Mansion]

384
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,580
Butler,

385
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,230
Princess's carriage

386
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,300
has entered the city gate of Jiangzhou.

387
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
They are heading towards the mansion.

388
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,450
Stand still.

389
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,240
Cheer up.

390
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,940
Welcome, Your Highness.

391
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,900
Welcome, commander-in-chief.

392
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,900
Rise.

393
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,020
Your Highness, commander-in-chief.

394
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,240
His Royal Highness heard that you came back today

395
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,980
and ordered me

396
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,820
to prepare the banquet in advance.

397
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,380
You must be tired.

398
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,080
Please come in and have a rest.

399
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,060
Please.

400
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,550
My dear,

401
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,040
I suddenly thought of a place.

402
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,780
A place that I must go.

403
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,290
Can you go with me?

404
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,480
Okay.

405
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:08,810
Let's go.

406
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,550
Your Highness. Your...

407
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,740
The couple are talking.

408
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,270
Why are you following them?

409
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,000
Your Highness.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,860
That's enough.

411
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Let's unpack

412
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,010
the princess's baggage.

413
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,410
Get to work.

414
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,430
Get ready.

415
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,720
-Yes. -Yes.

416
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,250
Butler,

417
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,130
they're gone. What should we do?

418
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,170
What else can we do?

419
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,100
Send someone to keep an eye on them.

420
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:44,920
[Nanyuan]

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,680
Take care.

422
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,520
Is this the place

423
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,480
that you must go?

424
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,500
Of course.

425
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,180
Help me down.

426
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,210
Be careful.

427
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,710
Watch your step.

428
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,260
Welcome to come again.

429
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,790
Let's go.

430
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
Please come in.

431
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,260
Come in.

432
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,910
Please.

433
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,080
This way, please.

434
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,700
Waiter,

435
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,730
get your best instrumentalist

436
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,940
here.

437
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,940
No need.

438
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,260
Yes.

439
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,620
I'll take my leave.

440
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,290
Take your husband

441
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,900
to enjoy music here.

442
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,940
Your Highness,

443
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,840
I've never heard this before.

444
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,570
Revisiting the old place,

445
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,900
Lord Shen,

446
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,100
you're still

447
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,540
such a wet blanket.

448
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,200
You can't even go home,

449
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
but you are still in such a good mood.

450
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,300
You are wrong.

451
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,660
This is

452
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,090
where we first met.

453
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,580
When we come back to Jiangzhou after our wedding,

454
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,820
we definitely should come here first.

455
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,380
How did you know

456
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,280
there was an ambush in the mansion?

457
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,050
Ambush?

458
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,660
What ambush?

459
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,940
Although you didn't mean to

460
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,980
do it,

461
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,470
it just happened

462
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,020
and helped me

463
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,100
for solving my problems.

464
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,040
Since your father wants to take me down

465
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,440
when I enter the mansion,

466
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,160
I'm afraid

467
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,410
it's hard to persuade him to give up.

468
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,300
He is so stubborn.

469
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm afraid many people

470
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,730
will die because of that.

471
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,660
My dear,

472
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,200
your are stern-faced,

473
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
but have a kind heart.

474
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,180
If that's the case,

475
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,420
why did you

476
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,300
choose to be a Jinlin Guard

477
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,220
and do things

478
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,700
you don't like?

479
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,540
In the future,

480
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,960
if we have our own children,

481
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,170
what do you want them to do?

482
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,730
I want them

483
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,070
to be safe and happy,

484
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,860
and grow up without worries.

485
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
What if

486
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,930
the political situation becomes unstable

487
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,980
and our country is constantly at war,

488
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,450
how could our children be safe and happy

489
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,730
as you want?

490
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,860
You sacrificed yourself for justice.

491
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,670
As your wife,

492
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,370
I'm really caring about you.

493
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,110
Here.

494
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,100
What are you thinking

495
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,100
with this expression?

496
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,140
You said

497
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,190
you wanted to give our children

498
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,720
a peaceful world.

499
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,630
I'm very touched.

500
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,380
But after thinking about it,

501
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
I think the peace of the world

502
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,120
is none of my business.

503
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,460
But for the children,

504
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,540
I think

505
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,720
I can help you.

506
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,420
How dare you!

507
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,740
Ling,

508
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,430
you are getting more and more shameless.

509
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,580
You are my husband.

510
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,200
Why should I be ashamed?

511
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,980
Besides,

512
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,340
when we first met,

513
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,460
you jumped out of the window and ran away.

514
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,340
Today,

515
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,020
I won't

516
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,080
let you escape from the window again.

517
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,340
I'm going to continue

518
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,380
what l did last time with you here.

519
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,900
Stop it.

520
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,400
Please.

521
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,170
Your Royal Highness, the guests are here.

522
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Where is Shen Yan?

523
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,180
He is at Nanyuan with the princess.

524
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,740
Our men have been watching.

525
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,100
Let them in.

526
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,290
Yes.

527
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,030
Crown Prince Tuoba.

528
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,290
Prince Guangping.

529
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,490
Your Royal Highness,

530
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,750
how have you been?

531
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,410
Have a seat.

532
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,630
Your Royal Highness,

533
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,100
why you want to see me

534
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,080
in the middle of the night?

535
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,180
Not long ago,

536
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,730
I went to Yejing

537
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,440
to meet you.

538
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,300
I was wondering what you think about

539
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,760
the thing we discussed at that time?

540
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,580
Your Royal Highness,

541
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,130
do you mean the thing that you want to ally

542
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,340
with Yigu

543
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,740
and ask me to help you

544
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,070
bring order out of chaos

545
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,980
and ascend the throne?

546
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,060
That's right.

547
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,860
I heard that

548
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,780
Liu Wang

549
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,410
and his father, the emperor,

550
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,560
are on their way

551
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,190
to Jiangzhou secretly.

552
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,550
They want to go to Mount Luoxian

553
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,150
to find the immortal Taoist

554
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,940
and ask for an elixir.

555
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,740
This is a great opportunity.

556
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,220
It's easy

557
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,620
to kill them at that time.

558
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,620
After that,

559
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,460
I'll lead the army of Yigu

560
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,050
into Jiangzhou City.

561
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,740
Then we can join our forces

562
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,530
to take over Jiangzhou.

563
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,340
It's only a matter of time before we succeed.

564
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,500
Your Royal Highness, you're very sincere.

565
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,420
I

566
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,020
would like to help you.

567
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,220
However,

568
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,660
if you want to borrow my troops,

569
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,860
Your Royal Highness,

570
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,780
you need to promise two things.

571
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,620
Which two?

572
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,700
First,

573
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,260
you promised

574
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,820
to give us

575
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,720
six cities with fertile fields

576
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,360
at the border of Wei.

577
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,380
But my father thinks

578
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,510
we need two more cities.

579
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,380
Eight cities?

580
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,100
Okay.

581
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,260
Eight cities are fine.

582
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,990
But

583
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,770
I hope

584
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,430
you can keep

585
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,860
your today's promise

586
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,220
in the future.

587
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,870
Don't worry, Your Royal Highness.

588
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,810
We, Yigu,

589
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,700
will never go back on our words.

590
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,540
Okay.

591
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,070
What's the second one?

592
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,330
The second thing is that

593
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I

594
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,700
want to kill Shen Yan.

595
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,260
Your Royal Highness, since you want to cooperate with His Grace,

596
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,060
I need

597
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,660
to remind you.

598
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,560
We are about to stage the rebellion.

599
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,800
Shen Yan and Liu Ling

600
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,580
come to Jiangzhou

601
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,510
at this critical moment.

602
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,310
I guess the fact that

603
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,870
you are training a private army

604
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,480
in Jiangzhou

605
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,990
has already been known by our crown prince and emperor.

606
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,520
They sent him here this time

607
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,890
to find out the evidence of our rebellion.

608
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,040
He is meticulous

609
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,650
and intelligent.

610
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,540
If we keep him alive,

611
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,540
he will ruin our plan sooner or later.

612
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,980
It's just Shen Yan.

613
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
I know how to deal with him.

614
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

615
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,540
Don't worry?

616
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,980
Whether we

617
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,820
succeed or not

618
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,780
is not only about your future.

619
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,020
It's rare that

620
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,270
His Grace is willing to help you.

621
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,420
But you're full of excuses.

622
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,820
Are you reluctant to kill Shen Yan,

623
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,060
your son-in-law?

624
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,940
You can't achieve great things with your petty kindness.

625
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,200
If you don't kill Shen Yan,

626
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,330
it's not enough to prove

627
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,810
your sincerity in working with us.

628
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,820
Please think twice.

629
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,390
Your Majesty.

630
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,960
See you later.

631
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,850
You must be a wise man.

632
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,850
I

633
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,480
and Crown Prince Tuoba

634
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,310
will wait for your good news.

635
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,380
Your Majesty.

636
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,200
Lord Shen, what brings you here

637
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,420
at night?

638
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,100
Your Royal Highness, I heard that

639
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,220
you have been a famous general

640
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,100
of Wei

641
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,460
since you were young.

642
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,420
Why do you

643
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,360
do such a treasonous thing?

644
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,660
You are asking a tiger for its skin.

645
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,220
Asking a tiger for its skin?

646
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,330
Your metaphor is not quite apt.

647
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,990
I'm asking a tiger to help me chase away the wolf.

648
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,420
This is the worst strategy in the art of war.

649
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,180
If I had other choice,

650
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,770
I wouldn't use it.

651
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,280
Wealth and glory are just a passing cloud.

652
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,930
If you insist,

653
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,340
I'm afraid all your family members and followers will leave you

654
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,850
in the end.

655
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,750
Is this worth it?

656
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,930
All my family members and followers will leave me?

657
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,420
I'm already alone.

658
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,400
The only thing supporting me

659
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,520
is just the hatred in my heart.

660
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,020
The throne

661
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,380
was supposed to be mine.

662
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,580
I want to take back my thing.

663
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,120
If anyone dares to stop me,

664
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,660
I will kill him.

665
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,410
In that case,

666
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,520
the death of the late princess Zhang Yun

667
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,800
is also because

668
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,020
she gets in your way.

669
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,930
Your Royal Highness,

670
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,470
you still have your brother

671
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,640
and your daughter.

672
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,370
If you change your mind,

673
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,260
you will find that

674
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,500
you are not alone.

675
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,690
The late princess hoped

676
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,490
you could retract from the wrong path,

677
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,280
but she died because of that.

678
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,820
Although

679
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,200
you didn't kill her,

680
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,750
her death was caused by your ambition.

681
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,820
I believe

682
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,740
this must be

683
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,820
a big regret in your life.

684
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,570
It's also a slit you've torn

685
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,750
in Ling’s heart.

686
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,620
Stop it.

687
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,950
Whether I tell you it or not,

688
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,720
if you can't face

689
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,010
the mistakes you made,

690
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,780
you will always be stuck

691
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,790
in the same rut

692
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,480
and feel difficult to get out.

693
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,800
Ling comes with me this time

694
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,080
because she hopes

695
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,730
you can change your mind.

696
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,460
I hope

697
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,800
you can make your decision carefully

698
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,220
this time.

699
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,420
Don’t make more mistakes

700
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,570
and hurt Ling.

701
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,270
Shen Yan,

702
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,020
I will consider about

703
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,290
your words.

704
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Yun’s death anniversary is coming.

705
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,340
Let’s wait for that day.

706
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,270
By then,

707
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,050
I will give you an answer.

708
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,460
OK.

709
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,080
I'll take my leave.

710
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,989
Yun,

711
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,179
our daughter

712
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,219
married a good husband.

713
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,639
If you could see him,

714
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,070
you would like him very much.

715
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,330
This is

716
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,350
where I used to live in my childhood.

717
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,790
Here.

718
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,570
Come.

719
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,700
Sit down.

720
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,220
You brought me here

721
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,180
to play on the swing with you?

722
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,400
That's one reason.

723
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,650
When I was young,

724
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,980
my mother played with me

725
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,040
and sang for me here

726
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,490
every day.

727
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,460
I asked her.

728
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,900
"Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be."

729
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,030
What does that mean?

730
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,920
She said

731
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,460
it is what every woman in this world

732
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,770
wishes for.

733
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,140
She said,

734
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,130
when I grow up,

735
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,340
I will also meet a man,

736
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,100
a handsome and brave man.

737
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,220
He will love me, protect me

738
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,540
and treasure me

739
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,330
more than his life.

740
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,610
She said

741
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,100
he will hold my hand

742
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,100
and grow old with me for the rest of my life.

743
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,900
In this way,

744
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,610
I won't feel lonely anymore.

745
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,070
Now, it seems

746
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,670
my mother didn't lie to me.

747
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,540
Shen Yan, what are you doing?

748
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,100
Well,

749
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,260
when you think of this swing again,

750
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,340
you will not only think of your mother,

751
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,450
but also me.

752
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,940
That's the first reason.

753
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
What is the other one?

754
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
Second,

755
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,780
I have hidden a gift

756
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,620
here.

757
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,620
It's for you.

758
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
For me?

759
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:35,910
Be careful.

760
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,580
Here.

761
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,610
Let me do it.

762
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,510
Maiden Rose.

763
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,780
This jar of wine

764
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,700
was buried by my mother.

765
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,060
It's the same age as me.

766
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,900
My mother said

767
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,140
one day,

768
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,620
when I'm getting married,

769
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,740
it will be my dowry.

770
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,180
All these years,

771
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,420
I've always remembered

772
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,260
that.

773
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,740
Today,

774
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
since we're going to see her,

775
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,370
we have to bring it.

776
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,720
If

777
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,860
we bring this jar of wine

778
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,300
and drink it with her,

779
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,090
she will be very happy.

780
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,790
Right?

781
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,820
Yes.

782
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,280
Let's go.

783
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,830
Go.

784
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,300
Ling,

785
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,940
I think

786
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,660
I should

787
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,020
explain to you that

788
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,580
I’ve got the evidence

789
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,990
of Prince Guangping’s rebellion.

790
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,550
So soon?

791
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,960
He is His Majesty's brother.

792
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,000
He is second to His Majesty,

793
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,560
but he still wants to rebel.

794
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,990
It’s his fault.

795
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,180
Ling,

796
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,540
don’t worry too much.

797
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,340
The evidence

798
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,510
is still in my hands.

799
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,060
I didn't send it back to Yejing.

800
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,860
If he is willing to change his mind,

801
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,390
there's still room for him.

802
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,830
How about this?

803
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,060
I'll go with you

804
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,610
to offer a libation for your mother first.

805
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,650
After that,

806
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,940
I'll go with you

807
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,360
to persuade your father.

808
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,020
Wouldn't it be best

809
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,890
if he could change his mind?

810
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,660
Thank you.

811
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,120
Let's go.

812
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:18,890
[The Grave of My Wife Liu]

813
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,690
Mother,

814
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,230
Ling is here to see you.

815
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,550
[The Grave of My Wife Liu]

816
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,740
This year

817
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,320
has gone by in a flash.

818
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,170
But this time,

819
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,570
I don't come back alone.

820
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,410
I got married.

821
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,370
I come with my husband.

822
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,490
You said

823
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,130
there would be a man to protect me for the rest of my life.

824
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,970
I found him.

825
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,590
It's the first time I offering a libation for my mother-in-law.

826
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,270
I should

827
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,620
make the first toast.

828
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,780
This jar of wine

829
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,630
was left to me by your mother.

830
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,490
Don't you want me

831
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,820
to have a taste?

832
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,440
Archers, get ready.

833
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,290
Release!

834
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,660
Go!

835
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,850
Shen Yan,

836
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,320
what's wrong with you?

837
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,220
The wine...

838
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,550
The wine is poisonous.

839
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,810
Poisonous?

840
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,730
How could it be poisonous?

841
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,820
Let's go.

842
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,120
Go.

843
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,060
Hurry!

844
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,690
Ling,

845
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,900
listen to me.

846
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,990
Prince Guangping only wants to kill me.

847
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,140
He will protect you.

848
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,910
No matter what happens later,

849
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,370
don't do anything stupid.

850
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,810
I don't want to survive.

851
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,670
I only want you.

852
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,660
We agreed

853
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,410
we’ll be together forever.

854
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,740
Be good, Ling.

855
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,070
Listen to me.

856
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,600
Just wait for me.

857
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,850
No matter how difficult it is,

858
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,550
♫ The night is not spent yet as affection spreads far and wide ♫

859
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,170
I will come back to you.

860
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,540
Be good.

861
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,630
♫ Never expect to savor the taste of life ♫

862
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,910
♫ How lucky I am to have you around ♫

863
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,370
Shen Yan,

864
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:04,120
♫ Night and day, we stay together. Never forget each other♫

865
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,900
Shen Yan! Shen Yan! Shen Yan!

866
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,140
No! Shen Yan!

867
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,730
Shen Yan, no!

868
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,460
Shen Yan.

869
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,340
No one knows a daughter better than her father.

870
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,020
How could you think of

871
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,300
poisoning

872
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,860
the dowry left by the late princess?

873
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,940
This is

874
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,390
brilliant.

875
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,380
It seems that, Your Grace,

876
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,650
you are satisfied with that.

877
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,220
Wonderful.

878
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,940
Your Royal Highness, with your sincerity,

879
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,740
there's nothing to worry about.

880
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,010
I'll send out troops in three days.

881
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,020
We need to discuss some details.

882
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,380
Please, Your Royal Highness.

883
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,060
Please.

884
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,370
Take the princess back to her mansion and confine her.

885
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:54,970
Yes.
