[My Sassy Princess]

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,450
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,300
Jin,

5
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,800
why are your hands so cold?

6
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,270
Are you feeling unwell?

7
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,860
It's just the strong wind at night.

8
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,970
Don't worry.

9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,650
This time in Yejing,

10
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,630
it's the first time that

11
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,009
you, Shen Yu, and I

12
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,460
are together, right?

13
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,100
But you know what?

14
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,490
When I saw you

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
with Shen Yu,

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,579
it made me think

17
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,260
you are a perfect couple.

18
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,790
Back then,

19
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,780
when I saw how Shen Yu loved

20
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,160
and protected you,

21
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,380
I actually envied you.

22
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,260
And I was happy for you.

23
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,100
If

24
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,110
the crime in Jiangzhou didn't happen,

25
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,440
and if your parents

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
were still alive,

27
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,579
you and Shen Yu

28
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,620
would have already married

29
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,700
and lived a carefree life.

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,180
Ling,

31
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,980
"if"

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,100
is the most beautiful lie

33
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,420
in this world.

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,079
Instead of indulging yourself

35
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,360
to live in such a lie,

36
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,810
I'd rather open my eyes

37
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,810
and see the truth.

38
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,320
At least I can be more sober.

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,220
I can see

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,720
your feelings for Shen Yu.

41
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,040
If I want to seek justice

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,080
for my parents,

43
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,020
I must

44
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,380
cut off this relationship with my own hands.

45
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,780
There is no turning back.

46
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,130
I don't understand.

47
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,550
He is so cool

48
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,820
and is indifferent to fame or gains.

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,150
He likes to live a leisurely and free life.

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,020
Even

51
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,540
in a place like the administration of Nandian,

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,980
he has never changed.

53
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,790
He is unworldly.

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,960
But I need revenge.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,220
So I have to be worldly.

56
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,990
The last thing I want to see

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,910
is that Shen Yu gets implicated

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,920
because of me.

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,520
Because I know

60
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,000
he hates that kind of things

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,880
the most.

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
So

63
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,100
this is love?

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,579
Why did you keep saying silly things today?

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,290
Stop talking about me. Let's talk about you.

66
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,360
Have you made up your mind

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,090
about what I asked you that day?

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,620
Compared with

69
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,800
your love for Shen Yu,

70
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,780
my feelings for Shen Yan

71
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,300
are nothing.

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,500
Don't be silly.

73
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,260
Love things can't be compared

74
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,340
like this.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,660
Jin,

76
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,589
after we enter the city,

77
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,300
drop me

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,579
at the tavern in the center of the street.

79
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,029
I want to take a walk alone.

[Administration of Beidian]

81
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,920
No wonder you can't get a wife.

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,070
You've decided to

83
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,130
spend the rest of your life with work.

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,630
Mind your own business.

85
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,780
The things you're looking for

86
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,580
are all here.

87
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,580
Yun Yi.

88
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,230
He should be called Lu Lianshan.

89
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,930
He must have something important

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
left in the north.

91
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,740
I'll ask His Majesty

92
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,620
to allow me to go to the north.

93
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,500
In such a hurry?

94
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,550
The Double Seventh Festival is coming.

95
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,400
The old man of Family Lu

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
will present a feast in his mansion.

97
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,340
He has invited ladies

98
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,590
of all noble families in the capital

99
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,180
to accompany

100
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,960
his precious granddaughter Liu Runxiang

101
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,380
to celebrate the Double Seventh Festival.

102
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,740
That day will be the perfect time

103
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,940
to sneak in

104
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,300
and steal the Kun jade.

105
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,230
You

106
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,650
get this done

107
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,380
before heading to Xuanwu Town in the north.

108
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,740
Got it.

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,140
I forgot to tell you this.

110
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,420
Your Princess Changle

111
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,760
has been really upset.

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,740
They said it's because

113
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,220
you are in trouble,

114
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,390
but there is nothing she can do.

115
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,750
She can't help at all

116
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,610
and has been increasingly upset at the thought of it.

117
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,740
So she ran out at night

118
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,710
and bought more than ten pots of wine

119
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,480
in the market

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,430
in order to get drunk and forget the worries.

121
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,510
At this moment,

122
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,020
I think

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,500
she must be drinking alone

124
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,050
in her bedroom.

125
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,080
If you are not busy,

126
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,610
you can go and have a look.

127
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,990
Shen Yan.

128
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,780
You're here.

129
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,380
Perfect timing.

130
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,730
Let's forget our worries together.

131
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,530
Shen Yan,

132
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,570
didn't we agree not to meet again?

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,940
Why are you

134
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,690
in my dream again?

135
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,970
I see you in my dream every day,

136
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,020
but why do I still

137
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,059
cry over missing you so much?

138
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,820
You're drunk.

139
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm not drunk.

140
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,580
Ling Bi told me

141
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,380
that

142

if I really love someone,

143
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,100
I will

144
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,610
cry over missing him so much.

145
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,170
But every time

146
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,760
I see you,

147
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,650
I smile.

148
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,180
In this case,

149
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,930
my feelings for you

150
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,230
may not be real.

151
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,060
So I can't meet you.

152
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,430
So

153
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,940
you don't want to

154
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,850
meet me

155
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,310
because of that, right?

156
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,100
Fine.

157
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,740
Keep thinking.

158
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm leaving.

159
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
No.

161
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,280
You...

162
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
At least in my dream,

163
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,290
you can't leave me alone.

164
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,210
Okay.

165
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,560
Shen Yan, you are really nice.

If that's the case,

167
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,090
I hope

168
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,610
I can hold you forever,

and we will never part.

170
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,140
And I hope I'll

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,390
never wake up from this dream.

♫ My untold thoughts, my lovesickness ♫

178
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,310
♫ Your love for me is like my love for you ♫

179
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,910
♫ We'll never feel lonely in the world ♫

180
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,290
♫ I'll share your wishes in the coming years ♫

181
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,270
♫ All the love poems fail to portray my love for you ♫

182
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,020
♫ I only want to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

183
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,570
♫ And indulge in the world holding your hand ♫

184
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,790
It's a dream?

185
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,920
If it's a dream,

186
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,370
I'll just dream a little longer.

187
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,820
Jin.

188
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,460
Ling,

189
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,660
you drank?

190
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,830
Your Highness,

191
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,500
why did you

192
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,560
drink so much?

193
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,620
I was planning to go back to sleep.

194
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,740
I had

195
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,360
a very beautiful dream.

196
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,180
Why did you

197
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,780
come so early in the morning?

198
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,140
I intended to

199
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,370
discuss something important

200
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,330
with you.

201
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,650
But I didn't expect that

202
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,180
you want me to leave

203
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,740
before I take a seat.

204
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,220
Anyway,

205
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,070
it's just something about

206
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,230
Lord Shen.

207
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,040
I won't disturb you

208
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,430
dreaming then.

209
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,260
Jin, Jin.

210
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
I'm sorry!

211
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,100
Come on.

212
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,210
Sit down.

213
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm sorry, Jin.

214
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,660
Tell me.

215
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,060
Your Lord Shen

216
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,860
wants to sneak into Lu's Mansion to get the Kun jade.

217
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,820
I heard that the two brothers

218
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,970
plan to steal the jade

219
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,720
on the occasion of the Double Seventh Festival in several days.

220
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,130
It's not easy

221
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,930
to sneak into Lu's Mansion

222
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,570
and leave safely.

223
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,980
What do you want me to do?

224
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,710
Just tell me.

225
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,220
To help them leave safely,

226
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,910
someone will need

227
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,940
to create an opportunity for them

228
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,290
on that day.

229
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180
In Yejing,

230
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,650
no one is more suitable

231
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,100
than you.

232
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,770
You want me to make a scene?

233
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,080
Are you interested?

234
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,780
Of course.

235
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,000
The mother and daughter of Family Lu

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
used Yue Ling

237
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,940
to set me up

238
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,210
and killed Shen Oink.

239
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,240
I haven't

240
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,390
found a chance

241
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,350
to take revenge.

242
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,710
What is your plan?

243
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,580
Tell me.

244
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,180
It's a secret.

245
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,320
When that day comes,

246
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
you'll know.

247
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,370
Steward.

248
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,070
Bad news!

249
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,260
Steward, bad news!

250
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
Why are you shouting?

251
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,940
Steward, something happened.

252
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,020
Princess Changle

253
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,310
brought a dozen guards

254
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,770
and is fighting her way in.

255
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,780
Let's go.

256
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,160
No one is allowed to get in.

257
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,760
Move!

258
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,720
Move!

259
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,650
Get up.

260
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,390
What are you doing?

261
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,450
What are you doing?

262
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,180
Move!

263
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,830
Back off!

264
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,210
Let us in!

265
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,060
What are you doing?

266
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,130
Don't stand in the way.

267
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,780
Move!

268
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,280
Let us in!

269
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,420
No!

270
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,900
Hurry.

271
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,170
Get out of the way!

272
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,220
Move!

273
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Move!

274
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,920
Back off!

275
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,540
Stop pushing.

276
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,380
Your Highness, this...

277
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,060
Why are you doing this?

278
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,340
Finally, a steward is here.

279
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,500
I want to get in.

280
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,900
Tell them to back off.

281
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,820
Your Highness.

282
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,750
It's not that I don't want you to get in.

283
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,940
Master and Young Master

284
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,360
repeatedly told us that

285
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,770
those who don't have an invitation

286
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,210
can't get in.

287
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,520
Your Highness, you are a noble lady.

288
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
Why do you bother

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
to embarrass us?

290
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,180
You have invited ladies

291
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,540
of all noble families in the capital

292
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,300
to the feast.

293
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,010
But you didn't invite me deliberately.

294
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,440
You showed no respect

295
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,430
for me.

296
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
It makes me embarrassed too.

297
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,100
Come on.

298
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:47,930
This...

299
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,220
Clear the way.

300
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,280
Your Highness.

301
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,650
Your Highness.

302
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,580
This...

303
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,270
Steward,

304
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,060
what should we do?

305
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,460
Cut the crap!

306
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,790
Hurry up and stay close.

307
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,060
[Lu's Mansion]

308
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,240
Your Highness.

309
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,940
Who are you?

310
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,870
What a coincidence.

311
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,080
You are all here.

312
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,700
Liu Ling.

313
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,070
You came here

314
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,150
uninvited today.

315
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,750
After all, you are a princess crowned by His Majesty.

316
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,210
If word gets out tomorrow,

317
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,490
I'm afraid

318
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,170
you'll find yourself in a really embarrassing situation.

319
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,650
I am not you.

320
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm here today

321
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,560
to seek justice

322
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,480
for Yue Ling.

323
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,350
Justice?

324
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,630
What justice?

325
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,100
I really don't understand

326
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,700
what you said.

327
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,120
As we all know,

328
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,700
a few days ago, Yue Ling, a maid of Family Lu,

329
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,750
had a miscarriage because of Your Highness.

330
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,860
So she killed herself in grief and anger.

331
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,500
Two innocent people

332
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,260
died.

333
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,170
In terms of justice,

334
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,400
it should be we

335
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,150
seek justice for them from you.

336
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,380
Mr. Lu, don't be

337
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
in such a hurry to slander me.

338
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,180
Today,

339
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,000
the first thing I want to tell you

340
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,000
is about Yue Ling's miscarriage.

341
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,819
Come out.

342
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,270
This is

343
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,099
a doctor of Huichun Clinic.

344
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,860
A few days ago,

345
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,480
Yue Ling went to Huichun Clinic for treatment.

346
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,030
Tell everyone

347
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,850
what happened back then.

348
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,300
Tell us

349
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,020
how long it will take for the medicine to kick in

350
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,030
after taking it?

351
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,020
Your Highness,

352
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,140
after about an hour,

353
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,620
it will definitely work.

354
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,150
Then why did Yue Ling

355
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,410
fell at the front door of the House of Duke Dingbei

356
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,470
several days after she got in the House of Duke Dingbei?

357
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
So this is what happened.

358
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,290
I don't understand it.

359
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,090
After thinking about it,

360
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,880
I have

361
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,430
an unkind idea.

362
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,960
Maybe Yue Ling knew

363
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,220
that the baby in her belly

364
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,580
was not allowed to come to this world.

365
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,220
So she wanted to set a trap.

366
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,090
That's why she decided to go to the House of Duke Dingbei

367
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,620
before the miscarriage.

368
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,260
Yue Ling died because of you,

369
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,300
but you're talking nonsense here.

370
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,580
You've gone too far.

371
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,660
Do you think

372
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,410
you can confuse right and wrong

373
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,300
by just finding

374
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,700
a doctor to

375
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,480
talk nonsense?

376
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:48,960
This is the second thing

377
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,530
I want to talk to you about.

378
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,630
What is this about?

379
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,260
This...

380
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,330
Why...

381
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,100
Gosh.

382
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,600
Why is the body moved here?

383
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,530
This...

384
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,790
This is so unlucky.

385
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,700
This is so unlucky.

386
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,220
Why did you move the corpse

387
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,020
here?

388
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,020
Liu Ling.

389
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,660
She is already dead.

390
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,800
What else do you want?

391
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,990
The dead comes first.

392
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,380
No offense.

393
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,820
But I need

394
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,110
to seek justice for Yue Ling,

395
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,110
who died wrongly.

396
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,340
Mr. Lu just said

397
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Yue Ling jumped into a river and died

398
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,420
because she was sad and angry due to the miscarriage,

399
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,020
right?

400
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,780
Yes.

401
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,330
Everyone in the capital knows about this.

402
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,640
Do you still want to find yourself an excuse?

403
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,690
According to the record of the coroner of the administration of Beidian,

404
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,450
Yue Ling's face shows cyanosis

405
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,030
and there are blood spots.

406
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,500
No sign of swelling due to effusion in the chest or abdomen.

407
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
That means

408
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Yue Ling didn't drown.

409
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,510
She was stifled to death by someone,

410
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,640
and her body was thrown into the river.

411
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,300
That day, Yue Ling

412
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,420
fell at the front door of the House of Duke Dingbei

413
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,170
and bled.

414
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,120
The House of Duke Dingbei asked someone

415
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,740
to send her back to Lu's Mansion.

416
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,300
Like you said,

417
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,660
everyone in the capital

418
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,540
knows it.

419
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,820
But why was a person

420
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,010
entering your mansion alive

421
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,980
stifled to death?

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,180
Why was her body thrown into the river?

423
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,260
And why did someone make it look like a suicide?

424
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,230
About that,

425
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,240
shouldn't Family Lu

426
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,920
give an explanation?

427
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,580
Mr. Lu,

428
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,890
I am

429
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,650
waiting for your explanation.

430
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,710
Young Master, it's done.

431
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,380
Calm down, Your Highness.

432
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,430
The butler said

433
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,460
our residence had been burgled.

434
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,660
Luckily he found out in time

435
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,080
and has locked the thief

436
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,050
in the study.

437
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,500
Yue Ling's case can wait.

438
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,490
I will spend time to explain it to you

439
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,890
after I catch that thief.

440
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,420
Lu Mingshan, stop!

441
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,330
Your Highness,

442
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,460
the thief they are talking about...

443
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,260
Go take a look.

444
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,570
Lu Mingshan!

445
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,850
Open the door.

446
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,260
Lu Mingshan, stop!

447
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,610
Your Highness,

448
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,610
you think thoroughly

449
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,690
and can see things clearly.

450
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,850
Would you take a guess?

451
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,110
Who is the thief

452
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,200
locked in the room?

453
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,680
Don't try to distract me

454
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,340
and avoid the real issue here.

455
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,670
I wouldn't dare to do so.

456
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,850
It's just a matter of priorities.

457
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,110
After I catch this thief

458
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,460
and send him to the authority,

459
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,200
I will look into that case with you.

460
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,330
Don't you dare move.

461
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,050
Your Highness,

462
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,110
this is the property of Lu's Mansion.

463
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,420
If you want to make a scene,

464
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,680
go pick another place.

465
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,670
Lu Mingshan,

466
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,860
don't forget that I'm

467
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,290
Jiangzhou's number one wicked woman.

468
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,950
I don't care whose place it is.

469
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,020
I'm here today

470
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
to demanded an explanation

471
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,060
for Yue Ling.

472
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,450
This matter hasn't been solved yet.

473
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,820
How can I leave it unsettled?

474
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,500
Yue Ling was a maid who was

475
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,940
bought by our Lu’s Mansion.

476
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,820
Even if

477
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,140
we killed her, you are in no position

478
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,420
to stand up for her.

479
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,140
Oh yeah?

480
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,850
Before Yue Ling died,

481
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,540
she took shelter at the House of Duke Dingbei purposefully.

482
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,510
She said she wanted to be my server.

483
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,900
This indenture was sent

484
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,100
by your aunt,

485
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,860
my stepmother personally.

486
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,970
It's our men from the House of Duke Dingbei

487
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,260
that you want to kill,

488
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,270
not people from the Lu's Mansion.

489
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Young Master.

490
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,140
Your Highness,

491
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,510
if you keep messing around,

492
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,950
we will hurt you.

493
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,780
Hit him for me!

494
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,790
Hit this heartless man.

495
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,160
I'll reward you one tael for one hit.

496
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,630
If you hit him ten times, I'll reward you ten taels.

497
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,700
What are you waiting for?

498
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,540
Do it now!

499
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,090
Stop it.

500
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,410
Your Highness, look.

501
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,820
Liu Quan hit three times.

502
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,220
Uncle Hei Wu hit ten times.

503
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,200
We will beat you to death.

504
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,790
We will beat you to death.

505
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,050
You malicious animal.

506
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,010
Knock it off.

507
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,430
Stop it.

508
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,650
Liu Ling,

509
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,180
are you done?

510
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,300
You had him beaten up.

511
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,970
And you took your revenge.

512
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,610
If you are still angry,

513
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,430
you can appeal to the government .

514
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,690
We will compensate her

515
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,030
according to the government's decision.

516
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,000
You will definitely get a satisfactory result.

517
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,380
If there's nothing else, get out of our way

518
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,780
so we can catch the thief.

519
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,700
Unlock the door.

520
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,820
Don't you dare!

521
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,420
I'm Princess Changle,

522
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,100
who is crowned by His Majesty.

523
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,300
Do you all want to die?

524
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:41,850
Fine.

525
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,310
If this matter gets reported

526
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,390
to His Majesty

527
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
and he is determined to protect you,

528
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,870
I, Lu Mingshan, will take full responsibility.

529
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,470
They wouldn't dare. I would.

530
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,300
Are you gonna move or not?

531
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,020
I'm not.

532
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,990
Are you okay?

533
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,580
Shen Yan.

534
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,110
What are you doing here?

535
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,800
Mr. Lu,

536
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,220
did you lose something?

537
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,080
Open the door now!  Open the door now!

538
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,490
Help!

539
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,210
Open the door!

540
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,110
Isn't it Junior Princess's voice?

541
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
Yes. It's her voice.

542
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,470
-How did she get locked inside?
- Anyone out there?

543
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,940
-Since this is a misunderstanding,
- Open the door now!

544
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,820
I am

545
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,030
taking Her Highness

546
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,750
back home.

547
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,180
Open the door!

548
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,420
Let's go.

549
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,620
Hurry!

550
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,400
Open the door!

551
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,910
Come on. Get up. Go.

552
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,470
Cousin,

553
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,620
Someone hit me. Look!

554
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,110
Who hit me?

555
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,500
Show yourself now!

556
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,390
Butler.

557
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,060
Young Master.

558
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,940
Go into the room with me.

559
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,500
Yes.

560
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,510
Shen Yan has succeeded.

561
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,930
He will take actions

562
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,170
in the future.

563
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,470
Go tell Hu Xiao

564
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
to spy on

565
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,190
Shen Yan and Xu Shijin.

566
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,160
When the opportunity arises,

567
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,740
kill Shen Yan

568
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,350
and take back my jade.

569
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,180
So I can get revenge

570
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,770
for my humiliation today.

571
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,820
Yes.

572
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,310
The chaos

573
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,610
at Lu's Mansion earlier

574
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,940
was...

575
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,700
was part of your plan?

576
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,390
I have confronted Family Lu many times

577
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,350
about the murder of Yue Ling,

578
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,900
to make Lu Mingshan

579
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
feel uneasy.

580
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,980
Being a cautious person,

581
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,580
he would carry the Kun jade with him

582
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,100
ever since he knew

583
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,900
I was after it.

584
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,610
The study in Lu's Mansion

585
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,680
is a trap.

586
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,560
So I played him at his own game

587
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,380
by letting him think that he succeeded.

588
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,510
My opportunity came

589
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,090
when he let his guard down.

590
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,040
Shen Yu's temperament

591
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,080
hasn't changed at all.

592
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,680
So mischievous.

593
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,810
Your Highness,

594
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,660
I'd like to tell you something.

595
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,720
Take a walk with me, please.

596
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,720
I have to take care of something.

597
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,640
I have to go.

598
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,580
Your Highness.

599
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,870
What?

600
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,980
Let's go and take a look.

601
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,460
Go.

602
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,110
Go have a look. Let's go.

603
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,630
Your Highness, how long are you

604
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,460
going to ignore me?

605
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,230
Ten days to half a month?

606
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,550
Three, five or seven years?

607
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,010
Or you won't meet me for the rest of our lives?

608
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,500
I received a secret imperial edict from the Eastern Palace.

609
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
I will leave for the north tomorrow.

610
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,350
Before I go,

611
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,010
I want an explanation from you.

612
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,540
I...

613
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,060
♫ My longing for you runs like an endless song ♫

614
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,160
Plead for skills by threading a needle.

615
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,500
♫ I love you to the moon and back ♫

616
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,480
Anyone who can thread the string through seven needle holes

617
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,870
can get a red string for love.

618
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,210
♫ I promise to love you always ♫

619
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,210
Come and take a look.

620
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,510
Come and take a look.

621
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,250
♫ I never want to say goodbyes to you ♫

622
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,320
Miss,

623
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,310
would you

624
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,150
like to try?

625
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,290
♫ You are in my dreams; you are in my heart ♫

626
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:25,520
♫ My untold thoughts, my lovesickness ♫

627
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,740
Can this red string really bring love?

628
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,580
♫ Your love for me is like my love for you ♫

629
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,060
Yes, of course.

630
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,300
Miss, look.

631
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,900
This red string

632
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:37,470
♫ We’ll never feel lonely in the world ♫

633
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,020
is specifically requested

634
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,100
from the Vega Temple.

635
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,180
If you plead for skills successfully,

636
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,180
and put this red string

637
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,820
on your boyfriend's wrist,

638
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,050
you two will stay together forever.

639
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,610
♫ I’ll share your wishes in the coming years ♫

640
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,430
Give it a try.

641
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:49,010
♫ All the love poems fail to portray my love for you ♫

642
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,030
♫ I promise to take your hand and grow old with you ♫

643
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:59,240
♫ Don't ask about the way home. I just want to be by your side for life ♫

644
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,370
♫ I will give you a lifelong promise, just as you wish ♫

645
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,300
Don't rush, Miss.

646
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,340
Take your time.

647
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:09,150
♫ Your every wish will come true. It's worth the wait ♫

648
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,380
No. No.

649
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,040
Do you want to try again, Miss?

650
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,480
I'd like to try.

651
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,460
Good. Give it a try, Sir.

652
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,910
♫ I only want to spend the rest of my life with you ♫

653
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,520
♫ And indulge in the world holding your hand ♫

654
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,500
It's not easy

655
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,170
for Her Highness and Lord Shen to meet.

656
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,890
Why they don't seem to

657
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,300
get along with each other?

658
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,850
What do you know?

659
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,950
It's called a tacit understanding.

660
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,020
Silence is golden at the moment.

661
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,840
Don't comment if you don't understand.

662
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,440
You...

663
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,190
You...

664
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,300
Luo Fan, wait here.

665
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,760
Sir, you're very skillful.

666
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,460
Here.

667
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,900
Take this red string

668
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,780
and give it to your loved one.

669
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,820
Thank you.

670
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,570
I didn't get

671
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,270
the red string for love,

672
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,380
but you did.

673
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,010
So it means that

674
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,690
I'm not the one for you.

675
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,380
Don't you always

676
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,580
want an explanation?

677
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,970
I'm telling you

678
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,570
you should...

679
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,500
should give

680
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,210
this red string

681
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,550
to a better girl.

682
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,340
We...We...

683
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,050
We... We are...

684
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,840
Funny how you feel wronged.

685
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,760
Why are you being so hard on yourself,

686
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,280
since you can't say it?

687
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,540
Shen Yan,

688
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,440
there is a barrier in my heart

689
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,570
that I cannot cross.

690
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,340
I can't think about

691
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,540
things in the future.

692
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,820
I can't make a promise to be with you

693
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,480
for the rest of my life either.

694
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,680
I feel like I don't deserve you.

695
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,170
So I don't want to be attached to you.

696
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,570
Why are you laughing?

697
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
I'm laughing because last night

698
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,270
you said something different.

699
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,460
Last...

700
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,540
Lord,

701
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,340
the criminals escorted by Ministry of Punishments

702
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,480
were snatched during chaos.

703
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,360
Right now

704
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,660
they are running off on streets.

705
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,160
If we don't catch them soon enough,

706
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,870
there will be dangers and disasters.

707
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,350
Got it. You can go.

708
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,040
Okay.

709
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,940
You have work to do.

710
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,640
I'm going home now.

711
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,190
I want you to go with me.

712
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,700
You know Shen Yan,

713
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,430
but you don't know Stern-faced Yama.

714
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,900
You said you didn't deserve me.

715
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,460
We can discuss that

716
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,100
after I show you

717
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,020
the world of Yama.

718
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
What do you think?

719
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,040
Are you afraid?

720
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,780
I'm not afraid

721
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,200
when you're with me.

722
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,370
What's wrong?

723
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,640
How can you be so careless?

724
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,240
It's okay.

725
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,790
There will be... two more stitches.

726
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,110
Okay. It's done. There you go.

727
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,670
Jade bracelet.

728
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,470
Miss,

729
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,820
anything you like here?

730
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,680
This one is pretty.

731
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,470
You have such good taste, Miss.

732
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,160
This hairpin

733
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,810
suits you perfectly, Miss.

734
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,980
How much is it?

735
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,909
Four taels.

736
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,900
I'll pass. It's too expensive.

737
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,370
Miss,

738
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,080
-It's a great deal, Miss.
- No, thank you.

739
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,679
Ling Bi,

740
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,300
Sir, take a look.

741
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
How much is it, Mister?

742
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,820
Four taels.

743
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,420
How much?

744
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,600
Four taels.

745
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,730
Here you go. Here you go.

746
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,830
Wrap it nicely for me.

747
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,750
Okay, Sir.

748
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,090
Am I heavy?

749
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,290
It's just you held me too tightly.

750
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,660
Wait for me here.

751
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,380
Bow down and plea guilty,

752
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,170
and I'll spare your lives.

753
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,330
Stern-faced Yama,

754
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,920
do you want to get killed?

755
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,280
Jinlin's night travel

756
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,470
is for the job of killing.

757
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,570
My dirty hands

758
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,450
will never be clean my whole life.

759
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,540
They are bad people.

760
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,910
They deserved it,

761
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,740
even though it saddens me.

762
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,850
The one who kills

763
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,190
must be prepared to be killed.

764
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,340
Stern-faced Yama

765
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,580
lives an unstable life

766
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,920
involving bloodshed.

767
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,990
Your Highness, do you still think

768
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,900
you don't deserve a man like me?

769
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
You are afraid.

770
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,680
This is the first time

771
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,730
I've seen that look of yours.

772
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
You should leave.

773
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,700
No.

774
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,460
Stern-faced Yama is scary.

775
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
But you asked me to wait for you here.

776
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,460
And I will always wait for you.

777
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,230
Shen Yan,

778
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,300
I don't deserve you,

779
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,890
but I'm not willing to let you

780
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,900
wonder alone between life and death

781
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,220
You won't be lonely

782
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,590
if I'm by your side.

783
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,060
Maybe...

784
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,810
maybe I can't make

785
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,960
a lifelong promise.

786
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,060
But before you find the one

787
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,020
who can give you

788
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,660
her whole life,

789
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,940
I can...

790
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,520
♫ My longing for you runs like an endless song ♫

791
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,170
♫ I love you to the moon and back ♫

792
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:53,020
♫ I promise to love you always ♫

793
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,820
♫ I never want to say goodbyes to you ♫

794
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,100
[Can they bear a separate homeward way]

795
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,370
The Magpie Bridge.

796
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,340
Where does it lead?

797
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,410
♫ Green, green the reed ♫

798
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,890
Come in, please.

799
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,530
Miss,

800
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,620
I really admire your beautiful voice.

801
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,740
I came here today

802
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,580
to see you on purpose,

803
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,860
Miss Ru Yu.

804
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,790
I also would like to hear you sing,

805
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,440
for sentimental reasons.

806
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,500
Why are you laughing?

807
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,300
Nothing.

808
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,100
Your words reminded me

809
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,780
of a gentleman.

810
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,490
He always says things like that

811
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,940
when he is here.

812
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,020
Don't mind me, Miss.

813
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,430
Please wait a moment.

814
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,530
♫ Green, green the reed. Dew and frost gleam ♫

815
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:24,940
♫ Where's she I need? Beyond the stream ♫

816
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:32,220
♫ Upstream I go. The way is long ♫

817
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:38,930
♫ Downstream I go. She is there among ♫

818
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,940
Fireworks. Fireworks.

819
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,970
Buy some fireworks, Sir.

820
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,450
Fireworks!

821
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,180
Newly arrived fireworks.

822
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,780
Sir,

823
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,340
would you like some fireworks?

824
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,900
I will take all of them.

825
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,000
All of them?

826
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,730
Here.

827
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,980
Okay!

828
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,340
I'm wrapping them up for you now.
