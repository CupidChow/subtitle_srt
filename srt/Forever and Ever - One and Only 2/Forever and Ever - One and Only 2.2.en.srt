but you haven't typed a word.

8
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,360
What's so important

9
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:11,680
that you are this

10
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
cautious about it?

11

Just a girl I recently met.

14

I've just met her,

15
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,400
and I've only seen her three times by chance.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Is she the kind that would marry you?

17
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
I notice

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,440
that when it comes to my marriage,

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,240
you are more anxious than anybody else.

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,480
She came to Xi'an for a trip.

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
She'll leave the day after tomorrow.

22

27

28

My suggestion,

29

30

31

That's what normal people would do.

32

38
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,200
the Junior Prince of Nanchen

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
only had one soul mate,

40

the crown princess.

42
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
It was said that

43
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,160
after he died, the crown princess

44
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,280
jumped off a building and died for love.

45
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,960
She may have jumped off the library

46

or the city wall.

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,480

It took you quite a while to finally get on.

It was the first time I took a bus.

to call us a cab.

Yes.

Then I recommend you go there.

You can get a very nice view of the city standing up there.

Most importantly, you can feel the history of that place.

348
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,240
I want to look around a little more.

349
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,880
May I?

350
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,000
Then let's

351
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,560
go to dinner

352
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
after touring the lab.

353
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
This way please.

354
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,760
Miss Shi Yi.

355
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,920
Instead of wine, I'll use tea

356
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,960
to make a toast to you!

357
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,720
Thank you!

358
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,120
Miss Shi Yi.

359
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
What do you do?

360
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
I'm a dubber.

361
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Oh, I've heard about this job.

362
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,320
It's a very popular vocation nowadays!

363
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,960
I watched a TV program

364
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,320
where they invited dubbers as guests

365
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,920
or interviewed

366
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,840
the dubbers.

367
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,000
That's right!

368
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,480
I've watched that program before.

369
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,960
You didn't eat much.

370
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,240
In every episode, they invited...

371
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,520
You've been talking with them.

372
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,880
You didn't see that I ate a lot.

373
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,080
Full?

374
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,720
Yes.

375
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,280
They all have appealing voices.

376
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Excuse me for a moment.

377
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,480
Making them more charming.

378
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,640
Exactly.

379
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Miss Shi Yi.

380
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
What works have you dubbed for in the past?

381
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,640
I did a lot of documentaries.

382
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,160
I rarely dub dramas.

383
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
But this year I dubbed

384
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,360
a new drama named One and Only.

385
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,040
Have you watched that?

386
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,920
Yes.

387
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,720
Sir, do you need a receipt?

388
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,880
No need. Thanks.

389
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,120
Professor Zhousheng.

390
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,120
I've told you

391
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,960
that the meal is on me.

392
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,520
It's fine.

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,360
It's on me.

394
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,160
Miss Shi Yi.

395
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,880
Are you his girlfriend?

396
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,520
No.

397
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
Careful about what you say.

398
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,480
I heard

399
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,120
Professor Zhousheng has a fiancee.

400
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm sorry, Miss Shi Yi.

401
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,240
I didn't know that.

402
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,240
It's fine.

403
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I still have things to do. I have to go now.

404
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,960
Let me take you back.

405
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,720
It's okay.

406
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,880
I can easily get a ride.

407
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,600
It's already late.

408
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
It's not safe for you to go back alone.

409
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Sorry, guys!

410
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,960
I have to leave now.

411
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,760
Bye-bye, Miss Shi Yi.

412
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
See you next time!

413
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,160
Bye.

414
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
I heard

415
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,280
the conversation between you and my students

416
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,640
at the restaurant.

417
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,840
They misunderstood the situation.

418
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,960
It's not true.

419
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,960
I am thinking about getting married,

420
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,160
but I haven't found the one I want to marry yet.

421
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,520

I believe you.

460
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,840
It's fate that brings

461
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,480
people together.

462
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,840
It's really not like

463
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,520
something he would say.

464
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,120
So,

465
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,760
you'll leave tomorrow, huh?

466
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I have a lot of work waiting for me.

467
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,720
I have to go back.

468
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,680
Could you please

469
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
give me your

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,240
phone number?

471
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,760
Then when I

472
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,440
don't have internet access,

473
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,160
I can at least call you.

474
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
It's okay if you mind it.

475
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,200
I don't mind!

476
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,880
But you don't have a cell phone,

477
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,440
and I didn't bring pen and paper.

478
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
Wait a sec!

479
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,960
It's okay.

480
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,240
Just tell me.

481
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,240
I can remember it.

484
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,360
Then I'm leaving.

486
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,840
Okay.

487
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,160

489
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,360
We have an early flight tomorrow anyway.

491
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
that he's thinking about getting married

492
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
but he hasn't found the one he wants to marry,

493
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,720
how would you interpret it?

494
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,280
I want to get married,

495
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,840
but I haven't found my Miss Right.

496
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,440
He said that to you?

497
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
It's a good thing.

498
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,480
I think it's his confession to you!

499
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,040
Is it?

500
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,600
I don't think so.

501
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,320
You sure are happy about it!

502
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,040
Stop pretending!

503
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,240
Stop pretending!

504
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,320
Now,

505
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,680
let me analyze for you

I can't

521
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
keep asking him questions!

522
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,680
Fine.

523
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,880
So where is he from?

524
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,320
I've never asked.

525
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,400
Are you sure he's not from Shanghai?

526
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,640
I'm sure.

527
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,640
No matter what,

528
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,640
it's a long-distance relationship,

529
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
which is not good in the long run.

530
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
When your relationship develops,

531
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,080
would he move to Shanghai for you

532
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,720
or would you move

533
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
to his place?

534
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
All the jobs you have

535
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,160
and the studios you work with

536
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,760
are in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

537
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,200
If you move to another place,

538
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,680
it'd be very tiring traveling all the time.

539
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,960
Don't you think you're worrying too much?

540
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,000
People that don't plan ahead will face troubles.

541
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
You can't go further until you've

542
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,520
solved the practical problems.

543
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,360
Otherwise, you are just

about his home and family

547
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,360
in a subtle way.

548

Let's talk about this another time.

Hello. May I speak to Zhousheng Chen, please?

Professor Zhousheng?

557

He just left

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Xi'an today.

559
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680

Yes.

Okay. Thanks!

In the library,

563
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,200
there was an unfinished poem of hers.

564
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,440
She even took it as one of her secrets.

565
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,960
After she grew up,

566
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,520
she started to understand

567
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
the real meaning of the poem.

568
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,560
"The woman's beauty is offered,

569
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
while the man's soul is taken.

570

For the affinity between one another,

the heart is overturned."

At least you know you need to come back.

I didn't say anything

because I was afraid you'd be upset

if I couldn't make it.

620
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,520
I wouldn't be upset.

621
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,480
But I'd be disappointed for a couple of days.

Really? Just a couple of days?

623

When you were little, it'd usually

624

take you at least a week to forgive me!

but you're already nagging him about getting married.

642
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,080
He'd be even more reluctant to come back in the future.

643
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,040
I said that only because

644

he rarely comes back.

645
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
Since you are home now,

I hope you can get married in May.

648

Of course we'd come to see you

Don't just stand there.

Sit down.

693
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,360
Right?

694
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,560
In recent years,

695
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,840
we've been

696
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,680
investing in overseas projects,

697
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,520
like buying properties

698
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,160
and utility companies.

699
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,480
This has already shaken

700
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,920
the foundation of our family business.

701
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
For generations,

702
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,480
our family

703
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,320
has always had our foundations

704
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,840
rooted in the national industries

The key purpose for next month's

708
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,600
investment meeting

709
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,040
is to attract investors

710
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
to develop the domestic manufacturing sector.

711
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,520
As the host of the meeting,

712
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,360
we'll announce then that we are going

713
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,640
to redirect our investment funds

714
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
to domestic manufacturing.

715
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,280
That's why I hope I can

716
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,760
get your

717
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,560
full support.

718

Chen,

719
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,880
you've just come back.

720
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,680
There's no rush.

721
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,160
Take it slow.

722
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,840
Okay?

723
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,840
Yeah.

724
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,880
You just came back. Have some rest.

725
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,720
Regarding this matter,

726
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,480
it won't be too late to make a decision

727
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,920
until you and your uncle reach an agreement.

728
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
Exactly!

729
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
Since we've made a public announcement

730
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,160
that we'll hold an investment meeting,

731
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,720
then we must go through with it.

732
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,600
Moreover,

733
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,080
this is the first thing that Chen

734
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,640
is doing after coming back.

735
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,240
I, for one, will give

736
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
my full support.

737
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,560
However,

738
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,560
this meeting seems

739
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,000
more of a show

740
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,360
than of substance for our family.

741
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,760
Chen, you've just come back.

742
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Take some rest first.

743
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,920
Some decisions

744
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,280
can't be made

745

overnight.

746

from here to Shanghai?

754
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Driving during the night would take longer.

755
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,560
Four hours.

756
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,360
We'd get to Shanghai at about 11:00 p.m.
