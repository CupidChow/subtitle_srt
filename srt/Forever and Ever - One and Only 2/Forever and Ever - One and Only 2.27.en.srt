00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,360
right?

176
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,810
♫Like a flower of the soul♫

177
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,770
♫The dreams that have accompanied me through the light years♫

178
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,380
♫I know that with just one glance♫

179
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,900
♫I can be sure that is the destination♫

180
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,500
♫Not afraid to fall for you♫

181
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,060
♫Running to the world with you♫

182
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm ready.

183
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,080
♫In the poem to be continued to write in the rest of my life♫

184
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,940
♫With your name in each line♫

185
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,310
♫If it started all over again♫

186
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,010
♫I'd still remember our love♫

187
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,990
♫It took♫

188
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,060
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

189
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,680
♫For our love to begin♫

190
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,520
Then, let's do it.

191
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,700
♫There's no way it'd end♫

192
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,040
♫May there be a right time and a right place♫

193
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,520
♫For the ones in love to hug each other♫

194
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,480
♫How can I let go♫

195
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,920
♫When all my expectations are lost♫

196
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,940
♫If the fate had been kind to me♫

197
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,080
♫If I'd had enough time♫

198
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
♫Would I have been able♫

199
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,440
♫To hold on to my love♫

200
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,250
♫How am I supposed to live without you♫

201
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,580
♫How can I fall in love again after the farewell♫

202
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,360
Wenchuan,

203
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,520
what are you doing staying up this late?

204
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:10,080
♫The impulse and courage we once had have gone with wind♫

205
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,360
I'm not sleepy.

206
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,280
Fourth Great-uncle, please go to sleep first.

207
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
I'll go to bed soon.

208
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,850
♫The smile I remember♫

209
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,700
♫Has become a pain that never goes away♫

210
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,240
These are all the keys

211
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,760
to the Zhou's mansion.

212
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,280
Give them to Shi Yi.

213
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
I have only one request.

214
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,640
Treat your younger brother well.

215
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,720
I want

216
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,760
to have a talk with you tonight.

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,920
Grandma is asleep?

218
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
I want to ask for an official

219
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,040
wedding gift from you.

220
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,840
What gift?

221
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
The library.

222
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
To be specific,

223
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,400
it's a wall in the library.

224
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,240
Could you ask them

225
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,400
to prepare an ink brush and some ink for me?

226
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,360
I don't need Xuan Paper.

227
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,440
Great-uncle...

228
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,440
Liansui.

229
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,130
Please ask Lin Fei to prepare ink brush and ink

230
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,560
and take them to the library.

231
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,280
The library?

232
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,680
Are you going there to admire the moon?

233
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,820
I'll prepare some snacks for you!

234
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,870
It's not necessary.

235
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,980
Then what's the point of making that many?

236
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,340
I'll prepare some for you guys, anyway!

237
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,040
Lin,

238
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,280
I've had them

239
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,680
mow the lawn.

240
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,080
It looks much nicer, doesn't it?

241
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
You've been of great help

242
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,160
to the Zhous since you came.

243
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,680
I'm flattered.

244
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,040
Are you two taking a walk after your meal?

245
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,319
We are.

246
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,960
Where are you going?

247
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,520
What's this for?

248
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,720
Take a guess.

249
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,520
What's that?

250
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,000
Ink.

251
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,040
Ink?

252
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,280
What do you need that for?

253
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
It will be hard to clean

254
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,000
if it stains the floor.

255
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,520
Someone asked us

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
to prepare it

257
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,120
so that he could please his wife.

258
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,960
Just leave it be.

259
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,920
The entire residence will be theirs in the future.

260
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,440
It's not our business even if they want

261
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
to tear the house down.

262
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,120
See you!

263
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,400
Be careful.

264
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,780
Okay.

265
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,440
Careful. Don't spill it.

266
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
Young people

267
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
don't listen to us, anyway.

268
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,800
Yeah.

269
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,800
Cook a few more dishes

270
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,080
for dinner tonight.

271
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,360
Let's have a drink.

272
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Why do I

273
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,040
have to cook?

274
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,800
I don't know how to cook.

275
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,880
I would do it if I knew.

276
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,520
So, all you can do is eat, huh?

277
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Fine. Let's go.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,120
You've had an idea about what to write?

279
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,680
The library is over 100 years old.

280
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,800
You are the first person who's ever

281
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,360
wanted to write something on the wall.

282
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,000
Will you sit there and keep me company?

283
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,120
Sure.

284
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,580
[Fu]

285
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:05,300
[Fu]

286
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,460
[Fu on the]

287
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,180
[Fu on the Imperial Park]

288
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,240
Are you tired?

289
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,760
Do you want some water?

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,200
No. I'm good.

291
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,260
[Fu on the Imperial Park]

292
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,200
You don't remember the next line?

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,120
The next line is "Beauty and soul are given,"

294
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
"the heart is overturned."

295
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,000
Seriously. That is the next line.

296
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,800
I know.

297
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
Then why don't you write it?

298
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,120
My hand is sore.

299
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,040
Is this the reason why you once asked me

300
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
at the Azure Dragon Temple

301
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,120
if I had seen an old-fashioned library?

302
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,040
Of course not.

303
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,600
Back then,

304
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,400
I thought you were just a researcher.

305
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,800
You were right.

306
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,200
I am just a researcher.

307
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,240
Writing on the wall

308
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,480
is so different

309
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,760
from writing on the paper.

310
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,200
I can't afford to make any mistakes.

311
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
With paper, at least I can change it and rewrite it.

312
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,680
With a piece of wall, though,

313
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,000
I can't just rebuild a wall.

314
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,280
I was even sweating.

315
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,560
So, you are going to stop for today?

316
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,280
I'll finish it some other time.

317
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,880
Would you like me

318
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
to walk you back?

319
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,800
I still have something

320
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,640
to discuss with my mother.

321
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,520
Let's go.

322
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:14,300
[Fu on the Imperial Park]

323
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,200
Uncle Mei, I'll go in first.

324
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,740
We've got many important guests.

325
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,800
It'll be improper if you and Shi Yi

326
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,820
don't go and greet them.

327
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,870
You can take care of it all by yourself.

328
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,270
I've faced them for over 20 years.

329
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,610
Of course I can handle it well.

330
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,200
But are you going

331
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
to hide Shi Yi forever?

332
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,920
Sure, I can still do it for a few more years.

333
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,160
But one day I'll be too old to do it.

334
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,920
What are you

335
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,360
gonna do then?

336
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,600
You must

337
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,000
have something important

338
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,990
to talk to me.

339
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,400
The police

340
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,720
went to Mei Xing today and asked him

341
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,260
to assist with investigating Zhou Wenchuan.

342
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,970
About what happened to Wenxing?

343
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,740

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,840
Right?

Mr. Mei

519
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,560
is willing to represent you.

520
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,400
But he hopes

521
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,740
you can turn yourself in.

522
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,760
Fine.

523
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,910
I will do so.

524
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,200
I'm done. It's all yours.

525
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,520
Okay.

The short life is like a dream.

528
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,000
How often can one enjoy himself?

529
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,640
Only my love, Shi Yi,

530
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,080
deserves my lifelong pursuit.

What is it?

534
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,920
I miss you.

♫Maybe it's the flower in the mirror without a trace♫

That's out of the blue!

537
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,760
Is there a rule about when I can miss you?

538
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,910
♫I've seen all the scenes of the passing years♫

You are acting weird.

♫They're not as good as you, not as good as you♫

Not really!

542
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,760
I want to talk to you

543
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,160
about my working plan.

Okay, go ahead. I'm all ears.

00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,090
♫It's like there's no wind and no sunshine♫

547
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,560
Originally I was going to open

548
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,120
a studio in Xi'an in two years.

549
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,840
But now I've changed my mind.

♫The more silent my love becomes♫

The dubbing industry

552
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,120
has been developing rapidly in recent years,

553
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,920
online or offline.

554
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,990
♫The more my heart turns to rain♫

555
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,000
Since I love Xi'an so much, I should

556
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,760
go there early and get a head start.

557
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,780
♫There is grace in your eyebrows♫

558
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,720
I'll work in both Shanghai and Xi'an.

559
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,920
The old studio can help the new one to grow.

560
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,260
♫I'll spend my whole life looking for it♫

Miss Shi,

562
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,920
you really can't wait

563
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
to mark your territory, can you?

564
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,680
♫Don't blame me for the sporadic sweet talk♫

565
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,000
Mark my territory? You think I'm a bandit?

566
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:59,220
♫I wake up from my dreams and I'm even colder♫

567

If I were a bandit,

568
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,680
I'd make you my wife!

569

♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

570

I don't mind.

♫The scene I look down for♫

575

♫Gets clear after saying goodbye♫

♫Even if to be a stranger to you♫

578
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,000
What are you doing?

579
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,680
I'm taking advantage of you.

580
