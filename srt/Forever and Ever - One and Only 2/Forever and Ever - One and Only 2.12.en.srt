[Forever and Ever]

2
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 12]

3
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,760
Just now in the hall,

4
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,200
I didn't see you offer incense.

5
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,120
I am an atheist.

6
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
But I believe in Buddhism, what should we do?

7
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
You have my full respect.

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,720
So, in your eyes,

9
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,040
what's Buddha like?

10
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,600
Benevolent, I guess.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,920
The reason Buddha left his wife and children behind and pursued Buddhism

12
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,040
is because

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,079
he cares about everything on earth.

14
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,510
Is there any difference

15
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,710
with how you perceive him?

16
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,440
There are some differences.

17
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,000
Like what?

18
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,480
I think he likes me.

19
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,640
That's why he's always smiling at me.

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,080
What are you laughing about?

21
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,600
The eye sees what the mind wants to see.

22
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,320
I always see things

23
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,480
from the positive side.

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,120
Which means I am living a happy

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
and positive life.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,760
Makes sense.

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,480
Am I wrong?

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
There is no right and wrong.

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,320
Only the different perspectives.

30
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's go to the villa

31
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,320
and wait for them there.

32
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,100
Did you finish?

33
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,640
Old Madam.

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,920
The guests we invited today are all sitting next door.

35
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,630
They all finished eating, right?

36
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,840
They are now having tea.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,680
Mr. Feng heard that

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,000
the eldest son of Mr. Zhousheng Wen

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,480
is here with his fiancée.

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,460
So he wrote a piece of calligraphy

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
and was hoping to present it to Miss Shi Yi.

42
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,360
He's one of my father's friends.

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
This is hard to come by.

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,720
Mr. Feng's works are priceless.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
Only his best friends

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,420
could enjoy his works.

47
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,050
The guests here today have been

48
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,519
friends of our family for generations.

49
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,100
We should all go and say hello.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,660
Let's go.

51
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,320
My strokes are not as good after years of idling.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
Your calligraphy is getting better and better.

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,400
Feng.

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,920
Mrs. Zhou, how are you?

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,520
I am fine.

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,960
Is he the eldest son of Zhousheng Wen?

57
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,840
Chen?

58
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,640
Yeah.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
This is Shi Yi,

60
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,120
his wife.

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,050
Nice to meet you, Mr. Feng.

62
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,490
Is she his wife already?

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,240
Wait.

64
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,960
When was the wedding ceremony?

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,680
Why were we not invited?

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
Young people are impatient

67
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,800
so they registered their marriage first.

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,320
The ceremony is yet to happen.

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Oh, that explains it.

70
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,240
Mrs. Zhou,

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,400
I haven't taken up my brush for a long time.

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
It only occurred to me

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,280
when I heard about your marriage.

74
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
Thus, I wrote a few characters.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
Here, come and have a look.

76
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,750
Come and have a look.

77
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,280
Gentle breeze blowing softly, what a perfect match.

78
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,560
I first wrote “what a perfect match”

79
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,200
indicating your marriage.

80
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,880
After thinking for a bit,

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,220
I felt that these four characters

82
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,980
[Gentle breeze blowing softly]

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,420
were the most suitable words in a study.

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,520
That's why I wrote both of them down.

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,560
Thank you, Feng.

86
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,360
Mrs. Zhou,

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,050
Let's sit down and have a chat.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,120
Okay, after you.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
I don't have anything with me

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
to return as a gift.

91
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,520
What should I do?

92
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,640
It's okay.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,680
Mr. Feng also

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
did this on the spot.

95
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
If you really want to give him something,

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,480
it will be okay if I sent him something

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,160
I had picked out

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,190
from the library.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
Do you take your family library as a treasure-house?

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,560
Having everything you want in it.

101
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,080
Grandpa Feng.

102
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,600
I heard from aunty

103
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,000
that your calligraphy works are priceless.

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,510
My drawings are not as good as yours

105
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,080
but I still want to draw something for you.

106
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,100
I was wondering if Mr. Feng would mind.

107
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Sounds great! I would be lucky to have a newlywed

108
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,010
gift me a piece of drawing.

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
Miss Shi, please.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,320
Call me Shi Yi.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,159
Shi Yi.

112
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,280
What a beautiful name.

113
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,080
Please.

114
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,280
Let me help you.

115
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,640
Mr. Feng. I am done.

116
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,400
Please.

117
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,920
Please.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay, let's have a look.

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,320
Check it out.

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
Great.

121
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,549
Good drawing.

122
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,440
You have found your treasure.

123
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,760
By the way,

124
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,400
where are you holding your wedding ceremony?

125
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,520
Zhenjiang.

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,480
Zhenjiang?

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
Then I will be

128
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,680
expecting your invitation.

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
-Okay, we will definitely invite you.
-Okay, great.

130
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes indeed.

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
Where did you learn how to draw?

132
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,000
I used to copy the works from masters

133
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,040
when I was little at home.

134
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I would often

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
lock myself in the room

136
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,560
just because I liked this hobby.

137
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,960
I noticed it was a good way to kill time.

138
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,360
Then I guess

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,520
you're just talented.

140
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
I loved drawing the lotus flower when I was young.

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,560
I also practiced figure painting.

142
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,560
However,

143
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
my painting of people was never good.

144
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Maybe I'm just bad at it.

145
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,770
Right, I recall telling you that story,

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,920
at the Guangzhou airport.

147
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,040
The heroin in the story was also the same.

148
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,520
She followed the male lead and learned how to draw,

149
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
yet she never drew any human figure.

150
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,400
And she was best at drawing the lotus flower.

151
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,230
She was actually drawing the lotus flower

152
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
to represent the male lead.

153
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,190
It's not that she couldn't draw him,

154
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
but she didn't dare to.

155
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,480
She was afraid of others finding out

156
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
that she has a crush on the male lead.

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,320
It that the reason why

158
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,080
you are such a big fan of

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
the story of the Junior Prince of Nanchen?

160
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,320
I almost forgot,

161
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,960
you told me

162
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,040
that you knew the story as well.

163
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,920
Where did you hear about his story?

164
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,580
He is in our family tree.

165
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
I am also named after him.

166
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,880
Does your family have that recorded? I want to have a look.

167
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
Sure. I'll look for it at home.

168
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,040
Wenchuan followed your instruction

169
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,560
and married Jiaren,

170
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,200
so you were happy about it.

171
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,900
Chen, however,

172
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,040
did not do what you wanted.

173
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,840
But you should have calmed down after a few days.

174
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,800
Why do you have to make it such a big deal?

175
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,160
Well, Tang Xiaofu is still in a coma.

176
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,880
Was I wrong to call off the banquet?

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
No, what you did was perfectly fine.

178
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,400
But your refusal to meet with Shi Yi's parents

179
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,120
is wrong.

180
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,890
At the end of the day,

181
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,160
you just don't want

182
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,840
Shi Yi to be your daughter-in-law.

183
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,800
I just don't want her to marry Chen.

184
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,170
Marriage is

185
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,840
all about affection.

186
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,270
There's no point in talking about influences.

187
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,560
Then what about you and Zhousheng Xing?

188
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,000
Well,

189
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,800
at...at that...

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,520

what happened between me and Zhousheng Xing.

193
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,360
Do you know how much I have done

194
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
so many years

195
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,920
to protect what Chen's father

196
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,480
had left for us.

197
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,720
Besides,

198
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,240
Zhousheng Xing has been running the family business for 20 years.

199
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,880
Do you think

200
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,790
he's gonna just simply hand over the whole thing

201
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,200
back to Chen?

202
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,600
I still have some capability

203
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
to protect Chen.

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,520
But what if I get tired one day

205
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,430
and could no longer help?

206
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,560
What if his second uncle turned against him?

207
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,320
Who's gonna help him then?

208
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,720
Let's be real for a minute.

209
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,640
Chen and I are not blood related.

210
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,360
In this family,

211
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,760
he doesn't have any real family.

212
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Neither are you.

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,720
True, I am not.

214
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,200
His wife could be considered his family.

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,000
After we're gone, his wife would be

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,960
the person that takes care of him

217
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,080
and help him wholeheartedly in the future.

218
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,960
I am helping him

219
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,320
by introducing him to a girl with a powerful family.

220
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,680

many times afterwards,

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,360

Those don't sound like good reasons.

00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
I will be your representative.

346
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,560
You are not afraid that I would sell you out?

347
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
Will you?

348
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,000
You can't be too careful.

349
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,120
But you shouldn't suspect someone whom you trust, right?

350
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,080
Done.

351
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,720
Even though you're the one who signed this,

352
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,200
I feel like I've become a slave.

353
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,280
When are you going to set off?

354
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,870
Soon.

355
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
I will fly to Bremen this afternoon.

356
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,560
I was planning to let you

357
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
meet Shi Yi.

358
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
We have time in the future.

359
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,840
Well, see you in Bremen.

360
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,360
I will be staying there for 2 months.

361
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:28,820
Okay.

362
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,160
Yu Jin.

363
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,980
I got some good news for you.

364
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,640
What good news?

365
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,880
Did your mother call you back

366
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,880
for another blind date?

367
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,400
What are you talking about?

368
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,360
Our teacher sent us

369
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
and his colleagues at Bremen an email,

370
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,600
saying that he's married.

371
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,720
He is married?

372
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,880
Who would send out mass email to colleagues

373
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,120
after getting married these days?

374
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,840
He's probably living in the last century.

375
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
Maybe his wife is someone formidable.

376
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,960
No.

377
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,720
I think our teacher is doing this on purpose

378
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
to show his wife.

379
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,280
Perhaps as a gesture of loyalty?

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,910
Very possible.

381
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,480
My mother asked me

382
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,630
when will we go home?

383
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,610
I am busy these days.

384
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,540
I am about to go back to Bremen.

385
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,980
I am only free this month.

386
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,480
It's better we do it this week.

387
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,600
We just got married

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,350
so we should go back for a few days.

389
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,920
My brother just left,

390
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,080
but you are already so eager to join him?

391
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,830
This has nothing to do with him.

392
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,680
My laboratory is also in Bremen

393
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,040
and you knew that.

394
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,960
You are my wife,

395
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,200
I thought I should clarify this.

396
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,280
We talked about this before our marriage

397
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,000
and you had no problem with

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,270
me working in Bremen.

399
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,480
We just got married.

400
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,200
Isn't it too soon for you to leave right now?

401
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,480
We should have a baby.

402
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,520
To make my mother happy.

403
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
I am not ready yet.

404
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,600
The reason why I married you

405
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,680
is because my mother believed

406
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,120
that my family owed your family a favor.

407
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
And you married me

408
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,360
to spite my brother.

409
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,360
Between you and I,

410
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,160
there is no need to put up an act.

411
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,600
If you don't want to get married.

412
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,720
Then why did you propose to me?

413
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
Because my mother liked you.

414
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,280
I thought after marrying you,

415
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
I could receive my mother's support.

416
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,400
But it looks like I was overthinking it.

417
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,760
My mother only cares about being fair.

418
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
She never cared about me.

419
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,440
Have a good journey.

420
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,240
I hope you can

421
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,680
win my brother's heart in Bremen.

422
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
If you succeed,

423
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
we can get a divorce.

424
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
How did you get in here?

425
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,640
Like usual.

426
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,440
You're already a grown-up

427
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,680
but you still climbed over the wall?

428
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,760
If my brother caught you,

429
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,800
he would have broken your legs.

430
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,920
He does not care

431
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
if you're the second eldest son of the Zhou family.

432
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,680
I don't mind my legs breaking

433
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,640
if it means seeing you.

434
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,320
Why did we break up?

435
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,800
I didn't want to get married so soon.

436
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,400
My father's will says

437
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,800
that only after marriage could we inherit the family wealth.

438
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,240
You said it before.

439
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,280
My mother signed

440
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
all the documents today.

441
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,040
Zhou family is now in my brother's hands.

442
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,160
He seems like a nice guy.

443
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,880
Although I don't know him very well.

444
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,000
But it looks like,

445
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,240
even if he took over the Zhou family,

446
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,080
he is not going to give you a hard time.

447
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,280
You don't understand the situation.

448
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
You are merely a tailor.

449
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,960
What would you know?

450
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Yeah, I don't understand the situation.

451
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,200
So, would the second eldest son of the Zhou family

452
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,040
please climb over the wall to get out?

453
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Quietly

454
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,040
and discreetly,

455
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,880
okay?

456
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,720
Little tailor,

457
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,640
would you still love me

458
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,960
if I get a divorce?

459
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,360
Zhousheng Chen.

460
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,920
I will keep this here.

461
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,480
It's not convenient for you to travel with.

462
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,280
I will put it in the bedside cupboard.

463
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,800
In case of emergency

464
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,680
and I am out on a business trip,

465
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,760
you can get it yourself.

466
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,520
Here, the house key.

467
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,960
Hong Xiaoyu still lives here.

468
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,800
It's not appropriate if I took the key, right?

469
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,400
She locks her room.

470
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
I am giving you the key to the front door

471
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,120
and my bedroom.

472
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Let's go, I will walk you downstairs.

473
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,760
You'll walk me downstairs?

474
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,560
I just walked you up though.

475
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,760
And now you want to walk me down?

476
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,400
I will take out the trash on the way.

477
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,480
Take care.

478
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,320
Wait for my call.

479
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,080
I will.

480
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,800
Wait.

481
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,920
Calling three times a day

482
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,040
would be too troublesome.

483
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,520
Is it interfering with your work?

484
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,600
I can adjust the time

485
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,520
to make the phone call.

486
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,920
We are married now,

487
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,960
let's make it easier.

488
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,200
If you want to talk to me,

489
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,280
let me know in advance.

490
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,360
If I am available,

491
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,440
then we'll call.

492
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,840
Okay.

493
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,520
Bye.

494
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,400
Bye.

495
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,720
Miss Shi.

496
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,520
The trash collection

497
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
is not here yet

498
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,000
at this time.

499
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,320
You got the time wrong.

500
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
The garbage bin will only be here at 6 o'clock.

501
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,080
Yes, I got the time wrong.

502
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,320
I have to go in now.

503
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,400
The is a perfect song

504
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
for this moment.

505
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,520
♫The day we met♫

506
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,450
♫Time froze♫

507
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:58,400
♫It's your smiling eyes♫

508
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,630
♫That made the hustle and bustle of the world gone♫

509
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,280
♫Every moment♫

510
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,160
I should've given her a hug.

511
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,290
♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

512
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,370
♫Love spreads♫

513
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,080
A hug would be perfect.

514
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,240
♫I'm glad you're here♫

515
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,800
♫One more day with you♫

516
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,400
She would also want me to hug her.

517
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,840
♫Love gets deeper♫

518
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,990
♫Making it a poem♫

519
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,610
♫Kissing through the long years♫

520
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,360
Why didn't I see him off

521
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,600
at the airport?

522
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,080
♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

523
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,880
I should've changed the flight.

524
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,990
♫Make a vow in silence♫

525
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,320

529
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,500
♫Nothing will change♫

530
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,510

533
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,640
Chen.

534
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,800
I gotta tell you something.

535
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,290
Shi Yi has an admirer

536
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,560
called Wang Yingdong.

537
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,000
He is supposedly pretty talented and famous.

538
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,920
As someone experienced.

539
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,430
I need to warn you,

540
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,850
long-term long-distance relationship

541
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,320
is not ideal for marital stability.

542
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,600
You should get back as soon as possible.

543
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,240
You wouldn't want your wife's heart stolen by others.

544
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,120
You never got married.

545
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,880
So what experience do you have?

546
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,000
I was better than you

547
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
when I was young.

548
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,320
I had experience dating.

549
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,800
You, are merely luckier than me

550
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
to have met Shi Yi.

551
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,960
Otherwise,

552
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
I don't think anyone would've wanted you.

553
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,640
Am I wrong?

554
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,640
You're right.

555
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,640
My personality

556
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,640
is indeed not ideal for marriage.

557
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,640
No, no, no.

558
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,520
You are not a perfect date,

559
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,720
but perfect for marriage.

560
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,080
I hope that's what she thinks.

561
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,040
With the presence of a rival,

562
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
you can never take it lightly.

563
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,360
Did you eat them all?

564
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,960
Are you upset?

565
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,360
What happened?

566
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,400
The engagement banquet didn't go as planned?

567
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:36,970
Your family and their family

568
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,960
had a fight?

569
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
Or was his mother mean to you again?

570
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,400
The engagement banquet was cancelled.

571
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,560
Don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad.

572
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
We're okay.

573
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
That dumb chemistry professor?

574
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,880
You are a pretty girl,

575
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,320
we can easily find someone like him.

576
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,600
Seriously.

577
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,640
What?

578
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,680
You fooled me.

579
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,160
I am married.

580
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,800
To be more specific, we got our marriage certificate.

581
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,560
No wonder that day.

582
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,040
Yes, on that day.

583
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
Not bad, not bad.

584
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,160
You two are good.

585
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,320
I am still confused.

586
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,880
I haven't told my parents yet.

587
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,120
You haven't?

588
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,520
Zhousheng Chen said

589
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,360
he would go to visit them with me

590
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,280
after he comes back from his business trip.

591
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,360
That would be more formal.

592
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,960
True.

593
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,200
It would be better

594
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,200
if you two went back together.

595
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,560
I seriously want to know

596
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
what on earth

597
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,200
did he do

598
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,200
to persuade you to get registered with him.

599
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,720
Nothing special.

600
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,160
It's exactly because of that,

601
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,960
and even seeming somewhat stupid,

602
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,160
that shows his sincerity.

603
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,720
My thoughts were in a mess at that time.

604
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,840
But I had a strong feeling

605
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,040
at that time.

606
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,240
If I didn't say yes,

607
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,560
I would definitely regret it

608
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,960
for the rest of my life.

609
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,880
Congrats, congrats.

610
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,680
A married girl.

611
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,320
I will tell you more about the story tonight.

612
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,400
Let's go to the supermarket first.

613
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,320
I just saw that the fridge was empty.

614
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,840
How did you manage to survive these days?

615
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,050
No matter how I lived through the past few days,

616
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,430
it was nowhere as exciting as yours.

617
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,160
Let me have a look.

618
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,320
What a big yellow diamond.

619
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,360
You're a married girl now.

620
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,560
You guys are raising that crab

621
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,000
like your child.

622
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,200
Even the crab eats better food than I do.

623
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,000
If you won't eat it,

624
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,160
then what's the point of keeping it?

625
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,920
Do crabs drink yogurt?

626
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,280
Are you talking to me?

627
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,120
I thought you were my friend.

628
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,280
I am sorry.

629
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,240
It's okay.

630
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,440
Why didn't you tell me you had left?

631
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,360
You caused me to embarrass myself.

632
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:08,280
I called you, you didn't respond.

633
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,120
I took that guy

634
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:09,880
as you.

635
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,600
I even asked a super embarrassing question.

636
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,199
Damn it.

637
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,800
I thought about it carefully.

638
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,840
I don't think crabs can drink yogurt.

639
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,719
That man has been following us

640
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,159
since we walked out of the supermarket.

641
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,639
Yeah.

642
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,520
Back at the supermarket,

643
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,920
what on earth did you say to him?

644
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,040
I simply asked him

645
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,480
if crabs drink yogurt?

646
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,000
I didn't even know what I was doing.

647
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,719
What a coincidence.

648
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
You guys live here as well?

649
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,880
Don't get me wrong.

650
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
I am not stalking you.

651
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,280
I rent an apartment here.

652
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,520
Bye.

653
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,280
Bye.

654
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,880
Does he really live here?

655
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,080
Let's go.

656
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,760
Seriously.

657
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,520
After receiving your marriage message from someone,

658
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,760
we moved away

659
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,840
and there is a surprise in the bedroom,

660
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,680
I wish you a happy wedding.

[Recording Studio]

695
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,000
Wipe your sweat.

696
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
It's 40 degrees right now

697
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,480
and there's no air-conditioner.

698
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,720
Are you not afraid of getting a heat stroke?

699
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,040
The air-conditioner broke down a few days ago

700
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,080
and it produces a lot of noise.

701
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
That's why we had to switch it off to record.

702
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
In the past when there was no air-conditioner,

703
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,640
our predecessors made it through,

704
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,840
didn't they?

705
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,280
Your scientist fiancé.

706
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,800
Married.

707
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,440
Okay, married.

708
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,920
Is there any difference?

709
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,000
Living separately immediately after getting your marriage certificate.

710
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,680
Of course, there is, we are legally married now.

711
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
Are you legally occupying him?

712
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,120
From his heart to his body.

713
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,600
Keep it down!

714
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,240
All right.

715
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,920
Let me ask you something serious then.

716
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,360
What's he doing there for two months?

717
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,320
To do

718
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,840
microanalysis and semi-micro analysis

719
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,610
of Venus's surface.

720
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,860
You're bullying me because I'm not knowledgeable.

721
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,960
It's pretty normal if you don't understand what I said.

722
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,000
I made that up.

723
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,560
Honestly.

724
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,680
I never knew

725
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,920
that you fell in love with

726
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,730
a scientist

727
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
whose ambition is to work for the development of human beings.

728
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,000
This type of person

729
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,320
must regard the relation between men and women

730
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,600
as unimportant, right?

731
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,080
Maybe.

732
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,680
Is he interesting?

733
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,080
Yeah.

734
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,410
What do you guys talk about?

735
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,520
Everything.

736
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,040
Starting from

737
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,120
the origins of humans?

738
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,800
And the reason

739
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,160
homo erectus disappeared.

740
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,000
I admire that.

741
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,080
But,

742
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,920
he happens to be my

743
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,440
favorite type.

744
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,520
When I read

745
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,640
historical materials, I would always imagine,

746
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,280
if I were to live in the ancient times,

747
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,240
I would definitely fall in love

748
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,840
with someone who cares for the people.

749
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,280
As a man, you gotta do something

750
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,360
that has nothing to do with fame or love.

751
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,120
Talking about love day and night,

752
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,870
that's not my type.

753
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,920
I don't like

754
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,880
talking about love all the time, either.

755
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,080
However, I prefer

756
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,320
a man who has no ambition.

757
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,540
Instead, loves his family,

758
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,800
loves kids.

759
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,000
In other words,

760
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,040
he needs to be a househusband after marriage

761
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,480
and take care of my family

762
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,080
so that I can be free to do my business.

763
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,440
This type really works for you.

764
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,260
[Miss Shi, the car has arrived.]

765
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,450
I gotta go,

766
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,240
something just happened at home.

767
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,760
Is it your own family

768
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,000
or your husband's family?

769
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,080
Take a guess.

770
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,000
It must be your husband's family.

771
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
A girl in the relationship.

772
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,640
Uncle Lin.

773
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,680
You can wait in the car with the air-conditioner.

774
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,720
It's scorching outside.

775
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,560
I am too old to feel the heat.

776
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,280
Let's go.

777
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,400
Thank you.

778
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
What are you

779
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,560
gonna plant here?

780
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,040
Maybe mint.

781
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,380
This is close to the living room.

782
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Mint can repel insects.

783
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,020
It would be pretty much it

784
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,200
after all the furniture has been moved in

785
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,320
this week.

786
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,050
This is from the old madam.

787
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,200
What is it?

788
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,020
[Happy]

789
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
She didn't want to buy them,

790
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,840
so, she made them.

791
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
I explained it to her

792
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,880
that we'll put it up after the house is done.

793
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
As it would be a waste if we put it up now.

794
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,240
But we won't be newly-weds

795
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
when we move in later, right?

796
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,480
It might be weird to put this up later.

797
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,720
Before the wedding ceremony,

798
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,280
you will remain as Miss Shi Yi.

799
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,040
You can admit that he is your husband

800
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,920
after the wedding banquet has been held

801
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,280
and the Xi character has been put up.

802
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,480
Okay.

803
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,160
Seeing him getting married

804
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,840
is the biggest wish of my life.

805
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,840
Thank you for accepting him.

806
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,640
You said it like

807
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,480
he is going to remain single

808
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,880
if he didn't meet me.

809
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,840
He's got

810
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,520
no sense of humor at all.

811
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,880
Only you could put up with that.

812
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,680
I think it's not bad.

813
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,720
Deep down in my heart,

814
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,720
he is like half a son to me.

815
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,640
You are likewise

816
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,040
to be my half-daughter-in-law.

817
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,680
I thought about

818
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,120
doing something for you

819
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,880
to make up for the time when he is not around.

820
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,040
What a coincidence.

821
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,600
I'll be busy for the next two months.

822
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,160
I am glad he won't be in Shanghai.

823
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,640
Or I would be the one feeling bad

824
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,200
if he had to be alone.

825
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,840
You are always so thoughtful.

826
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,660
I'll go check

827
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
on their progress.
