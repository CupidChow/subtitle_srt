called Lin Fei?

147
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Lin Fei is actually Zhou Linfei.

148
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
In fact, the senior housekeepers

149
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,320

150
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,320
are all surnamed Zhou.

They are more or less our distant relatives.

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,120
But if the whole family

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,840
all uses the surname Zhou,

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
it might be confusing.

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
So we're used to calling people

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
just by the characters in their given name.

157
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,480
Indeed.

158
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
There are a lot of people, so it helps us distinguish.

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
How come you're so…

174
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
So unromantic?

175
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,600
A little.

176
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,960
I want to ask you a question.

177
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,320
Go ahead.

178
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
You said that the two of us

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,960
are one of your research areas.

180
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,040
What if this research is in the wrong area?

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,840
You're making a

182
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
conceptual error.

183
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
What conceptual error?

184
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
The research area itself

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
can't be right and wrong.

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Only the method of experimentation can be wrong.

187
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,800
And what if the experimental method is wrong?

188
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
If the experimental method is wrong,

189
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
we can change the method.

190
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,640
But the research area itself

191
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,080
will not change.

192
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,400
That sounds very convincing.

193
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
For example, the fact that

194
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,840
we're together

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,160
is not going to change.

196
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,000
If something goes wrong,

197
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,560
we can

198
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
change the way we get along.

199
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,360
Science and technology

200
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,960
are not only the greatest productive force.

201
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,680
They're also the best language.

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,240
Let's go.

203
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,840
Come on in.

204
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,880
This is the house I bought myself.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,680
Xiaoyu and I share it.

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,760
She lives in that room.

207
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,200
Sit down first. I'll make some medicine for you.

208
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,360
What are you doing?

209
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,280
Nothing.

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,160
I just think it's cute.

211
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,320
It's Xiaoyu's.

212
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,560
You should wrap up in spring and wear less in autumn.

213
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,800
Don't be in such a hurry to wear

214
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,280
your summer clothes in spring.

215
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,880
The weather has been changing a lot in the past ten days.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,920
It's easy to catch a cold.

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,840
I just have a mild cold.

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't need to drink medicine.

219
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,760
This is herbal medicine to dispel the cold.

220
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,720
If it's a cold,

221
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,080
you'll feel better within a day.

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,760
It works so well?

223
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Of course it does.

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,480
You didn't think

225
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,680
I deliberately made an excuse

226
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,920
to get you to come up, did you?

227
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
In fact, just now downstairs,

228
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,520
I didn't mean to say no.

229
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
I just thought

230
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,760
I did the engagement thing

231
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,120
out of blue.

232
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,600
So I want to take things slowly.

233
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,360
But really I did want to come up.

234
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,520
He feels shy now.

235
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,560
You sounded calm

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,800
when you proposed.

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
Yet now you're shy.

238
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,920
Next time you want to come up,

239
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,000
just say so.

240
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,480
You're in a hurry to leave?

241
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,880
I have to go back to Zhenjiang

242
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
tonight.

243
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll have dinner with my family tomorrow morning.

244
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
You're driving back overnight?

245
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,240
Then finish this and go.

246
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't mean to kick you out.

247
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,920
I just mean if you leave now,

248
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
you can at least get two hours of sleep at home.

249
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
Otherwise you won't get any sleep at all.

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,880
Okay.

251
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:43,720
No need to...

252
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,960
You didn't waste a drop, that's good.

253
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Let's go. I'll see you off.

254
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,440
I came back early this time

255
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
because you were

256
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,120
nominated for the award.

257
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
You found out so quickly!

258
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,680
My agent just told me.

259
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,280
Congratulations.

260
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,280
I may not win.

261
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
So

262
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,000
you're back for the award presentation?

263
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Kind of.

264
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,640
The rest of my time will be spent

265
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,240
preparing for the engagement ceremony.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,280
I'll head back, then.

267
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,400
I'll come back on the day of the award presentation.

268
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,360
Okay.

269
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,280
Bye.

270
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,240
That room on the 12th floor is the bathroom.

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
It looks like the heating lamp is on.

272
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,240
She's probably in the shower.

273
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm back.

274
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
I went out for something to eat.

275
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,040
Smells like Chinese medicine.

276
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,360
You had some Chinese medicine?

277
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,160
Haven't you always hated

278
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,080
this smell?

279
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,760
I didn't want to disappoint her.

280
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,520
It's just a cup of Chinese medicine.

281
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,400
It's just a cup of Chinese medicine.

282
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,240
Chen.

283
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
Actually I really wanted to ask

284
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,480
the two of you…

285
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,920
You want to ask me

286
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,800
how we met?

287
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Then tell me, in your own words.

288
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,800
At Guangzhou Baiyun Airport,

289
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,800
she caught up with me

290
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,840
and asked for my contact information.

291
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
A person who likes you

292
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,240
must be as weird as you.

293
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,960
I think I'm quite lucky.

294
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
I never thought

295
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,000
I would be liked by

296
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
a girl like her.

297
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,720
25 minutes.

298
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,960
So it takes her 25 minutes

299
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
to take a shower.

300
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,200
Uncle.

301
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,560
I've brought Chen's clothes.

302
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,480
He came back sick.

303
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,599
He was so tired that he fell asleep.

304
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,240
Let him sleep a little longer.

305
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,240
He'll change it later.

306
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,079
Why do you treat him

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,520
as if he were your own son?

308
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,440
In my heart,

309
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,920
he is my son.

310
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,800
Chen is back.

311
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,000
Really?

312
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,880
When?

313
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,880
Last night.

314
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,800
He went to Shanghai to see his fiancee first

315
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,920
and came back overnight.

316
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,640
He didn't even sleep.

317
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,880
Just dozed in the car for a while.

318
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
They are so close.

319
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,800
Chen, a small farewell is better than a new marriage, right?

320
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,640
Just write something

321
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,240
so you don't have to say too much to them.

322
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,640
What's this?

323
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
What you have to study in college.

324
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,880
Chen.

325
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,280
How did you sleep last night?

326
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,120
I was in Shanghai all last night.

327
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,760
I didn't have time to sleep yet.

328
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,040
I see.

329
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,360
Your mother and I

330
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,320
had a discussion.

331
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,320
We decided

332
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
to let your fiancee come to Zhenjiang.

333
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
In this way,

334
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,440
she can learn about the business

335
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,760
from your mother.

336
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
She doesn't need to.

337
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,600
Since you're getting married,

338
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,720
she needs to.

339
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
She's not a good fit for it.

340
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,760
Neither are you.

341
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,400
But you have to take it over.

342
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,400
Since you don't think it's a good fit,

343
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
it's not too late to rethink the whole thing.

344

I don't have to.

Why are you eating my food again?

347
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,280
This is mine.

348
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,600
You just ate my food.

349
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,400
Don't think I have to give in to you

350

They are too embarrassed to ask you.

About what?

359
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,520
It's about your bed.

360

Do you want to get a new one?

361

enter our home?

365
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,800
She has to stay here, right?

366
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,960
It's a new bride entering the family home.

367
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,960
You at least have to

368
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,360
change the bed first, right?

369
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,920
No need to.

370
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,160
I think it's fine.

371
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
Are you sure?

372
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,480
It's sturdy enough?

373
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,920
I don't see there being a problem.

374
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,840
I've been sleeping on it for so many years.

375
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
What could be wrong with it?

376
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,280
I'm going.

377
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
So,

378
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,800
you don't want to change it, right?

379
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,080
Otherwise, we'll change it.

380
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,440
Prepare to change the bed.

381
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,360
Change it to the biggest one, understand?

382
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,120
What are you talking about?

383
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Why do you care about this?

384
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
Also, clean up

385
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
the guest room on the second floor too.

386
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,520
I'll sleep there.

387
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,800
Sleeping in separate rooms?

388
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,160
It's the first day.

The Junior Prince of Nanchen had no wife or children in his life.

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,400
But frequent rumors had it he had secret affairs

with the crown princess.

396

After the death of the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

397
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,320
the crown princess soon passed away also.

398

There were rumors

she hanged herself from a 10-foot-tall building

I need to borrow a dress.

Why do you need to borrow a dress?

428

Why don't you just buy it?

429
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
I'll just wear it once.

430
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,040
It's a waste to buy it.

a red dress instead.

Why?

especially on a beauty like you.

I can't explain.

When I was a child, I was not happy

464
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,320
when my mother dressed me in red.

465
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,120
Maybe it's too garish.

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Thank you.

517
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,080
You're welcome.

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,040
I'll leave now.

519
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,200
Grandma is relaxing in the sun inside.

520
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,200
Tell her

521
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,840
I had to leave.

522
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,840
Grandma.

523
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,600
Chen?

524
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,960
Chuan and Man just left.

525
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,480
I ran into them

526
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,360
outside just now.

527
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,160
These two kids.

528
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,720
I think they're in a good relationship.

529
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,200
Why aren't they married yet?

530
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,040
You're the older brother.

531
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,240
You have to think for your brothers.

532
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,720
Okay, okay, okay.

533
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,200
Well.

534
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,240
Uncle Lin.

535
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
You stay with Grandma for a while.

536
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,320
I'll go to the room to check it out.

537
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,880
Okay, okay, go ahead.

538
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,560
Come on.

539
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,480
Lin, sit down.

540
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Okay, okay, I'll sit down.

541
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,280
How have you been these days?

542
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,240
I'm fine.

543
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,400
Have some grapes.

544
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,840
Grapes.

545
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
Have one.

546
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,560
I don't…

547
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,840
I'm getting old.

548
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,640
My teeth can't

549
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,640
take them.

550
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,680
It's so sour.

551
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,600
Have one.

552
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,600
It's sweet.

553
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,680
Okay.

554
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,280
Have one.

555
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,040
Eat up, eat up.

556
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
It's fine, it's fine.

557
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,280
Eat up.

558
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
Chen, you're here.

559
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,040
You're taking a break here.

560
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,840
Don't get too busy.

561
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,840
Was this table

562
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,120
broken before?

563
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,840
A child came last week

564
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,120
who made a fuss and broke it.

565
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
I didn't have time to fix it.

566
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
It's already fixed.

567
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,000
I just thought

568
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,800
there's something I haven't done yet.

569
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,480
I'm used to being in the lab.

570
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,440
I always focus on details.

571
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,440
Don't mind me, Auntie.

572
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,240
Not at all.

573
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,360
Of course not.

574
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,320
You are filial and attentive.

575
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,600
I can tell.

576
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,240
I'll do it.

577
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,160
You go and rest.

578
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
I'll go check on Grandma.

579
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,640
Grandma?

580
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,720
You're sleepy?

581
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm not sleepy, I'm not sleepy.

582
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,760
Chen

583
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,640
I have a lot

584
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,440
to talk to you about.

585
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,720
Grandma.

586
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,720
I'm not leaving tonight.

587
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,160
You're not leaving?

588
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,400
Okay.

589
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,320
Go to Grandma's room.

590
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,400
Grandma will give you something nice to eat.

591
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,600
Let's go.

592
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,120
Something nice to eat.

593
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,480
Come on, come on.

594
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,200
Sit there. Sit there.

595
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,840
Grandma will get you something tasty.

596
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,960
Here it is.

597
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,520
Look at this.

598
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,200
I found it! I found it!

599
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,840
Look at this.

600
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,640
Look at this.

601
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,480
Isn't this

602
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,120
your favorite food when you were a kid?

603
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes, it was my favorite.

604
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,680
Open it up and eat.

605
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,400
I mean,

606
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
when will your wife

607
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,000
come and visit me?

608
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,760
Grandma.

609
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,040
I didn't even tell you.

610
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,600
How did you know?

611
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
You're not happy to tell Grandma?

612
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,960
No, I'm not.

613
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,560
Actually, I came here today

614
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
to tell you about it.

615
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,160
But I haven't had the chance.

616
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:29,840
Okay.

617
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,400
Then...

618
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
How long have you been in a relationship?

619
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,960
We were engaged first and then fell in love.

620
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,120
What?

621
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,240
Is that the popular way among

622
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,680
young people now?

623
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,560
No, Grandma.

624
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,880
We're not like other people.

625
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,440
The doorbell rang. Can't you hear it?

626
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,960
I'm coming.

627
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,280
Hello.

628
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,320
It's you.

629
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
What can I do for you?

630
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,480
Uncle Lin and our family

631
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,160
have ordered six engagement suits.

632
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,480
The address is here.

633
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,080
Two sets are ready first.

634
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,360
They asked us to deliver them today.

635
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,520
I'm sorry you had to send them here.

636
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,480
I'm so sorry.

637
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,200
Please come in.

638
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
You don't feel at ease?

639
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,560
No, I'm not.

640
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
You've been had this habit since you were a kid.

641
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,680
Once you've got something on your mind,

642
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,560
you start rubbing things.

643
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,560
I'm afraid she wouldn't like them.

644
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,920
But now it's too late

645
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
to make a new one.

646
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,120
I really regret it now.

647
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,800
I should have taken her to buy them.

648
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,800
But in front of me,

649
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,480
she would only pick the cheap ones,

650
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,840
not pick the right ones.

651
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,840
Uncle Lin.

652
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,400
Am I thinking too much?

653
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,240
Yes, indeed.

654
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,360
Looking this way and that.

655
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,120
Hello?

656
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,520
Although you didn't ask me,

657
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,760
I want to say

658
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I like them all.

659
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,880
I have the tickets for tomorrow.

660
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,800
I left two for

661
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,719
you and Uncle Lin.

662
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,719
Where should I send them?

663
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,280
Uncle Lin doesn't like crowds and all that excitement.

664
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,400
One is enough.

665
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,760
I'll ask someone to pick it up.

666
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,800
Bye-bye.

667
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,120
These two

668
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,920
are both your favorite colors.

669
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,440
You told him?

670
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,680
Uncle Lin.

671
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,200
Come with me to the lake.

672
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,360
Now?

673
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,360
Yes, yes. Hurry up.

674
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,800
What on earth?

675
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,440
I haven't driven in years

676
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,800
Uncle Lin.

677
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,480
You have help me ease back into this.

678
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,480
It's not your style to just

679
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,120
pick it up again on the fly.

680
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
But there are times in life

681
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,120
when you need to make some changes.

682
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,840
You still remember the rules of the road, right?

683
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,000
How can I not remember?

684
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,920
Remember everything?

685
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,040
Since you do…

686
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,640
Let's go.

687
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,040
I'm really leaving.

688
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Okay.

689
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,280

00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,280
animated movies together.

863
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,160
This is it.

864
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,320
Yes, that's right.

865
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,800
Although I'm a newcomer

866
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,840
in the world of voice acting,

867
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,320
I learned a lot from Miss Shi Yi.

868
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,120
I've learned a lot.

869
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,320
This place is pretty far away.

870
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
You can't be caught on camera

871
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,640
and you can see Shi Yi clearly too.

872
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,200
Thank you.

873
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,280
You watch, I'll do my thing.

874
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:37,800
Good.

Please.

Thank you all.

902

I'm very happy, truly delighted.

I'm very excited

to receive this award.

905
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,960
It's a great honor.

906
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,800
Why are you sitting here?

907
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,640
I told them

908
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,920
I wanted to surprise you.

909
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,520
To just let me sit in a place

910
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,280
where I can see you clearly.

911
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,840
Do you know

912
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,080
what seat you're sat in?

913
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,640
The first row

914
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,160
is for the organizers' VIPs.

915
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,560
I more or less guessed that.

916
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,440
Shall we go?

917
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,080
You don't have to wait until the end?

918
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:09,760
No, I don't.

919
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,960
The award has already been given out.

920
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,640
It'll cause trouble later

921
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,480
if the staff find out

922
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,480
we're in other people's seats.

923
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,680
Let's go.

924
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,480
Your love and dedication

925
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,000
has completed this work.
