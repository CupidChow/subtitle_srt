513
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,560
Yes.

514
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,990
Go and put this up.

515
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,590
Okay.

516
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,720
If my house was like this,

517
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,140
I'd spend the rest of my life

518
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,000
in this yard.

519
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,160
I wouldn't go anywhere.

520
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,200
There are mountains, water, and lotus ponds.

521
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,400
I would grow lotus and be self-sufficient.

522
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,890
If you like it,

523
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,990
I'll invite you over

524
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,880
on Labor Day and National Day in the future.

525
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,400
Yeah.

526
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
If Shi Yi doesn't come back,

527
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,600
you can come find me.

528
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,600
I'll reserve a guest room for you.

529
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,270
That...that wouldn't be too good.

530
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,520
There's nothing to worry about.

531
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,120
This house is Shi Yi's.

532
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,080
By the way,

533
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,800
I've made you

534
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,600
24 kinds of desserts.

535
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,360
Are you going to eat them now or at night?

536
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,630
Maybe at night.

537
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,610
I'm stuffed.

538
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,480
You've been giving me food

539
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,920
since I came back.

540
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll bring you a few now.

541
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,720
Take it as a snack.

542
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,320
Their family are so nice.

543
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,040
I wouldn't dare to come back if I were you.

544
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,960
After all, you had the accident here.

545
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,360
Don't you feel uncomfortable about it?

546
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,930
I tend to let

547
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,120
bygones be bygones.

548
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
I don't like to linger in the past.

549
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
In fact,

550
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,680
he is more worried than I am.

551
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,720
He was reluctant to come back here.

552
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,600
I want to help him get over this.

553
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,680
This is his home.

554
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,960
We're going to settle in Xi'an

555
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,160
so he can't see his family very often.

556
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,360
If he didn't come home at all,

557
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
Uncle Lin, Liansui, Lin Fei

558
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,440
wouldn't be able to see him.

559
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,280
Although he won't say anything,

560
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,480
he'll feel upset.

561
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,370
I took them around.

562
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,400
Xiaoyu has been praising this place

563
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,720
for an hour.

564
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,560
How do you guys feel? Are you tired?

565
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,620
Do you want to go for a meal?

566
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,400
Sure.

567
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,800
I'm hungry.

568
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,760
Let's go.

569
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:11,500
[Joy]

570
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,310
It's all ready.

571
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,360
They're all mine?

572
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,360
I told Grandma

573
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,640
six sets weren't enough.

574
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,480
You've been through a lot to get married.

575
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,320
There should at least be eight sets.

576
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,410
So Grandma said,

577
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,440
since we were making more,

578
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,040
let's make a whole number.

579
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,080
Ten sets.

580
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,140
To take from the idiom, "Complete and beautiful."

581
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
I can't wear them all.

582
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Isn't it a waste?

583
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,200
No at all.

584
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,500
The bride's dress

585
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,660
is worn for one day

586
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,720
and kept for a lifetime.

587
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,110
You just pick the ones you like

588
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,520
and keep the rest

589
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,400
as souvenirs.

590
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,540
Take your time to try them on.

591
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,000
Thank you.

592
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,400
Thank you

593
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,940
You take your time.

594
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,480
I'll wait for you here.

595
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,400
Okay.

596
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,600
Does it look good?

597
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,440
Yes.

598
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,760
Then I'll try the next one.

599
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,160
Okay.

600
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,200
How about this one?

601
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,640
It looks good.

602
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,720
Good.

603
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,160
How about this one?

604
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,880
This one is also very beautiful.

605
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,600
Are there any bad ones?

606
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,520
You look good in all of them.

607
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,920
I'm going to forget

608
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,040
how your yard

609
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,350
looks like

610
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
if I don't come this time.

611
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,360
Later on,

612
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,000
don't forget to help me out.

613
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,600
Liansui won't let me in.

614
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,840
Don't worry.

615
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,920
What are you two doing?

616
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,440
We're...

617
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,800
Talking about work.

618
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,600
Talking about work?

619
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,640
For how long?

620
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,360
Just...

621
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,760
for a while.

622
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,200
Liansui.

623
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,800
Go make us some tea.

624
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:17,800
Okay.

625
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,520
No, no, no.

626
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,000
Not even for a minute.

627
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,360
The bride and groom aren't supposed to meet each other

628
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,400
the night before their wedding.

629
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,560
I've told Lin Fei

630
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,600
to keep an eye on you.

631
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,360
What's going on?

632
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
What has he been doing?

633
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,240
Off you go.

634
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,360
Don't miss

635
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,120
tomorrow's auspicious time.

636
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,880
What are you doing?

637
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,560
I just wanted to tell you

638
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,870
Shi Yi must have a glass of milk

639
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,040
before going to bed.

640
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,320
Okay, noted.

641
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,720
And...

642
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,560
She can't sleep alone.

643
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
Otherwise she'll have nightmares.

644
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,470
Mr. Professor.

645
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,639
Mei Lin and I are both here.

646
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,600
You're still afraid your wife won't be able to sleep?

647
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,639
I'm sorry for his laughable behavior.

648
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,550
The groom

649
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:07,699
is a bit inexperienced

650
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,280
and nervous.

651
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,040
See you tomorrow.

652
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,840
Okay, now leave.

653
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,679
Rest early.

654
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,020
Let's go.

655
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,600
Bye-bye.

656
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,679
You'll see her tomorrow.

657
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,840
Just bear with it for a while.

658
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
Your professor

659
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,639
was kicked out of

660
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,000
his own place.

661
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,920
He was so reluctant to leave.

662
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,320
Poor thing.

663
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,560
He's not used to it.

664
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,110
Since I woke up,

665
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,570
we've slept together every day.

666
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,719
It's the first time we're apart.

667
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,239
Aren't you hoping for a baby?

668
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,600
In the future,

669
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,020
will you sleep with the baby

670
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,250
or your husband?

671
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,990
It's my first time seeing

672
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,480
someone being torn

673
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,400
between her baby and husband.

674
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,840
Be decisive.

675
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,680
Say it, who will it be?

676
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,270
Won't there be a crib?

677
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,070
And a smaller bed.

678
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,550
We'll just have them in the same room.

679
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,280
Anyway,

680
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,080
you must be in the same room with your husband.

681
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,400
The baby is just an embellishment to life.

682
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,160
Why does he say you have nightmares?

683
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,400
Does he think you're a child?

684
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,440
The first few months after waking up,

685
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,920
I often had nightmares.

686
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,600
He would tie a string

687
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,160
to my wrist

688
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,760
at night,

689
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,390
with the other end tied to his.

690
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,400
This way, no matter if I woke up from a nightmare

691
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,680
or I wanted to do something,

692
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,480
he would wake up and help me.

693
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,240
He worked during the day

694
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
and slept like this.

695
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,990
Could he stand it?

696
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,980
Wasn't there a nurse?

697
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,960
The nurses also advised him.

698
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,240
He said

699
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
it's not that I couldn't live without him.

700
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,560
But he couldn't live without me.

701
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
Not being able to sleep with me

702
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,360
scares me.

704
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,760
A closer look at the scientist.

705
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
Let's find out about

706
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,630
his other side.

707
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,240
Don't speak ill of him.

708
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,720
I didn't say anything bad about him.

709
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,840
The way you said it was bad.

710
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,290
This is my personal style

711

Do you want some?

715
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,240
I won't drink tonight.

716

Are you going to get drunk

717

tomorrow night?

718
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,680
I didn't prepare any

719
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,460
watered liquor for you.

720
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,040
No need for watered liquor.

721
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,190
I'll drink for real tomorrow.

722
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,480
It's my big day.

723
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,640
Of course I have to drink it.

724

I can't get drunk.

can't get drunk,

728

I just didn't drink in the past.

729

I'm a good drinker.

Will you be able to handle it tomorrow?

It depends on my mood.

four hours to think about that.

Why didn't you tell me about this?

Telling you everything would ruin the surprise.

00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,000
-Good.
-Good.

857
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,920
Thank you. Thank you.

858
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Thank you. Thank you.

859
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,640
Will the bride and groom

860
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,750
go around making toasts?

861
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,640
They are seniors.

862
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:18,490
To whom should they toast?

863
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,550
Who dares to take it?

864
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,160
Do you know who I am?

865
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:23,890
Who are you?

866
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,280
Zhousheng Chen is my big brother.

867
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,490
Do you know

868
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,450
what you should call me?

869
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,320
I heard

870
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,560
you once liked my sister-in-law?

871
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,800
No, no, no.

872
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:36,980
That's interesting.

873
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,530
That was just a misunderstanding.

874
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,320
It's a misunderstanding.

875
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,520
It's truly a misunderstanding.

876
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,280
Great-uncle.

877
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,480
A toast to you.

878
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,560
Come on, let's all join in.

879
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,880
Come on.

880
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,400
Cheers.

881
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,530
Come on, cheers.

882
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,290
Let's get cracking.

883
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,070
After we're done eating,

884
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,200
let's go prank the newlyweds.

885
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:55,800
How's that?

886
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,240
Yes, yes.

887
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,640
That's a must.

888
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,680
Mr. Zhousheng is so serious

889
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,040
all the time

890
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,920
and is so strict with us.

891
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,920
We have to mess with him today.

892
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,920
We must prank him good.

893
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:03,880
I'll go first.

894
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,960
You go first, I'll go last.

895
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,560
I've never pranked newlyweds in the past.

896
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,760
I'm so excited.

897
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,040
Great-uncle, have some meat.

898
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,160
Let's eat, let's eat.

899
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:11,860
You're all here.

900

Help yourselves.

901
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,900
Tonight,

902
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,680
no one shall prank the newlyweds.

903
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,040
Yes, no one!

904
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,780
Tonight,

905
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,320
I must help my great-uncle and his wife

906
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,780
complete the last step!

907
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,350
Otherwise I won't feel assured!

908
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,400
No pranking tonight!

909
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,280
This is a once in a life time thing.

910
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,080
Don't get in our way.

911
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,050
Just let us in.

912
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,840
You're not going?

913
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,720
