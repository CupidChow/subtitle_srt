4
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,580
Hello?

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,980
Hello, Xiaoyu.

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,240
Do you have Du Feng's phone number?

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,720
What happened?

8
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,720
Zhousheng Chen went out this morning

9
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
to look for Du Feng.

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
But he's not home yet.

11
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,920
Did you call him?

12
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
He didn't take his phone with him.

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,880
Can you ask Du Feng

14
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,480
when did he leave

15
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,760
the police station?

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,840
I have blacklisted him.

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,079
Oh, okay.

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,520
Never mind.

19
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
I'll go ask the lab then.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
All right, bye.

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,680
Bye.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
Darn you Du Feng.

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,920
Just because I've blacklisted you, you won't contact me?

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,040
Chen, I have a question for you.

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
Please don't get mad.

26
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,000
What is it?

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Uncle Lin said

28
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,800
you have no intention of taking over the family business.

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,079
What about your marriage afterwards?

30
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,360
Is your salary as a professor good enough?

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,520
My salary as a professor is pretty good.

32
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
This is what I saved up for you,

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,480
in case you had fallen out with mother

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,600
completely in the future.

35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,960
I can still buy you a wedding house.

36
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
I have my own house.

37
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,920
These are two different matters.

38
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
This is what I saved up for you.

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
Also,

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,440
I'll be spending my entire life at home,

41
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,080
I won't be using this money anyways.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,120
You are staying at home for the rest of your life?

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,519
What about getting married?

44
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,279
Getting married?

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,680
You can buy me a house when I get married then.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,640
Chen,

47
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,320
I know you just got married,

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,920
so you won't come home often.

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,040
And I know mother's attitude towards my sister-in-law

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,220
will make you feel uncomfortable.

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,900
But if you are really busy

52
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,300
and has no time to come home,

53
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,490
remember to make some calls.

54
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

55
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,640
I will come back to see you guys

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,120
if I have the time.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,520
You must take care of yourself.

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
I gotta go.

59
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,740
My dear husband,

60
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,300
why did you buy so much stuff?

61
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,580
Our fridge doesn't have enough space.

62
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,659
I bought all the ingredients of the dishes

63
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,260
you had made

64
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,380
since we got married.

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,820
Are you craving for them?

66
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,820
Can you cook for me?

67
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,820
Let's go home,

68
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,500
I will cook them for you.

69
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,490
Allow me.

70
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,300
I'll do all the cooking today,

71
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,260
no need for your help.

72
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,740
I will go take a nap.

73

[Stay Simple and Humble]

74
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,520
Time to get up.

75
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,190
Do you know what time it is?

76
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,820
What time is it?

77
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,260
It's 8 pm.

78
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,300
No wonder.

79
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,730
What?

80
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,800
I didn't have a good sleep.

81
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,140
You woke up early in the morning

82
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,300
and you didn't take lunch.

83
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,570
It would be strange if you slept well.

84
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,440
I have prepared some food.

85
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,120
Get up and let's go eat.

86
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,840
Hold on you.

87
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,040
Don't drink the soup first. Try some of the dishes.

88
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,120
I made so much.

89
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,200
You'll feel full if you drink the soup first.

90
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,760
Try the dishes.

91
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,960
You are not eating?

92
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
I would have fainted from hunger if I waited for you.

93
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,480
I already had some soup.

94
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
You eat first. I'll watch you eat.

95
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,800
My dear sleeping beauty is finally awake

96
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,160
and is able to eat on his own.

97
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,280
That's some good news.

98
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,040
When did I

99
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,560
not eat on my own?

100
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,360
I thought you would get sick

101
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,480
because of sadness.

102
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,760
You got sick

103
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,240
and couldn't get out of bed,

104
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
then I would serve you food

105
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,480
and fed you.

106
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
I had it all figured out.

107
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,920
But you failed to cooperate.

108
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,560
Then from now on,

109
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,240
you should give me some hints beforehand

110
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
and I will try to get sick

111
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,840
to cooperate with you.

112
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,480
Are you done?

113
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
I'll serve you a bowl of soup.

114
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,400
Didn't I say I had some already?

115
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
Your bowl is too clean.

116
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,640
How could you have had it?

117
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,200
What if I washed the bowl

118
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
after drinking it?

119
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
You dislike washing.

120
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
So that's impossible.

121
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,560
I like to eat with you.

122
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
That's my motivation

123
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,680
for buying the food.

124
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Do you like

125
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,040
to sleep with me then?

126
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,040
No?

127
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Do you not like the pillow?

128
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,480
Or is the mattress not soft enough?

129
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Or do I hog the sheets when I'm asleep?

130
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,440
I am used to it.

131
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Used to it?

132
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Used to me hogging the sheets?

133
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,960
Really?

134
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,960
No.

135
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,440
You never hog the sheets.

136
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,920
Seriously.

137
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
I swear.

138
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,560
Since I hog the sheets when sleeping,

139
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
let's have separate sheets then.

140
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,440
When I was sleeping this afternoon,

141
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,280
I woke up many times.

142
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,240
I kept waking up with a fright.

143
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,320
Noticing you weren't there

144
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
after waking up,

145
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,120
I would wonder where you were.

146
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,640
But then I would realize

147
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,240
that you were outside.

148
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,480
You were living

149
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,800
with me.

150
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,680
Then I would feel at ease

151
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,080
and soon fall asleep again.

152
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,280
Every night when I wake up

153
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
in the middle of night,

154
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,360
whether you are holding me,

155
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,960
hogging the sheets,

156
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,080
or when you take my pillow away,

157
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,880
as long as I can see you next to me,

158
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,040
I would feel especially secure.

159
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,600
Your wife is here. Don't worry.

160
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,600
Actually, Du Feng

161
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,800
didn't mean to hide it from...

162
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Hold it.

163
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,560
I am the one to comfort you today,

164
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,120
not for you to ease my anxiety.

165
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,960
Why would you buy some pets all of a sudden?

166
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240
He likes them.

167
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
So I want to cheer him up with them.

168
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,560
This chemistry professor

169
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
enjoys the strangest things.

170
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,360
This is not bad.

171
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,520
Get one of these.

172
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,200
No. It'll scare him.

173
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,280
He's a grown man. How could he be scared of this?

174
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,720
Zhousheng Chen is adorable,

175
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,120
he would want something cute.

176
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Then get a piglet.

177
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,000
Nothing is cuter than a piglet.

178
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
It'll become big when it grows up.

179
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,720
We won't even be able to hold it.

180
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,120
Stop touching it.

181
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,640
I'm just taking a look.

182
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,359
Hello.

183
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,280
Hi.

184
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,200
Would you want this?

185
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,839
There are not a lot of people who keep this.

186
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,599
We have a few, my husband keeps them.

187
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,040
Your husband has a good taste.

188
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
What type do you guys have at home?

189
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:03,960
This one.

190
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,839
This is not bad.

191
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
This is the most popular type right now.

192
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,839
Our star, devil crab.

193
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,720
What's the color of the crab you guys have?

194
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,440
Almost the same as this one.

195
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
I have a question.

196
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
What is this species of crab?

197
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,440
This one?

198
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,640
This is an entry-level type.

199
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,480
Sesarma crabs.

200
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
They are shy but easy to keep.

201
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Sesarma?

202
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
All right, I'll take two of them.

203
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,880
You have already kept the devil crab.

204
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,000
Why would you want Sesarma crabs?

205
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,640
How about you selecting some devil crabs?

206
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,680
We have a variety of colors here.

207
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
It's okay, I prefer these.

208
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,680
Okay.

209
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,920
Do you know what they are called?

210
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,200
Sesarma.

211
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
Do you like it?

212
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah.

213
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,040
I just don't know if

214
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
there's a difference raising them.

215
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,160
I'll go to the study room.

216
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,440
A name of the crab

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,920
can make you so happy.

218
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,560
Your sense of happiness is really high.

219
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm not giving you guys a red envelope

220
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,840
at your wedding.

221
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,760
I'll ask someone to make

222
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
a giant crab doll for you.

223
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
How does that sound to you?

224
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,880
Deal.

225
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,560
I won't break my promise.

226
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,000
Coming.

227
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,080
I came to visit you guys.

228
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,360
Come in and take a seat.

229
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,080
Xiaoyu.

230
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,480
Xiaoyu.

231
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,600
Did you buy them recently?

232
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
I know how to keep them.

233
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Have you had them before?

234
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,080
Yeah.

235
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,800
I only gave them away

236
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,600
because of work.

237
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,720
I didn't have time to look after it

238
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,520
since I always worked overtime.

239
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,800
Teach me.

240
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,760
I will take down notes.

241
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Sure, no problem.

242
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,040
Xiaoyu, I need to go to the bedroom.

243
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,400
Help me entertain my guest.

244
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
Do you like it?

245
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I can buy you one if you like them.

246
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,240
Why are you here?

247
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,000
Doing police work?

248
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,080
I couldn't reveal my identity

249
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,600
because I was working on a case.

250
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,680
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

251
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,760
Nor was I using you to get close to

252
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
the Zhou family.

253
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,240
I really had no choice.

254
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,480
Do you know what's the most important thing

255
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,760
when two people are in a relationship?

256
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,440
Sincerity.

257
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,840
We've been together

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,440
for so long,

259
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,120
but I don't even know

260
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,960
your real identity.

261
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,750
How could I trust you?

262
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,320
I'm sorry Xiaoyu.

263
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,680
It's all my fault.

264
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,360
I have been constantly calling you

265
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,200
and sending you WeChat messages recently.

266
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
But you never answered them.

267
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,920
I'm really concerned about you.

268
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,920
Will you forgive me, please?

269
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
You really had crabs as pets?

270
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course not.

271
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
I was just making conversation.

272
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,360
What are you doing?

273
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,600
I am searching about how to raise them.

274
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,280
When she asks me later,

275
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,520
I don't want her to think I lied to her.

276
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,240
Seriously?

277
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
All right. Forgive me, okay?

278
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
Come in.

279
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,360
Are you busy?

280
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,200
You want to talk about what happened at the hospital?

281
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,720
Yeah.

282
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,680
Although we haven't found the person

283
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
that killed your sister,

284
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,800
I still suspect

285
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,680
that the mastermind

286
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,800
is Zhou Wenchuan.

287
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,800
Also the capital he has raised...

288
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I don't want to talk about this

289
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
at home.

290
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,480
All right.

291
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,980
What are you guys talking about?

292
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,600
We were talking about your crabs.

293
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,680
He said Sesarma crabs are very timid

294
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
so we need to make a shelter for it.

295
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,760
Yes, exactly.

296
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,360
They need shelter.

297
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,920

I'm printing it out to read later at night.

Probably.

Then how do they make peace?

339
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,920
No idea.

the male crab

343

would say to the female crab:

00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,120
"Guduk, guduk, guduk..."

345

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,960
Oh yeah, I told my mother

348
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,320
that I will go to your family during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

349
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,560
My mother said

350
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
the Mid-Autumn Festival is an important festival for a family,

351
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
so we should go back and stay at home one day earlier

352
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,400
just to celebrate it.

353
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay.

354
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
The yellow one looks good too.

355
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,240
Hand it to me.

356
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,720
This way.

357
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,240
Grandmother.

358
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,200
Grandmother.

359
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,200
Grandmother, wake up, grandmother.

360
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,080
Grandmother, grandmother.

361
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
Ren.

362
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,120
Grandmother.

363
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,360
What a beautiful lady.

364
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,040
Are you married?

365
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,840
I have a great grandson.

366
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,080
My grandson he...

367
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,160
That's him!

368
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,130
That's him, that's him!

369
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,020
Do you like him?

370
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,120
Take a look.

371
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,600
Not only I like him,

372
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,680
but I fancy him.

373
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,190
You have good taste.

374
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,960
Let's go out and get to know each other better.

375
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Yeah. Go and get to know each other better.

376
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,800
Go and get to know each other better...

377
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,160
Grandmother.

378
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,800
Can I give you a massage?

379
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,080
Sure.

380
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,240
It seems like I am destined to be your wife.

381
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,800
Every time grandmother sees me,

382
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,480
she wants to introduce me to you.

383
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,760
But her mind

384
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,040
never gets confused.

385
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,040
Weren't you going to buy food?

386
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Why are you back already?

387
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,840
I saw these

388
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,240
on my way there

389
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,400
and I think they were pretty cute.

390
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,080
So I bought some

391
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,400
for you guys.

392
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,840
That many?

393
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,360
You guys can take your time to peel and enjoy them.

394
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,440
By the time you finish them,

395
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,440
I should be back with food.

396
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
If we ate all these,

397
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,320
we would be too full for dinner.

398
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
How much should we leave for you?

399
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,080
I am okay

400
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,360
no matter how much you leave for me.

401
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm going now.

402
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,280
Watch the steps.

403
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,640
You guys keep talking.

404
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,620
Just keep talking.

405
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,360
Don't mind us.

406
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,340
You guys, haven't

407
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,440
formerly introduced yourself to each other, right?

408
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,380
You need to know each other, huh?

409
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,920
What do we do?

410
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,230
Chen, you take the lead.

411
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,490
You go ahead.

412
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,890
I have a PhD

413
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,080
and I work in a research institute.

414
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,760
What did you study?

415
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,240
Chemistry.

416
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,080
I am a dubber.

417
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,380
A dubber, huh?

418
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,520
That's a good job.

419
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,440
How about giving me your WeChat number

420
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,360
or phone number.

421
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,360
I'll send you an invite.

422
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,760
We can become friends.

423
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Ordinary friends.

424
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,560
I am sorry,

425
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,880
I just returned to China

426
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,320
and I haven't bought a local phone number.

427
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,440
How about this?

428
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,600
I will give you

429
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,720
my home number,

430
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,480
my cellphone number, my WeChat, my Email address

431
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,160
and my home address.

432
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,280
So that

433
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,840
you can find me

434
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,040
any time

435
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,480
you want.

436
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,480
That's right.

437
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,090
Your brother has wisened up overnight.

438
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,880
He has.

439
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,520
You should eat, old madam.

440
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,920
If you don't eat first,

441
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,280
the others will keep waiting.

442
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
Right, dig in, please.

443
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,710
Let's eat.

444
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,870
My dear, help yourself.

445
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,730
Let's eat.

446
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,440
You too.

447
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,050
Grandmother, dig in.

448
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,570
Okay.

449
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,400
Here, grandmother.

450
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

451
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,130
Here, grandmother.

452
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,860
Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,190
Help yourself, help yourself, help yourself.

454
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,080
Are they all asleep?

455
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,680
Yes.

456
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,320
Why would you remember everything we said in the airport?

457
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,480
I have a good memory.

458
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
Can't you lie to me a little?

459
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,200
Why would I?

460
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,440
Well, you can say,

461
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
you felt something special when you met me.

462
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,280
That's a fact.

463
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,640
Why would I lie to you about that?

464
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,160
Why didn't you knock before getting in?

465
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,800
Can I sleep with you guys?

466
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,560
I heard some weird noises outside.

467
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,200
No.

468
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,800
I am scared of the dark.

469
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,880
Still a no.

470
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
Go sleep on your own.

471
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,040
I'm not faking this.

472
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,520
All right.

473
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,720
You two sleep here.

474
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,680
I'll go out to sleep.

475
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,630
Thank you, Shi Yi.

476
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,640
Go to bed.

477
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,400
From now on, you can only visit us during summer vacation and winter vacation

478
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,080
for one week each.

479
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Winter vacation is short,

480
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,560
so no problem.

481
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,920
But summer vacation is too long,

482
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,760
one week is too short.

483
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,280
You are also not allowed to visit us during normal holidays.

484
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,520
What about weekends?

485
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,840
No.

486
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
What about when I'm sick?

487
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,800
Chen.

488
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,920
I feel terrible.

489
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,720
And I have no one to talk to.

490
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,200
Cry out if you need to.

491
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,800
Grandmother.

492
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,080
It's late at night and it's chilly outside.

493
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,320
Why did you open the window?

494
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,500
You brat.

495
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,000
You have a weak body.

496
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,469
Why did you come out?

497
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,880
Look.

498
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,380
The moon tonight

499
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,220
reminds me of

500
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,760
the day when you and Wenchuan were born.

501
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,810
It's not easy giving birth to twins.

502
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,320
Your mother was in the delivery room

503
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,080
for a whole night,

504
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,800
while I waited outside

505
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,200
for a whole night.

506
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,550
Grandmother,

507
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,360
it's cold. Let me take you to your bed.

508
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,960
Okay, okay.

509
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,080
Grandmother,

510
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,080
I will stay here

511
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,760
until you fall asleep.

512
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,800
Zhousheng Wen

513
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,040
was a good man.

514
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,420
Even when he was dying,

515
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,760
he didn't say that

516
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,600
you weren't her daughter.

517
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,680
Your father,

518
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,340
although he's not your own father,

519
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,320
he is better than...

520
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,800
better than

521
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,960
your real father.

522
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,320
You knew that already?

523
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah.

524
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,320
You should have told me this earlier.

525
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,680
Some people like to

526
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,600
give the people they care about

527
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,520
the best impression

528
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,960
by their good side, their knowledge

529
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
or the good family atmosphere.

530
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,200
After getting remarried, my father

531
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,680
and I stayed

532
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,320
in this place

533
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,600
until he passed away.

534
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,880
That's why his marriage

535
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,120
with Qin Wan

536
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,640
exists only in name.

537
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,360
I can now better understand

538
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,640
why you are distant

539
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,080
from your family.

540
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,600
I am not affected by any of these.

541
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,520
My only concern is that

542
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,680
you would think that this family

543
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,400
is too complicated.

544
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,520
You fool.

545
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,360
You are the only one

546
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,880
I care about.

547
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
No need to walk me out.

548
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,600
About that family matter,

549
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
try to talk to them.

550
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,000
Your mother is a sensible woman.

551
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,200
Shi Yi, see you.

552
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,960
See you.

553
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,280
Let's go.

554
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,280
Go on.

555
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,920
Bye.

556
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,000
Your technology is inferior!

557
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,960
And it did not increase my production!

558
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,440
Yet you still want me to pay in full.

559
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,520
No way!

560
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,440
I have asked someone about this.

561
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,400
You already have a production line

562
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,600
using our technology.

563
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,840
Why aren't you paying us when you are using it?

564
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,040
What makes you say that

565
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,560
I am using your technology?

566
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,680
-Professor.
-Are you the only one in China

567
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,480
that have this technology?

568
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,800
What's going on?

569
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,400
Not our business.

570
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,640
The guys from the other lab

571
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,280
is having a dispute

572
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
with their partner.

573
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,200
They don't know how to argue.

574
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,960
Me and Du Yu,

575
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,280
we were arguing for them.

576
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Arguing on their behalf?

577
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,440
They are walking all over them.

578
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,920
Even though they use our technology,

579
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,920
he doesn't want to pay us.

580
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,200
He even used all sorts of excuses.

581
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,800
What? You guys have nothing more to say, right?

582
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,720
You want me to pay?

583
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,160
Not so easy.

584
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,560
Hello.

585
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,160
Who are you?

586
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
He is our Professor, Mr. Zhousheng.

587
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,320
Are you their superior?

588
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,440
I am their colleague.

589
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
You might get cocky

590
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,560
being called professor

591
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,560
at such a young age.

592
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,880
People in here

593
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
are all ill-tempered.

594
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,520
If your technology doesn't meet our requirements,

595
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,160
just admit it. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

596
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,800
What is shameful is asking for money

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,080
when you can't deliver.

598
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,480
I am here today

599
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,720
because I respect you

600
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,960
scientists.

601
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,520
When we terminate our contract,

602
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,120
talk to my lawyer.

603
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,040
Give me their information.

604
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,960
Professor, don't bother.

605
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,520
I asked my dad to look into this.

606
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,200
They are a thuggish company.

607
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,760
They are totally shameless.

608
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
They want to terminate the contract now,

609
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,160
yet they have already used our technology

610
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,120
in their production line.

611
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,880
I will talk to the head of

612
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
the renewable energy department tomorrow.

613
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,240
I will come back to you later.

614
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,240
It's rare to see you talk about

615
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,280
what happened there at home.

616
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
It's not that.

617
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,800
It's about the institute.

618
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,160
The guys from the other lab.

619
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
They worked as

620
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,880
technical consultants

621
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,000
for a company specializing in lithium.

622
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,480
Now the company

623
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,800
wants to unilaterally terminate the contract

624
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,040
without paying.

625
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,680
That's why you asked Mei Xing

626
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,280
to help them litigate?

627
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,880
It's very hard to obtain evidence for this case.

628
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,320
It's also very time-consuming.

629
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,640
We also need to find a third-party agency

630
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,680
for certification.

631
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,160
It's both too energy

632
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,800
and time consuming.

633
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Mei Xing advises against a lawsuit.

634
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,280
So, that's itï¼Ÿ

635
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,280
That's why we found

636
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,520
a compromise.

637
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,800
What is that?

638
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,680
We own a couple of

639
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,400
renewable energy industrial parks.

640
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,960
Our department of renewable energy is currently

641
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,120
planning on

642
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,760
acquiring some manufacturing companies

643
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,600
of raw materials.

644
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,200
His assistant will

645
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,640
do an on-site inspection tomorrow

646
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,960
with people from the department of new energy.

647
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
If there's no problem,

648
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,320
they would be included

649
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,320
in the acquisition.

650
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,880
That way, we not only

651
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,480
satisfy our own procurement plan,

652
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,040
but make it possible for the whole thing

653
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,040
to be properly investigated.

654
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,000
Although we will buy them out,

655
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,440
we won't be standing on their sides.

656
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,520
I know you won't.

657
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,000
Try this.

658
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,960
It's sweet.

659
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,520
Right?

660
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,120
Why are you here again?

661
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,760
Is Professor Zhousheng in?

662
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,400
Our teacher is in the middle of something,

663
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,240
he's not available.

664
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,200
I only have a few things to say.

665
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,160
Hello.

666
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,120
Professor,

667
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,840
I couldn't see the forest for the trees.

668
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,840
Professor Zhousheng,

669
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,120
we have been trying to get into contact

670
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,680
with the renewable energy industrial parks

671
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,960
and have been pulling a lot of strings

672
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,240
to see their person in charge.

673
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,160
But we never could.

674
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,400
Yesterday,

675
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
their legal department's chief assistant

676
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,240
actually came to visit me.

677
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,840
Professor Zhousheng,

678
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,360
you are truly my lucky star.

679
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I had no idea that

680
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,000
you and the head of their legal department

681
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,800
were friends.

682
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,320
I really didn't expect that.

683
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,760
If they didn't mention it yesterday,

684
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,600
I don't even know that

685
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,120
this was all thanks to you.

686
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,960
I have told my accountant

687
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,200
to pay the money today.

688
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,280
We won't terminate the contract.

689
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,560
Why would we?

690
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,560
It's impossible.

691
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,960
The whole thing was a misunderstanding.

692
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
When will you be available

693
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,200
to do me the honor

694
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,920
and let me invite you to dinner?

695
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,220
[Chen Sihan]

696
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
No, thanks, I don't like business dinners.

697
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,040
Here, here.

698
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,880
I admire those who dedicate themselves into science

699
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,200
instead of socializing the most.

700
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,800
Would you please,

701
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,200
maybe when you are not busy,

702
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,520
give my regards to Mr. Mei?

703
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,400
Okay.

704
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,120
Okay, okay, okay.

705
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,000
I won't trouble you anymore.

706
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,600
See you.

707
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,640
It's okay, I will see myself out.

708
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,680
Professor,

709
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,760
is he talking about the legal friend of yours

710
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
you mentioned just the other day?

711
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah, a famous lawyer.

712
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,960
Powerful people are friends with other powerful people.

713
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,800
That's a hard fact.

714
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,200
He didn't even check who you are?

715
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,960
But it's pointless

716
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,000
because he can't understand.

717
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,240
Let's get to work.

718
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,120
I just heard in the elevator that

719
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,280
your wife is some kind of celebrity.

720
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,040
I mean, this is really

721
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,560
good lenses, bad frames.

722
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,000
I apologize for my lack of respect.

723
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,520
Our laboratory building

724
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,800
has a visitor

725
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,680
registry policy, don't we?

726
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,560
Yeah, we do.

727
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,400
We are a key laboratory.

728
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,560
You think you can come and go as you please?

729
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,120
Who will be responsible if confidential documents are lost?

730
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,480
I am sorry, I am sorry.

731
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,360
I'll be on my way.

732
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,160
I won't take up your time anymore.

733
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,600
I am seriously leaving.

734
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,400
Bye, bye.
