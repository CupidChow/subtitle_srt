Wait.

00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,060
What's wrong?

6
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,020
Let's get down to business first.

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,100
Get into bed.

8
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,500
Now?

Yeah, come on.

10
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,460
It's still not dark enough, but we'll make do.

11
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,340
Come on, into bed!

Are you sure?

At this time of day?

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,780
I'm sure.

15

Close your eyes.

18
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,820
Why should I close my eyes?

19
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Close them.

20
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,900
Don't open them.

21
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,579
Okay, open them.

Thank you.

24
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,660
Just a thank you?

25
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,700
So stingy.

26
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,620
I don't mean to be.

27
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,340
It's nice. Very nice.

28

I work later than you.

29

31

just leave this on.

32
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,740
I bought the night light specifically for you.

33
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,460
Did I say I'm afraid of the dark?

34
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,180
Can't you just pretend?

35
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,060
I'm so afraid of the dark.

36
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,579
Look at you!

37
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,460
You even need your wife to teach you how to coax her.

38
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,340
This is your own star map.

39

Do you like it?

40
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,860
I do.

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,540
If you like it,

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,460
I can buy all the different patterns

43
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,540
for you.

44
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,060
I'll buy whatever you like.

45
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,980
If you don't like them,

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,060
I'll just buy and keep them for now.

47
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,500
Because even if you don't like it now,

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
you might change your mind later, right?

49
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,700
No, I can't look at you any longer.

50

Where are you going?

I'm going to buy a wiring board.

53
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,260
You only felt touched for a few seconds?

54

It's not that.

55

58

You bought so much stuff.

I just stopped to look around several times.

And an old lady

talked to me for more than 20 minutes.

I go back to the same place every day.

I know you're concerned about him.

131
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,540
I tormented him a lot when I was young.

132
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,140
Now that I've grown up, I should make up for it

That's right.

138
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,860
I lived in his house during the two years of my surgery.

139
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,100
I didn't feel comfortable when I first got there.

140
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
I cried every day,

141
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,060
through the morning and the afternoon.

142
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,580
I even cried at night.

143
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,340
I couldn't stand it now that I think about it.

144
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,940
But he never

145
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,300
ever lost his temper with me.

146
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,740
Every day, he was just like,

147
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,820
Zhou Wenxing,

148
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,540
I'll scold you if you cry again.

149
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,340
He said it every day, bluffing.

150
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,220
But he didn't really mean that.

151
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,060
It's the first night of living together.

152
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,420
What's the big feast?

153
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,460
Noodles with scallion oil,

154
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,900
mixed jellyfish, smashed cucumbers

155
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,380
with tomatoes in white sugar.

156
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,580
That's all you had?

157
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,340
There's nothing to eat at home.

158
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,700
He was in a hurry for a meeting.

159
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,020
He went into his study after dinner

160
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,460
and hasn't come out yet.

161
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,340
He's really

162
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,780
a mediocre chemistry professor.

163
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,740
What a mediocre first night of living together.

164
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,460
He's come out. I'm hanging up.

165
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,740
What are you looking for?

166
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,340
I'm looking for drinking water.

167
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,420
Hot or cold?

168
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,620
Both are fine.

169
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,140
Cold water is in the fridge.

170
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,740
Hot water and room temperature water are here.

171
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
How about some room temperature water?

172
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,340
Okay.

173
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,540

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,900
ask the kitchen for it yourself.

344
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,040
Okay.

345
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,060
Bye-bye.

346
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,130
Bye-bye.

347
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,460
A little red

348
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,370
Two-leaf green

349
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,960
[A little bit of red, Two rhythms.
Triangle Grass, Four Seasons.
Five Lianzi, Six harmonies]

350
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,350
Triangle grass.

351
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,360
Four Seasons.

352
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,500
[Seven-leaf lily. Eight-horned maple. Nine flowers. Ten dusts. Hundred Herb Cream, Thousand Day Red]

353
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Five Lianzi.

354
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,410
Six harmonies.

355
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,490
Seven-leaf lily.

356
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,580
Eight-horned Maple.

357
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,550
Nine flowers.

358
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,640
Ten dusts.

359
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,850
Hundred Herbs Cream.

360
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,960
Thousand Day Red.

361
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,710
This is the answer given by Shi Yi.

362
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,340
Watching you wash the glass

363
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,820
makes me think it's not glass

364
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,340
but crystal.

365
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,980
If you have time,

366
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,780
can you wash all the cups in the cabinet

367
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,900
all over again?

368
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,100
No problem.

369
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,180
When I was working in the lab,

370
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,900
most of the work

371
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,380
was to wash all kinds of bottles.

372
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,460
Eventually it became a pastime.

373
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,260
When I was happy, I washed them.

374
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,620
When I was not, I washed them too.

375
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,060
Can you expand this business

376
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,980
to washing clothes?

377
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,740
I'll stock them up in one place.

378
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,100
Wash some when you're happy.

379
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,780
Wash some more when you're not happy too.

380
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,380
I can try.

381
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,020
No cheating.

382
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,260
By the way, I thought about installing a sterilizer

383
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,300
here in a few days.

384
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,780
Whatever you want.

385
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,540
I'll go back to the bedroom then.

386
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,300
What are you doing?

387
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,300
Sleeping.

388
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,220
Come in.

389
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,940
I've got your pajamas for you.

390
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,820
Do you usually

391
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,420
wear pajamas?

392
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,860
Or do you just wear anything you like?

393
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,660
Pajamas?

394
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,940
I'll go inside and get changed.

395
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,780
This is my first time

396
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,900
seeing you in pajamas.

397
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,260
I'll go to bed now.

398
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,380
Where are you going?

399
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,700
Come sleep here.

400
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,900
Are you used to sleeping on the left side

401
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,700
or the right side?

402
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,740
Didn't you say...?

403
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,780
I can sleep on either side.

404
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,180
Then I'll sleep on the right side.

405
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,260
Come on.

406
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,820
I'm going to turn off the lights.

407
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,460
Right.

408
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,340
I also bought you

409
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,340
some loungewear.

410
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,740
They're a style you haven't worn before.

411
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,100
I've put them in your closet.

412
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,180
Okay, I'll wear them tomorrow.

413
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,260
Good night.

414
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,700
Good night.

415
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,740
It looks like it just rained here.

416
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,780
It might have.

417
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,700
Luckily, I'm not wearing heels.

418
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,940
Excuse me, shall we go?

419
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,020
Yes.

420
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,420
So, are you two having a meal?

421
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,340
Or are you just having tea?

422
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,300
We're having a meal.

423
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,740
This way, please.

424
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:17,860
Come on.

425
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,460
Please take a look at the menu.

426
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,940
You two are really lucky.

427
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,220
If it wasn't for the customer

428
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,860
who cancelled the order the other day,

429
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,100
there wouldn't have been boats around here.

430
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,860
Can you recommend some dishes?

431
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Mostly something filling.

432
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,900
We came here with an empty stomach.

433
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,700
It's all filling food here.

434
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,660
They're all very good, so feel free to order.

435
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,540
Okay.

436
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,020
Hi.

437
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,020
You've been here before?

438
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,140
It's my first time too.

439
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,460
I asked someone before we left.

440
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,820
I see.

441
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,740
You don't look like someone who would enjoy

442
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,020
this kind of life.

443
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,620
Excuse me.

444
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,860
There are two young people over there

445
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,180
who want to get on the boat too.

446
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,340
But I said the boat was chartered.

447
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,860
They want me to

448
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,620
discuss with you two.

449
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,580
Can you spare that

450
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,660
empty table

451
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
for them?

452
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,940
As long as my wife is okay with it,

453
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,060
I have no problem with it.

454
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,380
Get them on board.

455
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,620
Okay. Thank you.

456
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,180
Thank you.

457
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,770
Thank you.

458
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,060
Well, you two read the menu first.

459
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,380
Call me when you're ready.

460
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,310
Okay.

461
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,940
What do you want to eat?

462
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,660
I'll eat whatever you want.

463
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,340
I'll have this one.

464
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,500
Okay.

465
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,500
One more of this one.

466
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,260
I want to eat this.

467
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,260
Okay.

468
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,860
One dish

469
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,700
would be enough for us.

470
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,900
We can't finish two dishes.

471
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,100
It's a waste.

472
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,940
It's a rare occasion to go out.

473
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,620
It's quite beautiful here.

474
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,740
The worst thing would be to live an overly frugal life after we go back.

475
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,180
They look like students

476
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
or recent graduates.

477
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,460
Such a relationship is so rare.

478
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
I remember when I first graduated

479
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,460
and went into the studio,

480
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,940
there was an intern recording engineer

481
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,100
who got along with his little girlfriend like this too.

482
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,980
They were very careful with their money.

483
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,300
What to eat every day

484
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,020
from Monday to Friday,

485
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,060
they had it all planned out

486
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,860
just so they could have something nice

487
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,940
on the weekend

488
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,940
or go to the surrounding area for a walk

489
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,380
at the end of each month.

490
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,940
They worked together to make money

491
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,300
with the same goal.

492
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,700
I envy them.

493
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,940
I wish I could have

494
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,500
met you earlier

495
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,020
when you were in college.

496
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,660
When I was in college,

497
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,220
you were just in junior high school.

498
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,780
Show-off. I know you went to school earlier than me.

499
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,580
It's a

500
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,620
rabbit.

501
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,660
Have you ever seen a hand puppet show?

502
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,060
Grandma taught me some.

503
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
I'll show you.

504
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,900
Sure.

505
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,460
But you have to work with me

506
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,140
Me?

507
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,140
I'll try my best.

508
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,740
Guanghan Palace is really cold.

509
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,620
It's about to be mid-autumn.

510
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,460
I don't see any people from outside.

511
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,260
I might as well go for a walk with the crowds.

512
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,500
It's livelier.

513
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,420
This gentleman...

514
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,500
Have we met somewhere before?

515
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,390
Yes?

516
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,260
What's your name?

517
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,500
Zhousheng. Chen as the first name.

518
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,940
I've heard of

519
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,540
your name before.

520
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,940
Where did you hear it?

521
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,340
You're well-known.

522
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,220
Of course I heard it from some other people.

523
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,740
What did they say?

524
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,860
Drunk on the Baigu beach.

525
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,820
Singing wild.

526
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,380
A pot of liquor and a horse.

527
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,420
How many people in the world are like this king?

528
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,980
These are the lines you dubbed before?

529
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,140
I think

530
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,420
you'd be a good actress

531
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,780
if you plan to act.

532
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,660
Dubbing itself is

533
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,740
a kind of acting.

534
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,300
I had acting classes before I started my career.

535
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,500
The teacher who specialized in acting

536
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,260
from a drama school eventually found a good acting job.

537
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
It's going to rain.

538
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,620
Sorry, Chen.

539
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,940
I only have one umbrella here.

540
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,100
It's okay.

541
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,860
We like

542
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,540
the vibe of getting wet.

543
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,460
You guys just go.

544
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,250
Okay, we'll go first.

545
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,620
Come on.

546
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,460
Let's go too.

547
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,410
You put my clothes on.

548
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,540
I'll go out first.

549
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,060
Come on.

550
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,660

Yes.

621
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,460
And you?

622
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,179

623
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:13,780
[Celestial orbital theory]

you like kids?

630
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,900
Yes, I do.

631
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,820
I've always liked kids.

632
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
I was thinking

633
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,260
there are no flower girls in Chinese weddings.

634
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,060
If you like kids too,

635
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,300
we could do our make-up

636
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,020

643

654
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,900

Bye.

660
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,700
You don't know your way around Shanghai.

661
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,780
I won't give you the car key.

662

Is Uncle Lin here?

663
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,740
He's in Zhenjiang.

664
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,340
Then you can only take a taxi

665
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,580
to the research center.

666
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,180
Tell me in advance when you get off work.

667
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,420
I'll pick you up.

668
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,780
I can come back by myself.

669
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,580
I'll pick you up at my parents' house.

670
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,900
They've caught you.

671
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,020
Surely, we'll have to explain in person.

672
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,020
Do you want me to go explain?

673
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,740
Just go first.

674
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,980
We haven't matched our statements.

675
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,820
I'm afraid if something goes wrong.

676
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,460
It's easier for me to solve it myself.

677
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,580
Just go.

678
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,500
Just go.

679
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,700
You better get inside.

680
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,500
Bye, bye.

681
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,940
Are you going out?

682
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:05,780
Well.

00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,020

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,140
What? Is it inappropriate?

686
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,940
I don't think so.

687
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Is there a shopping center near there?

688
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,340
Yes, there is.

689
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,700
Turn left in front of you.

690
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,740
After you leave the neighborhood, turn left again.

691
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,020
There is a shopping center.

692
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:26,980
It takes...?

693
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,500
10 minutes by foot too.

694
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,300
Thank you.

695
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,380
Okay.

696
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,900
You really don't know anything.

697
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,220
Can't you look it up?

698
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,580
Grandpa, please sit down.

699
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,260
I'll make you some tea.

700
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,220
Save it.

701
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,180
Sit.

702
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,500
Me and him...

703
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,020
Although it's your own business

704
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,300
to decide to live together,

705
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,620
you have to inform your parents

706
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,900
of it in advance.

707
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,140
The most important thing is

708
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,420
their family

709
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,860
won't even meet with us till now.

710
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,540
Think about

711
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,020
how your parents feel.

712
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,500
Grandpa, you've wasted the tea.

713
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,900
Can't you say something good

714
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,020
for Chen?

715
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,540
He gave you

716
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,660
several teapots before, right?

717
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,980
The ones inscribed by famous masters.

718
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,980
And the stuff he gave you later,

719
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,420
brushes and ink.

720
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,660
You forgot who sent them

721
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,180
after putting them in the cabinet.

722
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,580
Their love is true.

723
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,820
But the parents tried to stop it.

724
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,460
Their parents are not understanding.

725
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,700
You are not either?

726
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
All right. I will say nothing about it.

727
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
That's right.

728
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,460
Our Yuan is right.

729
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,460
She makes sense.

730
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:55,980
Grandpa.

731
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,100
Look at Chen.

732
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,260
How poor he is.

733
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,340
He was so scared by you

734
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,460
that he didn't even dare to say a word

735
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,660
before running away.

736
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,220
We didn't say anything

737
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,820
before he ran away.

738
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Besides, well...

739
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,940
Grandpa, come here.

740
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,780
I just saw

741
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
there's a crab.

742
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,980
Guess

743
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,580
what the crab's names is?

744
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,420
What's its name?

745
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,380
What is it called?

746
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,540
Sodium chloride and monosodium glutamate.

747
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,340
What?

748
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,820
Okay, turn around.

749
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,740
Why have you lost weight again?

750
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,220
Are you on a diet lately?

751
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,390
No.

752
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,780
Do you even weigh

753
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,060
as much as a junior high school student now?

754
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,620
Why don't you eat more,

755
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,860
take better care of your body?

756
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,300
I look forward to your coming

757
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,300
to talk with me

758
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,420
every time the season changes.

759
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,980
But now you're here,

760
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,260
I'm afraid that you two siblings

761
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,300
would criticize me together.

762
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,660
I want to order some suits.

763
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,980
My eldest brother

764
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,140
has the best command of my family's suit-making skills.

765
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,980
But he's a slow maker.

766
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,220
You must order them

767
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,260
for an important friend.

768
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,420
His apprentice is not qualified yet.

769
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,860
Why don't you say anything?

770
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,820
Didn't you say everything I had to say?

771
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,860
Who is it for?

772
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,580
You don't have to know.

773
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,700
Write down what size you need and show me.

774
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,700
I'll measure for you.

775
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,180
I make eye-measurements.

776
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,540
Either you bring the person here,

777
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,060
or find a time and

778
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,620
I'll come to him.

779
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,140
No exceptions?

780
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
No exceptions.

781
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,500
My apprentice can make an exception.

782
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,340
I can't.

783
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,220
He's not lying to you.

784
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,140
Our family started with suits.

785
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,580
They're all hand-made.

786
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,380
Regular clients

787
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,820
have to register their information

788
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,180
just in case someone tries to cheat

789
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,540
or take the suits from our family

790
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,740
to learn the craft.

791
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,620
Forget it.

792
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,260
He's not that particular about it anyway.

793
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,740
I just can't think of

794
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,460
what to give him for his birthday.
