00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,330
Shi Yi.

5
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,820
About the tune name before...

6
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,100
I know.

7
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,460
Don't take me wrong.

8
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,990
I just want to say that

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,200
I've already

10
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,300
let it go.

11
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,840
Wenxing

12
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,710
wants to talk to you guys.

13
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,720
Go ahead.

14
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,270
Shi Yi.

15
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,630
Mei Xing has my phone.

16
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,800
There's a recording in it.

17
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,460
Go out and listen to it.

18
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,230
I want to talk to Mei Xing

19
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,020
alone.

20
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,060
Okay.

21
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,740
Shi Yi,

22
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,950
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,780
I'm a selfish person.

24
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,980
If I'm going to die,

25
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,340
I will definitely

26
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,659
give my remaining time

27
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,860
to Mei Xing.

28
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,250
I have to remember him

29
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,600
so that I can find him in my next life.

30
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,620
That's why I've prepared this recording

31
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,659
a long time ago

32
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,690
for you.

33
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,680
About this recording,

34
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,970
I don't know where to start.

35
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,659
I grew up in Mei Xing's house

36
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,020
and the hospital.

37
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,170
I didn't know my family very well.

38
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,460
The only people who treated me well

39
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,850
were the two of my elder brothers.

40
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,740
Of course,

41
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,300
the one who treated me the best is Chen.

42
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,180
But since I was young, I've had a feeling that

43
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,140
Mom didn't like Chen.

44
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,420
When I grew older,

45
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,220
I learned a secret.

46
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,580
But I won't tell you

47
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,180
this secret.

48
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,820
I feel that

49
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,340
everyone who knows about this secret

50
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,940
would have bad luck.

51
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,260
Me, for example.

52
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,500
My second brother, too.

53
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,340
I seem to be

54
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,300
talking nonsense again.

55
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,460
Shi Yi.

56
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,300
I actually want to

57
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
apologize to you.

58
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,980
I'm very, very sorry.

59
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,659
Don't be afraid.

60
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm here. It's okay.

61
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,300
I will always be with you.

62
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,860
After I'm gone,

63
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,980
you have to take care of yourself.

64
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,420
Don't drink that much anymore.

65
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,700
No one will be there to nag you anymore.

66
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,380
If you have to drink because of business,

67
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,460
then fill this with hangover medicine.

68
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,780
Don't cry.

69
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
I'll feel even worse

70
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,180
seeing you cry.

71
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,100
Okay.

72
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,420
I won't cry. Why should I cry?

73
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,060
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

74
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,020
Then get some sleep.

75
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,860
I'll stay here with you.

76
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,620
Okay?

77
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,260
Good girl.

78
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,390
We all know about Bremen.

79
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,430
But we all chose to keep quiet.

80
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,540
Only Ren and my second uncle had an argument.

81
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,660
Later on,

82
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,610
Ren went to Wuzhen for you.

83
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,940
You know Ren is very special

84
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,020
in our family.

85
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,110
As long as he is by your side,

86
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,700
no one would dare to

87
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,460
do something bad to you.

88
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,170
I know

89
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,060
I can't compare myself to Ren.

90
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,820
Later, you came to live with us.

91
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,150
I came back to see the doctor.

92
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,630
And then you fell into the water.

93
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,290
These were not accidents.

94
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,820
I don't know how much you can figure out,

95
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,020
or what intentions

96
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,060
the person who set this up had in mind.

97
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,060
Shi Yi.

98
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,860
I wish you could figure it out.

99
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,140
So that

100
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
I can feel less guilty.

101
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,140
Only me and Mei Xing

102
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,620
can get Chen's

103
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,340
unconditional trust, right?

104
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,860
You're so smart.

105
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,380
You should be able

106
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,220
to guess who it is,

107
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,780
right?

108
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,340
I didn't mean to hurt you.

109
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,620
But I did hurt you.

110
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,300
I caused you to fall into the water.

111
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,860
I tried to save you

112
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,940
and put myself in danger too.

113
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,980
I wanted to use this method

114
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,060
to hurt the two people my eldest brother

115
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,970
cared most.

116
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,860
So that he would be scared of losing you.

117
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,980
And be scared of involving me.

118
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,980
So he would give up on this family

119
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,460
and bring you away.

120
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Shi Yi.

121
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,620
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,060
I'm a selfish person.

123
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,900
At the most critical moment,

124
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,860
I could only take care of my own family.

125
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,180
I didn't want to see a bitter fight

126
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,620
between my two brothers.

127
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,340
That's why

128
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
I am the person

129
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,520
that caused all this.

130
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,480
If there is another life,

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
I will definitely make it up to you.

133
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,560
When you were little,

134
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
you sat on my lap.

135
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,720
Just like this.

136
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,140
You liked to put your face close to mine.

137
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,000
If I wanted to put you down,

138
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,840
you would immediately cross your arms and say

139
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,200
"Don't let go! Don't let go!"

140
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
If I let you go, you would be unhappy.

141
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,200
If you were unhappy, I would feel sad.

142
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,880
I...

143
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,720
I don't blame you.

144
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
I don't blame you.

145
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,720
I don't blame you.

146
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,080
Chen!

147
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,040
Chen, stop it!

148
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
Stop fighting! Chen, stop it!

149
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Wenchuan! Wenchuan!

150
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,120
Please, stop fighting!

151
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,320
Stop it!

152
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,280
He didn't want this to happen either!

153
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,520
He's Wenxing's biological brother.

154
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,480
Are you okay?

155
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,080
If you kill him,

156
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
how am I going to live?

157
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,920
I just lost a daughter.

158
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,880
Man!

159
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,200
Man, what happened to you?

160
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,880
Quick, call a doctor!

161
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,160
Call a doctor! Call a doctor!

162
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,480
Doctor!

163
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,520
Doctor!

164
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,910
Doctor! Doctor!

165
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,750
Ever since she was born,

166
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,120
I've always wanted to trade my life

167
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,600
for her health.

168
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,640
Why?

169
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,360
Why did she

170
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,080
have to suffer so much?

171
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
His sister just passed away.

172
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,720
For now, he'll probably

173
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,960
have a hard time accepting this.

174
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
Don't get upset.

175
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,440

You don't have to

pretend to be strong in front of me.

Mr. Du, you didn't sleep either,

right?

I didn't have time to sleep.

Your family refused to cooperate.

359
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,580
Saying it was all but a misunderstanding.

360
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,320
They also said that your sister's death

361

had nothing to do with Zhou Wenchuan.

I already said it last night,

and also did what she shouldn't have done.

Do you know how much

377

she had suffered these couple of days?

378

Dad.

Even on her deathbed,

387

Wenxing did not call you Dad.

Do you feel sorry?

389
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,520
You taught me to read, write
