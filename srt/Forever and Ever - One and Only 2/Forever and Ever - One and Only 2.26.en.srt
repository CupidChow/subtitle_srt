00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Professor Zhousheng.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,039
Thank goodness for your attorney friend,

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
or else

7
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,640
our efforts would have been in vain.

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah.

9
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,920
These are some dishes we ordered for you.

10
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,320
Thank you.

11
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,160
We should be the ones to say that.

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,560
We have ordered afternoon tea as well.

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,360
It's our treat.

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,360
There's no need for that.

16
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,480
It's okay, we have already placed the order.

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
We will leave you to it.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,600
Take your time. See you.
-We have to go now.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Bye, Professor.

20
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,320
Bye.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,960
The lab in Xi'an

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,320
is almost done.

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,000
You two have no problem

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
going there first, right?

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,480
No problem at all.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,800
Same here.

27
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,040
I'll be fine as long as I visit my parents

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
on Mid-Autumn Festival and have dinner with them.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,720
Okay.

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,120
By the way, Professor.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
Your wife works in Shanghai

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
while you'll work in Xi'an.

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
How are you going to maintain your relationship?

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,960
Our relationship

35
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,360
does not require deliberate maintenance.

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,560
That may be the now.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
What about in the future?

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Living apart for long periods

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
would definitely cause problems.

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,520
What if...

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm just saying, what if

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,520
a very attractive admirer shows up?

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,200
What would you do?

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah, what would you do?

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,680
Her admirers

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
seem to have never stopped appearing.

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,120
Are you not jealous?

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,720
It's doesn't feel good,

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
but it's not a big problem.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,800
You should at least

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,800
try to solve the problem.

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
She never gave

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
any of them a chance.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,240
To be honest, Professor.

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
This is my very first time

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,040
seeing someone being jealous

57
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,120
and calm at the same time.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Respect.

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,360
My wife

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,600
is flawless in every aspect.

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,200
So it's natural

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
she has numerous admirers.

63
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,520
For something that's natural,

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,960
it is best

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,280
to cope with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle.

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,040
That makes sense.

I love scientists.

71

Especially someone who studies Venus.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Why does it have to be

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
someone who studies Venus?

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,279
Because

75
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,160
they are special.

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
In what way?

The fact that it is so special

makes the person who studies it even more special.

He is an astrophysicist.

124

So it occurred to my father

125

that you are an astrochemist.

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
He doesn't want to let his students down.

127
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,440
So he asked me to ask you

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,720
if you can fill the role.

129
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,680

No need to get ready.

I will go get ready.

157
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,840
I'll head up then.

Wait.

Why?

164

too lovable.

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
No smiling.

167

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Is that you?

177
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,800
I am from the winter vacation class.

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,200
Last year's winter vacation class.

179
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,280
Lin Jia?

180
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Yeah, that's me.

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
You still remember me?

182
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,280
Shi Yi, are you Shi Yi?

183
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,039
I watched your drama.

184
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,480
You are even involved in plays now?

185
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,840
I am about to graduate,

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,320
so I am too busy

187
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
to follow you.

188
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,440
That was a rare occasion. I was doing my friend a favor.

189
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,200
Miss Shi.

190
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Can I get your autograph?

191
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,920
Sure.

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,800
Thank you.

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,840
Can I write the name of the drama?

194
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,200
Absolutely.

195
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,720
There is no notice about a big shot coming.

196
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Is it over already?

197
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,720
It shouldn't be.

198
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,320
At least let us hear the end.

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
Miss Shi, you are so talented.

200
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Miss Shi, please sign your name here.

201
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,160
Okay.

202
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,320
Miss Shi, you are amazing.

203
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,960
-Miss Shi, please give me your autograph.
-Thank you.

204
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
Miss Shi, me too.

205
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Okay.

206
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,760
Miss Shi, me as well.

207
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Miss Shi, can I have your autograph?

208
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
That's it, everybody.

209
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
That's the end of today's lecture.

210
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
Thank you.

211
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,600
Professor.

212
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,800
Is there no Q&A session

213
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,120
for today?

214
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
I am sorry.

215
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,440
Because this is a last-minute lecture.

216
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,440
So there is

217
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
no time reserved for questions.

218
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,640
Besides,

219
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,300
my wife has been waiting for me downstairs

220
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,270
for a long time.

221
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
Your wife?

222
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,330
You're a married man, sir?

223
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,520
Getting married at such a young age.

224
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,640
What if you regret it one day?

225
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
Yeah.

226
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,960
You should ask

227
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,520
my wife that question

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
instead of me.

229
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,520
Because she is way more talented than I am.

230
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,200
I am only an ordinary guy

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,280
that happens to meet a woman

232
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
exceeding my expectation

233
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,960
at the right age.

234
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,920
If I didn't marry her,

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,560
I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
That's so admirable.

237
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,160
Yeah.

238
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
Professor, there's no need to answer questions.

239
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,320
Why don't you talk about your love story?

240
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
Exactly, exactly.

241
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,880
Let's talk about that.

242
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,440
All right, from now on,

243
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,400
everyone

244
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,480
may ask one question

245
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,400
relevant to today's lecture.

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
You may start now.

247
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
Professor, I have a question.

248
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
Professor, you said

249
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Venus was rather unpopular

250
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,840
in terms of planetary research.

251
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,640
Then why

252
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,760
did you choose it?

253
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,720
Venus to me,

254
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,990
is the future of earth.

255
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,650
I want to see the future.

256
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,520
What turned a planet

257
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,520
that was once livable,

258
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
with all kinds of species,

259
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
into this planet

260
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,000
that has an uncontrolled greenhouse effect.

261
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,120
In fact, by studying Venus,

262
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,320
we better understand

263
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,840
how to protect our own planet.

264
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,280
Of course.

265
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,760
I also wish that human beings, in the future,

266
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
could transform Venus

267
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
into our second home.

268
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,240
Professor,

269
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,380
the surface temperature of Venus

270
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,680
can reach up to 500 degrees.

271
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Wouldn't it be too difficult to live there?

272
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,240
Yeah.

273
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,370
Yeah, it is indeed very hard.

274
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
High levels of radiation and corrosive acid rain

275
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,440
are no doubt

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,400
great challenges.

277
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,960
But our scientists

278
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
have never given up.

279
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,360
Since last century,

280
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,080
they have proposed

281
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,280
all kinds of solutions.

282
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
Such as building a sun shield

283
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,440
above its atmosphere

284
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,480
to improve its environment.

285
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,120
Or, to build a city above the clouds.

286
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,160
It's just that

287
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
implementing these ideas

288
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
would be really hard.

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
But anything is possible.

290
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,680
As long as we persist

291
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,480
long enough,

292
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,080
every impossibility

293
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,920
will become something possible.

294
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,760
Like what our ancestors

295
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,920
believed in.

296
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
They held the belief

297
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,240
that the sun would never rise from the west

298
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,320
and set in the east.

299
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
But if in the future,

300
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,560
our offspring

301
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,120
make it to Venus,

302
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
then they will see,

303
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,280
with their own eyes,

304
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,280
that the sun can come up from the west

305
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
and set in the east.

306
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,200
You know what?

307
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
You looked pretty cool

308
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,200
just now on the podium.

309
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,120
What?

310
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,960
Am I usually not?

311
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Today you are exceptionally cool.

312
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,120
So,

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to give you something as a reward.

314
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
What is it?

315
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,680
Pro...

316
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,960
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello, Professor.

317
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,560
Goodbye, Professor.

318
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,360
Goodbye, Professor.

319
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,880
Let's go to the bigger house

320
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,040
to get two boxes of stuff first.

321
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,160
Let's go.

322
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,390
Go.

323
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,360
How long are we staying at home during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

324
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,660
Three days, I guess.

325
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,200
Then I will pack for four days.

326
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,200
In case you want to live at Grandma's place,

327
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
you can have extra clothes for change.

328
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
What are you writing?

329
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,080
Our wedding invitation.

330
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
I want to practice a little

331
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,400
before

332
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
writing the formal invitations.

333
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
Why do you write it yourself?

334
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,080
Do you have enough time?

335
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,960
100 pieces a day.

336
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,560
3000 pieces a month.

337
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,360
I should be able to complete it.

338
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,480
This is something that happens once in a lifetime.

339
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,640
I want to do everything myself.

340
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
Then go ahead.

341
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,940
I will go pack.

342
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,680
Last night,

343
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,240
I think I heard you coughing.

344
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
I will make a

345
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,530
stewed pear for you later.

346
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,320
Okay.

347
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,480
After we come back,

348
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,400
how about going to that house

349
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
and staying there for a couple of days?

350
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Sure.

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,240
How about you wearing this tomorrow?

352
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,120
Sure.

353
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,280
I will iron it for you.

354
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,800
Have some juice. I will iron it myself.

355
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,560
Thank you, Professor Zhousheng.

356
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Let me give you a massage.

357
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Dear customer,

358
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,320
how does it feel?

359
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,160
Pretty good.

360
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,000
Just the right amount of strength.

361
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,020
Please give me a five-star review if you like it.

362
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,880
Oh, right.

363
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,000
My mother asked me when will we arrive tomorrow?

364
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
Five o'clock sharp.

365
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,440
Okay.

366
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,720
My wife is beautiful, huh?

367
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,240
She used to be the beauty queen of her school.

368
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,000
I still think

369
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,600
my wife is more beautiful.

370
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
But no matter how beautiful your wife is,

371
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,520
my wife gave birth to her.

372
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
She can't beat my wife.

373
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Isn't there a saying that goes like this,

374
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
the student surpasses the master?

375
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,760
You two college professors

376
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
are talking about

377
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,680
such pointless things.

378
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Aren't you afraid that your students might laugh at you?

379
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,200
You see.

380
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
When a man compliments his partner,

381
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,080
there is nothing wrong about it.

382
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,040
It's usually the opposite that's bad.

383
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Isn't it?

384
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,920
Yes.

385
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,680
The crabs in the two tanks

386
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,120
love to eat the same food,

387
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
but like different fruits.

388
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
I'll leave a note here.

389
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,040
All right, I got it.

390
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,690
You have been fiddling with these crabs

391
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,700
the whole night tonight.

392
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,300
[Longevity]

393
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,960
This is a birthday gift we prepared

394
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,920
for Chen's grandmother.

395
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,920
Thank you, Mom.

396
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,880
I'll go to bed.

397
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,770
By the way,

398
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,100
what do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

399
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,120
I will have rice balls and soy bean milk.

400
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
He wakes up at 5 am

401
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,800
and eats by himself.

402
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,710
You don't have to prepare anything for him.

403
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,570
Is that appropriate?

404
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,880
It's his first time staying here

405
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,160
and we don't make him breakfast?

406
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,240
It's okay, he won't mind.

407
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,110
Good night.

408
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,120
Look at the current me.

409
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm prettier now.

410
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,820
[Eleven]

411
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,400
Why did you

412
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,960
use Eleven

413
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,040
as a pet name?

414
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
My grandmother gave me the name.

415
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,320
She thought the name my father gave me

416
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,320
was too literary.

417
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,600
Aren't all seniors like this?

418
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
They all believe that it's

419
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,600
easier to raise a child with a simple name.

420
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,880
Seeing you here

421
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,600
in the room where I grew up

422
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,800
feels kind of surreal.

423
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
Why?

424
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
I don't know.

425
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Last time at your grandmother's place,

426
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,000
I slept with you in the bedroom where you used to live when you were a student.

427
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,240
How did you like it?

428
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,600
That night...

429
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,670
I believe that night,

430
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,960
you were more nervous than me.

431
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,260
As if you weren't nervous.

432
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,360
I was pretty calm.

433
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,840
It's just that...

434
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,400
What?

435
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,040
It's just on that night,

436
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,080
I couldn't sleep.

437
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,320
Because you smelled amazing.

438
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,680
I have never had

439
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,880
perfume

440
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
in the room where I sleep.

441
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,600
That's why I couldn't sleep.

442
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,640
Is it?

443
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,440
Yeah.

444
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,280
Your hair smells great,

445
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,680
also your pajamas.

446
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
You rascal.

447
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,000
How about smelling the perfume

448
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
once again tonight?

449
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
We are at your parent's place.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,080
It's okay,

451
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,840
as long as I get back before daybreak.

452
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,560
Sure.

453
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,270
Mother, is he not home yet?

454
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,120
I think he went out for breakfast

455
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,200
and hadn't come home yet.

456
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,680
Why don't you go check on him?

457
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,960
Okay, I will check on him.

458
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,520
Checkmate.

459
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,680
Qin.

460
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,720
You lost again?

461
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
What a young man!

462
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,640
Mr. Qin

463
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
used to be the best player

464
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,320
in our community.

465
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
How about playing another round?

466
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,160
Okay.

467
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,240
Here.

468
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
You are pretty talented,

469
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,240
young man.

470
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,120
Making such a special visit to our staff community,

471
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,360
did you fancy some professor

472
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,520
and hope to learn from him?

473
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,320
Mr. Shi, it must be Mr. Shi.

474
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,560
This kid's been talking about economies

475
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,640
since he sat down.

476
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,440
Mrs. Liu.

477
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
Mr. Qin and Mr. Li.

478
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,380
Here you are, Shi Yi.

479
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
You are back, Shi Yi.

480
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,870
My mother thought you had lost your way,

481
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,840
so she sent me downstairs to look for you.

482
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,760
This is?

483
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,840
Zhousheng Chen, my fiance.

484
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,240
We are about to hold our wedding ceremony.

485
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Where do you work?

486
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
Judging from your age,

487
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,080
you must have just graduated with a PhD.

488
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,800
I graduated very early on.

489
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,840
I work in a research institute now.

490
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,200
Sounds good.

491
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,440
We're leaving.

492
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,040
Go ahead.

493
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,600
Go, go.

494
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm leaving.

495
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,040
Okay.

496
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,800
Bye.

497
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,040
Okay, here.

498
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120
Here, here, here, let me challenge you.

499
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,680
Have you had your breakfast?

500
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,200
Yeah.

501
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,240
What did you eat?

502
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,200
McDonalds.

503
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,480
Be specific.

504
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,640
I ate two burgers.

505
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,120
Did you drink milk?

506
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,320
Yeah.

507
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,680
Good.

508
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,080
So, you have been sitting there

509
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,640
since you finished your breakfast?

510
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
On my way back,

511
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,880
I heard them talking about economies.

512
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,640
So I sat down and had a chat with them.

513
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,160
They were having fun

514
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
and said, how about playing Chinese chess?

515
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,560
So I joined them.

516
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
You should go to my father if it's about economies.

517
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
That's his profession.

518
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Isn't that so?

519
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,920
You're right.

520
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,640
I thought

521
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,520
if I intentionally guide the conversation,

522
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,840
they should switch the topic

523
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
to your family

524
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,440
or your father.

525
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
They watched you grow up

526
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
and told me a lot of

527
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,400
interesting stories about you.

528
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,720
Seriously, you and your witty tricks.

529
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,240
Let's take the stairs.

530
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,080
When I was a student,

531
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,120
I used to take the stairs.

532
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,520
You should experience it.

533
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,360
Why did you take the stairs?

534
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,400
I didn't like socializing I think.

535
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,600
The elevator is full of our neighbors

536
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,920
every time I go in there.

537
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,000
What I fear the most

538
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,120
was to say hello

539
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,960
to each and every one of them.

540
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,960
So I had to be mentally prepared

541
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,400
from the moment I went into the community,

542
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
all the way till I made it to my own home.

543
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,560
Are there no surveillance cameras here?

544
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,680
Nope.

545
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,120
Then it's very dangerous

546
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,280
for you to do this.

547
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,240
What if the light

548
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,400
goes out one day?

549
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
Are you not scared?

550
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,320
I think it did go out in the past.

551
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,680
You always look at things

552
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,880
differently.

553
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
I just imagined

554
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,480
what you said just now

555
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,080
and I felt a bit concerned.

556
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,640
Then let me feel touched

557
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,760
for the past me.

558
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,200
I have a secret to tell you.

559
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,840
What is it?

560
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
I used to have a crush on a senior schoolmate.

561
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
He was 2 years older than me.

562
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,040
He was also a straight-A student.

563
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,800
Was he a better student than me?

564
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Not really.

565
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,680
One day, I brought him here

566
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
and wanted to make things clear.

567
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,080
You took the initiative?

568
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah, you know me.

569
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,560
I am pretty straightforward.

570
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
I usually speak my mind.

571
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,080
True. It's also one of your strong points.

572
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,560
Are you jealous?

573
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Why should I be jealous?

574
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
I mean, it's too late to be, isn't it?

575
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,680
Don't you want to know

576
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,120
what I told him?

577
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,920
Were you two a couple?

578
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Didn't you say

579
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,040
I was your first boyfriend?

580
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,840
I am kidding.

581
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,200
You are the first

582
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,280
and only boyfriend I have.

583
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
Senior Zhousheng,

will you please help me

585
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,200
with my math homework?

586
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
No problem.

587
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,600
How about biology and geography?

588
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,640
Sure.

Lin.

614
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,800
Could you check

615
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,200
if it's tilted or not?

616
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,720
Okay.

617
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,400
That will do.

[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

619
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,440
Okay.

620
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,720
That's still tilted.

621
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
That's close, right?

622
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,880
It's the old madam's 90th birthday.

623
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,120
Everything must be perfect.

624
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,040
Only if the job is done right,

625
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,240
will I rest easy.

626
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,040
All right.

627
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,000
Come eat when you're done.

628
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,000
I will be waiting for you.

629
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
All right, you go ahead.

630
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,680
Okay.

631
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,320
Good for you.

632

This little yard is gonna be full of people.

633
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,680
I don't care so much about other people.

634
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,880
As for the other great-uncles and grandparents,

635
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,080
they'd better come here less.

636
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,920
I just want to watch my own great-uncle and his wife

638
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,320
behind the closed door.

639
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,720
Every time when I see them

640
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,600
sitting on the couch without saying a word,

641
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,640
all I can feel

642
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,400
is a sense of joy.

643
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,800
The mere thought of someone coming inside

644
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,640
makes me want to

645
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,920
kick them out.

646
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,480
Why are you sitting here alone?

647
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,320
Isn't it cold?

648
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,880
It's okay, I got the cushion.

649
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,200
Brother, come sit.

650
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
This is the mooncake I made.

651
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,720

652
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,760
Is it good?

653
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,800
Yeah.

654
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,280
Not good enough.

655
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,440
I will make some more tomorrow.

656
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,080
It's not the Mid-Autumn Festival yet.

657
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,160
Why didn't you tell us

658
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,960
that you were coming?

659
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,040
I could have worn something more formal.

660
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Do you know who she is?

661
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,320
Of course, I do.

662
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,680
From now on,

663
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,640
when I see Mr. Zhousheng,

664
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,240
I don't have to be that overcautious.

665
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,040
The biggest shareholder has been replaced.

666
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,200
Yes, from now on, I am the guest

667
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,440
and she is the hostess.

668
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,600
Here, here, here.

669
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,040
Let me show you around.

670
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,120
Everything here is yours.

671
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,200
You can come here as often as you want.

672
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,920
No need to ask anyone for permission.

673
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,120
Come, come.

674
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,800
This way, please.

675
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,480
The business here

676
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,560
has been doing pretty well over the years.

677
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,200
Do you know

678
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
the name of this room?

679
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,600
It's called a drying room.

680
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:24,920
When I was a kid,

681
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,560
my grandfather gave me one Guqin,

682
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,400
which was said to be from someone famous.

683
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,920
The manufacturing process takes two years,

684
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,320
one of which

685
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,760
is spent to dry in a room.

686
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,040
Like these ones here,

687
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,840
waiting to see the outside world.

688
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,960
Now that I think about it,

689
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,600
our ancestors

690
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,880
have left us many things

691
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,760
and it seems that all of them

692
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
went through such a process.

693
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,520
Not just for the people, but the stuff as well.

694
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,320
We have to endure loneliness

695
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,600
and hardship

696
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,700
until we finally achieve greatness.

697
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,920
Miss Shi sure can

698
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,240
give good lessons.

699
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,330
Come on.

700
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
They were joking around just now,

701
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
or were they serious?

702
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,400
What do you mean?

703
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,480
How many shares did you actually give me?

704
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,440
I have given you

705
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,720
all my shares.

706
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,680
All of them?

707
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,280
This is my parents' wish.

708
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,080
My father said that my mother passed away early

709
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,840
and she wouldn't see her future daughter-in-law.

710
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,400
So they specifically left this

711
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
as a gift.

712
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,120
So just take it as

713
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,320
a welcome gift

714
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,520
for their future daughter-in-law.

715
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,680
Thank you, my parents-in-law

716
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,240
for granting me great fortunes.

717
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,960
Your parents gave it to me,

718
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,720
so this is my asset now?

719
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,160
Yeah, yours.

720
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,200
What about the house in Shanghai?

721
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,120
The house in Shanghai

722
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,320
is also something my father

723
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,000
left for his future daughter-in-law.

724
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,000
They all belong to me?

725
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
They all belong to you.

726
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Here is the tricky part.

727
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,920
What if one day, I don't want to be with you anymore

728
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,240
and drive you out of my house and deprive you of everything you once owned?

729
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,120
What will you do?

730
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,580
Oh, yeah.

731
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,360
Good news is I have a skill to depend on

732
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,000
and make myself a living.

733
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,480
As for accommodation,

734
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,360
I can only go live

735
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,440
at the institute's dormitory.

736
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,480
You little poor thing.

737
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,800
Then you must listen to me.

738
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Mr. Zhousheng, how are you?

739
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
I heard from Mr. Zhao

740
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,280
that your wife is here,

741
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,480
so I came here to say hello to her.

742
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Nice to meet you.

743
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,120
Nice to meet you, too.

744
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,920
Are we back in production?

745
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,080
Yeah.

746
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,040
From now on,

747
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,640
we will be the pioneers among the environment friendly companies.

748
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,320
I have learnt my lesson now.

749
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,000
This is the boss from the dying factory.

750
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,040
This is my wife, Shi Yi.

751
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,640
All the shares my father used to own

752
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,520
are now under her name.

753
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
Our biggest shareholder.

754
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,240
How are you?

755
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,320
Today, the three of us

756
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,680
came here to see our biggest shareholder.

757
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,960
I am afraid someone might

758
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,160
gossip behind our backs,

759
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,000
saying we are meeting the biggest shareholder in private

760
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,320
without taking them with us.

761
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,320
How happy would your parents be

762
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,400
if they saw

763
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
how you are right now.

764
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,800
His parents

765
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,080
were really kind-hearted.

766
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,880
Chen's mother

767
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,639
received compliments from almost everyone.

768
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,000
And Chen's father

769
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:06,679
was polite to almost everyone.

770
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,040
He is a real gentleman.

771
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,400
I had never seen him get mad at anyone.

772
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,639
Like last time,

773
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,199
in that ancestral hall, right?

774
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,040
No need to bring that up.

775
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,480
It's all in the past.

776
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,400
It's all in the past.

777
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,440
He's like his father since he was a kid.

778
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,639
They're very alike.

779
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,320
Yeah.

780
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,920
You have an eye for men.

781
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
Yeah, that's right.

782
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah, I have a special eye for men.

783
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,040
You really do.

784
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,639
The workshops and factories

785
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,239
are in different places.

786
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
I will show them to you

787
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,280
when I am available.

788
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,080
Why did we suddenly come here today?

789
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,520
It's like

790
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,320
completing the last step of the ritual.

791
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,960
I had to personally hand down to you

792
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,360
the wedding gifts

793
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,640
my parents prepared for you.

794
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,280
The man just now said that

795
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
your father got angry in the ancestral hall.

796
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
Why is that?

797
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
They didn't agree to move

798
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,480
my mother's spirit tablet into the hall.

799
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,800
So my father

800
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,040
had a big fight with them

801
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,280
and swore from then on,

802
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,680
he would never kneel down before the ancestors.

803
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,640
So he never did it ever since?

804
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,640
What about you?

805
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Same.

806
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,120
They are all my

807
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,320
uncles and aunties.

808
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,840
Nice to meet you all.

809
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
You go upstairs first,

810
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,440
I need to talk to them about something.

811
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,810
You asked for me?

812
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,140
Will you go to the ancestral hall of Zhou family with me?

813
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,070
To have a meal?

814
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,820
By now,

815
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,160
they should have finished their lunch.

816
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,680
How about having it at home

817
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,600
and then go over there?

818
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
We haven't seen each other for a long time,

819
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,120
even if he had finished his meal,

820
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,720
he would love to have another one with me.

821
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,720
Please have some tea, Great-uncle's wife.

822
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,360
You don't have to call me that.

823
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,680
Mrs. Zhou told me

824
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,920
that seniority in the family can't be confused.

825
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,960
She also told us to take good care of you.

826
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,040
I was afraid

827
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,440
you wouldn't come back.

828
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,160
Why?

829
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,680
Because last time...

830
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,680
Never mind, forget it.

831
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,680
I've prepared for you

832
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,280
new bed sheet, new bed cover.

833
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,280
Everything is brand new.

834
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,040
Are you happy with that?

835
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,400
Yeah.

836
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
Chen's uncles and aunties

837
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,880
came to visit Mrs. Zhou before.

838
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,160
But judging from today's situation,

839
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,960
soon, everything concerning Zhou family,

840
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,240
like the clan, the ancestral hall

841
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,120
and everything

842
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,920
she's responsible for

843
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,320
will be handed over to you.

844
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,160
Really?

845
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,360
That's for sure.

846
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,480
There's no hiding from it.

847
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,880
Oh, yeah.

848
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
What is that?

849
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,640
Before you came,

850
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,080
Great-uncle specially asked me to prepare this.

851
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,280
It's Qielan incense.

852
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,480
Enjoy your break, Great-uncle's wife.

853
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,920
Call me if you need anything.

854
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,280
They are all gone?

855
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,280
Yeah.

856
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
I never knew you were interested in that.

857
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,120
Why are you suddenly interested in that?

858
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,080
I asked some TCM doctors and

859
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
they said this fragrance

860
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,040
has the function of refreshing one's mind.

861
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,880
If you are available,

862
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,840
will you come with me

863
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,240
to visit Grandmother?

864
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,960
My mother said,

865
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,240
Grandmother kept herself in the yard

866
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
and wouldn't come out.

867
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,760
Other people couldn't do anything about it.

868
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,440
If we both went there,

869
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,280
the problem might be solved.

870
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,400
Okay.

871
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Let me reapply my makeup.

872
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,800
How long will you need?

873
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
15 minutes?

874
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
15 minutes.

875
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
All right, I will go write the wedding invitation.

876
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,680
Go take a break.

877
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,320
Apart from eating, sleeping

878
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,080
and going to the laboratory,

879
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,480
you have been writing them in your spare time these days.

880
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,240
I've been busy lately,

881
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,040
which disrupted my schedule.

882
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,720
I can only do this

883
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,680
whenever I have some free time.

884
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
How about I help you?

885
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,160
My handwriting is not bad.

886
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,000
Let me deal with it.

887
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,600
All right, I'll leave it to you.

888
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,320
Why are you being so petty?

889
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,240
It's the invitation for my own wedding,

890
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,280
why can't I have a look?

891
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,200
It's not time yet.

892
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,840
You still have 13 minutes.

893
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,640
In fact,

894
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,800
I wrote you something as well.

895
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,480
What is it?

896
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,920
It's not time yet for you to see it.

897
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,380
You have only 12 minutes left.

898
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,480
Try to persuade her.

899
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,820
She is like a child. I am helpless.

900
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,360
I will go pack up

901
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,920
the clothes she will be wearing these two days.

902
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,280
Grandmother.

903
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
Chen.

904
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,000
You're here.

905
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,240
She forgot about me again.

906
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,110
Shi Yi.

907
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,840
Grandmother.

908
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,030
Where's the kid?

909
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,320
My great-grandson. Did you not bring him with you?

910
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,790
Your great-grandson.

911
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,480
Your great-grandson.

912
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,810
He's doing homework right now.

913
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,920
He's only three years old, what kind of homework is he doing?

914
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,470
He loves to do homework.

915
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,240
If he likes it...

916
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,800
Having interest is the most important thing.

917
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,920
Good, good, good.

918
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,760
Come over here.

919
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,960
Do you want to have another kid?

920
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,000
Do we want to have another kid?

921
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,800
Yeah.

922
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,560
It's up to her.

923
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,680
Do you want to have another kid?

924
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,280
Yeah, of course.

925
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,000
Did you hear that?

926
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,310
Did you hear that?

927
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,010
Yes, I did.

928
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,340
You gotta work hard.

929
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,280
Work harder.

930
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,560
Yeah, I will.

931
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,840
Grandmother.

932
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,590
How about going back to the house tonight

933
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,920
and have dinner with us?

934
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,040
No.

935
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,960
That's troublesome.

936
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,890
There are too many people there.

937
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,080
I get annoyed just looking at them.

938
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,070
But I miss you.

939
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,170
We finally

940
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:22,830
came back home.

941
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,030
Partly for the Mid-Autumn Festival,

942
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,210
partly for you.

943
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,680
Will you please

944
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,080
go there for our sake?

945
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
Okay, okay.

946
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,280
Let's get ready then.

947
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,320
All right.

948
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,240
Is your kid in kindergarten?

949
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,820
Yes, he is.

950
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,710
Watch your step.
