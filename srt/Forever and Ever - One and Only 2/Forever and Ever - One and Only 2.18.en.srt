[Episode 18]

4
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,020
What are you doing?

5
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,100
The things you said just now.

6
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,900
Who gave them to you?

7
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,539
Zhousheng Chen's cousin.

8
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,900
What's going on between you

9
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,820
and Chen?

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,340
He sneaked in for a night?

11
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,780
We got our marriage certificate.

12
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,000
Shh.

13
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,500
You two are pretty gutsy.

14
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,820
Obtaining your marriage certificate in secret.

15
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,419
There's a reason for that.

16
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,660
Did you tell your mother?

17
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,180
He just got back.

18
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,940
We plan to tell them in a couple of days.

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,780
My dad called your dad

20
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,340
several days ago.

21
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,900
He was telling your dad that the two of you should break up.

22
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,220
He said Zhousheng Chen's family

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,660
didn't accept you as his girlfriend.

24
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,660
So you'll have a hard time over at their family.

25
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,260
Your parents...

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,940
Your parents even told my dad

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,180
they still can't let go the fact that

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,460
his parents didn't want to meet up.

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,220
Now you've even got your certificate

30
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,820
but his mother still refuses to see you.

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,420
Your parents will definitely become furious.

32
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,460
That's why

33
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,060
I don't know how to tell them.

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,060
What about Zhousheng Chen?

35
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,900
We haven't really talked about it.

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,400
Let's not talk about this.

37
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,260
I'll cook for you guys.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,110
Good morning, sir.

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,220
Good morning, sir.

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,060
Good morning.

41
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
-Professor Zhousheng.
-Let's go.

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,420
Director.

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,820
Let me introduce you.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,180
He is the person

45
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:10,660
in charge of our

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,300
key laboratory,

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,579
Professor Zhousheng Chen.

48
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,660
This is

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,100
Professor Zhang

50
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,780
from Department of Chemistry, Zhenghua University.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,700
Professor Zhang.

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,180
How do you do?

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,579
This is Professor Jin.

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,380
Professor Jin.

55
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,020
How do you do?

56
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,260
By the way,

57
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,260
your school has hired him before, right?

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,820
Yes, I remember.

59
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,300
He was a visiting professor.

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,340
Mr. Zhousheng is young and talented.

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,900
You're about 25 or 26 years old?

62
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm already 28.

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,780
I must say.

64
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,340
He's changed since he came back.

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,860
He's getting younger and younger.

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,579
This is the style my wife likes.

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,220
That's good.

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,100
A man who values his family

69
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,460
must have a strong sense of responsibility.

70
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,820
Would you mind showing us

71
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,260
your lab?

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,740
Please come in.

73
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,420
Okay.

74
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,140
Are you interested in

75
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,899
a collaborative lab

76
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,300
with our institute?

77
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:10,899
I don't have the energy anymore.

78
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,140
In fact, these two

79
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,060
have always been

80
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,020
in charge of the lab here.

81
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm already working on

82
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,420
a new lab.

83
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,740
Li.

84
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,860
It seems that you can't retain talents.

85
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,300
Professor Jin.

86
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,659
No matter what you say,

87
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,580
I've convinced him to

88
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,980
set up a lab here.

89
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,860
And you?

90
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,300
You didn't even have a chance

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,220
to convince him.

92
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,020
I can't compete with you

93
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,500
in talent grabbing.

94
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,100
Where is your new lab?

95
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,500
In Xi'an.

96
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,740
Xi'an?

97
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,140
I tried my best to make him stay.

98
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,460
But he's determined to go to Xi'an.

99
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,900
Why? Are your parents there?

100
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,900
I'm interested in the project they are doing.

101
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,020
Besides, my wife likes it there.

102
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,540
This way.

103
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:53,980
Okay.

104
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,820
Everything is the same.

105
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,340
Nothing has changed.

106
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,300
The last time we met,

107
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,260
your eldest brother was here.

108
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,700
All these years, you ran the Zhou family.

109
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
It's been hard work.

110
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,740
Now it's all good.

111
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,540
Chen is now in charge of

112
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,980
all the business.

113
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,580
The son takes over the business from his father.

114
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,340
As for me, I can enjoy my retirement.

115
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,300
I wonder if

116
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,220
Mei Xing has

117
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,260
a girlfriend to get married with?

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Not yet.

119
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,240
I have no plans for the time being.

120
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,620
Wenxing

121
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,780
lived with your family for two years

122
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,260
when she was little.

123
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,780
She has a deeper bond with your family

124
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,420
than with her two brothers.

125
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,460
Every time you come here,

126
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,180
she would always greet you at the door

127
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,620
without fail.

128
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,300
I mean,

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,940
if neither of them

130
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,540
has a suitable match,

131
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,620
why not let them

132
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,260
spend some time together?

133
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,220
Mom.

134
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,860
You should have asked me first.

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm asking you now.

136
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,140
But you misunderstood.

137
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,540
How embarrassing it is for us

138
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,740
to say it in front of us.

139
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,390
It seems that Mei Xing

140
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,580
still has a long way to go

141
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,000
in terms of dating people.

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,060
You see?

143
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,420
Even the person who grew up with you

144
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,140
doesn't dare to marry you.

145
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,060
Uncle Mei.

146
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,020
That's not what I meant.

147
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,740
It's okay.

148
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,380
Yes, Dad.

149
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,980
You're right.

150
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,260
Wenxing is too good.

151
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,380
I don't deserve her.

152
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,700
I've always hoped that

153
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,100
she could meet someone she really likes,

154
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,280
someone who treats her right,

155
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,260
keeps her company and takes care of her.

156
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,180
I really had no idea my mother and uncle

157
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,660
would suddenly bring this up.

158
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,020
Sorry for what?

160
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,340
I'm a big man.

161
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,260
I have thick skin.

162
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
You guys are leaving now?

163
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,980
Yes.

164
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,900
The thing you mentioned earlier...

165
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,380
Stay for dinner.

166
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,060
No.

167
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,820
It's too much trouble to eat at your house.

168
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,100
You have a big family.

169
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,820
We're going home.

170
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,500
It's more relaxing

171
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,420
to eat with my disciples.

172
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,220
Stay.

173
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,140
I'll have the chefs

174
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,659
make your favorite food.

175
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,180
I've gotta go.

176
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:44,990
I have something to do.

177
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,410
Is that him?

178
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,940
It's not him.

179
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,100
If it's him,

180
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,100
I've just estimated

181
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,660
his measurements.

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,340
If you want me to make a suit for him, you can tell me anytime.

183
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,500
There is one thing.

184
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,620
I have a packed schedule.

185
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,500
I can allow you to skip the queue,

186
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,260
but you need to tell me at least three months in advance.

187
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,940
It's not him. Don't make any guesses.

188
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
It's not him?

189
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,260
It's not?

190
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,180
Can you stop looking?

191
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,500
Where's your eldest brother?

192
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,380
In Shanghai I think.

193
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,740
Shi Yi is there.

194
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,179
He must be with her.

195
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,059
He's not staying here?

196
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,860
My mother doesn't like Shi Yi.

197
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,150
She won't even let us

198
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,460
call Shi Yi sister-in-law in front of her.

199
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,220
Chen must not want her to come back

200
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,600
in case she'll suffer.

201
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,820
Why did you come so early?

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,220
I only realized

203
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,060
you were wearing slippers after you left.

204
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,050
When did you change them?

205
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,860
At the lab?

206
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,020
I bought them today.

207
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,380
My parents asked us

208
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,390
to come home for dinner.

209
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,940
Dinner?

210
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,500
Are your grandparents still home?

211
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,460
Yes.

212
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,380
Yuanyuan insisted on eating the dinner I cooked.

213
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,660
And my parents asked me to come over.

214
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,940
I had no choice but to make it first.

215
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,260
Let them heat it up tonight.

216
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,220
Before dinner,

217
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,780
go somewhere with me first.

218
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,220
Wait for me in the study.

219
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,380
[Happiness]

220
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,820
[Happiness]

221
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,740
We can go now.

222
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,620
Grandma made this.

223
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,900
I put it up to see how it looks.

224
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,020
Don't look, we're going to be late.

225
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,660
Let's go.

226
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,380
Should we come up with something to say

227
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,460
ahead of time?

228
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,860
So that we don't say the wrong things.

229
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,820
Actually, I don't know

230
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
what to say either.

231
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,100
My earlier plan was to

232
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,380
tell it to them directly.

233
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,420
Then excuse ourselves

234
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,940
so that you won't get beat up by my parents.

235
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,500
Ah.

236
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,620
I have another idea.

237
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,100
I haven't told you

238
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,340
because I was afraid you would mind.

239
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,220
I won't mind whatever it is.

240
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,380
I haven't said it yet

241
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,340
but you're already so agreeable?

242
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,620
You don't have any principles.

243
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,180
I'm thinking

244
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,220
we don't mention us getting the marriage certificate

245
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,860
before our families officially meet.

246
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,580
That means you'll have to bear with

247
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,540
being called my boyfriend

248
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,820
in front of my family.

249
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,620
When your relationship with your family

250
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,420
gets better

251
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,660
and we've set a date for our wedding,

252
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,020
then we'll tell my parents.

253
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,740
This is a step-by-step process.

254
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,580
So it may be easier for

255
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,260
my parents to accept it.

256
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,260
The only thing is that it won't be fair to you.

257
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,140
It's like I don't want to admit

258
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,740
our legal relationship.

259
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Luckily.

260
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,700
Luckily, I've got the protection of the law.

261
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,220
Don't worry.

262
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,300
You have half

263
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,500
of everything I have.

264
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,780
I won't do you dirty.

265
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,780
You'd better keep the promise.

266
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:37,420
Oh, right.

267
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,820
We wouldn't want to give the game away.

268
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:45,820
Let's go.

269
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,480
Shi Yi.

270
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,140
He's made his stand.

271
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,660
Regardless of his family's attitude,

272
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,900
he wants to be with me.

273
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
I agreed.

274
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,120
It's useless for him to make a stand

275
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,860
After all,

276
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,460
they are his family members.

277
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,220
You must face them.

278
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,780
You can't hide from it.

279
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,300
He'll take care of it.

280
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,620
It seems you've made up your mind.

281
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,820
If I hadn't thought Chen

282
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,060
is honest and reliable,

283
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,820
I would have...

284
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,620
He is honest and reliable.

285
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,540
I'm telling you,

286
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,420
love

287
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,500
isn't everything.

288
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,380
You must have legal protection.

289
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,180
I'm warning you, you two shouldn't

290
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
live together too soon.

291
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,500
Forget I ever said that.

292
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,780
Anyway, the way

293
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,540
you young people think

294
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,460
is completely different

295
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,020
from our generation.

296
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
Don't worry, Mom.

297
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,860
I will only be with him

298
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,180
for the rest of my life.

299
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,100
I won't be with someone else.

300
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,820
The rest of your life is a long time.

301
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,780
How is he treating you?

302
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,220
Pretty good.

303
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,060
You have to be more specific.

304
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,740
I'll have you know.

305
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,860
Your mother has been there before.

306
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,100
To judge

307
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,700
if a man is devoted to you,

308
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,300
you mainly have to look at the details.

309
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,460
Details...

310
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,580
He didn't like to call before.

311
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
After he met me,

312
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,940
he would talk about what he did

313
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,540
and who he met that day on the phone

314
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,460
strictly in accordance with my requirements

315
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,580
every day.

316
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,380
He is patient

317
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,660
with me.

318
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,340
As long as I ask for something,

319
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,500
he never refutes it.

320
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,780
He tries to learn.

321
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,980
And

322
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,180
since we met,

323
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,100
he has never been angry with me.

324
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,020
He has never been stern with me either.

325
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,140
When he's not happy,

326
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,500
he would stay away,

327
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,940
afraid he'll affect my mood.

328
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,140
The sound insulation at our house

329
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,540
is poor.

330
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,260
They don't know this.

331
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,500
But I know they always

332
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,300
have their girl talk over there.

333
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,940
And

334
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,780
I can feel

335
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,220
he has never had a girlfriend.

336
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,860
So far in the relationship,

337
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,780
I've basically been the one to initiate stuff.

338
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,740
He's always been well-behaved.

339
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,180
You lose, right?

340
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,260
Good game.

341
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,180
We should cook.

342
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Uncle, let me help you.

343
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,700
Okay, okay.

344
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,940
Wash the vegetables.

345
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,020
Over there, wash it.

346
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,740
-Okay.
-Okay.

347
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,460
You shouldn't be doing this.

348
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,620
I'll do it.

349
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,820
It's okay. I'll do it.

350

353
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,460
We should go.

354

We're going, Auntie.

363
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,980
Did you see that?

364
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,700
Your daughter has always looked like

365
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,260
she doesn't care about anything

366
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,500
since her childhood.

367
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,660
But now she's

368
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,260
getting serious about this lad.

369
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,860
You can tell?

370
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,990
She's my daughter.

371
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,420
How can I not know her?

372
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,180
Did you notice?

373
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,300
She took his hand

374
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,740
when they were leaving.

375
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,620
She's telling us

376
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,820
she chose him.

377
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,180
She likes him very much.

378
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,220
And that we shouldn't treat him badly in the future.

379
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,460
She got that from you, isn't it?

380
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,580
You always bully me.

381
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,060
When have I ever bullied you?

382
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,620
You tell me.

383
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,580
When have I ever done that?

384
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,020
Go mop the floor now.

385
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,180
Okay, okay, I'll mop the floor.

386
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,940
What's wrong?

387
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,580
It's rare

388
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,140
to see you so active

389
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,020
in front of your parents.

390
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,380
We're at my place,

391
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,140
of course I have to protect you.

392
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,540
I heard you call my mother auntie.

393
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,900
Then my brain immediately

394
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,540
thought about what it would be like if you called her Mom in the future.

395
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,460
Then I thought about going to your home.

396
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,460
And I wondered how to face your mother.

397
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,540
What do you think I should call her?

398
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,420
Auntie or Mom?

399
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,620
What do you usually call her at home?

400
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,140
I don't

401
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,100
see her much

402
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,580
because she's not my biological mother.

403
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,180
Ren and I call her Mother.

404
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,740
Wenchuan and Wenxing

405
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,420
call her Mom more often.

406
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,660
I feel that you and Wenchuan

407
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,500
are not very close with each other.

408
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,330
It's true that we don't know each other very well.

409
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,670
Actually, when we were little,

410
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,620
we lived

411
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
separately.

412
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,620
I lived at my grandmother's home.

413
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,220
Wenchuan and Ren

414
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,540
were raised by their nanny.

415
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,040
Then maybe from this year?

416
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,450
Since this year,

417
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,140
Wenchuan and I,

418
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,260
we've gotten a little bit closer.

419
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,790
What about Wenxing?

420
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,410
When Wenxing was little,

421
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,670
she wasn't very good at her homework.

422
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,360
So she would often

423
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,160
go to grandmother's house to ask me for tutoring.

424
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,050
But that was all an excuse.

425
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,460
She probably

426
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,820
felt bored in the yard.

427
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,650
So she always wanted to find an excuse to go out.

428
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,950
Asking me for tutoring

429
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,620
was the best excuse she could come up with.

430
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,300
Sorry, sorry.

431
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,100
It's okay.

432
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,840
I'm not afraid of dogs.

433
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,900
I'm afraid.

434
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,900
I'm afraid it might bite you.

435
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,660
Ever since I was little, cats and dogs would become restless

436
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,660
when they see me.

437
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,780
I've gotten used to it.

438
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,860
Why is that?

439
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,900
A fortune teller told my mother

440
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,980
that I shouldn't have been born.

441
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,900
That's why it happens.

442
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,580
I'm kidding.

443
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,420
Let's go.

444
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,180
In the next few months,

445
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,860
I may have to travel back and forth.

446
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,420
My work schedule has been packed recently.

447
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,060
I can only go back with you on weekends.

You don't have to go back with me.

I can go back by myself.

450
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,220
Going back and forth between the two places

451
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
is very energy consuming.

452
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,800
We only need to go back to Zhenjiang

453
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,040
on big occasions.

454
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,060
The rest of the time,

455
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,360
I will go back and forth between the two places.

456

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,830
If it's an accident, why did you get someone to investigate it?

519
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,310
I'm paranoid.

520
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,560
You know that.

521
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,600
Why are you here?

522
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,290
I saw that you didn't come for breakfast this morning.

523
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,540
So I brought it to you.

524
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,360
Not many people can get up

525
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,040
at your family's breakfast time.

526
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,690
Isn't there tea and pastry at 10?

527
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,120
That suits me better.

528
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,280
I have to meet some elders with your eldest brother

529
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,120
in the morning.

530
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,460
I have a lot of things to do before that.

531
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,080
If you've nothing else you want,

532
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,700
I'll see you this afternoon?

533
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,030
Okay.

534
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,880
Is what happened in Bremen

535
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,680
an accident?

536
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,250
Of course it was an accident.

537
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,440
You saw

538
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,260
the reply from the local police.

539
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,060
And it went on the news the next day.

540
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
It was a dispute.

541
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,440
Uncle Chen.

542
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,960
You are finally willing to come back?

543
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,420
I don't even know how to answer

544
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,000
your grandma's questions anymore.

545
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,680
What did she ask?

546
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,720
She said

547
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,460
"How long have they been married?"

548
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,480
"Is it about a year?"

549
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,030
I said it hasn't been a year.

550
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,160
It's only been a few months.

551
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,980
Then she stopped talking.

552
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,700
Muttering to herself.

553
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,080
I think she wants to have a great-grandchild.

554
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,880
Uncle Mei.

555
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,320
Chen.

556
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,100
Your father's old friends

557
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,210
have all come back

558
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,800
to help you.

559
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,530
It's hard for a man to succeed alone.

560
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,360
You need friends to help you.

561
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,530
Whether we, your father's old friends,

562
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,060
are important or not?

563
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,950
Your uncles

564
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,760
know clearly about that.

565
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,680
Get inside.

566
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,580
Don't make your uncles and aunts

567
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,460
wait for too long.

568
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay.

569
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,240
My nephew is back.

570
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Chen's back.

571
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,280
Let's sit down.

572
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,680
-Good.
-Good, good

573
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,100
Chen.

574
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,300
The family business seems to have been given to you.

575
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,260
But our family is old-fashioned.

576
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,860
We value family members

577
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,140
and ceremony.

578
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,620
Your wedding

579
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,820
must be held.

580
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,020
That's right.

581
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,620
So that the relatives coming from near and far

582
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,140
can meet your wife.

583
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,020
Okay.

584
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,020
I will definitely

585
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,980
make the wedding happen

586
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,060
within this year.

587
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,620
Good!

588
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:38,980
That's good.

589
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,700
That's great.

590
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,460
We'll be waiting for

591
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,660
your wedding banquet.

592
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,260
Yes, we are waiting for this day.

593
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,060
We'll definitely come over

594
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,260
at that time.

595
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,860
That's right.

596
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,660
Miss Shi.

597
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,140
Are you sick?

598
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,100
I've got a cold.

599
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,020
That's why I'm wearing a mask.

600
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,180
It's like this.

601
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,580
My superiors told us to

602
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,580
guard this first door.

603
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,340
So we have to know the residents

604
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,940
of every household.

605
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
The Miss Hong at your place,

606
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,060
did she move out?

607
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,420
Yes, she did.

608
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,560
In this case,

609
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,820
you're the only one in your house now?

610
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,280
I saw a gentleman yesterday...

611
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,980
My husband.

612
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,590
We just got married.

613
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,930
So he moved in with me recently.

614
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,780
I thought...

615
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,540
I thought

616
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,580
celebrities like you

617
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,380
don't tell people about

618
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,500
your private lives.

619
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,060
I'm not really a celebrity.

620
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,500
You were on TV wearing a long gown

621
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,380
and even got an award.

622
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,820
Is that not considered a celebrity?

623
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm merely working behind the scenes.

624
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,340
You're too modest.

625
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,220
[Security guard]

626
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,620
I have nothing else to ask.

627
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,660
I'll register him.

628
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,340
This way we won't have to

629
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,420
keep an eye on him anymore

630
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,980
on duty

631
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,980
when he's in and out.

632
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,660
Thank you.

633
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,620
Okay. Bye.

634
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,100
I'll go now.

635
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:57,860
Okay.

636
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,540
He's so lucky.

637
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,620
Now that they're married,

638
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,300
why is he living in the woman's house?

639
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,620
This guy seems honest.

640
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:07,620
He shouldn't be like this.

641
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,139
You can't judge a man by his appearance.

642
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,179
It's hard to say.

643
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,739
Li!

644
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,460
When I'm done watering here,

645
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,900
please register it for me.

646
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,139
Okay.

647
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,179
What were you

648
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
muttering about?

649
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,540
Nothing.

650
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,699
I know that girl.

651
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,300
She's pretty, has a good job

652
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,540
and recently got married.

653
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,500
But her husband lives in her apartment.

654
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,980
I'm afraid she'll be cheated.

655
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,980
I've seen a lot of people like that.

656
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,460
Bad boys of the lower class

657
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,420
look bad.

658
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,380
But the wicked ones

659
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,980
are of high class.

660
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,820
This kind of man

661
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,940
seems to be honest.

662
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,699
Most of them pretend it.

663
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,940
Girls today are so independent.

664
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,140
They can earn money.

665
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,540
They have their own opinions.

666
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,900
Most of them

667
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,860
want to find a man who stays at home

668
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,500
and can live a good life.

669
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,820
Ladies should beware of fake honest guys.

670
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,340
In my opinion,

671
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,300
false honest guys are worse than true playboys.

672
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,620
Playboys go after beautiful women.

673
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,860
But fake honest men

674
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,220
want your beauty and money.

675
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,580
They're greedy.

676
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,900
Let me tell you.

677
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,500
You must talk to that girl.

678
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,140
I'm sorry.

679
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,140
You must tell her

680
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
to be careful

681
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,780
and don't be fooled.

682
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,060
Okay.

683
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,340
What I said

684
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,940
is all good advice.

685
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,260
If she doesn't listen to me,

686
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,140
Okay, take your time watering.

687
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,260
I'll go register it.

688
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,060
she'll have a hard time later on.

689
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,860
We've all been there.

690
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,820
Grandma, I'm divorced.

691
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,220
I want to marry Man.

692
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,660
I know

693
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,060
I'm a nobody now

694
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,180
in my own home.

695
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,180
I'm not the eldest son,

696
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,700
and even got divorced.

697
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,540
I'm sure you don't think I'm the best candidate

698
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,260
to be your granddaughter's husband.

699
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,820
But today,

700
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
I kneel before you

701
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,220
to beg you.

702
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,820
I hope you say yes

703
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,230
to grant me and Man

704
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,770
a chance to start over.

705
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,180
Your grandmother and I

706
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,140
have watched the three of you

707
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,220
grow up.

708
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,140
I never thought

709
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,980
things would turn out this way.

710
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,340
I really don't know what to say.

711
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,940
I'm getting older.

712
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,220
I don't like it

713
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,300
when people get down on their knees and talk to me.

714
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Get up.

715
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,540
Granny wants you to get up.

716
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,100
Just do it.

717
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,020
As her eldest brother, let me ask you this.

718
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,620
You are divorced now.

719
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,620
What is Tong Jiaren

720
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,260
to your family now?

721
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,590
We have signed the agreement

722
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,490
and gone through the formalities.

723
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,590
But for the sake of the two families,

724
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,140
we have to wait for a year

725
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,190
to give a good explanation.

726
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,340
The hardest person to deal with in your family

727
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,180
is your mother.

728
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,220
Don't just try to

729
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,340
get a yes from our family

730
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,700
while you keep it from your family.

731
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,340
We only have one sister in our family.

732
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,820
She's very precious.

733
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,220
We won't let her suffer.

734
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,300
I've already told her.

735
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,620
I've told her everything.

736
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,900
You're still not meant to be

737
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,700
my daughter-in-law.

738
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,180
When are you going back to Bremen?

739
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,780
I'm not going back there.

740
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,820
Isn't your job over there?

741
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,380
Mom.

742
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,900
I've already made a deal

743
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,420
with a university in Beijing.

744
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,820
I'm going to Beijing in the winter.

745
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,660
Why not in Shanghai?

746
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,980
It's closer to home.

747
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,740
It suits me better there.

748
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,460
But I will stay in Zhenjiang during fall

749
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
to keep you company.

750
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,560
How long did it take Shi Yi

751
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,780
to come up with the pair of phrases that day?

752
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,940
Within seconds.

753
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,650
Now that you're married,

754
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,740
what do you think of it?

755
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,940
The fact that there's someone with me

756
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,780
when I wake up in the middle of the night.

757
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,140
What kind of answer is that?

758
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,220
Every married person

759
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,660
would have someone beside them.

760
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,820
It's not quite what I imagined.

761
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,710
What are you laughing at?

762
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,740
You won't get it.

763
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,380
It's autumn, so it's easy to catch a cold.

764
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,300
Take care of yourself.

765
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,620
Drink your medicine first.

766
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,780
Thank you.

767
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,900
I don't think it has anything to do with the weather.

768
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,460
Then what does it have to do with?

769
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,380
Is it related to your marriage?

770
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,980
Maybe it's true.

771
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,020
Is it because you forgot to cover up

772
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,820
after exercising?

773
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,100
What are you talking about?

774
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,900
No, I think

775
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,380
he always pulls the blanket in his sleep.

776
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,420
But

777
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,300
it feels good too.

778
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,020
I can wake up

779
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,940
in his arms every day.

780
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,780
Do you mean to irritate me?

781
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,420
Oh,

782
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,500
are you not worried

783
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,780
that he goes away for a few days every week?

784
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,420
What's to be worried about?

785
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,980
Erm...

786
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,860
He may have two families or something like that.

787
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,540
You've reported too much social news, haven't you?

788
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,420
It's true.

789
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,020
There are so many cases like this.

790
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,490
They say they're out for business,

791
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,820
but they actually have another family.

792
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,810
There are men like this.

793
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,100
There are also women that do this.

794
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,500
There are also those that are already married pretending to be single.

795
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:43,900
I just got married.

796
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,220
Say something nice.

797
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,940
Of course, there are also those who

798
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,300
keep each other company for decades

799
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,020
and pass away one after the other.

800
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,740
And then?

801
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,740
And then...

802
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,500
There is also someone who lost his partner.

803
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,700
The old man traveled all over the country

804
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
with a photo,

805
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,300
wandering around.

806
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,860
He searched for years.

807
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,220
The news

808
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,340
makes me cry every time I read it.

809
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,740
I hope he can find her soon.

810
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,980
The old man is a man of great love and loyalty.

811
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,820
It's tough for him.

812
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,100
I'm sure he'll find her.

813
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
I'm going to the train station this afternoon

814
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,180
to pick up a colleague.

815
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,460
I won't accompany you.

816
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,700
Will you be okay?

817
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,020
Do you want to go to the hospital?

818
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:34,940
I'm fine.

819
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,460
Call your husband?

820
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,500
It takes him several hours to drive back.

821
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,220
It's too tiring.

822
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,780
I'll finish the medicine and go to sleep.

823
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,380
Just go.

824
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,100
All right.

825
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,700
Text me before you go to bed.

826
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:45,500
I'm leaving.

827
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,660
Bye, bye.
