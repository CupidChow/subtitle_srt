4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,120
It's almost time.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,360
We should go back.

6
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
Give me some more time.

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,160
There's no hurry.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,480
I don't know if I'll get to see

9
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,079
this beautiful scenery in the future.

10
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,240
Don't be silly.

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
You're going to Shanghai for treatment.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,360
When you recover,

13
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
you'll come back.

14
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,560
You should stay in your room.

15
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,120
What are you doing out here?

16
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
I wanted to enjoy the sun.

17
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,680
Have you packed her things?

18
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
Yes.

19
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,480
I've put them in the car.

20
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
It's a long walk from here to the car.

21
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
Being in a wheelchair looks sad,

22
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,480
let me carry you.

23
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,040
All right.

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,280
Here.

25
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,600
Hold me tight.

26
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,760
Hold tight now.

27
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,320
Are you not going with me?

28
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,840
No.

29
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Silly, of course I'll go with you.

30
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,159
I've asked them to make a stew,

31
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:23,920
so you can have it on the way.

32
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,040
I'll go get it. Wait for me.

33
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,280
What's wrong?

34
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Wenxing's illness has suddenly deteriorated.

35
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
She transferred to a hospital in Shanghai today.

36
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Which hospital is she in?

37
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,200
The one you were admitted to last time.

38
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,800
Will she undergo surgery?

39
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
She still have to wait for a compatible donor

40
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
for a heart transplant.

41
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,320
The earliest time would be next month.

42
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Should we

43
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,480
postpone our wedding?

44
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
She has been asking me

45
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,159
and my mother every day

46
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
if she can see us getting married

47
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,560
before her surgery.

48
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
Actually I think

49
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,200
our wedding is just at the right time.

50
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
You don't have to

51
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
give yourself too much pressure.

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,840
Let's go visit her tomorrow.

53
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,480
Long time no see, bride-to-be.

54
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,080
Please sit down, Mrs. Wang.

55
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Okay.

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I heard you became ill.

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
How are you now?

58
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm fine.

59
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,880
Young Master Zhou

60
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
is a bit impatient.

61
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,840
Your wedding is too soon,

62
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,000
which doesn't leave me

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
enough time to work.

64
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,440
That's why

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,360
I only have six gowns here,

66
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
and they are still initial samples.

67
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,640
I think

68
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
I will have to come back another 3 to 4 times.

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,280
Have a look, maybe you'll like one of them.

70
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,360
Next time when you finish the dress,

71
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,240
just tell us in advance,

72
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,480
we'll go over to your place.

73
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,000
No need for that.

74
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,040
You just recovered and should take care.

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
And since Wenxing

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
is in a hospital in Shanghai,

77
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
I get to see you both

78
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
when I come here.

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
Did Wang Man come today?

80
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
She's in Shanghai,

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,840
but

82
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,080
she's pregnant and needs to rest.

83
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,840
Mrs. Wang, have a cup of water.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Thank you.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,120
You two newly-weds must have a lot to talk about

86
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
when she tries out the gowns.

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
I'll give you guys some space then.

88
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,000
Let me help you.

89
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,760
All right.

90
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,000
Have a look at them.

91
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,760
Wang Man is pregnant.

92
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Who's the father?

93
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Zhou Wenchuan.

94
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,640
I don't know much about

95
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,200
what happened

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,320
between Tong Jiaren and Zhou Wenchuan.

97
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
Try on the dresses first.

98
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,920
Grandmother.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,960
Have some water.

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
Thank you.

101
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,520
Mr. Wang.

102
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,160
Thank you.

103
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,000
You'll feel sad

104
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,080
staying in the room all day.

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,159
You should go out more often.

106
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,960
OK, Grandmother.

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,800
I'll go downstairs and take a walk after meal.

108
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,160
Good.

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,800
Wenxing,

110
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I brought something for you.

111
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Sweet green rice balls.

112
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,200
I've been craving for them these days.

113
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,600
Have a taste.

114
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,400
How is it?

115
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,960
It's good!

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
That person you spoke about,

117
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,080
when is his birthday?

118
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Are you almost done?

119
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,800
I've kept my regular customers waiting

120
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,320
to make yours first.

121
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,760
He was born in November, a Scorpio.

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,720
November.

123
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,760
Doctor Lin said we still have to wait.

124
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
I didn't see you just now,

125
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,720
I thought you didn't come today.

126
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
I went to meet the doctor.

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
Wenxing said she wanted to walk Mrs. Wang out

128
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,320
and catch some sunshine.

129
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,120
That should be fine, right?

130
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,280
That's fine.

131
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,080
You guys don't come often,

132
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
go spend time with her.

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
There are still a few reports not out yet.

134
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,800
I'll go ask.

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,400
All right.

136
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,280
Let's go.

137
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,560
Yeah.

138
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,000
My birthday is in lunar September.

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,480
That's soon.

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
I hope I can have my surgery done

141
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
before that.

142
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
Even better if I can make it home before that.

143
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
You will.

144
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,120
Lunar September

145
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
is the month of chrysanthemum, right?

146
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
The alternative names of September and December

147
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
are the easiest to remember.

148
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,120
One is when chrysanthemums bloom,

149
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
called the month of chrysanthemum.

150
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,360
The other is when everything is covered in ice and snow,

151
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
called the month of ice.

152
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,600
When I was little,

153
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,080
I was forced to remember these.

154
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
But now I've forgot all of them.

155
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
You don't have to use them,

156
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,040
it doesn't matter.

157
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,480
But Mei Xing likes these things.

158
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,240
The sentence you wrote about his secondary name,

159
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,920
he remembers it even until now.

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,240
When willow drops its leaves and the lotus fades, the plum is still blossoming.

161
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
He's in his thirties already,

162
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,040
but still single,

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,040
would he be single

164
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
for the rest of his life?

165
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,000
Chen,

166
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,400
how many girlfriends do you think he's had?

167
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
I've never asked him about that,

168
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
how should I know?

169
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,400
Liar.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,960
Your wedding

171
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
has to be big.

172
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
I will definitely attend it.

173
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Definitely.

174
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,000
Take care of yourself first.

175
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,240
When your test report is good,

176
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,640
take the surgery immediately.

177
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,320
It's all right to take the surgery later.

178
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
What if my favorite guy

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,680
is not you any more

180
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
after I get a

181
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,440
new heart?

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
I don't care about that.

183
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,160
All I care about is your health.

184
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,440
Shi Yi,

185
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
how do you stand him?

186
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
He's abnormally rational.

187
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
What can I do? I have to accept that.

188
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,120
Wenxing likes Mei Xing?

189
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,480
I can tell.

190
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,880
You can tell?

191
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
It's actually the most difficult

192
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
to hide your feelings for someone.

193
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
You can easily tell

194
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,160
who a girl has feelings for.

195
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,240
Through her

196
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,840
gaze, behavior,

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,760
and the way she speaks.

198
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,040
So in the past, when a girl likes you,

199
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,240
you just ignored them?

200
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,600
I rejected all of them.

201
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,560
Every single one.

202
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,360
Does Mei Xing like Wenxing?

203
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,960
I don't know.

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,720
You don't know?

205
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,160
We've

206
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,520
never talked about this.

207
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,040
Wenxing is your sister,

208
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,280
you should care for her at least.

209
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,160
The most difficult thing in life

210
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,480
is when both party have feelings for each other.

211
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,440
That wasn't like something

212
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,040
you would say.

213
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,800
Mei Xing said that.

214
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,240
All right. Try it again.

215
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,360
Is it still crooked?

216
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
No.

217
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,160
Then

218
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,400
what shall we do next?

219
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
What do you want to do?

220
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,040
I want...

221
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm hungry.

222
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,720
Then let's go out and eat.

223
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,120
Go out?

224
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,320
The weather report said

225
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
it would rain this evening.

226
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,120
The rain and us having food does not oppose each other.

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes, my hubby is always right.

228
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,240
Let's tidy this up.

229
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,800
You scared me.

230
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Why aren't you asleep?

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,880
I couldn't sleep, so I'm watching a movie.

232
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
Horror movies are not for you.

233
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,080
Have you taken your medicine?

234
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,320
Try to sleep then.

235
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,720
You stink of alcohol.

236
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,120
Wait.

237
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,480
It's cold outside.

238
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,800
Don't you feel cold wearing that?

239
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,280
No.

240
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
It's be around ten degrees these couple of days.

241
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,240
This will be just right.

242
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,400
I don't wear suits to the institute.

243
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,520
Why?

244
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,880
It's too formal.

245
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,040
But I think

246
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,760
you look good in suits.

247
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:47,620
[Stay Simple and Humble]

248
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,880
Oh yes, my mother asked me

249
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,400
the exact date of our wedding.

250
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
She wanted to inform our relatives.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
I told her we hadn't decided yet.

252
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
But we have.

253
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
I thought about it all night,

254
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,920
and I still think that

255
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,440
we should postpone our wedding until Wenxing's surgery has been done.

256
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,680
Before that

257
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,359
you will be

258
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,520
worried about Wenxing,

259
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,400
and so will I.

260
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,960
It just doesn't feel right.

261
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm also not in the mood

262
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,240
to decide on the wedding dishes

263
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,720
or send out invitations.

264
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,119
Come on, listen to your wife.

265
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,440
Okay.

266
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,359
Uncle Lin is picking you up?

267
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,440
He's already downstairs.

268
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,319
Off you go.

269
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,720
Bye.

270
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,440
See you.

271
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,280
I really want to get married to him.

272
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,280
With Du Feng?

273
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
Who else?

274
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,080
How far have you two gone?

275
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,680
Isn't it too early to talk about marriage?

276
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,640
Well, someone here got engaged

277
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,920
before she kissed him.

278
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm different.

279
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,560
At least we've chatted via email for half a year.

280
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
What made you

281
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,760
want to marry him?

282
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,280
What is it...?

283
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,560
He has good personalities.

284
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm sure it's not superficial.

285
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,720
I can feel that.

286
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Unlike your scientist.

287
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
Your scientist

288
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
seems rather unworldly.

289
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,240
He feels too distant.

290
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
Really?

291
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Using the term "unworldly"

292
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
to describe a man,

293
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,760
seems kind of weird.

294
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,720
Anyway, it's like

295
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,960
he doesn't really care about

296
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,840
anything.

297
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,600
Are you guys

298
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,200
a good fit for each other?

299
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,480
Very good?

300
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,240
Or not at all?

301
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Let's talk about something else.

302
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,720
Why avoid this?

303
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,840
A few days apart

304
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,280
and you aren't telling me anything.

305
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,480
You don't understand.

306
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
To me,

307
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,440
even he's just there at home

308
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,040
or in the study,

309
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm happy

310
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,920
just looking at him

311
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,120
by his side.

312
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,840
No, I don't even have to look at him,

313
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
just thinking that he's mine

314
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,920
makes me happy.

315
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,400
Fine.

316
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,400
Is it good?

317
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,920
Enjoy your meal.

318
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,000
I need to head out.

319
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,920
Where are you going?

320
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,440
A business meal.

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,960
You said you were here in Shanghai to accompany me,

322
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,840
actually you are here for my brother,

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,360
to help him with his great manufacturing industry dream.

324
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
I'll come back as early as I can,

325
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,280
okay?

326
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,600
How early will that be?

327
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,680
Eleven.

328
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,360
Before eleven.

329
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,680
Wait,

330
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400
this is for you.

331
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,240
What is it?

332
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,120
Poison.

333
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,160
Poison? You want to poison me?

334
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,640
Hangover medicine.

335
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,240
So you won't feel that bad

336
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,520
after drinking.

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,160
Half past ten.

338
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,880
Give me a second.

339
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
I'll give you something else.

340
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
All right, all right.

341
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,640
I'll be back by ten.

342
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,280
I'll be back ten sharp.

343
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,160
I'm heading off.

344
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,360
Hurry up and finish your meal.

345
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,640
Mr. Mei.

346
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
Mr. Mei treats you

347
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,960
differently now.

348
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,920
He treats me as his own sister.

349
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,040
Of course it'll be different.

350
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,280
Actually family relationship is better.

351
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,160
You can never give up on your family.

352
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,880
But love is way weaker.

353
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,840
I've always been eating alone

354
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,280
since I got admitted.

355
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,160
Will you eat with me today?

356
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,320
The food was prepared for you,

357
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,760
I shouldn't eat it.

358
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,400
You dislike me.

359
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,680
You little heartless brat,

360
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm doing what's best for you.

361
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,080
Fine, I'll eat with you.

362
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,120
Wait for me,

363
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,600
I'll go get a pair of chopsticks from the nurses.

364
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,600
You guys came.

365
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,320
What's Wenxing doing?

366
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,680
She's having dinner.

367
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,120
I want to talk to her alone.

368
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,800
Go find somewhere to sit with Song.

369
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,680
She's pregnant, so she can't stand for a long time.

370
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,440
All right.

371
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,160
She hasn't eaten much.

372
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,960
Try to get her to eat

373
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,120
when you talk to her.

374
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
These are ice cream moon cakes.

375
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,280
Remember to put them in a fridge.

376
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,080
Thanks.

377
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,280
How are you? Any better today?

378
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,680
Yes, I feel better.

379
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,800
I brought your favorite

380
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,400
claypot rice.

381
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,360
I was just saying

382
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,640
that I had been eating alone.

383
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,040
Now you're here.

384
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,680
Here.

385
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,320
Here you go.

386
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,520
Has Shi Yi moved out?

387
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
She's watching TV.

388
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,480
Yanyan.

389
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,960
You had the strings changed?

390
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,560
Let me take a look.

391
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Thank you.

392
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,840
The strings are a bit too loose.

393
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,920
I'll change them tomorrow.

394
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,480
You spoiled brat.

395
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,280
Remember the brand

396
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
you're used to

397
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,720
and keep using that.

398
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,240
Leave the zither here.

399
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,680
I'll find some time to tune it for you tonight.

400
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,440
Great.

401
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,600
What's his name?

402
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,920
Zhousheng Chen.

403
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,200
Are you guys

404
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,280
in a relationship?

405
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,880
Yes.

406
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,040
I'll give you some wedding candies when we get married.

407
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,240
Thank you, honey.

408
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
I didn't expect

409
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,880
you could play so well.

410
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,280
Was it good?

411
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,880
Very.

412
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,000
Very good?

413
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Very good.

414
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,600
Next time I'll bring my zither from home

415
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,920
and play something for you.

416
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,320
Okay.

417
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,360
Hello?

418
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,680
Chen.

419
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,480
Wenchuan.

420
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,200
We're at a hospital,

421
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,240
calm down.

422
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,160
You better pray

423
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,160
nothing bad happens to Wenxing!

424
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,920
Why did you hit him?

425
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,680
You should ask him that question!

426
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,960
Let's go.

427
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,360
Here are the true results.

428
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,360
Data that have not been altered.

429
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,120
If not for this,

430
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,200
she could have had her surgery the night before.

431
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,960
Also,

432
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
your younger brother came in the evening

433
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,200
and had a big fight with Wenxing

434
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,400
in her room!

435
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,280
He must have lost his mind!

436
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,120
How can he disregard

437
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
the patient's condition!

438
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,840
Doctor Lin.

439
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,640
How's Wenxing?

440
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,600
Not good.

441
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,000
Something happened just now.

442
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,280
I've already called the police.

443
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,440
The police?

444
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,400
What happened?

445
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,040
You should ask Wenchuan that.

446
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,400
Madam, the police are here

447
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,360
to take Wenchuan's statement.

448
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
Chen, you should go check.

449
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,160
He's ill-tempered,

450
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,560
he can't handle it.

451
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,720
He should handle this himself.

452
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
He's your younger brother.

453
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
I only have one sister.

454
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,400
And she's in there

455
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,680
fighting for her life!

456
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,240
Let's go.

457
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,640
What had happened?

458
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,640
Wenxing's pre-op tests were not good enough

459
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,520
because Zhou Wenchuan altered the data.

460
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
Who told you that?

461
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,920
Doctor Lin.

462
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,160
He's Wenxing's

463
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
primary doctor,

464
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,640
so he knows Wenxing's condition

465
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
better than anyone else.

466
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,040
He had a feeling that there was something wrong.

467
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,760
So he redid the tests,

468
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,880
and found out

469
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,720
that the data was altered.

470
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,680
Why?

471
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,400
Doesn't Wenchuan know that

472
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,800
she needs the surgery as soon as possible?

473
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,280
He wanted everyone

474
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,760
to focus on

475
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
Wenxing's surgery,

476
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,360
so that he could cover up

477
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,680
the problems in his accounts.

478
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,080
Regarding the mismatch

479
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
in these company accounts,

480
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,760
go back and check again.

481
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
You can go now.

482
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,640
Okay.

483
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,500
[Zhousheng Chen]

484
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,720
Coming.

485
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Come in.

486
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,040
You guys talk.

487
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,520
I'll leave you guys alone.

488
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,560
What happened?

489
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
I got a little bit emotional.

491
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,880
It's late.

492
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,280
You two should rest.

493
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,600
I need a bath.

494
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,120
I'll put your clothes here.

495
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,720
Let me wash your hair, okay?

496
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,320
I know you are sad.

497
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,960
I just don't know

498
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,080
how to comfort you.

499
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,320
Shi Yi,

500
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,600
will you give me a hug?

501
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,040
Sure.

502
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Wenxing will be fine.

503
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,360
She'll be all right.

504
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,640
Don't be too worried.

505
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,040
It breaks my heart

506
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
to see you like this.

507
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,160
Zhousheng Chen,

508
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,200
I love you.

509
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,000
I love you, too.

510
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,080
You're here.

511
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,520
You didn't sleep last night?

512
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,440
Wenxing

513
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,440
is not doing well.

514
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,520
You should see her.

515
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,440
Sorry for what happened last night.

516
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,000
I broke your tea cup.

517
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,880
It's okay. It's just a tea cup.

518
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,440
Mei Xing,

519
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,880
I don't know

520
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
if I should say this

521
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,920
now.

522
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,440
Wenxing...

523
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,480
Don't worry.

524
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,400
After her surgery,

525
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,440
I'll take her away

526
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,640
from the Zhou family

527
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
and take good care of her.

528
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,560
She will get well quicker

529
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,960
if she knows you said that.

530
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,200
But I have to help Zhousheng Chen

531
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,440
accomplish what he wants to do.

532
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,040
Maybe I had

533
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,400
owed him something in the previous life.

534
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,160
That's why I need to follow him

535
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,240
no matter what.

536
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,320
The previous life...

537
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,320
There were a lot who owed him in the previous life.

538
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,320
Everyone around him

539
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,720
would give their hearts to him.

540
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Shi Yi,

541
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,760
about the tune names before...

542
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,000
I know.

543
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,200
Don't get me wrong,

544
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,960
I just want to say that

545
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,240
I've already

546
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,280
let it go.
