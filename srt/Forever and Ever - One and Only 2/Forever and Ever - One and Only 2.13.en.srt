00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,400
Xiaoyu bought herself a furnished apartment,

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,759
she's going to move out at the end of this month.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,000
If you come back,

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,479
I'll sort out her room

7
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,720
and turn it into a study.

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,200
The bedroom remains what it was.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,720
We just finished decorating that house,

10
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,960
I suggest we move in

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
after a years' airing.

12
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,360
It's okay for daily activities, but not for sleeping,

13
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
that would be bad for your health.

14
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
Good news is I've got a ready-made house

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
for you to live in.

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,640
Hello, are you still there?

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm here.

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
Then why didn't you say anything?

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
I was just

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
overwhelmed all of a sudden.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
What did I say?

22
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,520
You were talking about

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,240
us moving in together.

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,880
Shouldn't we talk about that?

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
It's not that we shouldn't.

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,040
I was just picturing it.

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Don't take what I said

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
the wrong way.

29
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
What I meant was that

30
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,220
I was picturing

31
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,020
us living together.

32
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,579
I didn't take it the wrong way,

33
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,060
no need to explain for yourself.

34
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,260
Next week, I will attend

35
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,580
an International Space conference.

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,060
If you are interested,

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,380
you can come in advance

38
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,100
and we can go back to Shanghai together

39
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,580
once the conference is over.

40
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,820
You finished your job there?

41
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,300
Completely.

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,420
Wait, let me check my visa

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,500
and my work schedule.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,140
My Schengen visa is still valid.

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,220
Along with two days on weekend,

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,420
that makes four days off.

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,060
As long as I can make it to Shanghai during the day.

48
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,660
Okay, I got it.

49
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,940
I will book the ticket for you later.

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,260
Good night, in Germany.

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,300
Good night.

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,980
Zhousheng Chen, open the door.

53
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:11,500
Zhousheng Chen.

54
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,620
What's going on?

55
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,540
Here, here, here.

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,980
Move, move.

57
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,260
Do me a favor.

58
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,220
She's drunk.

59
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,140
Zhousheng Chen.

60
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,820
I don't know which hotel

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,020
her husband's staying in.

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,740
So I had to send her here.

63
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,100
This is...

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,580
She's married.

65
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,700
It's not appropriate to send her to a hotel.

66
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,180
If it's not okay to send her

67
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,220
to a hotel

68
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
why would you take her to my place?

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,540
Then tell me what should I do?

70
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,740
You're not going to throw her on the streets, are you?

71
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,180
What if she ran into some bad guys?

72
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,060
All right, all right, all right.

73
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,180
You may keep her here.

74
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,460
But you need to stay here as well.

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,900
Got it.

76
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,300
Move her into this room.

77
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,500
Easy, easy.

78
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,300
Frank.

79
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,220
Why did you take her into my room?

80
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,100
Thank you.

81
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,820
If you had a quarrel with Wenchuan

82
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,780
and didn't want him to come to pick you up,

83
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,100
I can call someone else

84
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,580
to take you back at dawn.

85
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,780
No need for that.

86
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,180
I am more familiar with Bremen than you.

87
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,340
Okay.

88
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,820
I have always wanted to apologize

89
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,340
for your engagement.

90
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,380
I didn't expect that accident

91
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,180
would ruin your plan.

92
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,340
It's okay.

93
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,180
I am going to divorce with Zhou Wenchuan.

94
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,940
We both acted on impulse

95
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,860
and none of us thought it through,

96
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,540
which turned into a drama.

97
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,100
I am afraid my parents won't stand for this,

98
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,540
not to mention your mother,

99
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,860
who is so sensitive about her reputation.

100
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,900
We decided to sign an agreement first,

101
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,340
and after a year,

102
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,060
we will make it public with an excuse.

103
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,380
Why would you rush into marriage?

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,340
I didn't rush into it.

105
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,180
I was just doing what I wanted

106
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,020
when it's appropriate.

107
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,460
I could understand if you did this

108
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,380
in order to go home

109
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,500
and take back what's yours from your second uncle.

110
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,860
But this reason you just said,

111
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,100
I don't buy it.

112
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,580
I don't like to talk with others

113
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,460
about my private affairs.

114
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,620
The sun has yet to rise,

115
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,980
you can go back to sleep.

116
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,980
In a while,

117
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,060
when Frank gets up,

118
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,780
I'll ask him to get your breakfast.

119
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,780
You have always

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,860
been very careful about marriage,

121
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,740
thinking it over a lot.

122
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,660
You also said

123
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,100
you didn't have any expectations for marriage.

124
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,900
If you ever get married,

125
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,740
you get married for your family.

126
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,660
What a surprise it was, this time.

127
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,100
Maybe this is the difference

128
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,620
between business and pleasure.

129
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Do you have any other problems?

130
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
If not,

131
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,659
I will continue to work.

132
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,700
Come and join us.

133
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,420
No, thanks.

134
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,660
Thank you for bringing me here.

135
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,540
You're welcome.

136
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,700
I have to go now.

137
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,540
Chen.

138
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,740
When did you arrive?

139
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,660
I have been waiting for 23 minutes.

140
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,940
I am famished

141
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,700
after staying outside for too long.

142
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,620
Would you mind me joining you

143
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,540
for breakfast?

144
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,540
Not at all.

145
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,660
You haven't seen Chen for a long time,

146
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,100
why not stay for breakfast?

147
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,140
You guys enjoy.

148
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,380
I have an appointment with my supervisor.

149
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,740
I will get a cab for you.

150
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,660
No, it's okay.

151
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
I can't believe you are just flying off.

152
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,860
Even though you are

153
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,420
legitimate husband and wife.

154
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,140
You have to apply some pressure

155
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,100
between you and him.

156
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,300
You are simply being too soft with him.

157
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,780
How am I being soft?

158
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,060
When my mother used to take her team for competitions,

159
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,420
as long as my father was available,

160
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,860
he would follow her to have fun together.

161
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,820
That way, they saved on hotel money while being able to travel around.

162
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,820
How long have your mom and dad been together?

163
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,380
They have already been married so long

164
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,500
they could tell what's on each other's mind

165
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,020
at a glance.

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,900
You guys are different.

167
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,580
You just got married and

168
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,060
barely know each other.

169
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,140
At this moment,

170
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,540
you could use

171
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,540
some cleverly applied pressure..

172
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,420
What kind of pressure?

173
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,380
If only I had a boyfriend,

174
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,100
so that

175
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,580
I could demonstrate that for you every day.

176
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,260
For example, this time.

177
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,180
You could've said.

178
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,740
"I'm busy, I haven't got time."

179
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,220
And he would start to wonder

180
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,700
about what's going on in your head.

181
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,620
Did he make you feel left out

182
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,500
so that you refused to go and used an excuse?

183
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,580
Once he starts to self-reflect,

184
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,500
we got him.

185
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,940
He feels more anxious and nervous than you.

186
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,540
That means he is like losing

187
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,140
the initiative in your relationship.

188
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,580
Whoever takes the initiative in a relationship

189
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,900
gains the upper hand.

190
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,540
Xiaoyu.

191
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,940
I met him when I was 26.

192
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
If I'm lucky enough

193
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,140
to live to 80,

194
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,940
I have only got 54 years left,

195
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,340
less than 20,000 days.

196
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,380
You know he is a researcher.

197
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,420
It will be like this when he is on a business trip,

198
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,500
being away for several months.

199
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,460
Maybe the time we really spend living together

200
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,620
is less than 10,000 days.

201
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,620
Minus the time

202
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,340
I would be busy, overworking

203
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,260
and off on business trips myself.

204
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,500
So the days we will get to spend together

205
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,780
are even fewer than that.

206
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,340
That's why,

207
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,180
within the limited amount of time I have left to spend with him.

208
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,580
I don't have any time

209
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,100
to think about using such tricks or applying pressure.

210
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,780
I need to seize every single minute

211
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,740
to be with him.

212
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,660
Do you understand?

213
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,780
All right, all right.

214
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,140
Forget it, forget what I said.

215
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,020
Don't worry, there won't be any delay.

216
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,740
I have calculated the time for you.

217
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,220
Great, I trust you.

218
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,860
You are only gonna be there for a few days,

219
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,900
why would you take so many books?

220
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,860
They are not books,

221
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,980
just some materials I printed

222
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,980
for me to read on the journey.

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,540
The characters Qinghe

224
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,340
indicate the origin of the family.

225
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,060
Qinghe County,

226
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,340
which is in today's Shandong Province.

227
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,740
[Map]

228
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,620
It is so far.

229
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,940
Hello, Sir.

230
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,020
Hi.

231
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,980
Can you get me

232
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,380
a pair of lady's slippers later?

233
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,500
Are we expecting any guests?

234
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,860
Do I need to prepare a guest room?

235
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,780
No need for that.

236
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,860
My wife is coming here.

237
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,620
Then I will give the bathroom

238
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,140
a good clean later

239
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,180
and light up some aromatic incense.

240
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,500
Which type does your wife prefer?

241
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,780
I am not sure about that.

242
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,620
Can you choose one for me

243
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,140
that's least possible to go wrong?

244
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,860
Will do.

245
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,660
Right,

246
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,300
she particularly loves to go to the temple,

247
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,220
so try to find some incense with a similar fragrance.

248
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Okay, got it.

249
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,860
Also,

250
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,820
get me some extra pillows

251
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,060
that are different

252
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,340
in softness and thickness.

253
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,140
I don't know what type

254
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,540
would she prefer to sleep with.

255
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,300
Will do.

256
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,180
Thank you.

257
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,340
Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

258
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,140
Like I expected.

259
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,180
Stop striking a pose.

260
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,820
Let's walk.

261
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,780
Well, you are the one who's in a hurry,

262
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,580
not me.

263
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,780
So says you, she's my wife,

264
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,740
not your wife.

265
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,500
Hurry up.

266
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,300
Let's go

267
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,020
to pick up Mr. Zhousheng's wife.

268
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,740
[For other directions, please take the elevator to the Service Center]

269
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,380
When did you arrive?

270
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,260
Well, about half an hour ago.

271
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,820

♫When all my hopes are dashed♫

275
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,580
I also saw a girl.

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,740
Despite only getting a glimpse,

277
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,540
♫How can I remain calm♫

278
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,900
her face is almost etched

279
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,700
in my mind

280
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,740
in a way I can never forget.

281
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,280
♫What if my destiny never fooled me♫

282
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,100
If I happened to see her again,

283
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,140
maybe I will be like you,

284
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,340
and propose without hesitation.

285
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,020
♫What if the time was more tolerant♫

286

This is my wife, Shi Yi.

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,180
This is my college classmate,

294
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,300

Mei Xing, courtesy name, Rugu.

297

Mei Rugu.

298
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,420
Weathered willow and withered lotus flower, only the plum remains the same.

299
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,820
That's a good interpretation.

300
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,700
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mei.

301
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,500
Nice to meet you, Miss Shi Yi.

302

Let's go.

303
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,060
I am done.

304
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,460
Enjoy.

305
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,700
Why are you staring at me like that?

306
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,900
-Hi.
-Hi.

307
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,900
You seem to have lost some weight.

308
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,980
Do I?

309
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,140
Your face is slimmer

310
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,380
than I recall.

311
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,820
Have you been eating properly?

312
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,420
I've been staying organized

313
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,700
and eating regularly.

314
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,420
I don't think I've gotten slimmer.

315
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,820
If I were you,

316
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,580
I would answer,

317
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,060
I missed you so much that I gradually lost some weight.

318
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,060
All right, I got it.

319
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,100
If the same thing

320
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
happened next time,

321
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,140
I would say,

322
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,900
I missed you so much

323
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,260
that I gradually lost some weight.

324
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,020
Here,

325
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,940
they've got room service,

326
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,980
24/7.

327
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,660
While I am not around,

328
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,660
if you need anything,

329
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,220
you can call reception.

330
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,620
You've been living in this place for quite some time?

331
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,180
Yeah.

332
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,580
I have been living in this place for ages.

333
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,500
Do you live here alone?

334
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,380
How's that possible?

335
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,780
He can't resist the loneliness.

336
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
He lived with someone else.

337
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,780
Did you really live with other people?

338
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,420
Yeah.

339
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:49,940
You see.

340
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,220
He even admitted that himself.

341
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,620
In the past,

342
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,940
I used to think a lot about

343
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,060
work stuff at night,

344
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,780
all of a sudden.

345
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,780
That requires talking and analyzing with other people.

346
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,780
That's why

347
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,980
I shared the apartment

348
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,900
with one of my colleagues before.

349
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,900
He just moved out.

350
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,540
He's a guy.

351
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,100
You guys don't waste a minute when it comes to your work.

352
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,780
I will put your luggage

353
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,980
in the room.

354
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,820
Okay.

355
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,780
Well.

356
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,740
A newly married couple who have reunited after a long separation.

357
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,980
You must loathe me, the lawyer

358
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,900
getting in your way.

359
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,420
But rest assured,

360
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,660
I know what I should do.

361
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,820
I will leave the moment I finish my business.

362
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,380
Please have a seat.

363
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,460
It's kind of scary to face a lawyer

364
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
right off the plane.

365
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,660
It's not me who scares you.

366
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,780
The content of the agreement does.

367
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,900
[Supplemental Agreement for Distribution of Property Signature]

368
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,980
[Signature]

369
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,340
This is the supplementary agreement

370
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,340
for the property settlement agreement

371
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,540
between you and him.

372
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,340
It is acting as

373
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,740
a supplement to your prenuptial agreement.

374
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,860
After you got married,

375
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,460
he inherited all his father's

376
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,740
personal assets

377
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,060
and 90% of the Zhou family's property.

378
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,780
It took us two months

379
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,940
to almost finish the take-over.

380
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,940
Here

381
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,220
are the movable properties and immovable properties

382
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,780
Zhousheng Chen changed their owner's name to you

383
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,860
after you got married.

384
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,780
Did his father give him

385
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
all his assets?

386
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,260
What about Wenxing and Wenchuan?

387
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,300
I don't know.

388
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,940
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you either.

389
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
As a lawyer, I have my professional integrity.

390
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,500
You don't have to manage these.

391
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,860
What we are going to sign today is necessary documents.

392
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,860
This is just following the procedure.

393
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,380
This is in triplicate.

394
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,900
It will be enough for you to read one.

395
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,660
I have marked the pages

396
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,820
where you need to sign your names

397
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,580
[Signature]

398
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,540
with stickers,

399
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,380
in case you miss any.

400
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,820
Thank you.

401
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,340
I will sign these and hand them to you before you go.

402
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,380
Is that too late?

403
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,740
The reason why I laughed is that

404
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,140
you and him are so alike.

405
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,060
You try to predict the next step

406
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,340
for whatever you do.

407
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,940
I haven't asked you when you could get it done,

408
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,100
yet you already told me.

409
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,780
I like to work with people who are reliable

410
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,500
and organized.

411
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,100
Of course, I need to be that myself.

412
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
If my partners

413
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,180
were like you,

414
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,820
that would save me a lot of trouble.

415
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,700
Take your time.

416
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,980
Are you not curious about his courtesy name?

417
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,660
What is it?

418
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,260
Changfeng.

419
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,700
Changfeng?

420
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,500
The waves rise as the high wind comes,

421
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,500
like the lonely land around a high mountain.

422
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,620
Raging waves pounding the banks,

423
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,580
turning and striking at each sharp turn.

424
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,500
Sure enough you can say that.

425
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,740
In Xi'an...

426
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,260
I mean the couple of days when you were in Xi'an,

427
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,100
I was there too.

428
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
But I didn't get to see you.

429
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,740
I did hear him talking about you.

430
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,300
What did he say?

431
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,660
He said there was a very romantic story

432
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,500
about how you two met.

433
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,620
It was actually pretty awkward.

434
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,020
Help me get the message to him

435
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,860
that I won't be waiting for him.

436
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,020
Okay.

437
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,140
Here, thanks.

438
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,060
It was nice meeting you.

439
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,980
Likewise.

440
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,550
I am his best friend.

441
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,500
If you have any difficulty

442
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
in the future,

443
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,700
you can always come to me.

444
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,980
Okay.

445
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,060
-Bye.
-See you.

446
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,140
OCD.

447
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,900
I didn't go interrupt you

448
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,140
as I saw you being very focused.

449
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,060
Here.

450
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,340
Wedding ring?

451
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,420
Shi Yi.

452
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,820
I need to tell you

453
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,260
one thing.

454
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,860
I took the ring off

455
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,340
when I was washing my hands a couple of days ago.

456
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,700
But something suddenly happened after I had washed my hands,

457
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,620
so I went out.

458
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,660
By the time I came back,

459
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,060
the ring was gone.

460
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,300
That's why just now

461
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,780
the ring was sent here.

462
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,780
Not the previous one.

463
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,300
By which you mean,

464
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,780
the first one got lost,

465
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,140
and this is already the second one.

466
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,100
Yeah.

467
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,100
Stupid.

468
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,580
If you didn't tell me that,

469
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,900
I would never have known.

470
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,540
Two months of not seeing each other,

471
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,180
you are still

472
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,620
the researcher who is honest and reliable.

473
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,540
It seems that, ever since I could remember,

474
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,980
this is the first time

475
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,340
I've been called a stupid.

476
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,580
So arrogant.

477
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,460
What do you think?

478
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,860
Do you want to go out for a meal?

479
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,180
Great, we could spend some time together as well.

480
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,820
What do you want to eat?

481
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,300
Any place you're familiar with.

482
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,860
Somewhere I'm familiar with?

483
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,340
It seems that apart from the apartment

484
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
and the laboratory,

485
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,660
I am not familiar with anything here.

486
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,060
I have been used to that kind of routine,

487
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,460
commuting between the apartment and the laboratory.

488
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,580
Then we have no choice,

489
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,900
I have to show you around.

490
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,380
Have you been here?

491
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,220
No, but I've done my homework.

492
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,300
Let's go.

493
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,780
I have seen pictures of this place

494
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
on the internet.

495
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,180
The documents Mei Xing wanted me to sign

496
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,980
mentioned your

497
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,220
Ten Years of Capital Introduction Plan.

498
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,620
Are you interested?

499
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,100
My father studied economics.

500
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
I often heard him talk about it.

501
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,540
In fact, those ten years

502
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,820
are only phase one.

503
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,580
At present, every country

504
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,220
is intensifying their efforts in scientific research

505
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,900
to speed up digitalization

506
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,340
and intellectualization.

507
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,340
That's why we can never stop.

508
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,660
We must pick up our pace

509
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,220
so as to seize the commanding heights

510
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,820
of global manufacturing.

511
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,820
Nevertheless, these efforts require capital.

512
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,540
A constant flow of capital.

513
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,420
Large enterprises are fine,

514
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,900
while small and medium enterprises,

515
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,460
like start-ups,

516
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,820
might find themselves struggling.

517
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,340
That's why I want to help them.

518
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,420
This kind of investment,

519
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,220
especially in the high-tech field.

520
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,620
It's hard to expect short-term return.

521
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,780
Will your mother and the seniors at home

522
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,860
understand?

523
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,500
The path to being understood

524
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,260
is pretty hard indeed.

525
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,540
You have my support from now on.

526
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:19,980
Thank you.

527
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,140
What kind of flowers do you like?

528
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,180
Me?

529
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I want to give you some flowers.

530
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,460
You want to give me flowers?

531
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,420
I forgot that you are allergic to pollen.

532
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,660
Wait a sec.

533
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,860
This is for you.

534
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,740
Do you like it?

535
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,860
Yeah.

536
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,380
Good afternoon, Professor Zhousheng.

537
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,700
Do you know him?

538
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,020
This is only three minutes

539
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,420
away from the institute.

540
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,420
Then let's go somewhere else.

541
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,300
Why?

542
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,940
Because I am not mentally prepared

543
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
to see your colleagues.

544
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,260
Besides, I just got off a long flight.

545
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,500
And I don't look good.

546
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,060
You don't?

547
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Just go.

548
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,660
Are you taking a shower just to go out?

549
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,100
I'm not.

550
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,580
I spent the whole night in the laboratory

551
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,580
and felt kind of dirty.

552
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,220
I just want to take a shower and get changed.

553
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,980
We are going to stay together tonight.

554
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,800
♫Time cannot steal memory♫

555
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,170
♫Try my best♫

556

♫To locate your trace♫

♫Spring flowers and autumn moon♫

558
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,040
♫I put them deep down in my heart♫

00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,760
♫To write you a song and a poem♫

560
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,060

♫With tenderness and caution♫

562
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,100

♫To rewrite the ending of what happened in our preexistence♫

564
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,260
You gotta take a shower later.

565
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I will just clean up real quick.

566
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,180
♫And resume our story♫

567
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,580
It's okay.

568
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,900
Are you going out?

569
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,950
♫You show up in my dream,♫

570
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,780
There's something going on in the lab.

571
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,780
I need to attend a

572
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,180
teleconference which will take a long time.

573
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,180
♫Gradually getting clearer♫

574
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,900
Are you coming home tonight?

575
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,900
I absolutely will.

576
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,900
However, it's going to be late as usual.

577
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,260
Wait.

578
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,460
Your hair is too wet.

579
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,540
You can leave after it's dried.

580
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,780
Did you bring it here?

581
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,940
I guessed you wouldn't have it, so I took one with me.

582
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
I really don't.

583
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,940
I'll blow-dry my hair then.

584
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,500
There's steak, some vegetables

585
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,420
and bread in the fridge.

586
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,780
If you don't like eating any of them.

587
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,060
Call room service.

588
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,340
I know, I'm not a child.

589
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,220
I saw where the restaurant was

590
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
when we were

591
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,380
on our way back.

592
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,140
I gotta go.

593
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,340
Take care.

594
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:33,940
Okay.

595
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,860
Zhousheng Chen.

596
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,739
I heard a complaint about your

597
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,300
embezzlement of the project funds.

598
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:04,500
This...

599
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,139
What a joke.

600
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
There's nothing wrong with the previous agreement, right?

601
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,460
The work has been made public,

602
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,620
and we also applied for the patent.

603
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,900
There's no problem with it.

604
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,780
As for the funds,

605
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,260
we will find out by looking into it.

606
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,980
Shall we go in and talk about it?

607
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,940
Not today.

608
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,219
My wife is here.

609
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,940
Your wife is here?

610
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,300
She just took

611
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,620
dozens of hours of flights to come here

612
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,699
and must be tired.

613
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,380
She must be sleeping now.

614
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,420
Let's make it another day,

615
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,420
and not disturb her.

616
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,020
Good, I will invite you

617
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,219
and your wife for dinner someday,

618
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
to show my hospitality.

619
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,380
Okay.

620
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,100
Bye.

621
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,699
Bye.

622
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,260
What time is it?

623
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,380
5:47.

624
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,980
Come to bed.

625
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,220
The sofa is uncomfortable.

626
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,980
I just got back from the laboratory.

627
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
My clothes are dirty.

628
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,620
I will go take a shower

629
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,420
and get changed.

630
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,100
I don't mind.

631
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,660
Come up here.

632
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,500
Is it really so hard for you to sleep with your wife

633
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,820
on the same bed?

634
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,780
It's not hard.

635
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,580
I was afraid of waking you.

636
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,220
I am already awake.

637
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,700
Are you going to keep sleeping?

638
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,700
Yeah.

639
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,580
I wasn't sleeping well

640
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,300
before you came back.

641
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,580
Now my head feels dizzy

642
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,540
and I want to keep sleeping.

643
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,500
You go do that.

644
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,980
Were you going to do something

645
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,900
after I sent you the flowers?

646
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,500
I have always been

647
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,140
terrible with words.

648
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,100
Yet you always surprise me.

649
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,060
And there's so many surprises

650
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,460
that I am speechless.

651
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,060
Then how are you gonna repay me?

652
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,860
Repay?

653
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,900
How do you want me to repay you?

654
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,020
Help me fall asleep.

655
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,460
How would you fall sleep more easily

656
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,900
normally?

657
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,020
Listen to music, or poems.

658
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,580
I will fall asleep

659
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,540
after listening to them for a while.

660
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,540
When I was young,

661
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,180
in order to help me memorize poems,

662
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,980
my mother used to read them for me every night before sleep

663
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,380
and I got used to it.

664
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,380
Then I will read some poems.

665
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,100
Can I choose which poem?

666
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,740
You don't have to recite the whole poem, just one or two lines.

667
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,340
Sure.

668
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,020
Bai Juyi.

669
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,820
I drank too much last night,

670
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,220
and I drank throughout the night.

671
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,940
I ate too much for breakfast,

672
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,260
and I fell asleep after I eating full to bursting.

673
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,380
Stop kidding around, I'm too sleepy.

674
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,020
I'm just responding to your request

675
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,260
to recite some poems.

676
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,020
You did it on purpose,

677
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,420
choosing these lines.

678
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,540
Things like drinking too much last night

679
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,900
and being full to bursting today,

680
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,300
just to make me laugh.

681
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,820
All right, I will try to behave.

682
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,100
The white porcelain cup is crystal clear.

683
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,820
The fire is blazing inside the stove.

684
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,420
The tea leaves give off the scent of alcohol,

685
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,940
and the water is now bubbling.

686
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,500
When I poured the tea into the cup, it looked fabulous.

687
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,060
After I drank it, the fragrance still lingered.

688
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,660
That's it?

689
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,660
One, two, three, four, five,

690
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,740
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

691
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,900
Eleven.

692
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,080
♫The day we met♫

693
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,090
♫Time froze♫

694
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,970
♫It's your smiling eyes♫

695
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,990
♫That made the hustle and bustle of the world gone♫

696
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,760
♫Every moment♫

697
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,680
♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

698
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,960
♫Love spreads♫

699
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,780
♫I'm glad you're here♫

700
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,430
♫One more day with you♫

701
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,340
♫Love gets deeper♫

702
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,340
♫Making it a poem♫

703
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,830
♫Kissing through the long years♫

704
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,620
♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

705
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,400
♫Make a vow in silence♫

706
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,960
♫Embrace again♫

707
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,920
♫A few forever♫

708
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,010
♫Nothing will change♫

709
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,940
♫With the same warm sunny day♫

710
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,090
♫Give you my true love♫

711
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,800
♫Thank you for being there♫

712
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,390
♫One more day with you♫

713
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,570
♫Love gets deeper♫

714
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,510
♫Making it a poem♫

715
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,870
♫Kissing through the long years♫

716
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,930

717
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:19,700

00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,320

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,260
♫A few forever♫

720
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,150
♫Nothing will change♫

721
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,180
♫With the same warm sunny day♫

00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,120
♫Give you my true love♫

723
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,810
♫Believe you can feel the same♫

724
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,670
♫Maybe it's the snow falling without a sound♫

725
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,160
♫Maybe it's the flower in the mirror without a trace♫

726
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,890
♫I've seen all the scenes of the passing years♫

727
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,580
Even the most beautiful face

728
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:20,570
♫They're not as good as you, not as good as you♫

729
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,140
will have to age.

730
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,300
You are the best in my mind.

731
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,580
♫I look at a ripple♫

732
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,460
I can see the bones of beauty inside you.

733
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,730
♫It's like there's no wind and no sunshine♫

734
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,800
♫The more silent my love becomes♫

735
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Where?

736
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,800
♫The more my heart turns to rain♫

737
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,900
In here.

738
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,320
♫There is grace in your eyebrows♫

739
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,580
People's faces are shaped by their hearts.

740
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,900
If they are kind at heart, they look kind in their face.

741
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,850
♫I'll spend my whole life looking for it♫

742
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,540
One has to have dignity

743
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,380
before having the bones of beauty.

744
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,700
♫Don't blame me for the sporadic sweet talk♫

745
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,760
♫I wake up from my dreams and I'm even colder♫

746
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,980
I realize I am totally dwarfed by you

747
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,020
in terms of mastering the art of language.

748
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,950
♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

749
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,710
♫Hides nothing from you♫

750
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,020
Do you still remember the composition Shanglin Fu?

751
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,510
♫The scene I look down for♫

752
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
The first time we met,

753
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,700
♫Gets clear after saying goodbye♫

754
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,380
I could think of

755
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,550
♫Every glimpse means missing you♫

756
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,500
no better line than

757
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:19,480
♫Even if to be a stranger to you♫

758
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,060
“Her beauty is breathtaking and charming with only a touch of make-up”

759
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,300
to describe you.

760
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,060
I have got you a wedding gift.

761
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,460
What gift?

762
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,380
I see you love wearing shirts.

763
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,580
So, I bought some cuff-links.

764
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,820
When I was shopping,

765
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,420
I said I was buying these for my husband.

766
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,180
The clerk asked what kind of color do you like,

767
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,460
but I didn't even know.

768
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,180
That's why I didn't specify

769
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,900
and then bought them in five different colors.

770
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,500
What color do you prefer?

771
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,820
I like them all.

772
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,020
Be serious.

773
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,300
If I have to choose one, then…

774
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:11,980
this one.

775
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,180
Shi Yi.

776
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:18,860
Thank you.

777
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,420
I bought some vegetables.

778
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,540
Are you having dinner at home today?

779
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,620
Last night's meeting in the lab

780
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,660
still hasn't finished.

781
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,060
I just took a few hours' break just to come home

782
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:29,980
and see you,

783
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,340
in case you got worried.

784
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,420
I will go back to the meeting

785
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,940
in a minute.

786
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,420
It's okay.

787
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,580
These last few days,

788
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,020
you must have had a lot of work to transfer.

789
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,860
What a pity.

790
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,020
I bought the Bundesliga tickets

791
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,260
and I was going to surprise you.

792
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,700
Do you love football?

793
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,780
I know nothing about it.

794
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,260
Xiaoyu is a die-hard fan.

795
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,540
She urged me to watch it

796
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,740
and asked me to give her some live coverage.

797
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,580
I will make you something

798
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,300
as fast as I can.

799
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,580
You go brush your teeth and wash your face.
