I'm concerned that our fourth uncle might feel alone,

so I'd like you and Ren to go over there.

I understand that.

Why didn't you tell me the truth?

16
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,180
The truth was too hurtful to be told.

17

If you had told me earlier

18

What I owed him before

With Zhousheng Chen.

177
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,260
Then we went abroad

178
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,210
and stopped going there that often.

179
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,230
You like ancient literature, don't you?

180
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,870
Then you should've been born in our family.

181
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,760
Not many of your siblings

182
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,940
are into that.

183
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,230
You're right.

184
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,840
The other day you sent to us

185
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,160
the tune names for choosing your wife...

186
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,600
I was doing it for fun.

187
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:58,890
By the way,

188
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,090
is it time to take your medicine?

189
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,190
Come.

190
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,160
Shi Yi, see you.

191
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,780
Bye.

192
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,850
Watch your mouth next time.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,800
Not everything

194
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,090
can be joked about.

195
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,420
I felt something was wrong

196
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,980
as soon as I said it.

197
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,730
Sorry.

198
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,580
I'm almost there.

199
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,040
I'll walk you to the yard.

200
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,670
No need. It's close enough.

201
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,020
What?

202
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,520
Are you mad at me?

203
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,780
No.

204
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,980
If you're seen by my mom and grandma,

205
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,660
you'll have to listen to their nagging again.

206
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,170
I want you to use the time

207
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,750
to go back and rest.

208
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,170
You work until one or two in the morning every day.

209
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,680
How can you ignore your health?

210
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,250
Enough.

211
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,510
Let's go.

212
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,980
You're back.

213
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,180
Sleep with me for a while.

214
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,380
I haven't washed up yet.

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,220
The lights are on.

216
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,220
Are they asleep?

217
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,180
Keep it down.

218
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,940
They would be awakened by you.

219
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,420
Well,

220
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,940
I mean

221
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,820
if he is still up,

222
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,740
you should go up and ask

223
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,260
whether they'll have breakfast

224
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,100
together

225
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,020
or separately.

226
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm not going.

227
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,780
What if they are sleeping?

228
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,460
Are people sleeping with lights on?

229
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,700
Of course.

230
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,260
You can see the shadows.

231
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,020
It's not my fault.

232
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,940
Really.

233
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,420
You are too loud.

234
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,540
Go and fetch me some cherries.

235
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,700
I'm not going.

236
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,620
It's too late.

237
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,700
Cherries picked in the sun

238
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,020
are not tasty.

239
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
We have a curfew

240
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,760
in this month.

241
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,940
We are not allowed to go out at midnight.

242
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,460
Then go and get me some lotus roots.

243
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,860
Tomorrow

244
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,470
I'll make Sweet Lotus Root with Sticky Rice

245
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,740
for Shi Yi.

246
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,180
Lotus roots.

247
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,580
By the water.

248
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,620
No way.

249
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,190
It's too dangerous to go near the water at night.

250
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,530
I'll go by myself then.

251
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:11,900
Well,

252
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,060
I'm coming with you.

253
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,020
Zhousheng Chen?

254
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,890
He didn't wake me up again.

255
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,020
You are up.

256
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,820
He turned off my alarm.

257
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,020
Did you finish breakfast already?

258
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,180
The old lady said

259
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,620
your daily schedule

260
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,500
could be different from ours,

261
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,900
so she told us not to wake you up.

262
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,900
Try this.

263
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,060
I've been waiting for it for months

264
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,340
since it was only a bud.

265
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,540
Finally, we can eat it.

266
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,660
For months?

267
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,620
Right.

268
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,180
The buds come out at the end of May.

269
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
The flowers bloom between July and August.

270
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,340
In September, the flowers wither and the roots take shape.

271
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,180
Did you raise lotuses before?

272
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,820
I raised some

273
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,060
when I learned how to paint them.

274
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,020
I kept painting them from the germination of their seeds at the end of April

275
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,260
to the end of their flowering season.

276
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,300
And I picked it up again next year

277
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,140
after the winter.

278
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,020
That lasted for years.

279
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,100
No wonder you are so good at it.

280
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,900
You are very patient.

281
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,940
It's tasty.

282
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
Really?

283
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,619
My great-uncle also likes my cooking.

284
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,180
I don't usually cook for people,

285
00:16:58,339 --> 00:16:59,420
not even for the lady,

286
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,980
not even if they beg me.

287
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,780
And every year,

288
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,140
I always hide

289
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,900
the lotuses I like

290
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
from other people.

291
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,609
Teach me.

292
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,140
Can you cook?

293
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,130
I'm passionate about cooking.

294
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,260
We share the same hobby.

295
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,220
You can be my confidant.

296
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,220
I'll teach you

297
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,640
after the Ghost Festival.

298
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,200
It's the Ghost Festival today.

299
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,220
Are there any family events?

300
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,740
Yes. To release lanterns on the water.

301
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,060
On the water?

302
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,820
I only watched it once

303
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,180
when people released some on land,

304
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,460
but never on water.

305
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,220
Then come back here every year.

306
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,340
We do it every year.

307
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,620
In my previous Ghost Festivals,

308
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,260
if we worked very late,

309
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,780
we would just tell each other

310
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,020
to go home earlier

311
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,900
and not to stay out late,

312
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,260
since it was the Ghost Festival.

313
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,460
It's fine.

314
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,700
Lin Fei and I will go with you.

315
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,260
Don't worry.

316
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,460
Finish your meal.

317
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,340
I'll do some cleaning.

318
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,980
What are you looking for?

319
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,580
Something practical.

320
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,820
Practical?

321
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,930
I don't think

322
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,940
there is anything practical here.

323
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,540
We only have things that are too precious

324
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,660
to be taken out.

325
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,460
I saw it when I was ten.

326
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,190
It should be here.

327
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,690
You have a retentive memory.

328
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,740
Why are you putting it back?

329
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,100
I just need to know it's here.

330
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,860
It's the Ghost Festival.

331
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,340
Not a good day to give gifts.

332
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,500
I thought you never

333
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,420
believed these things.

334
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,140
It's about her.

335
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
I'd rather be too cautious

336
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,580
than sorry.

337
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,500
Figure divination?

338
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,260
I saw it before

339
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,300
in a script.

340
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,100
So I want to look for more information.

341
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,460
Are these books

342
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,100
from the right end of

343
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,580
the third row of the tenth shelf on the second floor?

344
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,820
You read it before?

345
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,540
Ren did.

346
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,300
After he finished,

347
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,380
I helped him put them back.

348
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,860
Why would Ren be interested in these?

349
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,180
We spent one Spring Festival in the ancestral temple.

350
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,580
Our fourth great-uncle told Ren

351
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,580
a story

352
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,140
about figure divination.

353
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,420
What's that story?

354
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,620
There was an ambitious general

355
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,700
living in the Northern Dynasties.

356
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,100
After a palace coup

357
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,380
where he saved the crown prince's life,

358
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,860
he came up with an idea of taking his place

359
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,620
and being the emperor himself.

360
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,460
To convince all the ministers and people in the country,

361
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,740
he followed ancient rules

362
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,720
and asked craftsmen

363
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,100
to make dozens of molds for him

364
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,740
to build gilded bronze figures in public.

365
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,700
But he

366
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,100
failed every time

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,220
and all the molds were ruined.

368
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,730
He got downhearted

369
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,930
and asked the crown prince to give it a try.

370
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,310
But unexpectedly,

371
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,130
the crown prince succeeded on his first attempt.

372
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,510
He realized that it should be God's will.

373
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,710
Thus, he dropped his delusional idea

374
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,960
and supported the crown prince's enthronement.

375
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,460
Through this story, our fourth great-uncle wanted to

376
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,500
let Ren understand

377
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,250
that everyone

378
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,540
has their own fate

379
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,580
and should never expect things that don't belong to them.

380
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,120
Ren didn't buy it

381
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,350
and came to ask me.

382
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,640
What did you say?

383
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,380
I said

384
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,840
the craftsmen might have made

385
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,250
two different kinds of metal molds.

386
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,370
Some had a higher melting point than bronze,

387
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,670
and the others had a lower one.

388
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,370
As long as they wanted,

389
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,900
they could always

390
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,200
get in the way of the general.

391
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,350
Right.

392
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
Ancient people might have no idea of melting points.

393
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,380
But the craftsmen dealt with

394
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,540
metallic materials all the time.

395
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,730
They must have known the difference.

396
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,660
By the way,

397
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,320
Lian Sui told me

398
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,500
grandma wanted to go home.

399
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,470
I can

400
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,320
send her home together with you.

401
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,090
Aren't you going to release lanterns with

402
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,060
Wenxing tonight?

403
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,540
I'll send grandma home.

404
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,230
Sure.

405
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,120
Come back before dark.

406
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,000
It's a special day.

407
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,140
OK.

408
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,590
Grandma.

409
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,980
Shi Yi told me

410
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,460
to go back before dark today.

411
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,030
So I can't be with you

412
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,040
tonight.

413
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,310
All right.

414
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,380
I'm an old woman.

415
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,430
I don't need you here with me.

416
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,530
Go and be with your wife.

417
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,300
That's the most important matter.

418
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,320
Here. Be careful, grandma.

419
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,260
Chen.

420
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm afraid that grandma might find out

421
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,060
about Wenxing's condition.

422
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,220
If she asks about it,

423
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,900
please help me stall her off.

424
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,500
Mr. Mei and I

425
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,780
are going to see the doctor now.

426
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,930
Come as soon as you can.

427
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,260
OK.

428
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,340
Thank you.

429
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,080
We're all family.

430
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,400
What's more,

431
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,020
Wenxing grew up in my house,

432
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,500
and I know that doctor

433
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
better than you do.

434
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,500
Just go.

435
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,620
Alright. Bye.

436
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,420
Mom, I have other things to do.

437
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,900
OK.

438
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,580
Be safe.

439
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,260
Be careful.

440
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,260
You are back.

441
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,180
-Here.
-Alright.

442
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,940
Grandma hasn't eaten yet.

443
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Cook for her.

444
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,660
OK.

445
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,340
I was thinking

446
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,010
that Wan would not let me leave this time.

447
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,900
But she agreed

448
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,140
so fast and easily.

449
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,940
What's going on in the family?

450
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,980
Nothing, grandma.

451
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,280
I don't believe her.

452
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,820
I only believe you.

453
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,950
You never lie to me.

454
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,020
Go.

455
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,860
Your wife is waiting for you at home.

456
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,820
OK, grandma.

457
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,460
I'll come back in two days.

458
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,060
OK.

459
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,860
You said two days.

460
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,400
Don't be late.

461
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,820
I promise. Two days.

462
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,770
Deal.

463
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,680
OK. Go.

464
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,350
Bye, grandma.

465
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:24,820
Go.

466
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,460
Why must I let her

467
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,700
stay in the mountains to recuperate?

468
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,140
It's too humid here.

469
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,700
It's all my fault.

470
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,380
Doctor Lin,

471
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,620
how is Wenxing's condition?

472
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,660
Her condition

473
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,700
is even worse than I thought.

474
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,300
Before you came,

475
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,460
we were talking about the treatment.

476
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,260
Doctor Lin suggests a heart transplant operation.

477
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,100
He wishes

478
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,900
Wenxing can stay in the country for further treatment,

479
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
so that it'll be easier to

480
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,980
find a suitable heart donor.

481
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,220
I know you feel bad for Wenxing.

482
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,410
We've worked it out over the years,

483
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,480
and we can surely work it out again this time.

484
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,380
Mr. Wang,

485
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
stop here, please.

486
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,460
All right.

487
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,860
Ancestors,

488
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,620
if you are watching this,

489
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,780
please bless

490
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,380
my older brothers and sisters-in-law

491
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,700
with a smooth life,

492
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,740
including Mei Xing.

493
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,300
When I was a kid, my mom told me

494
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,420
we should release lanterns on the water during the Ghost Festival,

495
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,020
so that the ancestors could see us

496
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,060
and bless

497
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,020
all the generations of Zhou family

498
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,420
with a happy and healthy life.

499
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,630
In the future,

500
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,100
I will also bless you.

501
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,540
People die.

502
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,660
Shi Yi,

503
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,020
if,

504
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,340
I mean if

505
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,980
I am gone one day,

506
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,140
you and Chen

507
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,300
don't have to come back to see me every year.

508
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,460
I would be satisfied as long as you think about me.

509
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,700
Shut up.

510
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,500
Knock on the wood to withdraw those unlucky words.

511
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,660
Come on.

512
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,500
Silly kid.

513
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,100
There are so many people who love you

514
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,220
and stay by your side.

515
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,540
Even for them,

516
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,260
you should live on and live well.

517
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,980
Never say those

518
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,700
bad words again.

519
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,260
Here.

520
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,900
I don't feel cold, Shi Yi.

521
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,420
Why are your hands so cold?

522
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,300
I've always been like this.

523
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,460
In winter,

524
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,020
I dare not touch others' hands,

525
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,620
for I'm afraid they would feel cold too.

526
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,900
The wind is too strong here.

527
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,900
Let's go back.

528
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,060
Sure.

529
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:07,980
Here.

530
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,740
Sir, we are going back.

531
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,740
All right.

532
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,100
Shi Yi.

533
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,340
I...

534
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,100
Shi Yi.

535
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,540
What...

536
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,100
Sir, help her!

537
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,900
I can't swim.

538
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,140
Shi Yi.

539
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,020
Shi Yi.

540
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,620
I...

541
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,500
Shi Yi...

542
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,980
Wenxing.

543
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,380
Wenxing.

544
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,700
Come back up.

545
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,460
You can't take this.

546
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,740
Wenxing, come on up now.

547
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,180
Right.

548
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,900
-Wenxing.
-Why did she fall into the water?

549
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,380
-Wenxing.
-Get some help now.

550
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,060
Come up now.

551
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,180
Your body can't take this.

552
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,420
Something is wrong.

553
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,660
What's wrong, Uncle Lin?

554
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,620
Shi Yi.

555
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,580
Shi Yi fell into the water.

556
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,220
What?

557
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,380
What happened?

558
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:12,100
[Family of Books and Rituals]

559
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,580
Do you know why?

560
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,740
Who else was on the boat?

561
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,740
Only Wenxing and a boatman.

562
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,100
Mr. Mei,

563
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,580
Wenxing is having a high fever.

564
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,420
I took the liberty of coming to you.

565
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,820
They told us to keep quiet about it.

566
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,740
Don't tell Zhousheng Chen for the moment.

567
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,940
"The Bones of the Beauty"

568
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,140
is a legendary story

569
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,660
in ancient times.

570
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,500
It's about the Junior Prince of Nanchen whose meritorious military service was illustrious,

571
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,800
and an aristocratic girl.

572
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,820
That girl's name

573
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,930
was also Shi Yi.

574
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,060
The ending of the story

575
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,300
is too cruel.

576
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,980
Until they died,

577
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,500
the "Fu on the Imperial Park" on the wall of the royal mansion

578
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,340
was still unfinished.

579
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,460
Why didn't they talk about it

580
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,860
before they left each other?

581
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,179
Neither of them finished the prose.

582
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,610
That may be the beauty of regret.

583
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,820
Perhaps they were both hoping

584
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,140
that one day

585
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,420
they could finish it.

586
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,420
Uncle Lin,

587
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,780
why don't you go up and talk to him?

588
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,660
He hasn't eaten all day.

589
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,620
It would be strange if he could

590
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,900
eat anything now.

591
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,420
Haven't you eaten?

592
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,740
Shi Yi hasn't eaten either.

593
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,260
Being married

594
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,940
means you have one more family member.

595
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,700
If you live on your own,

596
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,580
you'll experience aging, sickness and death

597
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
only once.

598
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,580
But for married people,

599
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,940
they have to experience all this of

600
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,260
their beloved as well.

601
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,020
There are more challenges await on the road.

602
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,780
You can't just stop eating and drinking

603
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
when things get tough.

604
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,980
The meal is cold.

605
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,660
I'll warm it up for you.

606
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,380
Uncle Lin,

607
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,900
just leave it here.

608
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,140
I'll have it later.

609
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,820
Zhousheng Chen.

610
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,620
Shi Yi.

611
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,780
Shi Yi.

612
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,050
Shi Yi.

613
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,980
Can you hear me?

614
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,060
You are awake.

615
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,140
How are you

616
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,420
feeling now?

617
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,180
I'll get the doctor.

618
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,340
What are you doing down here?

619
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,380
Is she awake?

620
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,740
Bring some light food for her.

621
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,260
It's already done.

622
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,340
I'll go and get it.
