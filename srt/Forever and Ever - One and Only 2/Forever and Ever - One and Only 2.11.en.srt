You sleeping in the living room

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,440
will make it look like we're having a fight.

7
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680

[Zhousheng Chen]

9
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,880
I could say that

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,480
I made you unhappy

11
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,710
and that I came out on my own.

12
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,480
Are you thirsty?

13
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,829
You are ruining my image by doing this.

14
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:39,960
No, I am not.

15
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,190
You said you made me angry.

16
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,760
Doesn't that imply

17
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,000
I have a bad temper?

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,280
My grandma won't think like that.

19
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll sleep on the left side and you on the right.

20
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,510
We'll have our backs to each other.

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
Come on up here.

22
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,040
This is the place

23
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,860
you lived in when you were young?

24
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,480
So, at that time,

25
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,240
you and your grandma

26
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,680
had separate rooms?

27
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes.

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,520
So, you started to live here

29
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,400
from a very early age.

30
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah.

31
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
It must've been very tiring for your grandma

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to send you to and pick you up from school.

33
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,640
Zhousheng Chen,

34
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,920
apart from "yes, yeah",

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,640
do you have any other answers?

36
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
I noticed this when we

37
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,100
started calling each other.

38
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,100
You would only answer what I ask.

39
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,950
If not, you would just keep quiet.

40
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
It's just,

41
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,640
I don't know

42
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,600
what to talk to you about.

43
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,700
Why did you get up?

44
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,870
Let's have a chat.

45
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,520
How?

46
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,810
By sitting up and talking.

47
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,090
What would you normally talk about

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,140
when you are with your students?

49
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,500
Or,

50
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,680
when you were still in school

51
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
and was having a meal in the canteen.

52
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
You gotta talk when you are having a meal, right?

53
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,250
I don't usually talk

54
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
when I am eating.

55
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,050
Except when

56
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,320
it was about work.

57
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,159
If you keep this up,

58
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,480
the conversation would die out.

59
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,310
I mean, I, um,

60
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,400
I am really not a big fan of talking while eating.

61
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,400
But I do enjoy listening to other people.

62
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,659
When I visited

63
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,860
other schools in the past,

64
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,140
I would always enjoy

65
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,420
mealtime.

66
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,020
That's because the teachers

67
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,220
were all from

68
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,780
different fields.

69
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,140
Although mealtime was short,

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,620
I would always learn a lot.

71
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,820
I had a pretty boring life in the past.

72
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,780
I spent almost 15 to 16

73
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,140
hours

74
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,700
in the lab.

75
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,300
And only returned to the dorm at midnight.

76
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,100
When the sun was out, I was back in the lab again.

77
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,450
That's how it was in the past.

78
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,980
I didn't want to

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
bore you with

80
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,060
talks about my work.

81
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,960
But I'm not knowledgeable

82
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,260
in other fields.

83
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
We could just chit chat.

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Chit chat?

85
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,320
Like what?

86
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,580
Like, what did you eat today?

87
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,860
Or, how was your day?

88
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,340
We could even talk about the weather.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,780
You name it.

90
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,580
This way, we could have more conversations

91
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,270
and I'll get to know you better.

92
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,700
Take another example.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,080
The dish the aunty made today was a bit salty

94
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,200
and I had to drink a lot of water.

95
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,500
Yeah, it was a bit salty.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,550
If the food is too salty,

97
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,660
it's bad for your blood vessels.

98
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,920
I will remind her tomorrow.

99
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,310
Why is it bad?

100
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,450
If there is enough nitric oxide

101
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,930
inside a person's body,

102
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,980
it will make the blood vessels

103
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,180
softer and more relaxed.

104
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,100
In other words, better blood flow.

105
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,060
If a person consumes too much salt,

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,210
it will hinder the release of nitric oxide

107
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,300
and affect the dilation of blood vessels.

108
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,180
Sure enough,

109
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
our conversations turn serious after a while.

110
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,140
I suppose it would be really hard

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,220
to gossip with you.

112
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,820
I'll go close the window.

113
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,100
No, it's okay.

114
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,640
It's quite comfortable to sleep

115
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,460
with the sound of rain.

116
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,440
You might catch a cold this way.

117
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,980
I have the quilt and you, right?

118
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,220
Have a good night.

119
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,539
Don't you need the covers?

120
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,419
I am not cold.

121
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,500
Shi Yi,

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,740
thank you.

123
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,620
What for?

124
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,900
I should be the one trying to

125
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,180
make you happy.

126
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,180
Yet, throughout the day,

127
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,980
you seemed to be the one putting in the effort.

128
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,340
I realize sometimes

129
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,060
you can be really honest.

130
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,420
Why aren't you saying anything?

131
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,100
Zhousheng Chen.

132
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,540
Turn around.

133
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,940
I want to look at you.

134
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,740
Turn around?

135
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,930
Like this?

136
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,430
Turn to face me.

137
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,540
Like this?

138
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,280
Good night.

139
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,300
Good night.

140
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,020
Did I wake you up?

141
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,980
It's okay, Grandma.

142
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,380
I am used to getting up early.

143
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,260
Grandma,

144
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,060
I want to ask you a favor.

145
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,630
What is it?

146
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,030
Tell me.

147
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,980
I will do whatever

148
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,380
I can.

149
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,900
I want to get the marriage certificate with Shi Yi.

150
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,380
Good, very good.

151
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,940
Very, very good.

152
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,900
[1 yuan]

153
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,980
Where did this come from?

154
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,500
Did you drop some money

155
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,900
while sleeping last night?

156
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,300
I found a coin on the bed.

157
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,540
[1 yuan]

158
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,860
You found money on the bed?

159
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,140
It dropped out

160
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,100
when I was making the bed.

161
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,620
How lucky.

162
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,620
Is your household registration permit

163
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
with your parents

164
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
or yourself?

165
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,020
With me.

166
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,940
I changed the permit when I bought the apartment.

167
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,460
Come over here.

168
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,380
Here.

169
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,100
Today,

170
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,940
I want to ask you something

171
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,340
in front of my grandma.

172
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,900
Sure.

173
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,380
I want to

174
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,020
have our marriage registered first

175
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,180
and after that, we can make up

I will ask someone to bring you breakfast

515
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,580
later on.

516
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,460
Are you not going in?

517
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,740
I'll go in later.

518
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,820
After they finished eating.

519
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,660
It won't be too late that way.

520
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,060
Uncle Lin, are you not going in?

521
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,380
I'll stay here with you for a bit.

522
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,140
Chen.

523
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,820
Grandma.

524
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,540
Why are you here?

525
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,380
I brought our grandma here just to help you.

526
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,740
Mother.

527
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,840
Mother.

528
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,660
I thought you already had breakfast?

529
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,020
-Grandma.
-Grandma.

530
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,960
Wenxing got up late.

531
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,440
She was afraid you might blame her,

532
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,240
that's why she brought me along.

533
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,540
Wan.

534
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,020
You have been

535
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,900
too hard on the kids.

536
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,420
Sit down, sit down.

537
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:38,860
Grandma, have a seat.

538
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,970
Well.

539
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,760
The kids in our family.

540
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,430
Today is totally worth it.

541
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,360
The second son got married first.

542
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,700
The eldest, also has a wife.

543
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,150
How time

544
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,460
flies.

545
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,940
Grandma, you're mistaken.

546
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,400
Chen has not married yet.

547
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,900
Well,

548
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,940
according to tradition,

549
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,180
he is not yet engaged,

550
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,120
but he's almost there.

551
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:25,940
Isn't it?

552
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,420
Yes.

553
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,420
Me and Shi Yi.

554
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,700
We already obtained our marriage certificate.

555
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,820
Congratulations, Chen.

556
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,420
That mountain villa.

557
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,660
They haven't been there yet, right?

558
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,540
No, they haven't.

559
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,640
Let's burn some incense there.

560
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,620
So that the whole family could get some luck.

561
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,320
Bring your two daughters-in-law.

562
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,740
And also have a vegan meal

563
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,840
in the villa.

564
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,460
Okay.

565
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,320
Let's eat, the food's getting cold.

566
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,100
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,460
Dig in, dig in.

568
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,270
Let's eat.

569
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,520
Let's eat.

570
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,980
[Family of Book and Rituals]

571
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,780
Shi Yi,

572
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,940
my mother wants you

573
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,180
to sit in the same car with us.

574
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,940
Go ahead.

575
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,120
Please get in, Miss Shi Yi.

576
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,960
People need time

577
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,580
to solve their differences.

578
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,780
Let them go.

579
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,300
After some disputes,

580
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,920
maybe in the future,

581
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,680
their relationship

582
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,690
will be stronger than ours.

583
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,780
Grandma,

584
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,420
thanks for coming by.

585
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,100
No need to thank me.

586
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,380
Lian Sui told me

587
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,010
you were not staying in the same room with Shi Yi

588
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,040
last night, huh?

589
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,300
Did the two of you fight?

590
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,080
The two of you were fine at my place.

591
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,800
What happened when you came back here?

592
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,700
Our relationship is great.

593
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,780
We're fine, Grandma.

594
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,780
Let's get in.

595
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,060
Shi Yi,

596
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,500
I haven't had the chance to tell you

597
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,660
that you look pretty.

598
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,340
Thank you.

599
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,180
Ren.

600
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,140
You can't judge people based on how they look.

601
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,140
I have told you.

602
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,540
Don't indulge yourself in

603
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,500
beautiful things and other pleasures.

604
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,820
They can turn into things that rot your soul.

605
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,020
Don't you remember?

606
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,340
I do.

607
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,980
Lust and pleasure

608
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,420
will distort one's mind.

609
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,780
And we should never get addicted.

610
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,180
But Shi Yi being good-looking

611
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,620
is a hard fact.

612
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,460
Giving praise to something beautiful

613
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,660
and appreciating it

614
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,660
is also

615
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,180
something you taught me.

616
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,760
I won't recognize

617
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,180
your marriage.

618
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,420
You should seriously think about

619
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,380
whether you want to insist on

620
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,420
staying with my son.

621
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,780
Here we are.

622
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,940
What did you two talk about?

623
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:40,940
Nothing much.

624
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,020
I don't think it's anything significant.

625
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,780
Let's go.
