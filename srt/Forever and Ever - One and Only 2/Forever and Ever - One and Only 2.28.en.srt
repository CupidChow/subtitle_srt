Your arm is broken,

347
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,400
it's not convenient for you to look after her.

348
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,120
You can go visit them and apologize

349
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,240
after you've recovered.

350
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,440
I'll go with you then.

351
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,480
Let's go home.

352
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,770
They won't even let him see her!

353
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,160
He must feel terrible!

354
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,760
Why didn't he tell them

355
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,880
that they've gotten married?

356
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,120
At least they'd allow him

357
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,800
to see her if they knew.

358
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,320
It's understandable that her parents

359
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
are angry

360
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
and can't forgive him for now.

361
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,320
I do understand, but...

362
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,890
I can do it on my own.

363
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,200
Then I'll pull the car out.

364
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,720
I called a designated driver.

365
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
We are all here,

366
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,640
why did you call a designated driver?

367
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,120
It's okay. Don't bother.

368
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,000
I can go

369
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
by myself.

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,040
Dine out?

377
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,320

I usually come home later than you do.

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,520
When you are alone,

412

Shi Yi has some work to do.

464
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,040
