3
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,440
Sis, you can't fall asleep?

4
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
I can't.

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,639
But I can't stay awake either.

6
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:01,720
I get it.

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
You're meeting his parents tomorrow.

8
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm sure you can't sleep.

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
Keep your voice down.

10
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,360
When I think about the fact that

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm going to meet my future cousin-in-law,

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't sleep either.

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
I told you to keep your voice down!

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
I think

16
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
older people are so old-fashioned.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,440
You just met him and then got engaged.

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,760
How romantic is that!

19
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,120
Are there still such men nowadays?

20
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Don't generalize them.

21
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,400
There are still good men out there.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Yeah, my future cousin-in-law.

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,240
You haven't even met him.

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
And you think he's good?

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
It's my intuition, my sixth sense.

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
You're still awake?

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,880
I bought a new phone.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
You do need a phone.

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,280
Otherwise

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,600
she'll feel insecure

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
if she can't get a hold of you.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,680
This is the only impulsive thing

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
I've ever done.

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm really scared it won't end well

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
and somehow ruin her chances at meeting someone better.

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,720
I think

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,079
getting married needs impulsiveness

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,960
and a lot of it.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
I also saw a girl

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,440
in Xi'an.

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,760
Even though I only saw her for a few seconds,

42
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,240
her face

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,880
had left a deep impression

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
in my mind.

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I can't forget her.

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
If I could see her again,

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,600
I would probably propose to her immediately

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,480
as you did.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
I hope you can meet her again.

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,040
How is that even possible?

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
If it's fate, you'll meet her again.

A scientist that has fallen love

53
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,959

54
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,120
mysterious things now.

Tell me,

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,160
what's it like to be in love?

58
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,520
You've asked

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
the wrong person.

What?

68
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,680
You want to send "Kiss, baby",

"Good night, baby",

70

but you're afraid I'll see that?

71

You little brat.

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,520
All you think about is this stuff, huh?

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,040
I was thinking

74
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,160
if I should tell him to bring gifts

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,440
in case he forgets.

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,920
Do you think he is stupid?

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Even I know

78
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,080
you have to bring gifts when meeting someone's parents.

79
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
He doesn't think like us.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
He lives a simple

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
and boring life.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,080
All he does is work in his lab

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,040
and go to meetings.

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,640
He could even watch a TV series

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
for more than 70 times.

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,120
Oh, he does sound a bit weird now.

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
But giving him a reminder

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
would seem like I'm asking for gifts.

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
It seems like a bad idea.

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,040
It's okay.

Yeah.

I forgot to ask before.

107
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Are you nearsighted?

108
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
A little farsighted.

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
Farsighted?

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,400
Isn't that presbyopia?

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,360
You brought so many people.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,480
They'll help me

bring the things upstairs later

What are you waiting for?

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
Invite him in.

Chen, we'll wait for you downstairs.

This is Zhousheng Chen.

My uncle and auntie.

131
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,320
Uncle, Auntie.

132
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,600
Uncle, Auntie.

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
Take a seat.

134
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,280
Yes, have a seat.

135
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,840
Sit, sit, sit.

136
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
My mother is not able to come

137
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,280
because of her health.

138
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,400
But she asked me

139
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,280
to bring these as a token of appreciation.

140
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,080
You're too generous.

141
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,400
Bringing all these expensive gifts for us.

142
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,960
It's all my mother's intention.

143
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,920
Sis, these look so pretty.

144
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
They don't look fake.

145
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,720
I didn't know

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,120
what girls like.

147
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
So I prepared this in advance.

148
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,039
Hope you will like it.

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,159
There is even something for me?

150
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
Thank you, cousin-in-law.

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
It looks so good!

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,000
I forgot to make some tea.

153
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,680
I'll go get some tea.

154
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Go, go.

155
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,000
Go, go.

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,400
Chen.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
I heard from Shi Yi that

158
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,080
you've just finished

159
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,640
your exchange in Xi'an.

160
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,160
That's right.

161
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,560
I got back not long ago.

162
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
I've been going back and forth

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,400
between Zhenjiang and Shanghai recently.

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,320
You came to Zhenjiang

165
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,040
for ancestor worship, right?

166
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,800
That was one of the reasons.

167
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,960
The other is about the investment meeting.

168
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
The research you're working on

169
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,760
has something to do with this?

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,240
My family is the organizer

171
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
of this investment meeting.

172
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,280
That's right.

173
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
This invitation has the character Zhou printed on it.

174
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,480
I didn't expect it to be your family.

175
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,200
Yes.

176
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,240
Great.

177
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
Great news!

178
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,120
It will benefit the people here

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,440
to attract investment.

180
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,360
It's a great thing!

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,720
I need to have a good talk with you today.

182
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,760
All right, stop it.

183
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
He came all the way here today to visit

184
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,080
Shi Yi's parents.

185
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
Talk about your business later.

186
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,040
Right.

187
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,600
This is not the business today.

188
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
Today it's for something else.

189
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
But I really didn't expect

190
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
the organizer and us

191
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
to be one family.

192
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,760
Yes, we'll be one family.

193
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Here.

194
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Have some tea.

195
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Thank you, Uncle.

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,360
They have prepared such generous gifts.

197
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,920
I feel like it would look bad on us

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,240
to have lunch at home.

199
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
What does he like to eat?

200
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll order some food.

201
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
We won't be eating at home.

202
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,920
His mother wants to invite me to lunch.

203
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,080
I see.

204
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,000
It's rare for you to come to Zhenjiang.

205
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
It's good to visit his home.

206
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Am I right?

207
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,480
Let's go then.

208
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm really sorry

209
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,720
for not being able to stay

210
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,160
for lunch today.

211
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,280
Look at you.

212
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,240
You've said you're sorry

213
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
for a dozen times.

214
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,960
My family

215
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,400
is quite casual about these things.

216
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,160
It's okay.

217
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,200
Shi Yi

218
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,680
rarely comes to Zhenjiang.

219
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,400
So it would be good for her to visit your mother.

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,960
How about this?

221
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
When you're in Shanghai,

222
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,960
come to our home for a meal, okay?

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,760
Okay.

224
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,760
You two can go then.

225
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,360
Wait for me.

226
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
I'll change into something formal.

227
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,800
Come with me.

228
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,200
Looks like Shi Yi really likes him.

229
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
It seems they have a good relationship.

230
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
I think so too.

231
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,800
What do you your mother usually prefer

232
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,120
girls to wear?

233
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
You can wear anything.

234
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,920
No need to be so deliberate.

235
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,120
I can't be casual.

236
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
I have to respect her on our first meeting.

237
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,920
You've dressed yourself up

238
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,200
to meet my parents.

239
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,760
How can I not do the same for your mother?

240
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Last night I had someone

241
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,400
prepare a few Qipao dresses for you.

242
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,160
They're all the styles

243
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
my family would usually wear.

244
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,480
If you don't mind,

245
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,000
I can ask the tailors to come upstairs.

246
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,080
They're downstairs.

247
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,880
Okay.

248
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,160
There was very little time

249
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,280
so we haven't had time to iron the dresses.

250
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,360
What if there's no time constraint?

251
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
Sewing accounts for 30% while ironing accounts for 70%.

252
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
Old people stress this,

253
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,760
especially his mother.

254
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
She's very particular about this.

255
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,160
Miss Shi Yi.

256
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,640
Look at these jewels.

257
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,720
Which one do you prefer?

258
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,640
Okay, the Qipao is ready.

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
What's the problem?

260
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
You have to go out.

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I need to get changed.

262
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,680
Sorry.

263
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,280
Chen.

264
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,280
Actually, I'm also a businessman.

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,760
But

266
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,520
the economy in the past two years

267
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
hasn't been very good.

268
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh my.

269
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
She looks so different

270
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,920
wearing a Qipao.

271
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,240
Yeah.

272
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,920
Miss Shi Yi, would you like some water?

273
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
No, I'm not thirsty.

274
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,040
Uncle Lin, you don't have to be so polite.

275
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,960
I should be.

276
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
When you came to work in Zhenjiang,

277
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,600
I thought Uncle Lin

278
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,280
was your temporary driver.

279
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,000
For you.

280
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,360
What is it?

281
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Open it.

282
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
Isn't this for children?

283
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,040
My family

284
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
prepared this.

285
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,400
They asked me to give it to

286
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
my future wife.

287
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,720
It's engraved with my birth date.

288
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,060
[Xinmo   Gengzi   Jisi    Gengwu]

289
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
The birth date of Zhousheng Chen.

290
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
That's precious.

291
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I have one too.

292
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,600
I'll ask my mother to find it.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
But the one I have is only for collecting.

294
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,480
It can't be worn.

295
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,720
Miss Shi Yi.

296
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,640
Even if your hundred-year-old lock can be worn,

297
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,200
It doesn't seem right

298
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
to let a man who's almost 30 years old

299
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,960
to wear it.

300
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
I didn't mean for him to wear it.

301
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,280
I just want to give it to him as a souvenir.

302
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,440
Uncle Lin is joking with you.

303
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,280
It didn't sound like a joke.

304
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,280
He didn't even smile.

305
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,720
He's like this sometimes.

306
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Let's chat a little.

307
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,560
Okay.

308
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
What does your family do?

309
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
Well.

310
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,240
It's complicated.

311
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,720
Our family was in manufacturing in the beginning.

312
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,480
Now we mainly focus on investments.

313
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
The invitation letters for the investment meeting

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
only had the character Zhou on it.

315
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
Why is it not Zhousheng?

316
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,560
There is a tradition in our family.

317
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,080
Only the eldest son's last name is Zhousheng.

318
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,280
What about the others?

319
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,960
The others' last name is Zhou.

320
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,440
In other words,

321
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,120
you are the only one in your family whose last name is Zhousheng

322
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,840
while all your younger brothers have the last name Zhou?

323
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
That's about right.

324
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
Why is that?

325
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,760
There are exceptions.

326
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,200
You will find out

327
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,200
when you meet my family.

328
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,400
Okay.

329
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,319
So are we going to start living together

330
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,280
after we meet your mother?

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,440
I don't think so.

332
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm not asking this

333
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,400
because I want to live with you.

334
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,640
I've never gotten engaged.

335
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,640
So I'm not sure

336
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,680
about what you have in mind.

337
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,480
I think...

338
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,760
I think

339
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,680
we don't have to

340
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,840
change or disrupt

341
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,960
anything else in our lives

342
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,200
except for the engagement.

343
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,280
It's just like my research.

344
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,440
We'll decide on a research topic

345
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,760
before conducting experiments.

346

By doing so,

347
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,800
it would be a reasonable

be stressed out about this.

353
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,960
I should warn you

about my mother.

coldly.

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,080
It's not because of you.

358
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,520
It's because of me.

359
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
You two had a fight?

360
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,280
Sort of.

361
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
Is there anything I should avoid?

362
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,480
Or is there anything

363
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
to watch out for?

364
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,120
Nothing.

Okay.

366
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,920
I have one more question.

367
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
You have my family information?

368
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,600
Yes, I do.

369
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,000
Why do you have that?

370
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,320
My family wanted to know about you.

371
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,560
Because

372
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,560
our encounter was rather special.

373
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
Were they afraid that I'd be a bad person?

374
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,040
But

375
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,400
I was really surprised at myself

376
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
that day for stopping you.

Do all the people around you all have the last name Lin?

381
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,280
He's my nephew.

382
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,680
No wonder.

383
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,680

You should hurry!

389
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
You've lived here since you were a kid?

390
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,320
Only for a few years.

Hello, Auntie.

Hello, Miss Shi.

Have you had lunch yet?

402
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,080
I haven't.

403
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,360
It's the Qingming Festival these days

Okay. Thank you, Auntie.

There's no need to go out.

But it won't fall off.

about my mother's attitude.

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,800

451
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,320

when all the preparations she had done these ten years

461
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
were all pointless

462

No wonder what?

465

The way she looked at me

466
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,960
made me think I had said something

467
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,600
or did something rude.

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,200
we can have a reason to come out

521
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,280
for something nice.

522
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,120
I'm not staying for long this time.

523
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,880
Maybe next time.

524
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,480
I've been scared to sleep these two days.

525
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Miss Shi Yi.

526
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,000
Would you be afraid

527
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
to stay at an old house?

528
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,400
I think I'll be fine.

529
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,040
If I were you,

530
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,120
I'd get out of that place

531
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,240
with your pregnancy as an excuse.

532
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,480
I already didn't go to ancestor worship rituals

533
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
because of that.

534
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
I'm afraid I'll get a lecture from my parents

535
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,640
if I don't live there.

536
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,720
Good thing it's only once every four years.

537
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,600
Otherwise, if I had to live in that place all the time,

538
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,080
I'd go crazy.

539
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,040
By the way,

540
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
where would you

541
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,240
be stationed this time?

542
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,360
Xi'an?

543
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,400
I haven't decided yet.

544
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,320
If you're working here,

545
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
are you going to move your house

546
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,120
here?

547
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,920
Shi Yi works in Shanghai.

548
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,400
It's not convenient for her to go to Xi'an with me.

549
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,840
Maybe

550
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,920
I'll end up going back and forth

551
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,960
between the two places.

552
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,120
Living apart affects your relationship.

553
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,680
You need to hold him tight and not let him go.

554
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,440
Couples need to live under the same roof

555
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,920
to be considered a couple.

556
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,200
Yes.

557
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,080
If you had a child later on,

558
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,600
would you leave Shi Yi with the responsibility of taking care of the child?

559
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,040
Even if someone else can help with it,

560
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,840
dads can't be absent.

561
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
We haven't thought that far.

562
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,880
People in the honeymoon phase

563
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
are blind to reality.

564
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,760
Chen.

565
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,920
You are a man.

566
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,160
You have to think about these things.

567
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,840
I know.

568
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,880
Someone sounds perfunctory.

569
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I'm not being perfunctory.

570
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
I'm already thinking about it.

571
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,080
Do you come here often?

572
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,200
Not very often.

573
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,120
But my uncle

574
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,600
gets along the best with my father.

575
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,200
I see.

576
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,320
What?

577
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,360
I understand

578
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,440
what relationship they have now.

579
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
When are you leaving Zhenjiang?

580
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,360
The day after tomorrow.

581
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
I'll be gone for half a month after this.

582
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,520
When I return,

583
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll go to your house to discuss the details of our engagement.

584
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,960
Don't you need to consider

585
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,160
your mother's opinion?

586
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,560
In this case,

587
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,960
only one woman's opinion

588
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,120
is worth taking into account.

589
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,280
And that's you.

590
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,800
But I'll have to face her later on.

591
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,320
It'll be fine.

592
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,560
There's one thing I want to ask you.

593
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,800
After I start working,

594
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,080
I might not

595
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,320
be able to answer all your calls.

596
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,000
So I'd like to

597
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
set a fixed time

598
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,040
when we can talk on the phone every day.

599
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,080
Every day?

600
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,080
All right, I can do that.

601
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm relatively free

602
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,240
after I wake up,

603
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
before lunch and before I go to bed.

604
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,040
Okay.

605
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,640
Then let's call each other during these times.

606
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,880
Do you have any suggestions

607
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,920
on the specific time?

608
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,840
7 am, 11 am,

609
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,480
and 11:30 pm.

610
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay.

611
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,440
7 am, 11 am,

612
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,520
and 11:30 pm.

613
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
I'm going in then.

614
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,920
Be careful on your way back.

615
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,960
Except for being made out of pure gold,

616
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
does it have other meanings?

617
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,360
It doesn't look like an antique.

618
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
I don't think it's anything special.

619
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,440
I think it's similar to the ones we had when we were kids.

620
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,880
This is much worse than the gifts

621
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,080
his mother gave us.

622
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,159
Is it possible that his mother is in charge of the finance

623
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,520
in their family

624
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,199
while he has no real power at all?

625
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,000
You sure are concerned.

626
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,199
A gold lock is simple.

627
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,080
I like it.

628
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,920
I'll give you mine if you like it.

629
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,159
I have a lot of them.

630
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,120
I got a dozen of them

631
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,440
when my relatives came to celebrate my one month after birth.

632
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,480
They're all in a drawer in my parents' bedroom.

633
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,239
I'll give them all to you.

634
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,840
Keep them for yourself.

635
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:35,179
[Xinmo   Gengzi   Jisi    Gengwu]

636
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,920
Your family is hosting the investment meeting,

637
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,400
but you had me give the speech.

638
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,840
I was so nervous.

639
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,960
If this is my profession,

640
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,120
I would have no problems.

641
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,640
But I still think you are right for

642
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,240
this kind of

643
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,880
business meeting.

644
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,600
Your speech just now

645
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,440
was pretty good.

646
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Thanks, I guess, for the opportunity.

647
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,880
Did you contact Shi Yi?

648
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes.

649
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,000
I made a phone call this morning

650
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,960
to say good morning.

651
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,480
And you'll call her again at night

652
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,560
to say good night.

653
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,760
There is one more at 11 am.

654
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,880
What's wrong?

655
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,320
Nothing.

656
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,480
As long as

657
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,080
your fiancee's fine with it,

658
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,560
I have no say in this.

659
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,040
I think I'm doing good.

660
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,560
She sounded like she was in a nice mood

661
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,560
on the phone.

662
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
She laughed twice.

663
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,080
Not bad.

664
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,360
Zhousheng Chen

665
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,280
came all the way here to see us off.

666
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,720
That's very thoughtful.

667
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,240
This kid does things by the book.

668
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,400
He doesn't seem arrogant or easily irritated.

669
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,000
He's definitely a researcher.

670
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,400
Let me ask you.

671
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
Don't you

672
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,880
guys get bored when you two are together?

673
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,160
Not at all.

674
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,720
Wouldn't it be too rigid to

675
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,320
have specific times to call each other?

676
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,600
On the contrary, I think

677
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,560
he's very serious about me.

678
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,160
Everything is nice as long as you like him, huh?

679
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,960
Uncle, auntie.

680
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
When I get back from my business trip,

681
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,800
I'll go to your home first

682
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
to pay you a formal visit.

683
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,520
Okay.

684
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,600
Work should still be your priority.

685
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,720
We are in Shanghai all the time.

686
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
You can come anytime.

687
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,520
Okay.

688
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,920
We're leaving then.

689
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,520
Okay.

690
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,440
Have a safe trip.

691
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,280
Okay. Goodbye.

692
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,240
I'll go then.

693
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,400
Remember to wear your seat belt,

694
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,000
even in the back seat.

695
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,120
Okay.

696
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,120
Bye, bye.

697
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,800
Bye.

698
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,640
What are you looking at?

699
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,640
They're already so far away.

700
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,800
Let's go.

701
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,240
The car is over there.

702
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,720
I've been back for an hour.

703
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
You didn't talk to me once.

704
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,920
You've been busy packing your things

705
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,440
and taking a shower.

706
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,760
You just got everything done, didn't you?

707
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,360
I want to talk to you about something.

708
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,640
What?

709
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,440
In Zhenjiang, me and Zhousheng Chen...

710
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,200
You met each other?

711
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,360
I knew the two of you

712
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,280
would meet up.

713
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,000
We did see each other.

714
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,080
Your relationship with him is developing well I see!

715
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,000
He asked you out or you asked him out?

716
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,360
He asked me out.

717
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,480
He got the hang of things now.

718
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
He's on the ball now.

719
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,760
Back in Xi'an,

720
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,120
he was still a naive boy.

721
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,640
See you later.

722
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,880
Am I right?

723
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,080
Go on.

724
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,200
What did you do on the date?

725
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,920
Watched a movie, had dinner?

726
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,760
You can't say?

727
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,960
Could it be that

728
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,440
you guys had hugged?

729
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,440
No.

730
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,400
I knew things wouldn't go so fast.

731
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
Although I've only met Zhousheng Chen

732
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,200
a few times,

733
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,480
I can see that

734
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
he's a conservative person.

735
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,880
He proposed to me.

736
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,680
What did you say?

737
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,160
Say it again.

738
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,280
He proposed to me.

739
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,600
Why?

740
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,040
What do you mean why?

741
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
He wants to get married, of course.

742
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,440
You said yes?

743
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,800
I never thought

744
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
the only person around me

745
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,960
who would do a flash marriage is you.

746
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,960
I didn't expect myself to agree to it either.

747
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,600
But

748
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,400
it feels good.

749
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,880
I can tell.

750
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,040
You're glowing now.

751
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah right!

752
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:58,760
But

753
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,120
isn't he working in Germany?

754
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,000
What are you going to do

755
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,680
after you two get married?

756
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,960
Long-distance?

757
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,240
He had planned to come back long ago.

758
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,720
He went to Xi'an

759
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,360
because he had to help set up

760
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,640
the new lab.

761
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,000
He handed in his resignation letter a few days ago.

762
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,680
I think it will be a few more months

763
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,800
before he can come back.

764
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,800
This is so much information.

765
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,800
Let me process it first.

766

[Recording Studio]

767
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,440
Mother, I know

768
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,400
you wanted to give your life

769
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,280
in exchange for my life.

770
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,360
But I can't escape.

771
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,120
I can't let you die for me.

772
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,880
And I can't involve

773

the thousands of people in Qinghe.

774
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,120
Ever since I entered the royal mansion,

775
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,280
Master has taught me many things

776
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,520
and my peers loved me.

777
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,440
I've never been able to return the favor.

778
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,200
Today, Master died of injustice.

779
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,280
My peers were cruelly slaughtered.

780
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,560
My enemies are close to me

781
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,440
yet I can't kill them.

782
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,120
It's already a great pain.

783
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,600
There is no way I would marry him.

784
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,200
I'm sorry for letting you down, Mother.

785
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,400
Thank you for raising me.

786
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,760
Mother, please allow me to

787
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,160
renounce my last name

788
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,320
and to be removed from the family book.

789
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,960
From now on,

790
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,800
there won't be an unfilial daughter in the Cui family.

Thank you.

794
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,520
There are too many crying scenes in this drama.

Miss Shi.

796
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,240
A person who claimed to be your family

797
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,800
has ordered dinner for the whole crew.

798
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,040
I didn't know he ordered food for us.

799
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,880
Now that it's arrived, let's eat together.

This was specially ordered, right?

805
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,280
It's all restaurant food.

806
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,360
And by the looks of it,

807
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,440
it's not from some nearby restaurant.

808

Do we know him?
