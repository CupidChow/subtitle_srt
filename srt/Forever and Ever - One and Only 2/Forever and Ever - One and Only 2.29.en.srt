00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,360
But you sitting here all day long

176
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,920
wouldn't help with anything,

177
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
not to mention that your injury hasn't healed yet.

178
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
You should go back and take some rest.

179
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,560
It's okay.

180
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,320
I'll be fine.

181
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,960
Have some water.

182
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,640
We need to think about what to do next.

183
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,160
Life needs to go on,

184
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,520
and we don't know when Shi Yi

185
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,640
can wake up.

186
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
The good thing is

187
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,640
that you , I,

188
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,960
and the care attendant

189
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
can take turns to take care of her.

190
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,120
But what are you

191
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
going to do with the one outside?

192
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,480
We both know him well.

193
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,840
To be fair,

194
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,840
he's always been a good kid.

195
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
But it's true that without him,

196
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,880
our daughter wouldn't have

197
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,640
had to suffer this misfortune.

198
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,400
How about this?

199
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,280
Let's have a talk with him

200
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,320
and see what he's going to do.

201
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
Ignoring him like this

202
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,079
will get us nowhere.

203
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Chen.

204
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,960
Mr. Shi.

205
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,280
Please come in.

206
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,680
I never left.

207
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm always here for you.

208
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm there

209
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,120
whenever you want to see me!

210
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,720
Chen.

211
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,960
We need to talk.

212
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
In front of Shi Yi,

213
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
we'd like to figure out a plan for the future.

214
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,080
We had no idea

215
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,640
that you two got married.

216
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,800
We thought

217
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,760
separating you two would be

218
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,440
the best for everybody.

219
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,800
But we didn't expect that you had

220
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,160
obtained your marriage certificate already.

221
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,720
Of course,

222
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,440
a certificate

223
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,160
is not everything.

224
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,200
So,

225
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,880
if… if you want to leave,

226
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,360
we won't stop you.

227
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
We can take care of Shi Yi ourselves.

228
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,120
When she wakes up,

229
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
you can get an official divorce.

230
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,600
I won't leave her,

231
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,640
neither will I divorce her.

232
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,560
That's not what Shi Yi and I want.

233
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,560
We've told you

234
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,240
that we don't want you to take responsibility.

235
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,160
Why won't you just let go?

236
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
She's my wife.

237
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
Always been and always will be.

238
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,040
We've been destined

239
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,480
to be together forever

240
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040
since the moment we met.

241
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
What if she never wakes up?

242
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,560
If she never wakes up,

243
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
I'll take care of her for the rest of my life.

244
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
In fact, this week,

245
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,600
every day I'd wake up

246
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,400
at 5:30 a.m.

247
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,240
and leave the hospital.

248
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,160
After I get home,

249
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,360
I'd take a shower and change,

250
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,920
and then go to work.

251
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,520
I have my three meals

252
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,320
in the cafeteria of the institute.

253
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,800
After leaving work on time,

254
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,920
I'd ask the attending doctor

255
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
about Shi Yi's condition.

256
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,480
I did some calculations.

257
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
It takes me 20 minutes to drive

258
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,600
from the institute to the hospital,

259
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,960
40 minutes during

260
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,720
the peak hours.

261
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,840
Though it's a little far,

262
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,840
it's not a big problem.

263
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,040
If you agree,

264
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,680
I can find

265
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,840
a closer hospital,

266
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,960
so that I can save some time

267
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,840
on the commute.

268
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Shi Yi once told me

269
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,120
that she disliked hospital.

270
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,240
So I'm thinking

271
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,160
after her condition has stabilized,

272
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll arrange private medical care

273
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
for her and take care

274
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,240
of her at home.

275
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,080
That way,

276
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
I can have more time

277
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
to spend with her.

278
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm not quite sure

279
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,760
what you are getting at?

280
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,280
I've prepared to maintain

281
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,720
our marriage in this way.

282
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,160
I have faith that she'll wake up,

283
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,120
but I've also prepared myself

284
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
for the possibility of waiting

285
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,360
for a lifetime.

286
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,080
Your words

287
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,680
are something touching,

288
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,320
but I still can't let you off

289
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,360
or forgive you.

290
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,360
Mrs. Shi,

291
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,960
you are her mother.

292
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,800
Be it hatred, hostility,

293
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,320
or rage,

294
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,400
I accept however

295
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
you feel

296
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,440
about me.

297
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,040
But Shi Yi and I have never had

298
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,140
any problem in our relationship.

299
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,020
I can't live without her,

300
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,220
neither can she without me.

301
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,020
I believe

302
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,060
what Shi Yi wants

303
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,100
to see the most

304
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,420
is a complete, happy family

305
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,420
when she wakes up.

306
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,620
You can go back now.

307
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,620
She means for you

308
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,140
to go home and have some sleep.

309
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,260
We'll take turns

310
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,100
and take care of Shi Yi in the future.

311
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,340
Thank you, Mr. Shi!

312
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,260
Off you go.

Mrs. Shi.

334
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Her father stayed up a few nights in a row

335
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,380
and fell ill.

336
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,380
I'll leave her to you tonight.

337
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,540

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,640
♫Nothing will change♫

347
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,720
♫With the same warm sunny day♫

348
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,750
♫Give you my true love♫

349
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,310
♫Thank you for being there♫

350
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,500
I remember

351
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,140
every little detail

352
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
about what I did,

353
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,780
ate and said

354
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,140
in this week.

355
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,980
If you don't mind,

356
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,380
I'd love to share them

357
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
with you.

358
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,820
Although there's a wall between us now,

359
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,820
it won't stop me from thinking of you every day.

360
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,780
[Family of Books and Rituals]

361
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,860
Our family values blood ties the most

362
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,500
and has little tolerance for family feud.

363
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,100
Qin Wan,

364
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,660
things have become like this

365
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,300
because you overprotected him.

366
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,820
Our family has been hit hard this time!

367
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,820
And Chen's wife

368
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,910
is still in a coma!

369
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,540
The parents should take the blame for their children's mistakes.

370
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,220
He did such a horrible thing

371
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,140
because I failed in educating him.

372
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,140
I should leave even if

373
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,860
you don't ask me to.

374
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,860
Everyone, think about it.

375
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,300
Qin Wan has been managing

376
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,340
the clan for years and she's never

377
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,620
made any major mistake.

378
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,300
This time

379
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,500
it was Wenchuan's fault.

380
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,380
We can't blame Qin Wan for it.

381
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,260
That's right.

382
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,100
I'm not trying to give you a hard time.

383
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,140
But if she hadn't spoiled him so much

384
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,100
after Wenxing was gone,

385
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,020
something like this wouldn't have happened.

386
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,380
Shi Yi is still unconscious.

387
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,540
With so many things going on,

388
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,200
there's no trustworthy person to whom I can hand over the house yet.

389
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,700
When Chen and Shi Yi

390
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,300
come back,

391
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,140
I will step down

392
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,940
and move back to the Qin family.

393
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,660
You guys are chatting?

394
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,780
We came five minutes early.

395
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,340
We'll wait outside.

396
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,540
Please continue.

397
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,810
We'll take our leave.

398
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,650
You guys talk.

399
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,580
I'm a junior here.

400
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,340
Usually

401
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,780
I wouldn't speak first.

402
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,020
But,

403
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,210
today I'm here

404
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,450
to discuss an agreement with you two

405
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,390
as Zhousheng Chen's lawyer,

406
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm not familiar

407
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,500
with their matters.

408
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,780
I'll let Mei Xing explain.

409
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,130
Because of what happened to his wife,

410
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,950
he can't calmly face his family,

411
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,340
so he entrusts me with everything.

412
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,750
He and I

413
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,650
have gone over every article

414
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,580
in this agreement

415
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,980
when we were in Germany.

416
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,420
I can explain everything

417
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,580
you want to know

418
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,330
about the articles on his behalf.

419
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,380
His interest has always

420
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,800
been in scientific research.

421
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,990
When the investment plan is over,

422
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,380
which is in 10 years,

423
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,950
he's going to let Ren take over the Zhou family.

424
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,500
He has only

425
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,600
one condition, though,

426
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,990
that the foundation of the family business

427
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:56,780
must be based in China,

428
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,030
which can never change.

429
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,270
You two are both Ren's guardians.

430
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,040
Please take a look at the agreement.

431
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,870
I have no objections.

432
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,540
Even though I didn't give birth to Ren,

433
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,420
I'm the one who raised him.

434
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,659
He shares the same character and aptitude

435
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,940
as his elder brother.

436
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,620
But the Zhou family has traditionally

437
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,020
had the eldest son be the primary heir.

438
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,699
He said

439
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,980
you would have a way

440
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,100
to persuade the diehard members.

441
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,020
There's no need to worry.

442
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,940
Though I adopted Ren,

443
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,380
you are after all his father.

444
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,610
You should make

445
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,900
a decision on this.

446
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,460
I don't have

447
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,100
to hide anything from you two.

448
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,260
Given what happened,

449
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,620
I can't stay and continue

450
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,060
to manage this home anymore.

451
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,500
You can discuss the future matters

452
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,060
with Zhousheng Xing.

453
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,060
Ms. Qin.

454
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,350
Please hear me out.

455
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,900
What I'm about to say next concerns you.

456
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,020
He said

457
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,940
you had fully devoted yourself

458
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,700
into this family for years,

459
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,260
as if it was your child.

460
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,140
Over the past 20 years,

461
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,220
you've never given up on this family

462
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,980
despite all the hardships and difficulties.

463
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,740
And now

464
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,720
you don't have to, either.

465
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,180
You are more attached to this family

466
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,220
than he is.

467
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,080
The people here

468
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,540
are like you children.

469
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,650
If you insist on leaving,

470
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,070
no one will stop you.

471
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,980
But if you want to stay,

472
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,500
you are more than welcome to.

473
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,740
Today is my birthday.

474
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,380
What kind of gift

475
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,860
will you get for me?

476
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,340
I asked madam Wang

477
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,940
to make this outfit for you

478
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,050
on short notice.

479
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,340
It's named "cloud gown."

480
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
It was made by 10 embroidery girls,

481
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,210
implying flawlessness and perfection.

482
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,700
By the way,

483
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,900
I bumped into the doctor just now.

484
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,580
He warned me

485
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,700
that you might get confused

486
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,580
and not be able to recognize me

487
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,060
when you first wake up.

488
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,820
So I'll have to keep telling you

489
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,740
that we've gotten married

490
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,060
and that I'm your husband

491
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,980
in case you drive me out

492
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,060
and give the nurses something to laugh about.

493
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,540
I did one thing without asking

494
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,900
your permission, though.

495
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,380
I've found

496
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,580
an apartment in Xi'an.

497
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
We'll go there after your room

498
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,420
is ready.

499
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,580
And

500
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,700
your parents have approved.

501
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,300
I'll try to put away all the books

502
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,140
in the living room within half an hour.

503
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,300
And I'll let Cheng

504
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,700
put a movie on for you later.

505
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,420
I'll come back to check on you

506
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,500
after I'm done organizing.

507
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,000
"The bones of the beauty,"

508
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,300
"are rarely seen in this world."

509
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,210
"Some may have good bone structure, but not beautiful facial features."

510
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,900
"Many have beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure."

511
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
"Most people are shallow, seeing only the skin-deep appearance"

512
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,070
"and not the bones, the inside beauty."

513
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,670
Zhousheng Chen,

514
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,090
when writing this name,

515
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,870
two people would come to my mind.

516
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,100
One is you,

517
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,480
and the other is the reason I met you.

518
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,710
We talked about him a few times.

519
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,340
Because of the story of

520
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,380
the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

521
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,990
I took the initiative to introduce myself to you

522
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,060
at the airport in Guangzhou,

523
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,850
which was something

524
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,820
I'd never imagined I would do.

525
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,010
What was

526
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,780
your first thought about me?

527
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,500
You can tell me tomorrow

528
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,750
if it's good.

529
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,070
Otherwise,

530
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,180
you'd better say you had forgotten.

531
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,020
It's said that

532
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,020
he was a power-driven traitor.

533
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,610
I didn't believe that, though.

534
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:50,900
So

535
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,660
I searched all the clues I could find in the ancient books

536
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,600
and wrote a biographical note

537
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,450
on Zhousheng Chen,

538
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,070
the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

539
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,420
Of course,

540
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,220
as a scientist,

541
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,970
you may need evidence to support it.

542
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,010
Even so, please read this through,

543
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,860
or I won't marry you!

544
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,880
Why was he dismembered?

545
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,220
Because he was known

546
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,700
for his beautiful bones.

547
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
That was why the crown prince

548
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,500
decided to punish him by dismemberment

549
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,700
in front of everyone

550
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,550
to make an example of him.

551
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,580
[How stainless the water-lily rises from its slimy bed, how modestly it reposes on the clear pool.]

552
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,700
The Junior Prince of Nanchen stayed single for his whole life,

553
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,060
yet the rumor said he had a romantic relationship

554
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,820
with the crown princess.

555
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,120
After he was executed,

556
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,700
the crown princess also died.

557
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,060
Some said

558
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,360
she jumped off a 30-meter tower

559
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,100
in Nanchen Royal Mansion.

560
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,690
Some, however, said

561
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,700
she jumped off the city wall of the capital.

562
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,020
As opinions vary, no unanimous conclusion can be drawn.

563
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,620
Only the transcript of "Fu on the Imperial Park"

564
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,220
that the crown princess copied in the library of the mansion

565
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,140
remained a trace of evidence and became

566
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,780
a much-told story by later generations.

567
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,690
All glory of his life

568
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,060
was summed up in a few words

569
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,500
and has been long forgotten by the world.

570
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,220
Would you like to take a picture?

571
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,620
Seeing that you are dressed neatly

572
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,940
and in a good mood,

573
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,260
I feel much relieved.

574
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,780
About what?

575
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,940
Do you know how long you've

576
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,300
been sitting here?

577
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,060
I've been watching you for half an hour now

578
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,220
in case you'd do something stupid.

579
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,140
Excuse me,

580
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,740
is there anywhere I can go horseback riding in Chang'an?

581
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,060
I don't know about Chang'an,

582
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,140
but I'm sure Xi'an has one.

583
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,940
You need to go to a tourist spot, though.

584
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,700
Go online and check the travel strategy.

585
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,530
I'm sure you can

586
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,540
find a horseback riding place

587
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,100
where you can enjoy a trail ride

588
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:27,800
and have some fun.

589
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Don't do it in the downtown area.

590
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,020
Uncle Lin, I want to go back for one day.

591
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,940
There's something

592
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,140
I need to finish.
