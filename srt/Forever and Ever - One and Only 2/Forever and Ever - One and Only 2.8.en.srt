00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,940
Let's go.

173
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Chen.

174
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Slow down.

175
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,860
Chen.

176
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,820
Miss Shi Yi.

177
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,080
Chen.

178
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,660
I knew I could meet you here.

179
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,050
Did you walk down from up there?

180
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,020
It's okay.

181
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,140
Miss Shi Yi, how nice to meet you.

182
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,220
My name is Zhou Wenxing.

183
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,580
I am your future sister-in-law.

184
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,700
Nice to meet you.

185
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,460
My mom was there the other day,

186
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
sorry I didn't get a chance to talk with you.

187
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,740
But we can finally meet and talk today.

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,420
You are about to see my mom.

189
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,180
Are you nervous?

190
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,700
I'm fine.

191
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,980
Being nervous is totally normal.

192
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,580
Everyone at home is afraid of her.

193
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,560
Relax,

194
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,740
I've got your back.

195
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,140
You're really not built for mountain climbing,

196
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,260
so what are you here for?

197
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,100
It's...It's Xiaofu.

198
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,620
She says a pregnant woman needs a lot of walking.

199
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,980
I was worried about her,

200
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,580
that's why I joined her on her walk.

201
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,580
It's me.

202
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,580
The doctor says I need to walk every day for exercise.

203
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,020
Wenfang went out with me

204
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,100
and we happened to see Wenxing.

205
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
So, we went out together.

206
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,100
I can't pick up my pace as a pregnant woman.

207
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,580
She didn't make any great effort coming down here.

208
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,700
You don't have to worry.

209
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,580
Get in my car, let's go back.

210
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,980
I want to spend some time

211
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,060
talking with Shi Yi.

212
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,780
Hurry up.

213
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,820
It's okay.

214
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,100
We have plenty of time.

215
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Yeah.

216
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,580
You don't have to do it now.

217
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Let's get in the car for now.

218
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,860
I'm too tired from all this walking.

219
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,860
By the way, Chen,

220
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,060
we will try the dishes at noon.

221
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,260
Get home earlier,

222
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,900
or mom's gonna be unhappy again.

223
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,940
Bye.

224
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,340
We might need to

225
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,860
walk quite a way still.

226
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,900
It's okay, we have beautiful scenery to keep us happy.

227
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,900
We won't feel tired.

228
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,260
Let's go.

229
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,860
At your pace,

230
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,740
we might have to walk

231
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,740
for 50 or 60 minutes.

232
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,420
That far?

233
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,220
Can we make it in time to try the dishes?

234
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,820
Yes.

235
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,020
If not,

236
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,300
they are gonna have to wait for us.

237
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,860
After all, it's our engagement banquet.

238
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,660
This is a tough road for walking.

239
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,380
I do morning exercise regularly.

240
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,820
I am in perfect health.

241
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,620
While you

242
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,740
stay in a lab every day.

243
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,620
Can you make it?

244
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,180
When I was in college,

245
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,420
I had a hobby.

246
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,620
That was mountain climbing.

247
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,700
Why is your brother and sister's last name Zhou?

248
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,460
While your cousin's last name is Zhousheng?

249
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,140
After my father passed away,

250
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,980
in order to make the family business

251
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,300
run properly.

252
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,060
My uncle temporarily

253
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,900
took over as the owner of the house,

254
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,540
and changed his last name into Zhousheng.

255
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,660
His only son Ren

256
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,140
also changed his last name accordingly.

257
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,860
Wenchuan and Wenxing are twins,

258
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,260
can you see that?

259
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,660
Kind of.

260
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,180
But Wenchuan is

261
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,540
more mature than Wenxing.

262
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,580
In fact, Wenxing didn't stay in college

263
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,820
for long enough

264
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,260
before she came back home to recuperate.

265
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,660
So her chance to experiencing the world

266
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,460
was cut short,

267
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,340
which explains why she can be a bit naive.

268
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,820
I mean,

269
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,300
the old traditions are good.

270
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,900
You can have a meal at the engagement banquet,

271
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,690
and another at the wedding.

272
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah.

273
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,540
I mean, their second eldest son is married.

274
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,500
Now the eldest one is getting married.

275
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,500
We won't get to eat these dishes in the future, right?

276
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,420
Of course, we will.

277
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,100
At the red egg party.

278
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,680
You are seriously thinking way ahead.

279
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,640
And the third daughter, Wenxing.

280
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,900
The fourth, Ren.

281
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,420
Plus the engagement, the wedding.

282
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,820
And the red egg party again.

283
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,260
The wedding, that's right.

284
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,500
That's what I'm talking about.

285
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,680
Chen is back.

286
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,740
Why do you walk up here?

287
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,220
Just let us know, we can pick you up.

288
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,380
I saw it was a good day today.

289
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,940
So, I wanted to take a walk through the mountains.

290
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,540
That's right.

291
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Young people who don't walk a lot,

292
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,100
might end up growing lazy.

293
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,460
Uncle Lin, we are going inside.

294
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,500
Go ahead.

295
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,340
Uncle Lin enjoys making fun of you.

296
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,420
That's who he is.

297
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,580
Why is Mei Xing not here?

298
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,660
He is much older than you.

299
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,380
It is very rude of you

300
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,500
to call out his name like that.

301
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,260
Then how should I call him?

302
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,300
Brother-in-law?

303
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,940
If you keep talking like this,

304
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,180
I'll get mad at you.

305
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,660
What's this dish?

306
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,380
Lotus seedpod fish maw.

307
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,940
Fish maw?

308
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,780
Fish maw needs to first

309
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,500
be soaked in oil for twelve hours.

310
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,370
After it gets soft,

311
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,580
Keep it at a heat of 180 degrees to bloat it.

312
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,740
Then soak it at a low temperature.

313
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,660
Put in some stock in to season it,

314
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,740
and simmer it for about a minute on a low heat.

315
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,580
Can you make it?

316
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,540
I can't.

317
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,100
Then why would you know it inside out?

318
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,720
I heard our chef mentioned it once,

319
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,060
and so I remembered it.

320
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,100
If it's someone who doesn't know you well,

321
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,980
they must be thinking

322
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,460
you're showing off having such a photographic memory.

323
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,020
Chen.

324
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,860
My sister-in-law is so beautiful

325
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,540
that you're reluctant to

326
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,820
talk with us.

327
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,260
Instead, we always see you whispering there.

328
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,460
The whole lot of us are

329
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,580
feeling left out.

330
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,660
So, our bridegroom-to-be,

331
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,180
shall we start?

332
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,220
Dig in.

333
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,900
Are the dishes to your liking?

334
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,820
Chen.

335
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,220
You lured her deep

336
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,500
into the mountains

337
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,140
without arranging any activities?

338
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,540
Nothing really.

339
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,460
My future cousin-to-be.

340
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,740
Think about it.

341
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,859
Marrying him means

342
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,260
you're gonna stay deep in the mountains every year,

343
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,420
which is very boring.

344
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,500
Only you think it's boring, I guess.

345
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,339
I think it's great.

346
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,300
There's fresh air in the mountains.

347
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,099
I really like that.

348
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,579
Unlike you,

349
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,300
I hate this place.

350
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,460
Please hurry up and be born soon.

351
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,780
I am about to become a primitive soul.

352
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,140
Well.

353
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,060
Mom wants to see my sister-in-law?

354
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,660
No.

355
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,000
Your mother says...

356
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,060
It's okay, say it.

357
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,260
It is the play's last performance tonight.

358
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
She wants everyone to be present.

359
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,420
But she says

360
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,580
that Miss Shi Yi came from afar

361
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
and she needs rest, so...

362
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,820
no need for her to be there.

363
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,220
That's it.

364
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,020
She's not seeing her daughter-in-law?

365
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,140
Jiaren, this is your favorite.

366
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,100
Thanks, mom.

367
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,890
My dear brother and future sister-in-law are trying the dishes.

368
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,390
For the sake of looking lively,

369
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,690
they especially asked the juniors to be with them.

370
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,680
That's so thoughtful of him.

371
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,620
Are the dishes to your liking?

372
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,220
Was it so dramatic?

373
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
Yeah.

374
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,620
I was looking from outside

375
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,420
and I held my breath.

376
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,700
Seriously.

377
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,620
It's you who fear the cold,

378
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,900
not your mom.

379
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,060
You didn't see my sister-in-law.

380
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,060
What an awkward situation you just put her in.

381
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,780
You have never been

382
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,940
a mean mother-in-law.

383
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,940
You treated Jiaren so nicely.

384
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,380
Be nicer to my sister-in-law, will you?

385
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,860
Everyone's got his or her own temper.

386
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,420
Your brother decided of his own will

387
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,300
to marry a girl

388
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,500
I have never met before.

389
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,060
For that I respect him.

390
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,020
So if I don't favor this daughter-in-law

391
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,940
and do not want to see her,

392
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,220
you can't say a thing about that either.

393
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,860
Always some excuse.

394
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,220
What did you say?

395
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,500
I said you always have some point.

396
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,940
You can come up with a reason for anything on Earth.

397
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Mr. Chen.

398
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,180
Every time you come here

399
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,460
with this army of people.

400
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,140
Those who have no idea what's happening

401
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,980
would assume the Zhou family

402
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,060
owes you money and is paying you back in clothes.

403
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm a new tailor.

404
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,740
It's all bluffing with this number of people.

405
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,620
Is this about the future mother-in-law

406
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,740
inviting artists to

407
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,500
perform for the future daughter-in-law?

408
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,980
Miss Shi Yi is not there.

409
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,820
Does Mrs. Zhou not like her?

410
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,620
Sooner or later.

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,420
No hurry.

412
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,820
Come on, please.

413
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,900
My aunt used to

414
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,300
keep Jiaren around her

415
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,740
and treated her like her own daughter.

416
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,740
I was with Jiaren in the same elementary school.

417
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,020
She was the star of the day

418
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,540
since we were in school.

419
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,980
She had good grades,

420
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,180
and was the student representative chosen to give a speech every semester.

421
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,500
I mean, who wouldn't like her as a kid?

422
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
Zhousheng Chen didn't get better grades?

423
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,460
My cousin doesn't like to be in the limelight,

424
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,940
so no one would compete against her.

425
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,180
At that time,

426
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,620
all of the family thought they were going to get married.

427
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,060
No one expected things would turn out this way.

428
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,660
With someone so totally unconnected.

429
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,020
If it was me,

430
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,740
I would keep some distance.

431
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,860
Maybe it's not that surprising.

432
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,180
Maybe

433
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,900
Zhousheng Chen never really had any feelings for her.

434
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,340
It was all her crush.

435
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,340
Jiaren.

436
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,060
Next time you talk behind someone's back,

437
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,340
make sure you look over both shoulders.

438
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,860
If it bothered you,

439
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,380
just interrupt us from the beginning.

440
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,260
You'd eavesdropped for so long

441
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,900
and then blamed us for not knowing you were there?

442
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,340
You took them as your pet?

443
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,720
I'd say it's a coincidence.

444
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,260
I bought these

445
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,500
outside of the hotel you stayed at in Xi'an.

446
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,740
Is there any difference

447
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,580
between raising crabs and other animals?

448
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,740
Compared with other pets,

449
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,420
crabs are better at escaping.

450
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,660
The first time I got them to the dormitory,

451
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,660
due to my lack of experience,

452
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
they caught me unawares

453
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,660
and almost all of them got away.

454
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,340
So, what do they like to eat?

455
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,620
Small fish and shrimps, things like that.

456
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,500
Just because Chen raises crabs,

457
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,140
all the crab dishes at the engagement banquet

458
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,060
were taken away.

459
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,020
No one's gonna believe

460
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,100
that there's no crab dishes

461
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,260
being served at an engagement banquet

462
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,940
on the Yangtze River delta.

463
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,780
There's an emotional attachment after you raise them.

464
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,820
Then from now on, I won't eat crabs anymore.

465
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,060
Then from now on, I...

466
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,900
won't tell you when if I do!

467
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,300
New bedsheet, new duvet cover.

468
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
They are all brand new.

469
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,460
Just leave them there.

470
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,460
I can do it.

471
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,460
Okay.

472
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,500
If there's anything else,

473
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,820
feel free to let me know.

474
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,540
So, you can take a rest now.

475
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,940
I'll go to the next room

476
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,540
and get some sleep.

477
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,660
By the way,

478
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,100
if you need anything.

479
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,420
Just call me.

480
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,620
Come in.

481
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,820
I'd rather take my

482
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,700
pets back.

483
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,420
I am afraid they might wake you up at night.

484
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,180
Okay.

485
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,100
Good night.

486
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,140
Good night.

487
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,180
They are laid out the same way as in my family.

488
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,300
Hello?

489
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,380
I just wanted to say good night to you.

490
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,500
Did you buy all the stuff

491
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,660
in the sink?

492
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,820
I saw it once

493
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,740
when I went to your place,

494
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,900
and so I remembered it.

495
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,100
Again, showing off your memory.

496
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,060
No, that's not it.

497
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,300
Why do we have to use a phone

498
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
when we are one wall away from each other?

499
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,700
Isn't nighttime perfect for seeing one another?

500
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,380
I was afraid to disturb you.

501
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,820
Open the door.

502
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,060
I often work till 11 or 12 pm.

503
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I can't go to sleep early either.

504
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,180
Mr. Zhousheng.

505
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,500
Something just happened over there,

506
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,620
they want you to come quick.

507
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,580
You take a rest,

508
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
I'll check it out.

509
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,740
Well now, do you want to have some tea?

510
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Flower tea, good for sleeping.

511
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
No, I am not thirsty.

512
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,780
Okay.

513
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,180
Rest early.

514
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,500
Call me if there's anything else.

515
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,860
I simply pushed her on impulse,

516
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,580
I didn't expect anything like this to happen.

517
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,900
Where is everyone else?

518
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,540
They went to the hospital.

519
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,980
What about Zhou Wenchuan?

520
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,780
I don't know.

521
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,340
Why don't you ask me about it?

522
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,700
About what?

523
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,940
Ask me why

524
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,580
I argued with Tang Xiaofu?

525
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,360
I am not good at

526
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,340
dealing with these kinds of conflicts.

527
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,100
There's no point me asking why.

528
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,980
Because throughout the night,

529
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,340
they have been making comparisons

530
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,220
between me and your fiancée.

531
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,660
In their eyes,

532
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,740
I am a total loser.

533
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,300
Chen.

534
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,420
Jiaren.

535
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,180
Where is Shi Yi?

536
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,060
In her room.

537
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,060
That's good.

538
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,260
We are a big family with a lot of big mouths,

539
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,380
so that means a lot of troubles too.

540
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,260
We need to make sure Shi Yi is protected from these.

541
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,420
If she hears this crap too much,

542
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,700
she wouldn't be confident enough to marry you.

543
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
That's why

544
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,660
you need to spend more time

545
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,540
with her.

546
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,260
And talk more with her, you know?

547
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,860
Yeah, I got it.

548
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,220
Where are you going?

549
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,860
I want to take a walk.

550
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,180
Don't go outside.

551
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,940
His mom takes saving face very seriously.

552
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,660
What happened tonight is a stain on their family reputation.

553
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,020
If you happened to see this,

554
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,540
she would definitely be unhappy.

555
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,980
We should just stay in here and not look,

556
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,100
pretend we don't know about it.

557
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,380
Okay.

558
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
I'll go back to my room, then.

559
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,540
Rest early.

560
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,260
You poor thing.

561
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,180
There's no-one to keep you company tonight.

562
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,900
Come sleep with me.

563
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,060
Let's go.

564
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,780
You head to bed for now.

565
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,100
Chen, you are not sleepy?

566
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,620
She just went to bed,

567
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,820
so probably hasn't fallen asleep yet.

568
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,500
I don't want to risk waking her up again.

569
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,860
After half an hour or so,

570
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,940
I'll head back.

571
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
You are not going to sleep?

572
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,100
I am not sleepy, either.

573
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,100
The thing is, ever since you came back,

574
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,260
you've been followed by either the lawyer, Mr. Mei,

575
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,380
or my sister-in-law.

576
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,900
It's been impossible to get any alone time with you.

577
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,260
So I want to stay with you for a moment.

578
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,100
Chen.

579
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,220
I mean, you are doing a good job

580
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,220
in your scientific research,

581
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,660
and you are also very into this,

582
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,220
why would you come back?

583
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,220
You wouldn't understand

584
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,220
even if I told you why.

585
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,500
You couldn't figure it out.

586
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,420
But I could remember it.

587
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,620
I can't figure it out now.

588
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,860
But I could hold onto it and try to understand in the future.

589
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,460
I remember

590
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,780
when I was 3,

591
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,780
you told me that

592
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,700
because light travels faster than sound,

593
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,180
we always see the lightning first,

594
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,420
and then hear the thunder.

595
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,620
I can still recall it now.

596
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,540
Not bad memory.

597
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,260
In the past.

598
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,980
Domestic worker's wages used to be low

599
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,940
and that's why there are many OEMs.

600
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,780
Made in China...

601
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,860
This became the trend of manufacturing industry.

602
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,700
But now,

603
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,140
as the cost of Chinese labor increases,

604
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,070
Made in China

605
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,550
has gradually turned into

606
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,850
made in other countries.

607
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,219
So, a lot of OEMs face

608
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,980
either closure,

609
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,860
or transformation.

610
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,580
Capital always makes sure it's profitable

611
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,620
and take the world as its OEM,

612
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,659
so it only ever goes to low-cost areas.

613
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,300
But we can't do this.

614
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,420
A nation needs manufacturing.

615
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,139
Be it high-tech,

616
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,980
infrastructural, technical kinds,

617
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,420
we can't give them up.

618
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,460
I don't want to see our family

619
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,940
abandon the domestic foundation

620
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,900
and only seek to make money out of money.

621
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
That's why I am back.

622
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,060
Do you remember that?

623
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,260
Yes, I do.

624
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:44,060
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

625
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,139
Do you understand?

626
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,300
Yes.

627
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,860
It's pretty moist near the lake.

628
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,900
Be careful not to catch a cold.

629
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,540
Sit on my coat.

630
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,300
All those crappy things

631
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,740
happening tonight.

632
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,100
I suddenly pitied you.

633
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,940
A wife you just married

634
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,340
only cares about your brother.

635
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,820
What do you think?

636
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,060
She can do what she likes.

637
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,700
Did you have dinner?

638
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,180
I heard that

639
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,500
you returned all your food.

640
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,660
The stuff in your family is too delicate,

641
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,140
it's not made to be edible,

642
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,420
more like an exhibition.

643
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,660
Now you're starting to be sarcastic again,

644
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,460
looks like you are going to forgive me.

645
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,940
I just don't want to make it too nasty.

646
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,500
After all, we knew each other since we were small.

647
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,830
You said the same thing

648
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,260
when we had a quarrel back in high school.

649
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,260
In our second year in university, we fought and then went back to being friends,

650
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,560
back then you were saying pretty much the same thing.

651
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,540
You were saying,

652
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,540
due to the family relation,

653
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,540
you don't want it to turn ugly.

654
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,180
I will buy you some pot noodles tomorrow.

655
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,620
Next to the Jinshan Temple.

656
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,540
Your favorite kind.

657
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,820
I will go down the hill at 3:30 am

658
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,500
and come back at 5 am.

659
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
That way, I should make it to breakfast.

660
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,540
I don't buy it.

661
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,180
No one else needs to buy it,

662
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,980
as long as you do.

663
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,600
Mr. Zhousheng.

664
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,260
Do I need to wake her up?

665
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,060
No, it's okay.

666
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,380
Let her sleep a bit longer.

667
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,580
Okay.

668
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,500
Where is Xiaofu?

669
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,220
I didn't see her in the morning.

670
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,660
She went back home.

671
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,260
She's not attending the engagement banquet?

672
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,640
It is said she'll be going into labor soon

673
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,140
and left here last night.

674
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,980
Where is Shi Yi?

675
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,980
She's still sleeping.

676
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,780
Even though she's not married yet,

677
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,300
she should act like a local here.

678
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,460
I didn't tell her

679
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,900
what time we eat breakfast.

680
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,260
Chen.

681
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,620
I think your fiancee

682
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,420
is going to be a blessing for our Zhou family.

683
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,660
If she ever took over the household,

684
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,300
none of us would have to

685
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,340
get up so early to have breakfast.

686
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,500
Where is Wenchuan?

687
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,900
He didn't come back last night.

688
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,220
Let's eat, no need to wait.

689
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,540
Have some porridge.

690
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,460
Uncle Chen.

691
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,050
Change to another bowl and take it to Man.

692
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:00,820
Okay.

693
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,740
While it's still hot.

694
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:02,940
Will do.

695
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,660
Why are you so late?

696
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,220
I overslept.

697
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,380
This morning,

698
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,180
the two of you,

699
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,740
come to the hospital with me.

700
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,700
You don't have to go, Jiaren.

701
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,460
Good morning, Shi Yi.

702
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,510
Good morning.

703
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,900
Did you have your breakfast?

704
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,780
I did.

705
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,700
It's so thoughtful of Chen.

706
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,660
In order to increase your appetite,

707
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,180
he even carved the lotus shape out.

708
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,540
He carved this himself?

709
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,620
Yeah.

710
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,220
Ren says he did it while he was taking a break

711
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,780
from doing experiments.

712
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,020
Did you sleep well last night?

713
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,820
Yeah, quite well.

714
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,180
He had to go out for something urgent.

715
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,620
So, he asked me to spend some time with you.

716
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,020
I am not a child

717
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,580
who always needs someone accompanying me.

718
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,340
But he hopes

719
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,300
you have someone with you

720
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,500
every single minute you are in this family.

721
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,340
Meanwhile, you look so beautiful,

722
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,060
many people are eager

723
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,340
to do that favor.

724
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,300
Just now, Ren was trying to take over from me.

725
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,020
When you're finished,

726
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,140
I will take you somewhere nice.

727
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,500
Chen says

728
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,820
you have always wanted to come here.

729
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,660
Where is this place?

730
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,180
The library.

731
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,060
He says you asked him before

732
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,540
about the library.

733
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,500
That's why he guessed you would like this place.

734
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,020
There really is a library?

735
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,180
Yeah.

736
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,510
Let me show you around.

737
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,940
Here are some collections.

738
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,380
The first time Chen went to your parents' place

739
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,780
to visit them.

740
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,620
He handpicked the gift.

741
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,420
He spent the whole night searching for it.

742
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,060
There are people whose job it is

743
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,340
to clean this place every day.

744
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,340
So it should be dust-free.

745
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,300
By the way,

746
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,740
are you allergic to dust or any kinds of flowers or grass?

747
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,420
Chen, however,

748
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,340
is allergic to all of these.

749
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,620
One day if you quarrel with him,

750
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,140
you can make him smell a flower,

751
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,340
and he'll get a rash

752
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,740
all over his skin.

753
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,500
It's not very serious,

754
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,220
but it's a lot of fun.

755
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,100
I'm starting to seriously doubt

756
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,900
if you are a medical student.

757
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,580
Everyone tells me

758
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,740
allergies are no joke.

759
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,620
It can get pretty nasty if it turns serious.

760
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,860
I'm kidding.

761
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,420
In fact, his allergic reactions

762
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,660
are more like having a cold.

763
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Like sneezing and a runny nose,

764
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,660
and a high body temperature.

765
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,540
As long as he stays away from the allergen,

766
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,860
He'll be fine by the next day.

767
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,460
Here I am in the region south of the Yangtze River,

768
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,660
while the tower in my dream is in the far northwest,

769
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
thousands of kilometers away.

770
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,620
How can there be poetry from Shanglin county?

771
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,660
How tall is this building?

772
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,820
Dozens of meters.

773
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,260
You can read any book you like here.

774
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,460
They are all copies written by others.

775
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,780
The original ones are well preserved elsewhere.

776
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:21,820
Let's go.
