00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,720
Have you told her?

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
The sooner I tell her,

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
the more I'd worry.

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,800
I won't say anything until the delay is confirmed.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,240
And you?

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,800
What's going on?

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,199
Are you drunk again?

Everybody has his own problems.

You can't help with mine.

13

So, don't ask.

Let's go.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,520
It happened all of a sudden.

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
I don't think it was a coincidence.

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
It boils down to one thing,

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,920
to stop you from going back home.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
I even skipped my lunch

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,440

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,630
Thank you so much!

22
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll take you out for something nice after you are back!

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
I'll count on that!

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,230
You bet!

Bye-bye!

Miss Shi Yi.

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,110
What a coincidence!

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Not quite.

29
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,230
I've been in Bremen for a week.

30
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,710
And I hoped I could meet you.

31
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,290
Your brother didn't mention anything.

32
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,340
He didn't?

33
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,660
Maybe he was afraid that you'd misunderstand.

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,260
I'd misunderstand?

35
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,420
About what?

36
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,460
He and my wife…

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,340
Your wife?

38
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,420
You may not know

39
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,340
that my brother was once engaged

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,579
with my wife Tong Jiaren.

41
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,880
It a was long time ago.

42
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,060
And because of that,

43
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,060
Jiaren had been following my brother's steps

44
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,540
during her schooling years.

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,060
They were like

46
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,780
childhood sweethearts.

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,500
But for some reasons,

48
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,860
their engagement got canceled later.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,660
And then

50
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
she married me.

51
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,339
The things happened in between

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,540
were quite complicated.

53
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,660
You can ask my brother

54
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,260
if you wanna know.

55
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,060
My wife is as devoted into science

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,300
as my brother.

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,060
Honestly,

58
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
I don't quite understand them.

59
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
I'm as lonely

60
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,580
as you are.

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,780
I'd usually take a walk

62
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,900
in this neighborhood when I'm alone.

63
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,300

64
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,060

my marriage very much.

67

I don't want to ruin it

68
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
because of their relationship in the past.

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,260
So, I hope you can also keep it

to yourself.

71
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,220
Don't make a big deal out of it.

72
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,860
But it's got to be solved.

I haven't told others.

120

I don't think he did that.

121
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,500
But an investigation

122
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,820
is still necessary

124
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,580
It's an absurd accusation,

125
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,860
but he's willing to cooperate

126
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,420
and accept the financial investigation.

I met your younger brother today.

He came to you?

131
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,620
Did he give you

132
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,140
this ring?

133
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,060
Did he also tell you the relationship

134
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,980
between Tong Jiaren and me?

135
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,780
How much did he tell you?

136
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,380
Should I

137
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,740
tell you more?

138
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,700
You are not afraid that I'd be upset?

139
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,820
I believe

140
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,060
that you can make the right judgment.

141
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,700
Is this the ring you lost?

142
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,740
Yes.

143
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,100
No one would be that stupid

144
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,580
to give the ring engraved with a wedding date

145
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,100
to someone as a gift.

146
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,060
Perhaps someone found it and gave it to Tong Jiaren,

147
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,460
and then your younger brother misunderstood.

148
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,260
I'm glad you can think of it this way.

149
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,100
Don't you wanna explain it to him?

150
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,860
No need.

151
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,780
There's nothing that I should explain to him.

152
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,220
I've known Tong Jiaren

153
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,620
since childhood.

154
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,900
We went

155
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,140
to the same school

156
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,860
and studied overseas together.

157
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,500
Then we became colleagues at the same institute.

158
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,020
We worked together

159
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,340
once in a while.

160
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,140
Later,

161
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,340
her elder sister married my uncle,

162
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,100
so our engagement was canceled.

163
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,380
After that,

164
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,660
I don't know

165
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,140
what happened,

166
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,900
but she got married with Wenchuan.

167
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,820
Her elder sister?

168
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,500
She's Ren's mother.

169
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,780
But I've never seen her at home.

170
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,140
Ren's mother

171
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,980
passed away when Ren was only

172
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,380
a few years old.

173
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,620
Shi Yi.

174
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,580
Before, I didn't give much thought

175
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,180
to my marriage.

176
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,420
I only followed my family's arrangement.

177
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,380
If I did anything wrong,

178
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,940
or I made you unhappy,

179
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,380
please forgive me.

180
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,020
It'd be unreasonable to have you

181
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,500
apologize for the things happened in the past.

182
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,500
My grandma called me last night and told me

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,300
love was much more important

184
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,300
than reasoning

185
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,740
between a couple.

186
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,180
She reminded me

187
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,540
that if I made you angry,

188
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,420
upset, or sad,

189
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,260
it'd never go wrong

190
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,460
to apologize first.

191
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,180
She knows that I'm here?

192
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,460
Yes.

193
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
Why are you staring at me?

194
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,580
You are really not angry?

195
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,460
I'm really not!

196
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,940
Who's your

197
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,140
best friend in Germany?

198
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,980
My best friend

199
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,860
in Germany

200
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,900
is my former roommate.

201
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,500
Why don't we invite him over?

202
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,780
I wanna meet your friend.

203
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,220
Sure.

204
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,020
Does he like Chinese food?

205
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
Have you cooked any for him before?

206
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,620
He does.

207
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,300
I used to cook

208
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,980
all kinds of noodles for him.

209
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,580
You make our Chinese cuisine

210
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,820
sound so monotonous!

211
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,740
Wait for me.

212
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,460
Shopping list!

213
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,540
[Beef, tomato, potato, onion, peanuts, green pepper, pork belly, carrot]

214
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,180
Are they hard to find?

215
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,100
They are all common groceries.

216
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,580
I just noticed

217
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,260
that your handwriting

218
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,660
is really nice.

219
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,580
I asked you to check the items,

220
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
not my handwriting!

221
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,340
Let's go! Come on!

222
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,780
Let's go shopping!

223
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,460
Mr. Zhou.

224
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,100
All the documents that you signed

225
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,140
have been rejected.

226
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,060
All of them?

227
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,820
Yes.

228
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,140
They won't proceed the payment

229
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,380
unless they are signed by Mr. Mei.

230
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,300
But

231
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,060
today is the due day for the payment.

232
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,900
Where's my brother?

233
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,860
In his apartment.

234
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,220
This is from Mr. Zhousheng.

235
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,420
He said

236
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,420
the documents must be signed by Mr. Mei

237
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,700
no matter how urgent the project is.

238
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,500
There's no room for negotiation.

239
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,420
This

240
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,820
should belong to you.

241
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,460
[April 7]

242
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,940
Don't you wanna ask me

243
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,180
something about him when he was in school?

244
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,900
We were taught

245
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,620
by the same professor.

246
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,700
And he taught me Chinese.

247
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,380
No wonder your Chinese is so good.

248
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,740
It's made of meteorite, isn't it?

249
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,940
You can tell?

250
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,460
This is our expertise.

251
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,460
I can tell that at one glance.

252
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,740
It's a gift from Zhousheng Chen, right?

253
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,500
He told you about it?

254
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,460
Nah.

255
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,260
There's no way

256
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,380
he'd tell anybody about this.

257
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,260
But as his old classmate,

258
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,460
I can guess it.

259
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,100
Why?

260
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,700
The graduation gift

261
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,140
that his most respected professor gave to him

262
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
was a piece of meteorite.

263
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,220
He even made a joke and said

264
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,460
his Chinese wife often told him

265
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,620
that one of the most romantic

266
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,500
lines in China was

267
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,820
"I'll pick a star for you

268
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,500
as a gift."

269
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,140
So, the professor asked him

270
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,540
to save it

271
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,740
for his future wife.

272
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,900
Here. Have some fruit.

273
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,900
Alright! Thanks!

274
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,020
What is it?

275
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,579
Your friend said

276
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,300
you were a very popular

277
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,420
playboy in the college.

278
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,579
We have a guest now.

279
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,819
But I need an explanation tonight!

280
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,780
Here's something else about him.

281
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,859
Before graduation,

282
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,220
he buried himself in the lab every day.

283
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,380
He only stayed at school

284
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,579
and completely isolated himself

285
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,260
from the outside world.

286
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,660
I helped him

287
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,460
find this apartment.

288
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,980
Watch out.

289
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,700
It's a new apartment building.

290
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,460
The rent is cheap,

291
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,380
and it's close to the institute.

292
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,860
The only problem is

293
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,300
that we have to pay six months' rent in advance.

294
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,860
It's okay.

295
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,900
I've never used my scholarship.

296
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,780
It should be enough.

297
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,900
Really?

298
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Good for you!

299
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,500
Which room do you want?

300
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,740
I don't care.

301
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,940
Then I'll have this room.

302
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,340
You take that one.

303
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,140
Okay.

304
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,820
Alright?

305
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,260
Okay.

306
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,140
Let's go unpack.

307
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,740
See you later.

308
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,660
From bachelor's degree to master's degree,

309
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,620
none of your family has ever visited you.

310
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,620
I think at least

311
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,260
someone should come for your doctorate.

312
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,620
I'll lend you the travel fee.

313
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,260
Seriously! I have money.

314
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,420
Though you've never said anything,

315
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,420
everybody can see

316
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,820
that you aren't well off

317
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,860
since you seldom go out for fun.

318
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,100
Thank you for seeing me as a friend!

319
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,300
But I really don't need your help.

320
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,300
I have my scholarship.

321
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,300
Alright! Cheers!

322
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,540
To friendship!

323
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,060
To friendship!

324
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,500
We thought

325
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,340
he didn't date

326
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,980
because of his financial situation.

327
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,980
But Tong Jiaren told us later

328
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,420
that he's actually from

329
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,540
a wealthy family.

330
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,420
He just has no material desires.

331
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,140
Well, it's time to go.

332
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,180
It's rare for you to be together.

333
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,980
I'll disturb you no more.

334
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,060
I've told her

335
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,140
about the meteorite story.

336
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,500
No need to thank me.

337
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,500
Why did you give me this that day?

338
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,740
Anything special about it?

339
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,900
Nothing special.

340
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,460
It's just a gift?

341
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,780
Just a gift.

342
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,380
If there's anything

343
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,140
special about it,

344
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
it's that the first iron tool

345
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,540
was made from meteorite.

346
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,420
Is that special

347
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,700
enough?

348
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,820
What?

349
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,780
You want me

350
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,140
to keep the origin of the Iron Age in mind?

351
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,220
Come on. I'll take you to a place.

352
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,860
Where?

353
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,500
You don't have to work tonight?

354
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,860
I want to

355
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,900
take some time

356
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,140
and spend with you today.

357
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:23,020
[Welsh Black Beer]

358
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,100
Wait here for a moment.

359
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,900
[Welsh Black Beer]

360
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,540
Shi Yi! Are you okay?

361
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,140
It's alright! It's alright! Don't be afraid!

362
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,420
I'm here!

363
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,780
Don't be afraid!

364
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,220
She fell asleep?

365
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,540
She must have been terrified.

366
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,180
She was alone

367
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,980
in the car.

368
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,140
If I had been with her,

369
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,420
it could've been better.

370
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,900
It happened so suddenly,

371
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,260
and it was a strange place to her.

372
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,900
Of course she'd be scared.

373
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,340
I've sent a lawyer to the police station for some information.

374
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,580
She's only been here for a few days,

375
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,380
and something happened to your lab work.

376
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,300
Have some warm water.

377
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
Still thinking about things happened earlier?

378
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,460
I don't want to,

379
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,260
but it keeps coming to my mind.

380
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,620
It was just an accident.

381
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,460
There was a mansion

382
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,980
near the florist we went to.

383
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,580
Two logistic companies

384
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,980
holding standing contracts

385
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,820
with the stores

386
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,140
in the mansion had a conflict.

387
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,100
It was just the wrong place,

388
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,340
the wrong time for us.

389
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,420
I was going to buy you

390
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,020
a dried flower bouquet

391
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,100
to thank you for cooking dinner.

392
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,980
I have never thought

393
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,660
something like that would happen.

394
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,260
You've been trying to comfort me for a whole night.

395
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,180
Say something else.

396
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,220
There's something

397
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,060
I was going to tell you

398
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,660
after giving you the flower bouquet.

399
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,420
What is it?

400
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,100
The work handover

401
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,580
is harder than I thought.

402
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
So, you may

403
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,860
have to fly back home on your own this time.

404
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,700
Then when will you go home?

405
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm not sure.

406
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,900
Work comes first. It's okay.

407
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,700
A.S.A.P.?

408
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,220
I promise!

409
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,500
Seems like today is all about bad things

410
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,100
and bad news.

411
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,220
What can I do

412
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,860
to cheer you up?

413
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,580
Sweet talk.

414
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,860
What sweet talk?

415
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,900
Say something sweet to make me happy!

416
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,300
Okay.

417
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,300
That's it?

418
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,500
I'm thinking what I should say.

419
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,820
I'm very pretty, right?

420
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,660
Among all the people

421
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,060
you know,

422
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,260
am I the prettiest?

423
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,980
Or, if you know someone who's prettier than me…

424
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,740
No.

425
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,580
There's no one

426
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,260
who's prettier than you!

427
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,550
♫One more day with you♫

428
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,650
♫Love gets deeper♫

429
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,660
♫Making it a poem♫

430
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,170
♫Kissing through the long years♫

431
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,990
♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

♫Thank you for being there♫

439
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,940
What are you thinking?

440
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,860
Why didn't you dry your hair?

441
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,140
I had a lot of meetings lately

442
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,380
and I'm way behind in my work.

443
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,380
I'll have to stay up

444
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,420
for work again.

445
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,340
You big nerd!

446
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,220
I'm going to bed.

447
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,740
Alright. Goodnight!

448
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,510
Shall I close the door for you?

449
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,540
No.

450
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,660
Won't I disturb you?

451
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,140
Of course not.

452
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,020
I can hear you

453
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,060
with the door open.

454
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,540
And that makes me

455
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
feel relieved.

456
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,420
He really slept in the study?

457
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,540
You are cooking spaghetti?

458
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,180
You get up!

459
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,700
I'm cooking oil-splashed noodles.

460
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,420
With this?

461
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,700
It's all I have at home.

462
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,460
And I'm short of ingredients.

463
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,900
But I'll do my best.

464
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,380
I stayed in an industrial park

465
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,340
for two months

466
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,380
in Xi'an before.

467
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,260
Back then that area was still under construction,

468
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,980
so there weren't any restaurants nearby.

469
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,580
Sometimes when I was busy,

470
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,100
I'd miss my meal,

471
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,420
so I learned how to cook this

472
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,540
from He Shan's mother.

473
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,420
But I could

474
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,100
only learn it over the phone.

475
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,180
As a result,

476
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,500
I failed quite a few times.

477
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,980
But now, I can pretty much

478
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,780
do it right every time.

479
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,900
Wouldn't you be tired of eating this every day?

480
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,500
I can make different flavors of noodles.

481
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,140
I've mastered them all.

482
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,980
Actually,

483
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,980
I learned all these

484
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,020
from the parents

485
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,340
of my students.

486
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,020
None of my students

487
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,620
knows how to cook.

488
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,100
Your cooking looks like an experiment.

489
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,940
Some people would really do experiments

490
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,220
in the kitchen.

491
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,860
What kinda experiments can you do in a kitchen?

492
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,780
There was a chemist

493
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,180
who did experiments in the kitchen.

494
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,380
And he knocked off sulfuric acid

495
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
and saltpeter powder by accident.

496
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,020
In fear of being yelled by his wife,

497
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,380
he picked up

498
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,780
the nearest apron,

499
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,450
cleaned everything up,

500
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,540
and hung the apron outside to dry.

501
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,500
He thought he could easily

502
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,500
cover it up,

503
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,180
but his wife

504
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,700
found out anyway.

505
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,060
Because the apron exploded into pieces.

506
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,620
But because of this accident,

507
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:02,500
he discovered

508
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:04,020
the first explosive fiber,

509
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,540
cellulose nitrate.

510
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,620
Watching you cooking is so fun!

511
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,739
It's pleasing to the mouth and to the ear!

512
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,659
When you told me you'd cook noodles yesterday,

513
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,179
I thought it'd be instant noodles.

514
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,100
It's true that I used to cook

515
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,139
instant noodles a lot.

516
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,060
But later,

517
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:28,340
I learned how to cook all kinds of noodles.

518
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,900
Is it because you love

519
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,980
eating noodles?

520
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,780
I just thought it was convenient.

521
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,699
In my opinion, noodles

522
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,420
are the most continent staple.

523
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:38,820
Not only can they

524
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,780
satisfy our appetite,

525
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,300
but also take the shortest

526
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,260
time to prepare.

527
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,139
How pitiful!

528
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,540
Pitiful?

529
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,180
Eating the same food all the time

530
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,780
will lead to nutritional imbalance.

531
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,820
When we go back to Shanghai,

532
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,860
let's eat more vegetables

533
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,140
instead of noodles.

534
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,060
I'll cook for you.

535
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,260
Okay.

536
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,220
Let's go.

537
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,460
Here. Have a taste.

538
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,020
Yummy!

539
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,980
If you weren't a researcher,

540
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,180
you could open a noodle restaurant.

541
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,900
I'm well aware

542
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,260
of my own cooking skills.

543
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,260
You are flattering me.

544
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,060
I like it!

545
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,700
When I…

546
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,820
When I go back home,

547
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,500
let's move in together.

548
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,740
I'll get you a bottle of water.

549
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,620
Here.

550
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,100
Did I put

551
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,340
too much chili?

552
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,780
I'll put less next time.

553
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,980
Uncle Lin said we need

554
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,900
a ceremony to make our marriage formal.

555
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,460
I agree.

556
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,260
Then how about I put

557
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,820
a camp bed for you in the study?

558
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,100
You won't mind, right?

559
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,420
No.

560
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,100
I won't.

561
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,460
You didn't cook anything for yourself?

562
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,300
I've had breakfast.

563
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,260
I usually get up three hours

564
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,460
before you do.

565
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,020
How do you know when I get up?

566
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,220
I paid attention to it when you stayed

567
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,220
at my home.

568
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,860
Makes sense!

569
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,260
Your family eats breakfast at 5 a.m.

570
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,460
When I got up,

571
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
they'd already had breakfast.

572
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,060
So tasty!

573
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,940
Here. Your hair drier.

574
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,020
You keep it.

575
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,260
You don't have one here, right?

576
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,060
Hold on.

577
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,220
I'll take this with me.

578
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,460
Is the car here?

579
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,540
Yes.

580
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Then let's go.

581
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
Let me help you.

582
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,220
I have something to talk to him.

583
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,780
He told me you'd leave today.

584
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,940
I can give you a ride.

585
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,780
Let's go.

586
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
Let's drive her to the airport.

587
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,300
Come on.

588
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,660
Every time I go through the security,

589
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,100
I'd think of the first time we met

590
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,380
at the airport in Guangzhou.

591
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,140
You had nothing else

592
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,460
but one laptop bag,

593
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,100
yet they asked you for a recheck.

594
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,940
That was

595
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,140
the first time ever

596
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,020
I'd been asked for a recheck.

597
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,620
Thank you, security check!

598
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,900
The security check at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.

599
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,180
Are you thirsty?

600
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,420
A little.

601
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,140
Wait a sec.

602
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,060
I'll go get you a bottle of water.

603
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,700
It's okay, there's…

604
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,900
Why the rush! I haven't finished yet.

605
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,100
Here.

606
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,700
Thanks!

607
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,020
I could just buy one inside.

608
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,620
I just had a sip and I can't bring it in.

609
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,420
It's a waste.

610
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,580
It's okay. I can take it

611
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,020
and drink it on my way back.

612
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,260
We are talking

613
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,860
about a bottle of water before I leave.

614
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,820
I'll save the special words

615
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,500
for the next time when we

616
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,700
get together.

617
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,780
Then I'm leaving.

618
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,100
I'll let you know when I land.

619
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,180
Come home A.S.A.P.

620
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,420
I'll miss you!

621
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,010
♫Those familiar eyes♫

622
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,500
Bye-bye!

623
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,560
♫Lost the past when we shed tears♫

624
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,150
♫It won't change♫

625
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,680
♫Our fate of encounter♫

626
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,880
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

627
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,760
♫With your name in each line♫

628
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,330
♫If it started all over again♫

629
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,160
♫I'd still remember our love♫

630
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,010
♫It took♫

631
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,920
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

632

♫For our love to begin♫

00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:47,940
♫There's no way it'd end♫

634
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,420
I should have given her a hug.

635
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,940
But I haven't found a chance.

636
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,300
Why am I always like this?

637
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,900
Is the guy on the same flight with her

638
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,860
trustworthy?

639
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,020
Rest assured.

640
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,220
He's been my assistant for years.

641
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,300
He'll make sure she gets back home safely.

642
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,660
My man

643
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,140
has gone to the police station for information.

644
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,860
Unfortunately,

645
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,700
there was nothing wrong about it.

646
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,220
All the evidence

647
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,180
suggests that it was

648
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,460
only a random fighting.

649
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:53,580
You guys were just

650
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,860
two of the victims who happened to be there.

651
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,290
But my instinct tells me that it wasn't that simple.

652
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,020
You must go home immediately.

653
00:41:59,640 --> 00:41:59,980
There are too many

654
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,370
uncertainties if you stay abroad.

655
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
When's the earliest can we

656
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,820
get the result of the financial investigation.

657
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,300
30 something working days.

658
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,480
More than a month?

659
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,940
If you want to go back,

660
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,070
I can arrange it for you at any time.

661
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,660
I can't go back without knowing the truth.

662
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,340
I need to wait till the result

663
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,460
of the investigation comes out.

664
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,180
Otherwise,

665
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,580
it'd not only be unfair to myself,

666
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,660
it'd also affect the institute's attitude

667
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,420
toward the future recruitment

668
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,100
of Chinese students.

669
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,020
As a lawyer,

670
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,780
I don't agree with you.

671
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,120
But as your friend,

672
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,450
I respect your decision.

673
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,140
Let's go.

674
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,700
[After the Eastern and Western Jin Dynasties, the imperial authority…]

675
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,380
After the Eastern and Western Jin Dynasties, the imperial authority

676
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,900
during the Southern and Northern Dynasties became even shakier.

677
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,660
The real power was in the hands of the generals

678
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,660
with military leadership and the prestigious clans.

679
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,780
Due to the strategic importance of Chang'an,

680
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,020
those who stationed there were seen as a threat to the capital city.

681
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,400
Hanging a tea bag in the closet can keep moths away.

682
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,180
A bachelor like you wouldn't know about this!

683
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:03,700
Sir.

684
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,820
Would you like to change the sheet?

685
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,730
No need.

686
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,300
Okay.

687
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,860
Thanks.

688
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,900
What are you

689
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,260
puzzling over?

690
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,100
No puzzle, but no answer either.

691
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,820
About natural science

692
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,460
