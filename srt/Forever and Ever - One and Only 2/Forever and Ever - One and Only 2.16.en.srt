[Episode 16]

4
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,460
When I was a child, I memorized "Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals".

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,180
The elders in the family would say

6
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,259
"Beauties and

7
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,259
demoralizing music.

8
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,780
Don't enjoy yourself in them."

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,500
Beauty and pleasant music

10
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,980
are not worth indulging in.

11
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,620
Have you heard this?

12
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,860
At that time,

13
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,539
I thought they

14
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,340
were not worth indulging in.

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,460
But now,

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,580
I don't think so anymore.

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,980
Suddenly you're a smooth talker.

18
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,180
It's true that somethings

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,900
you don't need a teacher to learn about.

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,100
Xiaoyu asked us

21
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,780
to go see her when we're free.

22
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,420
What do you mean by "when we're free"?

23
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,620
Right.

24
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,020
A friend from the institute

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,940
told me

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,220
a man and woman had to show their marriage certificates

27
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,460
to stay together in a hotel.

28
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,300
Is that still the case?

29
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,940
I don't know.

30
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,380
I always stayed with girls on business trips.

31
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,620
And I never stayed with a woman.

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,420
I didn't bring our marriage certificates.

33
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,460
I brought a photo though.

34
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,980
A photo?

[Marriage certificate]

36
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,820
When was it taken?

37
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,940
The day I picked up our certificates.

38
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,940
Why did you take it?

39
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,820
To treasure that moment.

40
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,020
It's not like I wouldn't give you the original.

41
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,460
It's a big risk to

42
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,220
bring around the original document.

43
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,020
It's safer this way.

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,220
If you lose your phone,

45
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,700
wouldn't our information be leaked too?

46
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,180
I've put a lock on this photo.

47
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,460
It can't be opened without a password.

48
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,700
That's very thoughtful of you.

49
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,820
Get used to it.

50
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,340
Where's Mr. Zhousheng?

51
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
He's not here.

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Are these

53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,260
going to be sent back to China?

54
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,340
Yes, someone will come by tonight

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
and deliver the stuff.

56
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,940
Has he moved everything?

57
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,659
Yes.

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,460
He said

59
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,740
he's going back for good this time.

60
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,220
He asked us to clean it up.

61
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,300
After nine years of living here,

62
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,820
he just left this place

63
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,380
without feeling anything.

64
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,940
Not bad.

65
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,260
We'll go back tonight.

66
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,460
I can eat whatever you want. Tonight.

67
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,300
Okay.

68
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,660
Okay.

69
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,180
Good.

70
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Okay.

71
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,180
Good.

72
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,940
The food here should be nice.

73
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,500
I thought you guys were

74
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,620
trapped somewhere.

75
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,780
You're back so early.

76
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,780
I came back early.

77
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,300
Lucky you.

78
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,260
We took shelter near shore

79
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,900
until now.

80
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,380
I didn't have the chance to ask in the afternoon.

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,660
Meilin didn't make it clear either.

82
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,900
Shouldn't you formally

83
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,380
introduce your husband to us?

84
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,540
You guys are Shi Yi's colleagues.

85
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,780
As long as you know

86
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,740
I'm Shi Yi's husband,

87
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,580
that's enough.

88
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:23,460
Did you hear that?

89
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,860
This is Shi Yi's man.

90
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,820
We're going

91
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,940
back to Shanghai tonight.

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,980
What is your plan?

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,700
Are you going back with us

94
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,580
or are you going to stay with your husband?

95
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,940
It's the weekend. We'll stay one more night.

96
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,900
Okay.

97
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,740
Then I'll leave your wife

98
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,340
to you.

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,020
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

100
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,820
I'll leave you two alone.

101
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,220
I'm going.

102
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,860
Bye, bye.

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,260
Bye, bye.

104
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,020
Bye, bye.

105
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,580
Bye, bye.

106
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,980
Bye, bye.

107
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,340
-Finally, we're back.
-Let's go.

108
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Do you check whether the door is locked

109
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,180
every time you go out?

110
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,140
I guess it's a habit.

111
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,580
There are many people here.

112
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,820
There weren't many people just now?

113
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,500
You came back on your own?

114
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,180
In fact, except for going home,

115
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,300
I am usually alone

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,380
when I go out.

117
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,300
Your lawyer seems to be better than you in this aspect.

118
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,020
At least he has a few assistants.

119
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,460
I also have assistants in the lab.

120
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,780
But outside of the lab,

121
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,020
I really don't know

122
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,580
what an assistant can do.

123
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,260
He can't help me eat.

124
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,660
He can't help me drink water.

125
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,180
He can't help me sleep.

126
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,300
What?

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,660
I'm trying to figure out

128
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,940
the similarities between you and normal people.

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,420
I can't think of many.

130
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,980
Even watching a drama,

131
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,780
your methods would be strange.

132
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
Few people can

133
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,380
watch "Qin Quest"

134
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,500
for 79 times.

135
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,180
I only do that during my leisure time.

136
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,100
I really don't want to waste

137
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,140
too much energy

138
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,820
to find a new TV series.

139
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,380
So I just keep watching it.

140
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,580
Every time I see

141
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,860
the last scene,

142
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:24,780
I can think of

143
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,419
what the next scene is going to be

144
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,740
and what the next lines will be.

145
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
It's interesting.

146
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,020
Maybe only you

147
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,020
find it interesting.

148
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,140
Maybe.

149
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,780
Watch out, the road is uneven.

150
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,780
And you're wearing high heels.

151
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,900
It's easy to trip and fall.

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,540
I know.

153
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,220
I'll hold your hand.

154
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,540
Why didn't I notice

155
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,700
he's so freaking cute.

156
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,620
Thank you for waiting.

157
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,860
Let me introduce you.

158
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,580
This is Shi Yi's husband.

159
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,460
Professor Zhousheng Chen.

160
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,820
This is Du Feng, my friend.

161
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,260
Hi.

162
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,860
Hi.

163
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,180
What's this?

164
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,140
A liquor made by the locals. Smells good.

165
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,700
Sorry, I don't drink.

166
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
As a man

167
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,220
you have to at least drink some, right?

168
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,860
It's just a gesture of friendliness.

169
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,260
Don't force him to drink.

170
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,260
I didn't force him.

171
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,100
I merely urged him to.

172
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,420
I merely urged him to, my lady.

173
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,580
It's a strong liquor.

174
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,940
You're protecting him.

175
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,180
That's a no no.

176
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Professor.

177
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,820
This is our first time drinking, right?

178
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,060
Yes.

179
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,620
Are you not gonna give me face then?

180
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,580
Let's do as we please.

181
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,340
I'll drink for him.

182
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,060
She's the one who doesn't drink at all.

183
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,780
That's true love.

184
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,300
Absolutely true love.

185
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,620
They're married.

186
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
How can it not be true love?

187
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,900
True.

188
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,460
After all, they are a family now.

189
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,660
I'm the outsider.

190
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
Whatever, let's eat.

191
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,340
Eat.

192
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,260
Don't drink on my behalf in the future.

193
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,860
I'm willing to.

194
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,540
You're strange.

195
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,300
Neither do you want to leave, nor do you want to look for them.

196
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,820
I don't want to bother them.

197
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,140
I don't want to go back either.

198
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,940
In this family,

199
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,780
I like Chen and Shi Yi

200
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,340
the most.

201
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,860
I always look forward to their return.

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,020
But I also don't want them to come back.

203
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,460
Chen doesn't fit in there.

204
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
Do you want one?

205
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,020
To relieve your sorrows.

206
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,460
Childish.

207
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,460
I'll eat it later.

208
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,540
Let's go home!

209
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,500
Is Mr. Zhousheng from Zhenjiang?

210
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:13,980
Yes.

211
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,700
Just now, Xiaoyu said

212
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,260
you're a researcher, right?

213
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,220
A researcher that works in a lab.

214
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,500
And you?

215
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,500
You never said what you do.

216
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,100
I'm a civil servant.

217
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,420
Professor.

218
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,820
Here's your wife.

219
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,980
My gosh.

220
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,340
I'm telling you.

221
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,260
She really can't drink.

222
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,940
I don't care if she's going to act wild later on.

223
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,620
I'll get my last box of clothes

224
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,700
after I go back tonight.

225
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,620
From now on,

226
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
you guys can have fun there.

227
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,060
What's the hurry?

228
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
Why not?

229
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,620
Your husband is finally back.

230
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,180
You should quickly live a normal life.

231
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,460
We got to work. I'm going.

232
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,700
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

233
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,460
Bye.

234
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,060
Are you drunk?

235
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,380
No, I'm sober.

236
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,740
Try walking on your own.

237
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,940
All right.

238
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,940
Don't sway.

239
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
This place is quite interesting.

240
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,300
Now that we're leaving,

241
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm really sad to leave.

242
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,740
Didn't you come here before?

243
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,500
Yes, I was here for work last time.

244
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,700
I didn't have much fun.

245
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,260
You just said you were moving out, right?

246
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,780
That's right.

247
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Her husband is back.

248
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,660
I should move out.

249
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,260
Have you found a place to live?

250
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,780
I bought a house before New Year.

251
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,140
Where is it?

252
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Why are you asking so much?

253
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm concerned about you.

254
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,660
It's in another district.

255
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,180
Not close to you.

256
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,900
We won't be running into each other anytime soon.

257
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,580
But you can always contact me.

258
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,540
It's not like I've left Shanghai.

259
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,060
Right?

260
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,060
True.

261
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,020
I feel a little dizzy.

262
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,820
I'd like to sit down for a while.

263
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,700
You want to stay here for a while?

264
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,700
Let's cover your legs up.

265
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,180
Do you want to lie on my lap?

266
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,060
Okay.

267
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,340
Get closer. I can't see.

268
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,820
What do you want to see?

269
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
You.

270
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,420
Just look at me like that.

271
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm already very close to you.

272
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Your facial hair is growing again.

273
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,540
Did it prick you just now?

274
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,260
I'm not going to talk to you about this.

275
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,540
This is also a lesson from God.

276
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,260
He has taught me to withdraw hatred and avoid coquetry.

277
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,380
And to change my nature.

278
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,580
Stop loving the past and withdraw from the sea of suffering

279
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,900
to realize the causes.

280
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,460
What are you laughing at?

281
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,500
Do you know what this play is about?

282
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,180
It's about a woman

283
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,580
lamenting that her glory is fleeting.

284
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,060
And that people should realize early that life is impermanent.

285
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
So you think

286
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm lamenting this too?

287
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,099
You're wrong.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Zhousheng Chen.

289
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,540
You're wrong about what I'm going to say.

290
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,020
I know you don't like business,

291
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,500
and only like the people and things in the laboratory.

292
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,740
So what I want to say is,

293
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,180
since life is unpredictable,

294
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,420
don't put it off any longer.

295
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,300
When you're done with what you have to do,

296
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,940
just drop everything here.

297
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,260
From then on, you just need to

298
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,980
research your favourite planet, Venus.

299
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,540
Leave the rest to me.

300
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,740
I'll make you tea and cook for you.

301
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,140
I'll take good care of you.

302
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,660
From now on, I will be there every day.

303
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,580
I'll be your support.

304
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,380
Your closest family.

305
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,700
Since you don't like Zhenjiang,

306
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,540
we will live in Shanghai.

307
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,140
Shanghai will be our home.

308
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,660
I mean it.

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,540
Drunk people tell the truth.

310
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,540
Look at you.

311
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,180
Your face is all flushed.

312
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,500
Really?

313
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,460
I can't drink.

314
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,820
I get drunk when I drink.

315
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,700
But you look pretty

316
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,300
when your face is flushed.

317
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,740
Really.

318
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,980
I'm dizzy.

319
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,100
If you don't feel well,

320
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,980
should we go to our room and rest?

321
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,660
I'm even dizzier if I walk now.

322
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,980
I want to just hold you and lie down for a while.

323
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,740
Why are we here?

324
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,500
Are you

325
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,900
interested in Yuan?

326
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,180
Don't talk nonsense. I have my own plan.

327
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,060
Why did you come see me?

328
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,260
You failed your exams?

329
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,340
Do I look like

330
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,660
someone with bad grades?

331
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,660
Even a horse stumbles.

332
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,100
Come, I'll take you for milk tea.

333
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,980
Get in the car.

334
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,020
Where to?

335
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,420
I need to buy tea for my grandpa.

336
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,420
I can't go too far.

337
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,580
I'll take you there.

338
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,340
What's wrong with him?

339
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,340
Sorry, Yuan.

340
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,380
He doesn't want to go home.

341
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,820
But he has no other friends.

342
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
So he came to bother you.

343
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,300
It's okay. I'm older than him.

344
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,660

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,790
Shi Yi, we're leaving.

517
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,660
By the way, could you hold the umbrella closer to her?

518
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,750
I don't want her to get wet.

519
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,570
Don't worry about me.

520
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,180
Okay.

521
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,000
Thank you.

522
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,100
Young man.

523
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,860
You treat your girlfriend well.

524
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,220
I'm all dirty.

525
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,700
Have you talked to Tong Jiaren

526
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,260
this month?

527
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,460
Yes.

528
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,460
It's all about work.

529
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,140
Excuses.

530
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,940
It's not.

531
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,020
So, have you two ever…?

532
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,340
No.

533
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,460
You know what I'm asking?

534
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,740
I know.

535
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,820
Nothing in the future too.

536
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,500
There won't be any.

537
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,620
Not with anyone.

538
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,580
Not with anyone.

539
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,820
If I pass away first,

540
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,020
then stay single.

541
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,740
I'll make it up to you in my next life.

542
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,860
Make up for what?

543
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,460
To be your wife, of course.

544
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,620
If you do well in the next life,

545
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,820
I'll reward you in your next, next life.

546
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,340
I know you are materialistic.

547
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,020
You don't want to promise me.

548
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,900
I promise you.

549
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,900
Say it again.

550
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,630
I promise you.

551
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,290

♫Give you my insignificant♫

559
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,480

♫All and all♫

561
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,820

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
Turn off the light.

Do you still have the pomegranates you bought last time?

578
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,940
I want to eat some.

590
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,700
Good morning!

591
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,500
Excuse me.

592
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,660
Do you know a place nearby

593
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,620
that sells pomegranates?

594
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,060
It's too early.

595
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,740
It might not be available.

596
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,340
But,

597
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,970
there may be some

598
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,920
in those supermarkets

599
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,790
that's always open.

600
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,060
You could go there and check it out.

601
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,220
Do you have a car?

602
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,430
If only you came sooner.

603
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,520
My wife just

604
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,300
took the car.

605
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,140
But I have another one.

606
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,420
You have to be patient

607
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,900
to take out the flesh.

608
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,780
Yes.

609
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,950
When I was a kid,

610
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,980
I rarely ate it

611
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,940
because it was troublesome to peel.

612
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,620
Luckily, when my wife was pregnant,

613
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,100
she liked durian

614
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,380
instead of pomegranates.

615
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,380
Take your time, be patient.

616
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,460
Where have you been?

617
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,540
I've packed the stuff.

618
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,580
We can go home anytime.

619
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,100
Pomegranates?

620
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,460
There's a pomegranate vendor here?

621
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,100
I came across someone selling it.

622
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,300
I've loved pomegranates since I was a kid.

623
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,260
Just that they are too troublesome to peel.

624
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,780
That's right.

625
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,060
Did you bring back all the stuff

626
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,180
from Bremen?

627
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
Yes.

628
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,860
Where did you send it to?

629
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,420
Your house or mine?

630
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,140
The institute's dormitory.

631
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,500
The bachelor apartment?

632
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,940
You're occupying a bachelor's apartment as a married man.

633
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,580
Is the institute fine with that?

634
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,740
You're already married.

635
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,340
It's not a good idea to take up their place, right?

636
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,860
When the luggage is delivered to China,

637
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,020
I'll have them send it to the home.

638
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,140
Which home?

639
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,540
Our home.

640
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,340
Good boy.

641
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,820
It's so sweet.

642
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,580
Come on in.

643
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,180
These are slippers for you.

644
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,380
I've turned Xiaoyu's room

645
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,980
into a study room.

646
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,860
Okay.

647
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,020
Where are you going?

648
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,340
Didn't we agree

649
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,540
I'd sleep in the study when I got back?

650
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,860
Oh no, I forgot.

651
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,620
I forgot to buy a bed for you.

652
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,140
I'll sleep here then.

653
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,500
Okay.

654
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,580
Then I'll get you

655
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,820
a quilt and a pillow tonight.

656
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,700
Okay.

657
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,180
I'll put the stuff in first.

658
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,780
Even if you want to sleep on the couch,

659
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,860
you can't just leave your things unpacked, right?

660
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,620
I have too many things.

661
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,260
I'll do the cleaning

662
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,220
on my own

663
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,500
after you're done unpacking.

664
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,300
You won't be able to do it yourself.

665
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,780
Only I know

666
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,020
what goes where.

667
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,780
That's all?

668
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,620
I have some clothes on the way.

669
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,460
They'll be here in a couple of days.

670
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,820
Okay, I'll help you put the clothes

671
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,940
in the closet first.

672
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,570
I've made space

673
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,300
on the left of the closet

674
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,300
for your clothes.

675
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
The right side is for me.

676
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,180
You can put these books in the study.

677
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,660
I've made space for your stuff too.

678
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,060
You have more books coming?

679
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,900
Yes.

680
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,740
Are these shelves enough?

681
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,260
If not, I'll make some more space for you.

682
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,500
Should be enough.

683
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,900
Do you usually

684
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,340
turn these two computers on together?

685
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,340
Yes.

686
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,380
Then there aren't enough sockets.

687
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,340
I'll go to the supermarket downstairs later

688
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,540
and buy a bigger one.

689
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,100
The supermarket downstairs?

690
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,100
Otherwise there will be no place to plug in the lamp.

691
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,910
Okay, I got it.

692
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,320
Wait.

693
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,660
What's wrong?

694
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,700
Let's get down to business first.
