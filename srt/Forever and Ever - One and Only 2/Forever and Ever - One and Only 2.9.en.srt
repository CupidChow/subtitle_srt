[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,960
Do you have any books you like?

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
I quite like the books here.

6
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,039
Wenxing said that you went to settle something.

7
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,320
It's settled.

8
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
As for the rest,

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
I don't think they'll need me anymore.

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,520
Let's go.

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,919
I want to take you somewhere.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,520
Where?

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,680
Let's go.

14
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
You can have a full view of

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
the old manor from here.

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
You can even watch the sunset now.

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,400
What's up?

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,800
I have acrophobia.

19
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,920
But it's not serious.

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
Sometimes, I'll be fine.

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
But I think it's pretty bad today.

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,240
Come.

and do some thinking.

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,600

Chen.

51
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,400
Sorry for

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
disturbing you.

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,399
What's up?

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
J-Just an allergic reaction to dust.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,880
Let's go then.

56
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,960
Let's go.

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,320
Chen.

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,880
Why didn't I realize before that

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you are so good at acting pitiful?

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,360
Are you okay?

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm fine now.

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,960
Don't worry.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
I told you just now, right?

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
His allergy is not severe.

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,520
Although he is fine now,

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
you have to pay attention to him.

67
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
Usually, after his allergic reaction,

68
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,160
he feels weak at night.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
Make sure

70
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
to stay by his side

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,400
and take care of him.

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,560
I forgot to tell you about the important matter.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,200
Uncle Lin said that the car

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,000
is ready.

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,200
You can depart at any time.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,760
Where are we going?

77
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
We are going to meet my elder.

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,000
Again?

79
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,640
How many elders do you have?

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,240
This is the most important one.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Are you afraid?

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
No.

83
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,400
I'm just a little bit nervous since I don't have the experience.

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,280
Don't be nervous.

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,120
Have you been to Chen's house?

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,400
But it's different from here.

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,720
And they are different from you.

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,800
Where are you going?

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,200
Let's go into the house.

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,760
Okay.

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,440
Let's go in.

93
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Let me help.

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,920
Be careful.

95
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,570
Be careful of the step.

96
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,500
Over there.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,600
Let's sit over there.

98
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,280
Chen didn't tell me that you'd be coming.

99
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,680
So, I didn't prepare anything for you.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,430
Have some sweets.

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,780
[Chocolate]

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,480
Have some sweets.

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
-Eat this.
-Thank you, Grandmother.

104
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
No need to thank me.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,320
Go ahead and eat it.

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
I just eat it like this?

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,120
Yes.

108
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,840
What's wrong?

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,730
Is it not good?

110
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,160
No.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,280
It's good.

112
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,380
Eat more then.

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,080
Eat more.

114
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,840
Your grandmother gave me this.

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,280
You liked it when you were young?

116
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,760
Yes.

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
You don't like it?

118
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,000
The flavor is very surprising.

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,000
But from today onwards,

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
I'll try to like it.

121
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,720
What are you doing?

122
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,560
This is

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
her favourite radio.

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
She listens to it every day.

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,280
Just now, I found that

126
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
its volume got softer.

127
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
So, I want to

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
fix it for her.

129
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
So, besides studying about Venus,

130
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,400
you know how to do this too.

131
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,480
You've been working ever since you came in.

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,200
Every time, after raining,

133
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,120
the moss on the floor will become very slippery.

134
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,480
She's long in the tooth now.

135
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,760
I don't want her to fall.

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
You do this all by yourself?

137
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,840
I like to

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
do everything myself.

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,720
No matter

140
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
how many people you hire,

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,440
there's always something that they fail to take care of.

142
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,680
It feels better

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
to do it yourself.

144
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,200
Indeed.

145
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,480
My mother and uncles

146
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
hired a care provider for my grandmother before.

147
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
But later they found out that

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,880
the care provider didn't like to talk to her

149
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,400
and didn't give her enough time

150
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,200
under the sun.

151
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,800
After some discussions,

152
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,080
they decided to take turns

153
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,400
to take care of her themselves.

154
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
Some things may seem trivial,

155
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
but those are the things that

156
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,600
only family will pay attention to.

157
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Are you thirsty?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,160
Let me get you some water.

159
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,520
It's okay.

160
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,560
Shi Yi.

161
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Come.

162
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,440
Come.

163
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
What is it, grandmother?

164
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:54,520
Come.

165
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,470
Give me your hand.

166
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,920
Good.

167
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,160
I kept this

168
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,960
for Chen's wife.

169
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you, grandmother.

170
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,640
Well.

171
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,430
You...

172
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,570
You should go out and chat with him.

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Go on.

174
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
I want to take a rest.

175
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,000
I need a nap.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,520
Let me hold you.

177
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,040
I just have a daughter.

178
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,520
I've disappointed

179
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,320
the Zhousheng family in this life of mine.

180
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,170
The eldest young master

181
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,100
shouldn't have married her.

182
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,780
If he knew about the second young master's story,

183
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
he wouldn't have married her.

184
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,760
Your grandmother has fallen asleep.

185
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,560
Just like my grandfather and grandmother.

186
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,940
No one can stop them from taking an afternoon nap.

187
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
Is there anything

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,760
special about this?

189
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,720
It has the circumference of 28cm.

190
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,600
It has 18 jadeite beads,

191
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,000
pink tourmaline flower carving,

192
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,240
coral beads and pearls.

193
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
It's a bracelet from the late Ming and early Qing.

194
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
Looks like I need to buy a safe

195
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
to keep them.

196
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
This is a rosary.

197
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,320
It has been used for chanting and praying

198
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,520
for generations.

199
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,760
Wear it.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
I know.

201
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
This is the smallest one.

202
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,480
There are the 27-bead,

203
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,520
the 54-bead

204
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,440
and the 108-bead rosaries.

205
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
They are all rosaries for prayers.

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,560
This

207
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
belonged to my mother.

208
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,120
It belonged to your mother?

209
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,480
My birth mother.

210
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,000
The one you saw

211
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
is not my birth mother.

212
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
She is Wenxing and Wenchuan's birth mother.

213
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
They are your half-siblings?

214
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,000
Your grandmother is your birth mother's mother?

215
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,200
She is Wenxing and Wenchuan's

216
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,520
birth mother's mother.

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Are you confused?

218
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,760
Because you are

219
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
quite close with your grandmother.

220
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,120
I never thought that you are not related by blood.

221
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,120
My birth mother and my grandmother

222
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,360
are distant relatives.

223
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,240
She was brought up here since young.

224
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
But my grandmother treated my birth mother

225
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,440
like her own daughter.

226
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,800
So, your mother

227
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,160
married your father first.

228
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,280
After she passed away,

229
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Wenxing's mother

230
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,600
married your father.

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,120
In order to

232
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,600
marry my mother,

233
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,040
my father left the Zhou family.

234
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,440
After my mother passed away,

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
in order to let me

236
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,600
take after the Zhousheng surname,

237
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,040
he gave in and married Wenxing's mother

238
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,760
to appease the family.

239
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
He brought me back to the Zhou residence.

240
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,000
Before I went back to the Zhou residence,

241
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
I lived here.

242
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
So, he has lost all of his closest ones

243
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,800
in this family.

244
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,760
Uncle Lin.

245
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
You are eating stinky tofu again.

246
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
Give me the car key.

247
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,280
You want to go out?

248
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm worried about your driving skills.

249
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,680
What about me?

250
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I have my driving license with me.

251
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
Any other drivers

252
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,080
will be more reliable than him.

253
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,840
You can't be sure about that.

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,640
No one is perfect.

255
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,800
You are used to being at the top since young.

256
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
It's time for you to learn

257
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
how to accept your weaknesses.

258
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,360
Last time, in order to pick you up,

259
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,200
he drove around the lake

260
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,440
for an entire afternoon.

261
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,440
No.

262
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,240
I don't need to drive

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
to work.

264
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
I can just walk.

265
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,560
So...

266
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
He has me when he comes home.

267
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,840
So, he doesn't even have

268
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
the chance to touch the steering wheel.

269
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,080
Let's go, Professor Zhousheng.

270
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,360
I'll let you experience my driving skills.

271
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,800
Go.

272
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
Drive carefully.

273
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,100
[Gather Fortune]

274
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,480
There's a mountain road nearby.

275
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,840
It's quite steep.

276
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,680
When I graduated from the university,

277
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,760
I once drove down from that road.

278
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,340
It felt dangerous

279
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,620
even driving at only 20 miles per hour.

280
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,700
Where is it?

281
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,460
If you like car ride,

282
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,940
I'll take you out for a ride next time.

283
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,380
I know a few mountain roads.

284
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,580
They have great views.

285
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,380
Mister.

286
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
Your fruits are quite fresh.

287
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,180
Of course.

288
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,820
I plucked them

289
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,620
from my fruit farm this morning.

290
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,740
And they are cheap.

291
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,980
Are the oranges sweet?

292
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
Yes. Try one.

293
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,780
Thank you.

294
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,060
I'll take some oranges

295
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,220
and some pears.

296
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:25,660
Okay.

297
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,340
Mister.

298
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,580
Hello, Sir.

299
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,660
I'll take them all.

300
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,380
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,460
I was here first.

302
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,460
Yes.

303
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,620
I'm buying them for you.

304
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,460
It's okay.

305
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,220
My boyfriend will buy them for me.

306
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,500
You don't have a good taste in men.

307
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,180
What is it? What's wrong?

308
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,700
Nothing.

309
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,540
Nothing.

310
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,020
Have a taste.

311
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,500
Beautiful girls

312
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,380
always attract attention.

313
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,540
Chen's mother

314
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,140
was very beautiful.

315
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,060
When she was still in school,

316
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,980
she was the campus belle.

317
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,300
No, grandmother.

318
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,420
I'm not talking about me.

319
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,580
He said something bad

320
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,940
to Zhousheng Chen.

321
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,080
I don't like it when others criticize him.

322
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,320
Not even a word.

323
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,250
Because of that?

324
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,860
Newly-weds

325
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,660
are so loving.

326
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,600
You don't get bored of

327
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,020
looking at your wife.

328
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,820
Let me take this to them.

329
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,160
Grandmother.

330
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,640
Have some fruits.

331
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,430
You are so good.

332
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,110
You still think about us.

333
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,380
Mother.

334
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,860
Mrs. Zhou.

335
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,700
What are you chatting about? You look happy.

336
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
We are

337
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,260
very happy every day.

338
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,850
Why are you here?

339
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,380
I'm here to visit you.

340
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,640
I only have one daughter,

341
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,900
Qin Wenjin.

342
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,340
Tonight,

343
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,780
I'm going to eat dinner

344
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,460
with my eldest grandson and his wife.

345
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,860
I don't have time for you, Madam Zhou.

346
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,350
Then, I won't disturb you further.

347
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,510
This is for you.

348
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,700

350

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,700
I went home.

356
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,940
My mother

357

is still the same.

358
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,580
And Chen was there,

359
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,380
she was even more unwilling to talk to me.

360

One may become more stubborn

Don't mind her.

363

When I was young,

364
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,900
I was so adamant about right and wrong.

365
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,740
I thought that

everyone had done me wrong.

367
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,230
I was forced to become Chen's stepmother.

368
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,940
Because of this, I had a fell out with my mother.

She's young.

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,820
But she can only stay in her room, battling with her illness.

377

No matter how wonderful our life is,

No.

390
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,260
I've asked them

Of course.

394

this question.

Come closer.

400
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,940
Is it awkward for me to ask

401
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,900
such a detailed question?

402
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,820
I think so.

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,040
♫Corners of mouth and eyes♫

518
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,780
Yes?

519
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,980
♫Give you my intense♫

520
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,340

00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,580

♫Give me your untouched♫

523

♫Innocence and freedom♫

525
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,900

530
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:31,750
Chen.

531
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,870
You are up so early.

532
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,500
Where are you going?

533
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,900
I'm going for a run.

534
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,260
Why is he doing that in the morning?

535
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,100
He's not familiar with this place.

536
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,940
Go with him.

537
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,860
Uncle, you know me.

538
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,739
I don't run.

539
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,460
Go.

540
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,300
Let's take a break.

541
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,660
Let's take a break, Chen.

542
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,340
What's wrong?

543
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,300
They have been

544
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,460
talking

545
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,300
about you

546
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,180
since I was young.

547
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,200
Finally, I get to meet you today.

548
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,440
Whenever I came back before,

549
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,740
you were always not here.

550
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:11,900
Yes.

551
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,580
I was still in school back then.

552
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,140
Chen.

553
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,010
Are you a natural bookworm

554
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,860
or are you a self-made bookworm?

555
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
I think I'm born like that.

556
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,420
I knew it.

557
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,460
It must be an inborn talent

558
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,740
to be such a serious case of bookworm.

559
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,260
I told my uncle about it.

560
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,220
But he wouldn't believe me.

561
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,300
He always sets you

562
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,180
as my example.

563
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,900
Okay. Let's continue.

564
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,020
Uncle Lin.

565
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,060
You are back.

566
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,220
You are so sweaty.

567
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,500
Why aren't you heading to the shower?

568
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,300
I have to take a rest.

569
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,620
You should

570
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
learn from Chen.

571
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,260
You

572
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,500
lack the training.

573
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,740
Is there water?

574
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,060
Good morning.

575
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,700
Good morning.

576
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,860
You just woke up?

577
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,740
Yes.

578
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,700
Do you want to join me for a morning run?

579
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,820
Sure.

580
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,020
Let me get changed first.

581
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,660
Good morning, Lin Fei.

582
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:30,820
Good morning.

583
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,860
Where are you going?

584
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,020
We are going for a morning run.

585
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,340
Lin Fei.

586
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,860
Eat properly.

587
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,780
What is it?

588
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,340
Do you want to go for a run too?

589
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,500
No. Go ahead without me.

590
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,580
Okay. We'll go for a run then.

591
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,180
Let's go.

592
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,700
Bye.

593
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,340
Bye.

594
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,820
He's not spending time with his girlfriend.

595
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,340
He's risking his life for her.

596
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,340
No.

597
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,900
I can't

598
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,860
stay here anymore tonight.

599
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,860
This is too scary.

600
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,420
Let's take a rest.

601
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:51,910
Okay.

602
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,820
Wait for a while.

603
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,900
Sit on top of this.

604
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,860
I didn't sleep well last night.

605
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,140
Why?

606
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,220
Because of me?

607
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,260
No.

608
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,260
That's not true.

609
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Did you have a good sleep last night?

610
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,740
I had quite a good sleep.

611
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,100
I slept all the way until morning.

612
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,410
Yeah, all the way until morning.

613
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,940
Great-grandpa, thank you

614
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,660
for coming with me.

615
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,340
This is such a coincidence.

616
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,180
If it wasn't because of this engagement banquet,

617
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,660
he might not be at home.

618
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,360
Behave yourself when you see him.

619
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,940
Of course.

620
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,020
Great-grandpa, be careful.

621
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,860
Be careful.

622
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,300
Okay.

623
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,860
When you change the sand,

624
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
put one or two tablespoons of salt into it.

625
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,100
Will it be depressing for them

626
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,180
to stay inside here?

627
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,540
We can't do it here.

628
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,060
But when we go back to Shanghai,

629
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,540
I plan to move them

630
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,820
into a bigger aquarium

631
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,060
and add some containers that they can climb on.

632
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,500
He's here.

633
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,780
He's your great-uncle.

634
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,340
Chen.

635
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
To be exact,

636
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,020
he's my distant relative.

637
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,540
Based on the seniority,

638
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,620
he has to call me great-grandpa.

639
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,540
We heard that

640
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,740
you are back from abroad.

641
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,380
So, he came here to greet you.

642
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
Greet him.

643
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,500
Who?

644
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,540
Greet him as your great-uncle.

645
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,420
Greet him now.

646
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,540
Uncle, take a seat first.

647
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,980
Why are you suddenly acting so shy?

648
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,420
Greet him.

649
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,940
Great-uncle.

650
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,300
She is my fiancee.

651
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,300
Great-aunt.

652
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,580
Go and

653
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,020
tell your great-uncle about

654
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,740
what you did after you came back.

655
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,380
I came back from abroad after I graduated two years ago.

656
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,260
Now, I have my own company.

657
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,620
My throat has been a little bit itchy lately.

658
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,900
I have the hay fever.

659
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,420
You take your time chatting.

660
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,620
I'll go to the library.

661
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,340
Come.

662
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,260
Tell me more about your company.

663
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,740
It's just a small company. It's not worth the mention.

664
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,460
Chen, Mrs. Zhou is looking for you.

665
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,100
What is it?

666
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,630
The Tong family and the Tang family are all here.

667
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,660
The Tong and the Tang family

668
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,060
are in a fierce battle.

669
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,890
How pitiful

670
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,380
of their unconscious daughter.
