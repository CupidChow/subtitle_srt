4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,440
Something happened at home.

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,800
I have to go back and take a look.

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,440
Try to rest early today.

7
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
How's Wenxing?

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,690
She's recovering now.

9
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
She's in a terrible condition.

10
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,000
We have to schedule an operation for her as soon as possible.

11
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,120
Go.

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,920
Chen.

13
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,280
Leave this place.

14
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,640
It's a big world out there.

15
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,440
Go live your own life.

Go.

19
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,920
Chen.

20
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,560
Step out with me for a moment.

21
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
What's wrong, Ren?

22
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
Mother won't let outsiders into the guest room.

23
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,600
Lin Fei could do nothing.

24
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
I came to tell you

25
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,600
Shi Yi didn't feel well last night.

26
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,480
When did the doctor say she'd wake up?

27
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,720
In three or four hours.

28
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,450
That's how life is.

29
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,320
Sometimes

30
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,290
there are no clouds in the sky.

31
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,640
And sometimes,

32
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,580
many different things can pile on top of each other

33
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,440
until they're heavier than a mountain.

34
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,480
You have to take it easy.

35
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,320
I used to

36
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
think

37
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,000
I could

38
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
easily handle the relationship

39
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,360
between people,

40
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,520
whether it's a blood relationship,

41
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
business relationship,

42
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,880
or other social relationships.

43
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,840
But I find

44
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,760
I can't handle easily the things

45
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
related to Shi Yi.

46
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,640
When I first heard about it,

47
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
I couldn't even think.

48
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,680
I didn't dare to ask the doctor

49
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,440
what was going on.

50
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,160
I didn't dare to go in either

51
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,960
when I was at the door.

52
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,960
I was really afraid

53
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,520
something bad would happen to Shi Yi.

54
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
Didn't the doctor explain it?

55
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,680
It's appendicitis.

56
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
She will be fine.

57
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,880
Don't work yourself up.

58
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,320
I hope so.

59
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,700
It's true this house

60
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,720
is not a good place to live in.

61
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,320
It's not conducive for her recovery.

62
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,570
I'm here to take care of Wenxing.

63
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,830
Since it's not a good place to live,

64
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,490
just leave if you want to.

65
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,600
Zhousheng Chen.

66
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
You're awake?

67
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,800
It's acute appendicitis.

68
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
I was afraid the doctors there wouldn't be able to treat it.

69
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,760
So I brought you back to Shanghai.

70
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,080
No wonder it hurt so much.

71
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,480
Going back to Shanghai for acute appendicitis,

72
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
you're making a big deal out of it.

73
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,260
It's neither a life-threatening disease

74
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
nor an insignificant one.

75
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,390
Now that you're back,

76
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
let's not talk about it.

77
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,840
Just take your rest and get well soon.

78
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,960
Are you thirsty?

79
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,520
I just brought you some warm water.

80
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,680
I want to sit up.

81
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,720
Okay, come on.

82
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,600
Come closer to me.

83
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm tired of talking loudly.

84
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,760
I had a dream.

85
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,160
I dreamed that I didn't lose my memory

86
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,240
after I died in my last life.

87
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,680
Did Meng Po let you go?

88
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,680
Maybe it's because I hadn't done anything bad.

89
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
Or it's because

90
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,390
I've done too many bad things.

91
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,400
So Meng Po

92
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,880
forced me to drink her soup.

93
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,080
You are a great person.

94
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm a great person?

95
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
You know what I used to be like?

96
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,480
That's right.

97
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,760
I knew you in my past life.

98
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,240
Why don't you say something to refute me?

99
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
I don't want to.

100
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
There's nothing wrong with this assumption.

101
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,280
When I'm older,

102
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,960
I will turn to theology

103
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
as Newton did.

104
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,280
Because of me?

105
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,800
Because of you.

106
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,970
I would be such a guilt-ridden person.

107
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,120
Are you hungry?

108
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
I'll go make you something to eat.

109
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
Wait for me.

You're not working today?

147
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,960
I'm taking the day off.

148
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,480
Take the day off?

149
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
What for?

150
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,200
To take care of you.

151
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,120
I just have an appendicitis.

152
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,160
I haven't had an operation yet.

153
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,640
Are you hungry?

154
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,840
I'll make you breakfast.

155
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,540
Hello.

156
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,640
He goes shopping at the supermarket

157
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,640
every working day at 2pm,

158

[Security Guard]

159
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
goes back at 3:30.

160
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,840
This guy doesn't work.

161
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,320
He's probably unemployed.

162
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,120
What's this for?

163
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,200
This is for peeling walnuts.

164
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,400
He prepared them all.

165
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,900
So finely cut.

166
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,359
It tastes different.

167
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,839
I find your quality of life has obviously improved

168
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,319
after you got married.

169
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,760
What has improved?

170
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,920
I don't know.

171
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,480
The house is the same, the people are the same...

172

But the atmosphere is different.

173
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,040
It used to be a bachelorette pad,

174
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,160
now it's a home.

175
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,290
A sophisticated male host

176
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,640
brings about a quantum leap.

177
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,600
The taste of life is in the details.

178
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,160
The male host provides

179
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,840
those details.

180
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,920
So you

181
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,300
didn't eat fruit and snacks

182
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,580
when you lived together?

183
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,040
Yes, we did.

184
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,800
When I felt like eating them,

185
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,080
I would do so over here.

186
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,570
Shi Yi.

187
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,110
We haven't eaten fruit today.

188
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,110
I'll go to the kitchen

189
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,000
to get some fruit for her.

190
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,140
It seems my future life

191
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,240
is not going to be easy.

192
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,040
Accept your fate.

193
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,280
You're together now.

194
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,360
What can I say?

195
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
He chased me so earnestly.

196
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,680
Give him a chance.

197
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,430
We don't disturb him

198
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,400
talking like this, right?

199
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,560
I've installed soundproof walls in my study.

200
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,360
He can't hear us.

201
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,960
He'll be out at 6 pm sharp to make dinner.

202
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,480
He cooks?

203
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,000
What's the matter?

204
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,160
Nothing.

205
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,480
I just wanted to ask

206
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,720
if you're feeling

207
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,080
unwell at all?

208
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,480
Or if you have anything

209
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,560
you want to do,

210
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,010
something you want to eat,

211
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,070
or to drink?

212
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,260
If you need anything,

213
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,020
just tell me.

214
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,270
I'll make it for you.

215
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,860
Then I'll leave you to it.

216
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,880
You guys continue.

217
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,970
I'm going back to work.

218
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,760
Okay.

219
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,320
Surely he doesn't just work all day

220
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,760
taking care of you at home?

221
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,360
He took a leave of absence,

222
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,360
to look after me.

223
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,640
It's a long way to go.

224
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,480
I'll try. I'll try.

225
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,120
I don't want you two to see me off, but you don't listen to me!

226
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,840
Do we still have to pretend to be polite?

227
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,540
I'm not pretending to be polite with you.

228
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,120
I take a walk every night at 8.

229
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,920
Right on time.

230
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,700
When you didn't live here,

231
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,960
where did you go for walks?

232
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,230
In Bremen,

233
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
there was a green area under the apartment building.

234
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
In Xi'an

235
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,080
I could walk to the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda

236
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,080
and back to the institute.

237
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,590
There was also a school playground next to

238
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
the institute in Shanghai.

239
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,240
Kinda like my dad,

240
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,090
he could always find a place to fish.

241
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,480
A day for him never went to waste.

242
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,560
Life must follow some routines so as not to

243
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,320
waste a lot of time for no reason.

244
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,280
I've learnt that lesson.

245
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
Professor of chemistry, goodbye.

246
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,200
That's enough. You should go now.

247
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Let's go.

248
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

249
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,520
Let's go too.

250
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
Here, I've got some warm water for you.

251
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,150
You can go to the institute tomorrow.

252
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,270
I'm fine.

253
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
It's the same for me wherever I am.

254
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,320
Same job.

255
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,060
Same conference call.

256
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,640
It's not the same.

257
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,260
You can still work

258
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,420
at home 24 hours a day.

259
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,090
I can't do anything.

260
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,080
I always want to watch you.

261
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,440
Aren't you a dangerous beauty?

262
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,960
Nothing.

263
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Sit here and don't move.

264
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,160
I'll do it.

265
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,760
Take a good rest.

266
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,400
What are you doing here alone?

267
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,610
I've been growing lotus roots all summer.

268
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,050
There's no one left to eat them.

269
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,320
Yes, it's a pity.

270
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,060
It's my fault.

271
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,410
It's your fault.

272
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,160
Do you think the appendicitis

273
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,800
could have been brought on by diet?

274
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,740
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

275
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,390
I don't know.

276
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,170
If you're not satisfied with the food,

277
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,420
you'll be in a bad mood.

278
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,280
If you're in a bad mood, you'll get appendicitis.

279
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,720
Her getting the appendicitis

280
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,560
is still your fault.

281
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,330
Do you know how to talk properly?

282
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm just

283
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,140
following your implication.

284
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,330
Do you want to go to Shanghai?

285
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,640
Chen told us earlier

286
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,820
not to disturb them.

287
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,290
Go or not, it's totally up to you.

288
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,200
Let's go.

289
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,600
Ren.

290
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
Where are you taking me?

291
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,720
We're going to find Chen.

292
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,270
Okay, okay.

293
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,720
Did you bring all of Grandma's medicine?

294
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,720
Yes.

295
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,420
Who are we waiting for?

296
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,320
You'll find out later.

297
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,480
How have you been?

298
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,480
Good.

299
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,680
Who's the girl?

300
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,120
This is Shi Yi's cousin.

301
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Good, good.

302
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,120
Get in.

303
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,440
Grandma, let me help you.

304
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,480
Be careful.

305
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,440
Hello, Chen.

306
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,180
Chen.

307
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,610
Chen.

308
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,680
Grandma.

309
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,120
Why are you here?

310
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,600
Come on in.

311
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,320
Ren said Shi Yi had appendicitis.

312
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,880
Grandma was worried about her and came to visit her.

313
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,040
I wanted to come and check on her too.

314
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,040
So we came together.

315
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
It wasn't my idea.

316
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Grandma wants to see you.

317
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,320
I can't stop her.

318
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,080
Sit down first, Grandma.

319
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,040
Grandma's in a very stable condition

320
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,280
except that she can't recognize some people.

321
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,280
Be at peace.

322
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,040
Chen, where's Shi Yi?

323
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,600
She's washing up inside.

324
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,320
You guys sit down first.

325
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,080
I'll go get her.

326
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,120
Okay.

327
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,800
What are you looking at?

328
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,520
I'm looking at the crabs.

329
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
There are guests outside.

330
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,680
Who are they?

331
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,720
Grandma, Ren, Yuanyuan.

332
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
Liansui, Lin Fei.

333
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,880
They came together.

334
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,880
They came together?

335
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,920
How did Yuanyuan come here with them

336
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,680
together?

337
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,200
Isn't Grandma in poor health?

338
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,080
Is it okay for her to come here like this?

339
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,240
Well, she's here anyway.

340
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,760
Wait for me.

341
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,800
I'll get dressed.

342
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,500
Why do you live here

343
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,760
instead of in the new house?

344
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,920
There's a new house?

345
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,640
I thought you

346
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,040
didn't have any house in Shanghai.

347
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,080
Are you thirsty?

348
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
You think Chen would get married

349
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,600
totally unprepared?

350
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,880
That's hard to say.

351
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,720
Your family is very tricky.

352
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,160
Your families

353
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,920
won't even see

354
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,120
our families now.

355
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,240
-Though we don't live in the old society anymore,
- Thank you.

356
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,680
you still have to

357
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
follow the basic etiquettes.

358
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,040
Forget it.

359
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,700
For the sake of Chen's honesty,

360
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,040
I won't say anything bad about him.

361
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,840
The worst could happen is that

362
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,640
I'll consider him to have married into our family.

363
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,040
Shi Yi can afford him anyway.

364
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,440
She could raise three of him.

365
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,080
Why didn't you tell me

366
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,800
you were coming in advance?

367
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,120
Shi Yi.

368
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,480
Shi Yi.

369
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,800
I'll book a hotel for you.

370
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,440
We're not staying in a hotel.

371
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,440
It's a waste of money.

372
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,720
And not safe either.

373
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,200
I want to stay with you.

374
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,320
I'll stay wherever you guys want me to.

375
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,720
But

376
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,240
we can't hold so many people in my apartment.

377
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,680
Then I'll stay here.

378
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,570
They are guests.

379
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,600
Let them stay in the hotel.

380
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm not going anywhere.

381
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,880
I want to stay with you.

382
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,200
Why?

383
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,560
I want to live in the same apartment with you.

384
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,040
How about this?

385
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,720
Grandma, Liansui and Yuanyuan

386
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,480
take the bedroom.

387
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,720
You and Lin Fei will sleep on the couch.

388
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,440
Is that okay?

389
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,880
What about you and Chen?

390
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,640
You...you can stay in a hotel.

391
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,920
I saw it on the way here.

392
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,360
There's a hotel right next door.

393
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
You can't leave.

394
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,800
If they don't leave, should they sleep standing up?

395
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Chen and I

396
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,160
can sleep on the floor in the study.

397
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,600
When I was a kid at my relatives' home on New Year's Eve,

398
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,280
there were many people and not enough beds.

399
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,480
We often slept on the floor.

400
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,400
Right, Yuanyuan?

401
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,440
I slept on the floor in my great-aunt's home

402
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,800
seven or eight times.

403
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,360
Shi Yi.

404
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,000
Can I see your bedroom?

405
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,880
Of course.

406
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
Turn on the TV for Grandma.

407
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,160
Bring them some cards.

408
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,920
You don't know how to entertain the relatives.

409
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,840
Come on, Grandma.

410
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,480
What do you want to watch?

411
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,020
Shi Yi, is this all yours?

412
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,430
I used to live with someone else.

413
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,880
The study was her bedroom.

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
That's why my desk is here.

415
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,520
So the Bund is outside your house.

416
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,960
Do you stand here and look out

417
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
every morning when you get up?

418
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,490
I don't think so.

419
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,680
I've lived here too long.

420
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,660
The view outside

421
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,410
has gotten old.

422
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,800
That's true.

423
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,640
Did you come up with the idea of coming over?

424
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,840
Did you miss us?

425
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,640
Yes.

426
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,040
My dad took me to my fourth great-uncle's place.

427
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,720
I had a hard time

428
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,960
coming up with numerous excuses

429
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,320
and finally came home early.

430
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
But you guys left.

431
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,880
Are you not going to

432
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,920
go back anymore?

433
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,280
Why not?

434
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,240
Of course we're going back.

435
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,280
Come out and watch a movie with us.

436
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:26,960
Let's go.

437
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,800
Here comes the fruit.

438
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,080
You guys go ahead and watch.

439
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,360
I have work to do.

440
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,400
Good boy, we're not scared.

441
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,080
I'll teach you.

442
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,120
At a time like this,

443
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,680
eating non-stop to distract yourself

444
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,480
works best.

445
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,710
Shi Yi, eat. Aren't you afraid of the dark?

446
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,690
I have more courage than you.

447
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,300
I'm not afraid when I'm in a group of people.

448
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,960
-You're too timid.
-You scared me.

449
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,320
This child.

450
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Don't scare my little grandson.

451
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,560
You dropped your chips.

452
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,600
This girl is your girlfriend, right?

453
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,560
Yes, she is.

454
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,080
She's so pretty.

455
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,090
There's a lot of competition, right?

456
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,800
There's

457
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,720
a whole lot of competition.

458
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,280
Look at you.

459
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,840
Good, good.

460
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,310
Miss.

461
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,850
My eldest grandson

462
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,920
is smart.

463
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,560
Smarter than the average person.

464
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,520
It's useless for a man to be good-looking.

465
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,860
Intelligence is the most important.

466
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,040
That way,

467
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,410
when you two have a child,

468
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,860
the child is going to have high IQ.

469
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,050
And when your child has a high IQ,

470
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,720
you don't have to worry about him

471
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,410
as a mother.

472
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,000
Yes.

473
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,570
Grandma obviously doesn't remember me.

474
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,590
But she praises me a lot every time she sees me.

475
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,430
You taught her?

476
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,680
That was all from her heart.

477
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,960
Grandma.

478
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,920
Good.

479
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,560
Good.

480
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,080
Good.

481
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,800
So filial. My grandson.

482
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,910
I'll take it.

483
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,850
Okay.

484
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,170
Grandma.

485
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,250
Go to bed.

486
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,160
It's the first time I've slept in the same room with you.

487
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,680
I'm not used to it.

488
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,400
It'll also be the last time.

489
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,640
Do you think I would like

490
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,000
to sleep in the same room with you?

491
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
What do you think you want?

492
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,680
You gave up a nice hotel

493
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,880
to sleep on the sofa.

494
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,160
It's fun.

495
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Now you say it's fun.

496
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,320
You usually don't even let other people

497
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,160
sit in the same car with you.

498
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,840
Now you don't mind?

499
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,410
Your feet are facing my head.

500
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,840
Can you change the direction?

501
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,360
I don't want to.

502
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,920
Who wants to be so close to you?

503
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,960
Did you take a shower?

504
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,240
Of course I did.

505
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
I was the second to last to take it.

506
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't want to stay close to you even if you did.

507
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
What's wrong? Did you not sleep well?

508
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,700
It was comfortable.

509
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,240
Comfortable?

510
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,720
Chen, you go to sleep.

511
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,040
We're all fine.

512
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,760
Really.

513
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,640
Then you guys get some rest.

514
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,040
You've reached the peak

515
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,440
of personally admiring him, right?

516
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
And Shi Yi.

517
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,060
Only Chen is worthy of her.

518
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,040
Grandma's asleep?

519
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,400
Yes.

520
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,159
Lian Sui.

521
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,719
They call you Lian Sui, Lian Sui.

522
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,320
Your last name is Lian?

523
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,080
My last name is Zhou.

524
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,699
You're all related?

525
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,400
That's right.

526
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,350
Some are close and some are distant.

527
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,860
I'm kind of distant,

528
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,600
like a hundred thousand miles away,

529
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,350
kind of relative.

530
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,520
Then what do you call Chen?

531
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,030
I should call him great-uncle.

532
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,679
Great-uncle?

533
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,800
I didn't ask him.

534
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,719
What about my cousin?

535
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,970
Great-aunt.

536
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,760
She is so

537
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,400
young and beautiful.

538
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,320
How can she be a 'great' anything to you?

539
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,830
I have no choice.

540
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,490
She is a senior anyway.

541
00:34:59,440 --> 00:34:59,940
I'm going to sleep.

542
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,480
Go to sleep.

543
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,090
Good night.

544
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,440
Good night.

545
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,840
Is the floor hard to sleep on?

546
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,360
It's okay.

547
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,520
Did the doctor say

548
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,840
I need an operation last time?

549
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,400
Do I have to have my appendix removed?

550
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,490
I chose a more conservative treatment,

551
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,560
taking some medication to reduce inflammation,

552
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,120
so you don't need an operation.

553
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,410
If it gets inflamed again,

554
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,000
we'll see then.

555
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,640
It's better not get inflamed again, it'll hurt like crazy.

556
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,210
Think about it.

557
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,720
I'm quite delicate.

558
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,680
Not only am I afraid of the dark, but I'm also afraid of pain.

559
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,200
Do you think I'm delicate?

560
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,360
No, I don't.

561
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,560
Really?

562
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,880
But think about it.

563
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,840
I seem to have more advantages.

564
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,420
I can cook.

565
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,700
I can clean the house.

566
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,900
I can draw.

567
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,800
I can write.

568
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,800
I can also do dubbing.

569
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,470
Yes, you have a lot of good points.

570
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,220
♫In the memory♫

571
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,520
♫The snow-covered city tower♫

572
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,700
Why did you come down?

573
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,340
I want to sleep with you in my arms.

574
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:48,410
♫When your name rings out♫

575
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,520
All right.

576
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,060
♫Finally blooming again♫

577
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,410
♫Like a flower of the soul♫

578
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:03,600
♫The dreams that have accompanied me through the light years♫

579
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,760
Zhousheng Chen.

580
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,120
♫I know that with just one look♫

581
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,680
I love you.

582
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,640
♫I can be sure it's the end♫

583
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,240
♫Not afraid of falling♫

584
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
Did you hear me?

585
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,620
♫Running to the world with you♫

586
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,890
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

587
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,760
November,

588
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,000
let's get married.

589
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,670
♫With your name in each line♫

590
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
We'll hold an official wedding reception.

591
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,350
♫If it started all over again♫

592
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,740
I'm asking you to answer I love you.

593
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,000
♫I'd still remember our love♫

594
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,400
Who asked you about the wedding?

595
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,500
That's my answer.

596
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,860
♫It took♫

597
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,800
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

598
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,580
♫For our love to begin♫

599
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,440
Good night.

600
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,040
Good night.

601
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:49,070
♫There's no way it'd end♫

602
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,480
Here, eat it while it's warm.

603
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,720
I make the best meatloaf.

604
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,440
Chen always eats several pieces.

605
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,600
It's really good.

606
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm not lying, right?

607
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,960
Shi Yi.

608
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,920
Can I come and stay with you

609
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,360
on vacation?

610
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,040
Yes, you can.

611
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,640
But you have to put your studies first.

612
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
If you do well in your exams, you can stay for a few days.

613
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
If you don't do well, you won't get to stay as long.

614
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,920
If you have kids,

615
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
can I still come and stay here?

616
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,840
Of course.

617
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,160
Then I hope you'll have a girl.

618
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,800
Is there a difference if it's a boy or a girl?

619
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,680
There is.

620
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,280
If you have another boy,

621
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I'll not be so novel to you anymore.

622
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,920
Rare things are precious.

623
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,680
We haven't even had a baby yet,

624
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,240
and you're already jealous.

625
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,080
All right, get out of here.

626
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:56,840
There's a lot of oil here.

627
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,440
Ren.

628
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,470
Let's go play cards.

629
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,680
I'm not going.

630
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Then what are you doing?

631
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,440
Waiting to serve Shi Yi.

632
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,280
There are several plates. She can't carry them all.

633
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,850
Sir.

634
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,320
Sir, only one meat dish?

635
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,320
You should at least have two meat dishes.

636
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,760
There aren't any meat dishes

637
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,920
I'd especially like to eat today.

638
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,110
Sir.

639
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,770
You now live in Shi Yi's house

640
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,460
before marriage, right?

641
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,670
Yes.

642
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,080
Is it convenient?

643
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
It's quite convenient.

644
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,040
It's very close to the institute.

645
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,280
Then...

646
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,290
What did you do

647
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
with your salary all these years?

648
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,280
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

649
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,090
No, I'm just curious.

650
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,240
Sometimes the lab

651
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,600
needs to buy some things.

652
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,120
Since the budget can't be approved in a short notice,

653
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,040
I often

654
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,080
buy them myself first.

655
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,670
Sir.

656
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,060
If the lab needs something in the future,

657
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,920
tell me.

658
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:29,690
I'll buy it.

659
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,360
No need.

660
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,440
I bought it for you, sir.

661
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,440
Sir, you have to take a tonic.

662
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,040
We don't like it. You have it.

663
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,200
It's all yours.

664
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
An old troublemaker,

665
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,680
and a young troublemaker...

666
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,920
you're taking them both off our hands.

667
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,240
I'm so impressed.

668
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
Don't blame Liansui.

669
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,560
I'm the one who brought them out here.

670
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,560
You dare to speak?

671
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,320
Your father was so angry yesterday.

672
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,850
You're his heart and soul.

673
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,600
You know that, don't you?

674
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,080
We were all scolded mercilessly.

675
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,830
Shi Yi, Chen I'm leaving now.

676
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,120
Bye, Grandma.

677
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,460
Bye. Bye.

678
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:26,930
Grandma.

679
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,320
Take care of yourself at home.

680
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,820
We will visit you often when we have time.

681
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,340
Good, good.

682
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,410
Chen.

683
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,920
You must visit me when you have time.

684
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,050
I will.

685
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,230
Don't forget.

686
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,630
Be safe.

687
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,560
Take care.

688
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,560
Go back. Go back.

689
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,200
We're leaving.

690
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:51,930
Okay.

691
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,760
When we move in the new house after New Year,

692
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
let Grandma live here in Shanghai

693
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,080
if you don't want to leave her alone.

694
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,280
It's a big house anyway.

695
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,520
Grandma doesn't want to leave the old house.

696
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,520
That's how older people think.

697
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,940
I suggest to my grandparents that they

698
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,140
come to Shanghai for medical checkups every year.

699
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,170
I've tried to persuade them,

700
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,210
but they won't listen to me.

701
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,380
This weekend,

702
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,630
my fourth great-uncle and my uncles

703
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,720
will all be in Shanghai.

704
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,720
Let's go back to our old house on Hunan Road

705
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,420
for a couple of days.

706
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,440
Okay.

707
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,860
So this is a formal

708
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,730
parents' meeting?

709
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,320
Shi Yi.

710
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,040
I think this style of decoration

711
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,600
is the kind you like.

712
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,380
Basically, I'm in charge of

713
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,630
the later decoration.

714
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,400
You're not even the hostess yet

715
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,800
but you're already taking charge, aren't you?

716
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,560
See, you were afraid

717
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,120
our daughter would suffer here.

718
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,640
You're making it a big deal.

719
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,640
Uncle, Auntie.

720
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,960
This is my fourth great-uncle.

721
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,570
He is the most senior in our family.

722
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,040
These are my uncles.

723
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,530
Fourth Great-Uncle.

724
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,890
This is Shi Yi's mom and dad.

725
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,300
-How are you? How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

726
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,120
Welcome. Welcome.

727
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,160
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

728
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,960
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

729
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,400
We're in-laws now.

730
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,950
If there is anything not to your liking,

731
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,520
please forgive us.

732
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,300
Not at all!

733
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,580
Take a seat first.

734
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,300
Let's all sit down.

735
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,650
Come on, let's all sit down.

736
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,320
Take a seat.

737
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,650
Shi Yi, make some tea.

738
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,010
Come on.

739
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,040
You've come all this way.

740
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,330
As a rule,

741
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,280
we should have gone to see you first.

742
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,600
We've made you

743
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,730
come all the way to Shanghai.

744
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,680
It must be tiring.

745
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,960
It's nothing.

746
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,600
Son.

747
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,930
You should be clear about

748
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,360
Wenxing's current situation.

749
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:13,960
Dad.

750
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm sure everything will be fine with

751
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,920
Wenxing's operation this time.

752
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,320
And

753
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,600
I want to tell you that

754
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,320
I was always out in the world,

755
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,910
not being able to settle down.

756
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,280
But recently I've realized

757
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,320
that actually,

758
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,150
the person I should cherish most

759
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,080
is right here by my side.

760
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,120
So don't worry.

761
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:36,640
I understand.
