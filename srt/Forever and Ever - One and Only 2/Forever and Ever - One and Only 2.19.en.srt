6
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,620
You are drinking alone?

7
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,300
Want some?

8
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,660
No, thanks.

9
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,140
What's up?

10
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,620
Nothing.

11
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,620
Then why are you constantly staring at your phone?

12
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,700
I sent Shi Yi a text,

13
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,180
yet she hasn't responded.

14
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,340
Why don't you just call her?

15
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,980
She's in sleep,

16
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,340
I am afraid I will disturb her.

You two

18
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,020
are too polite to be a couple.

19
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,100
Shi Yi went to the hospital.

20
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,320
Give me the car key.

21
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Why do you want to the key?

22
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,120

Are you okay?

Why did you bring Wang Yingdong here?

29
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,940
We were at the same party just now.

30
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,700
I was drunk, so I was unable to drive.

31

He knew that I was coming for you

32
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,700
and never gave me a chance to say no.

33
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,620
Well, put this under your wrist.

34
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,300
Where did you get this?

35
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,220
I bought it downstairs.

36
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,100
No, thanks. I am good, I am not feeling cold.

37
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,860
Well, then you take care of her.

38
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,340
Okay, I got it.

Did you come here together?

65
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,620
I was afraid he might get distracted

66
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,460
due to his worry about you,

67
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,020
so I came along.

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,830
that I'll go visit in Shanghai tomorrow.

Can you accompany her throughout the night?

72
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,420
Is that even a question?

73
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,620
I am her husband.

Here's the thing.

76

We know that you are usually very busy.

77

As her friends,

78
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,780
we will definitely come here for her, right?

79

Thank you.

Bye.

83
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,700
Then I am leaving too.

Where are you going?

85
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,380
You two have made it to see each other,

86
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,700
which means my job is done.

87
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,260
I am going somewhere for fun.

88
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,510
Bye.

89

Why is your hand so cold?

90

is near here.

92
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,460
Do I need to take you there?

93
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,540
The doctors there will be better.

94
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,400
I am too tired to move.

95
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,420
I don't know

96
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,700
Wang Yingdong would come here today.

97
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,100
Are you jealous?

98
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,540
No.

99
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,780
Get closer to me.

100
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,860
Closer.

101
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,700
Come on.

102
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,100
I will do it when we go home.

103
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,780
Wait a minute for me.

104
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,820
I will be right back.

105
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,340
Stay here.

106
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,060
Hi, I'm wondering

107
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,700
how long it will take

108
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,460
before she can go home?

109
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,660
Your wife is Shi Yi, right?

110
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,540
That's right.

111
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,340
At least three hours.

112
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,820
Are there any wards available here?

113
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,380
They've already been occupied.

114
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,380
Thank you.

115
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,860
Hello.

116
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,980
This is Zhousheng Chen.

117
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,180
Help me book a ward

118
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,220
near the Central Hospital.

119
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,180
Thanks.

120
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,780
I am only here

121
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,420
to get some tea today.

122
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,300
I never expected to see you coming for me.

123
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,900
This is a very remote area

124
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,900
where it's difficult to get a cab.

125
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,580
How are you gonna go back

126
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,820
if you get drunk?

127
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,740
Let's drink first

128
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,540
and leave the following stuff behind.

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,980
Right.

130
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,260
If you overdrink,

131
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,020
there's a staff dormitory here.

132
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,540
Great alcohol.

133
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,500
Take it slowly.

134
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,500
The heated alcohol

135
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,780
is easy to make people drunk.

136
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,620
What's the matter? You have something in mind?

137
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,180
Grown-ups

138
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
all have something in mind

139
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,540
that they find it hard to talk about.

140
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,420
That's right.

141
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,100
Here.

142
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,940
I don't have a lot of friends here

143
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,500
and I am afraid that I would say something wrong if I get drunk.

144
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,420
So I couldn't come to those I am familiar with either.

145
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,530
That's why you are here for me?

146
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay, okay.

147
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,460
Isn't it good that I could go home to sleep

148
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,820
after getting 3 to 4 hours of infusion

149
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,300
over there?

150
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,540
Your husband cares about you.

151
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,620
Isn't it better to have a ward?

152
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
So that you can sleep whenever you want.

153
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,100
Take a good rest.

154
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,700
Thank you.

155
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,900
Go have a rest now, it's over 10 pm now.

156
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,340
Sit down.

157
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,780
Sit here.

158
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
You are not sleepy?

159
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,820
No.

160
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,540
I have to chat with you.

161
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,660
All right, go ahead.

162
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,620
I am a patient, you want me to talk?

163
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,700
Okay, then I will be the one to speak.

164
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,460
What do you want to hear?

165
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,140
Describe what was on your mind when you felt jealous just now.

166
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,420
Just tell me about it.

167
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,260
Not feeling well.

168
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,020
And?

169
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,460
It's just not feeling well.

170
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,420
Don't put me off.

171
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,900
Did you fail your Chinese tests when you were young?

172
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,020
I was not bad at Chinese,

173
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,020
although I never got a full mark.

174
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,840
Who could get a full mark in Chinese tests?

175
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,420
Do you actually know

176
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,740
what it means to be modest?

177
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,380
For those I am not good at,

178
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,740
I am always very modest.

179
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,220
What about those you specialize in?

180
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,700
In the fields where I specialize,

181
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,540
modesty leads to fear.

182
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,020
I will stop people from making progress.

183
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,340
That's way off the point.

184
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,340
You brought it up first.

185
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,220
All right, my fault.

186
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,740
Go on.

187
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,300
Talk about how you feel about jealousy.

188
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,340
Where are you going?

189
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,900
Your question is pretty tough to answer.

190
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,780
I need more time

191
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,980
to think about it.

192
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
How's the water temperature?

193
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,980
The water you fetched must be warm.

194
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,540
You see, you are such a grown-up,

195
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,980
yet you still want me to take care of you.

196
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,380
How about me helping you

197
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,340
wash your feet later?

198
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,860
No need for that.

199
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,320
Lin Fei.

200
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,900
It's late at night, what's going on?

201
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,020
Why are you not sleeping?

202
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,420
Me Xing overdrank

203
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,820
in the tea plant on the outskirt.

204
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,660
Would you mind

205
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
helping me pick him up?

206
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,860
No, not at all.

207
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,700
It's just overdrinking.

208
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,740
Lin Fei, hurry up and go pick him up.

209
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,580
Okay, no problem.

210
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,500
Needless to say,

211
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,980
I won't feel easy if this was handed on others.

212
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,940
Hurry up.

213
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,620
Slowly, slowly.

214
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,460
I am sorry to bother you today.

215
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,220
Mr. Zhao.

216
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,420
Don't mention it.

217
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,180
It was my fault as well.

218
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,940
I shouldn't have given him so much to drink.

219
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,040
Uncle Zhao.

220
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,210
I am not drunk.

221
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are not, you are not.

222
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,460
Let's keep drinking.

223
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,100
-Go on.
-Let's keep drinking after getting in the car.

224
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,100
Be careful.

225
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,660
Let's go.

226
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:21,980
Slowly.

227
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,380
Watch out, watch out.

228
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
Yeah, okay.

229
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,540
Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Zhao.

230
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,500
Now go.

231
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Okay, we are leaving, Mr. Zhao.

232
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,000
Drive slowly.

233
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,300
Be careful.

234
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,680
Get off the car.

235
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,580
Get off the car.

236
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,300
Get off the car.

237
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,980
Don't dilly-dally.

238
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,200
Get all of your

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,580
valuable stuff out.

240
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,620
Bro.

241
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,880
I didn't take anything

242
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,850
valuable with me today.

243
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,850
Cut the crap.

244
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Now, take it out.

245
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,050
I only have this watch

246
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,210
with me.

247
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,660
You can have it.

248
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,620
Anything else?

249
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
I, I

250
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,700
have nothing else to give you.

251
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,820
Nothing else?

252
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,180
What are you doing?

253
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,620
What are you doing?

254
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,340
Mind your own business.

255
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,660
What are you doing?

256
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,290
-Go.
-Go.

257
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,570
Go.

258
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,620
Mr. Mei.

259
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,650
Uncle Lin.

260
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,460
What's going on here?

261
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,740
They are robbers.

262
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,740
Do we need to call the police?

263
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,620
No.

264
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,700
My father doesn't want me

265
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,060
to get involved in the business here.

266
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,060
It would be more of a trouble if he knew this.

267
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,540
Don't tell anybody what happened today.

268
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,340
Including my father.

269
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,060
But...

270
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,940
But if we don't call the police.

271
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,900
What if it was not a robbery?

272
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,060
Didn't you get beaten for no reason?

273
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,380
I know whom to blame

274
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,619
for this.

275
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,500
All right, let's go home first.

276
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,420
No, I'm not going home.

277
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,940
How about hospital?

278
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,740
Just to tell our family about it.

279
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,790
Wenxing is mousy,

280
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,730
she would be more worried

281
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,740
if she sees what I look like right now.

282
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,320
Let's go dress the wounds.

283
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,540
All right.

284
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,300
Slowly.

285
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,420
You drive that car home.

286
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,500
I will take him to the hospital.

287
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,100
Okay.

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,780
Slowly.

289
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,210
Here.

290
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,940
You are back.

291
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,980
Where is Mei Xing?

292
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,820
He drank too much

293
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,820
and let nobody touch him,

294
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,020
so he went to sleep there.

295
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,620
Uncle Lin went to find you, did you see him?

296
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, we did.

297
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,860
He is with him there.

298
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,500
Thank you for tonight.

299
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
I have to go now.

300
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,060
Zhousheng Chen.

301
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,340
Are you sleep walking?

302
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,900
You haven't fallen asleep yet?

303
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,660
I did, and now I am awake.

304
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,820
I walked around

305
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,700
your bed

306
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,910
and I noticed the central air-conditioner

307
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,380
is blowing right towards your legs and feet.

308
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,660
I am afraid you might catch a cold,

309
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,780
so I went to turn up

310
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,820
the heat.

311
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,100
I have the quilt on me, the cold air won't get me.

312
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,900
You like to kick the quilt.

313
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,860
Nonsense.

314
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,440
I never do.

315
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,940
I just realized marriage is pretty good.

316
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,460
You just realized

317
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,660
how good it is to get married?

318
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,740
I have been to hospital alone

319
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,180
ever since I started to work.

320
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,260
I would feel sorry

321
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,180
if I had to bother my friends

322
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,780
as they needed to work the next morning.

323
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,460
If I asked my parents to come with me,

324
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,980
I would be afraid they would get too worried.

325
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,860
What about you?

326
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,420
Who would go to a doctor with you?

327
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,380
I have always been alone.

328
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,660
Only when I had a minor surgery

329
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,500
that I asked my classmate to go with me.

330
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,740
Didn't your family accompany you?

331
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,900
They didn't know.

332
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,500
Well, why didn't you ask someone from the corporate

333
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,300
to come along.

334
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,820
I didn't know them at that time.

335
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,980
No wonder

336
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,180
the driver in Bremen said

337
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,940
he had never seen you in the company.

338
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,660
I didn't have to.

339
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,580
I was not interested anyway.

340
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,420
Then who would drive for you?

341
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,660
You were not good at driving, were you?

342
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,660
It only takes ten minutes

343
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,220
from my institute to the apartment on foot.

344
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,420
I didn't need to drive.

345
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,580
Well, there were definitely occasions

346
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
when you need them, right?

347
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,060
When you need to go to the supermarket

348
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,500
and buy some food or daily essentials,

349
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,980
a car is handy for carrying stuff.

350
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,420
Whether they are food

351
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,980
or daily essentials,

352
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,090
my institute has got them all.

353
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,740
You are the one

354
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,660
with the least requirements for your life

355
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,560
among all the people I know.

356
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,020
What a couple,

357
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,460
you guys have been talking since the moment you moved in

358
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,900
and you are still talking once she woke up in the middle of night.

359
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,210
What a great relationship you have.

360
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,700
You don't feel uncomfortable, right?

361
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,380
No.

362
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,620
The lady's husband.

363
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,060
Our patient needs to rest.

364
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,860
Time to sleep.

365
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,200
Then I'll go to bed.

366
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,700
Good night.

367
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,060
Good night.

368
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,660
I can't fall asleep.

369
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,980
Zhousheng Chen.

370
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,140
Can you talk with me a little bit longer?

371
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,360
Professor Zhousheng?

372
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Mr. Zhousheng?

373
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,780
Zhousheng Chen.

374
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,210
Fell asleep so soon?

375
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,540
Why did you come down here?

376
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,620
I can't fall asleep if you are not holding me in your arms.

377
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,180
Go sleep on the bed.

378
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,380
I want to sleep here.

379
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,220
All right.

380
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,300
Good night.

381
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,260
Good night.

382
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,860
Why is your face black and blue?

383
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,500
I accidentally fell down.

384
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,660
You alcoholic.

385
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,580
Why can't you drink at home?

386
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,780
Why did you have to go out?

387
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,180
Your family has got too many rules, I dare not.

388
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,580
I gotta go.

389
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,780
You guys continue.

390
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,060
Thank you, Uncle Lin.

391
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,540
Come over here, I will apply some medicine for you.

392
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,220
I have been applied.

393
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,100
What's the matter?

394
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,620
Lean against here.

395
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,020
Here, come on.

396
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,780
Did you feel better?

397
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,380
Afraid, are you?

398
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,700
This is the result of you hiding things from me.

399
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,700
The reason why I didn't tell you

400
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,860
is exactly because I was afraid that you would get too worried.

401
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,340
How many times have you taken this medicine these days?

402
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,020
There was much more

403
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,840
last time I checked it last week.

404
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,660
I dropped some yesterday

405
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,060
and I forgot to refill it.

406
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,580
You need to check it every day from now on.

407
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,380
Why did you drink?

408
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,820
Are you bored at staying at my home?

409
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,290
To release the pressure, obviously.

410
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,700
There is too much pressure from work.

411
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,300
You have a big household with a large fortune

412
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,500
and your family is investing on manufacturing

413
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,180
which has the most powerful growth momentum.

414
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,580
I can't sleep, not even a single night.

415
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,340
Bring me along when you go for a drink next time.

416
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,670
Bring you along?

417
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,260
Well, the next day,

418
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,340
I will get kicked out by your mother.

419
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,660
I will be just watching without drinking.

420
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,580
At best, it's like when I was a kid

421
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,140
and I wanted to have liquor filled chocolate,

422
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,020
you could let me have a lick of that on the sly.

423
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,380
I remember when we were kids

424
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,260
and you were having a chocolate,

425
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,900
you would lick it first

426
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,980
and then put it in my mouth.

427
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,140
And you would start to cry if I didn't take it.

428
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,420
As a result, when my father came in,

429
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,860
he thought I was the one who secretly

430
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,100
let you eat the liquor filled chocolate

431
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,300
and gave me a good kick.

432
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,140
He almost

433
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
wasted his own son.

434
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,660
If you want to drink next time,

435
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,380
drink at home.

436
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,060
Anyhow, you have Uncle Lin

437
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,420
and Uncle Chen to take care of you.

438
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,660
Okay.

439
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:16,260
[Family of Books and Ritual]

440
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,180
Uncle Lin.

441
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,260
Look at the water on the ground.

442
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,260
Stay away, far away.

443
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,340
What a pity

444
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,780
if such a pair of beautiful shoes got stained.

445
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,300
Uncle Lin, I was gonna ask...

446
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,020
You want to ask about what happened last night, right?

447
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,380
They bumped into some robbers for money.

448
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,980
He didn't hold his temper after overdrinking

449
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,100
and took a few hits.

450
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,660
Where did the robbers come from?

451
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,740
He's a man,

452
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,460
it doesn't matter for him to take a few hits.

453
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,820
Meanwhile,

454
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,980
isn't it a good thing

455
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,700
for him to remember

456
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,900
not to overdrink in the future?

457
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,980
Yesterday,

458
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,860
Mei Xing got beaten by others.

459
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,860
Oh, yeah?

460
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,660
How's he?

461
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,380
Do you really have no idea

462
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,860
or are you pretending that you don't know?

463
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,140
My account is now being checked by my own family

464
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,340
while I am being watched by Mr. Mei and his son.

465
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,420
I don't even dare to go to the company,

466
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,780
yet I have to be treated unfairly by my own sister.

467
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,940
Am I not the poorest man here?

468
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,580
My life is way harder than you thought.

469
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,980
The moment Chen was back,

470
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,820
all my plans I'd made these years

471
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,660
were ruined.

472
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,060
I am not only losing my own money,

473
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,180
the ones who co-invested with me

474
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,540
are now trying to get even with me.

475
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,500
We are twins from the same mother

476
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,860
and we share the same blood.

477
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,980
The one you should take most care of

478
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,940
is me.

479
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,660
I just hope you are all safe and sound.

480
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,020
Who doesn't?

481
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,140
Here.

482
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,820
It still feels to be a bit hot.

483
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,260
Not really.

484
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,860
Our body temperatures are pretty much the same.

485
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,860
I will buy you

486
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,740
a thermometer.

487
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,900
We have one at home.

488
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,460
It's in the right drawer of the desk.

489
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,380
Here.

490
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,940
You see, 36.9 degrees,

491
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,820
pretty normal.

492
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
This is tasteless.

493
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,340
You are still recovering.

494
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,060
You should eat something bland.

495
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,260
Add some sugar, can I?

496
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,820
How much?

497
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,980
Half a spoon.

498
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,940
A quarter of a spoon.

499
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,740
Who is it?

500
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,220
Zhousheng Chen's wife?

501
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,140
It's mine.

502
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,420
It's the vegetables I bought, take them in.

503
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,580
Give it to me, please.

504
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,900
Here.

505
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,820
Thank you, thank you.

506
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,940
You bought vegetables.

507
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,700
We agreed, a quarter of a spoon.

508
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,060
You're stingy.

509
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,220
So that marks us

510
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,460
officially living our lives together.

511
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,300
So what do you

512
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,860
want to talk about?

513
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
House chores.

514
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,060
Okay.

515
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,300
I have hired a

516
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
cleaning lady to do the cleaning job

517
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,860
and she has been working for almost four years.

518
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,060
She will come over to have three times of thorough cleaning every week.

519
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,540
So, we don't have to

520
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,780
worry about cleaning.

521
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,380
She is from a financially embarrassed family

522
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,620
and she works really hard.

523
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,740
If there's no problem,

524
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,060
I don't want to fire her.

525
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,740
No need to fire her.

526
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,380
You have the final say in this house.

527
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,820
I can cook.

528
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,820
So, no need to

529
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,900
hire another one to cook for us.

530
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,220
Bad news is we need to wash to dishes

531
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,780
and clean up the kitchen ourselves.

532
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,540
Along with washing the laundry, hang the clothes out,

533
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,180
bring the clothes in and fold the clothes.

534
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,620
The fact that you can split one thing

535
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,300
into four

536
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,620
tells me that

537
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,460
you are really not a big fan of doing the laundry.

538
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,980
Washing and hanging them out in particular.

539
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,260
Bringing in and folding clothes are fine.

540
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,580
I'll do it.

541
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,100
I like cooking,

542
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,540
but dislike washing the dishes.

543
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,020
I'll do it.

544
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,980
What about cleaning up the kitchen?

545
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,300
I'll do it.

546
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,739
That's my boy.

547
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,540
Here's your reward.

548
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,420
Now, do you think

549
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,860
getting married is actually not bad?

550
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,100
I used to think

551
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,219
that it would be worth getting married

552
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,420
if someone could share the duty of

553
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,980
doing what I hate.

554
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,260
You don't ask for too much

555
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,300
and are easily satisfied.

556
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,900
If you can put up with

557
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,659
having noodles every single day

558
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,340
in the future,

559
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,180
I can also take the job

560
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,300
of cooking.

561
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,380
Cooking is where my happiness is from.

562
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,180
Well, now.

563
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,780
Do you think marrying me

564
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,380
is actually a good thing?

565
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,220
The dishes I make taste like home

566
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,540
and are better than what aunties make.

567
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,380
I'd say I was lucky.

568
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,580
And washing the fruits.

569
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,220
I'll take it.

570
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,260
I am pretty sure

571
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,460
you are born

572
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,900
to marry me.

573
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,420
Everything I hate to do,

574
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,540
you can do them all.

575
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,260
I have always

576
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,780
been into washing things.

577
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,860
Dealing with all kinds of dirty

578
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,780
utensils or cabinet.

579
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,500
What about things in the sink?

580
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,300
I'll do it.

581
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,460
It seems like

582
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,020
you have never gone into this place.

583
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,740
No, I haven't.

584
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,500
Aren't you interested in

585
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,620
my workplace?

586
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,740
Of course, I am.

587
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,300
When I first knew you,

588
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,820
I searched it on the internet

589
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,140
and found some pictures of its interior.

590
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,060
So I have, more or less,

591
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,300
some knowledge about it.

592
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,580
This is my recording studio.

593
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,340
If you want to go in,

594
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,660
just walk in there.

595
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,620
Yours?

596
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,580
Yeah, my workshop rent it.

597
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,020
Let's go.

598
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,700
I will show you my property.

599
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,100
Hey, it's you guys.

600
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,220
Your feet are okay?

601
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,540
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,620
When it comes to this,

603
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,260
I gotta thank you

604
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,180
and your boyfriend.

605
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,940
Sorry, I've got a phone call.

606
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,500
Hello?

607
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,380
Yeah, yeah, I am sorry.

608
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,460
I will be right there.

609
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,100
Okay, okay, okay, will do.

610
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,980
I am sorry.

611
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,500
I've got too many orders.

612
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,380
I gotta go.

613
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,300
Bye.

614
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,100
Bye.

615
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,900
How do you know him?

616
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,980
Well, by chance.

617
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,060
Let's go.

618
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,100
Miss Shi.

619
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,820
Miss Lin.

620
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,060
This is our sound engineer, Lin Yao.

621
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,100
This is my husband.

622
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,620
Nice to meet you.

623
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,220
Nice to meet you.

624
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,900
It's the first time our beauty

625
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,940
brings her family member here, huh.

626
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,260
You just go on what you're doing and I'll show him around.

627
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,180
This is the control room.

628
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,420
In there you have the recording studio.

629
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,660
That's the monitor

630
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
and the TV in there.

631
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,060
They have the same display signal.

632
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,940
That way, people on both sides

633
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,460
can see the same picture.

634
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,140
Let's get in there and have a look.

635
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,180
Let's go.

636
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,780
When doing the recording, there will be two mics positioned,

637
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,740
one close to you, one far away.

638
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,860
Can you guess why?

639
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,620
To record two sounds,

640
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,460
if you want to use the sound recorded near you,

641
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,660
use the one recorded by the mic that's closer to you.

642
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,340
Otherwise,

643
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,340
use the one recorded by the farther mic.

644
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,540
Almost there.

645
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,460
We read once,

646
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,860
and he will have two soundtracks.

647
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,780
When doing the sound mixing,

648
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,020
depending on the scenario,

649
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,780
he can choose either the closer one or the farther one.

650
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,020
So when you were playing the heroine,

651
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,740
you would sit here and dub

652
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,300
with a male voice actor?

653
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,580
Sometimes I would do dubbing together with another actor.

654
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,140
But it's quite rare

655
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,500
as two people dubbing together

656
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,620
is highly demanding

657
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,300
for their skills.

658
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,780
That's why we would usually do solo recording.

659
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,700
For example, I could,

660
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,660
from this afternoon all the way till tonight,

661
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,420
finish dubbing

662
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
about two to three episodes for my own part.

663
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,900
I would usually be the first one to dub.

664
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,340
Because it's always the hardest.

665
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,180
Let's go out and have a look.

666
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,500
With the size of such a recording studio,

667
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,900
how many voice actors

668
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,620
would you recruit?

669
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,420
That depends.

670
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,860
As long as we have voices

671
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,780
of all different ages,

672
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,420
from junior to senior.

673
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,660
We could have a whole package project working.

674
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,700
My workshop

675
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,500
has signed up with dozens of voice actors.

676
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,660
Miss Shi can stand on top of the pyramid

677
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,020
of her industry

678
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,580
at her twenties.

679
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,500
That's pretty impressive.

680
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,700
More impressive than I am.

681
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,900
No, not really.

682
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,460
You are flattering me.

683
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,220
Every time you stood down there waiting for me,

684
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,820
I would be standing here watching you.

685
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,460
Here you are.

686
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,900
[Debit card]

687
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,780
What is it?

688
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,020
My salary card which I just got.

689
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,140
This feels fantastic

690
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,300
to have someone hand to me his salary.

691
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,500
It's like I have the power in my grip

692
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,260
and I have you in my hand.

693
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,660
Miss Shi.

694
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,380
You have a very strong desire for control, do you know that?

695
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,100
Shi Yi,

696
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,820
you are here.

697
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,860
Me and Wang Yingdong

698
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,380
are simply workmates.

699
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,540
He often comes here.

700
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,260
I know.

701
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,740
I have no feelings about him.

702
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,460
Not even a single bit.

703
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,260
I can see that.

704
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,500
Do you really not mind?

705
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
Yes, I do.

706
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,020
But I can manage to digest it myself.

707
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,540
Nevertheless, hearing that you said you do

708
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,700
makes me feel a bit proud.

709
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,260
Proud?

710
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,780
I love to see you getting jealous.

711
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,180
Mother,

712
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,180
if you are tired,

713
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,220
I can help you get upstairs to take a rest.

714
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,660
No, I am good.

715
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,380
You don't have to go.

716
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,900
Here, we've got more people to look after each other.

717
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,020
And the grandsons and granddaughters can make you happy.

718
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,460
How wonderful is that?

719
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,500
East or West,

720
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,780
home is the best.

721
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,340
I have been used to living at my own home

722
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,700
and I feel like a guest wherever I go.

723
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,820
I am not going there.

724
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,220
How about we wait till they come back?

725
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,530
Meet each other

726
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,600
and then leave after having a reunion dinner?

727
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,780
Sounds good, good.

728
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,740
So, Chen and his newly married wife.

729
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,580
When are they coming back?

730
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,540
This weekend.

731
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,050
This time after they return.

732
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,660
You gotta treat them better.

733
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,980
It reminds me of

734
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,840
how I treated you

735
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,480
when I saw how you treat them.

736
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,810
I was so stubborn and so subjective,

737
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,560
trying so hard to separate you and the second eldest son of Zhou family.

738
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,440
It's already too late for me to regret now.

739
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,160
Too late.

740
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,360
Wan.

741
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,560
I hope you won't make the same mistake as I did,

742
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,040
okay?

743
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:02,840
Mother.

744
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
It's been 20 years.

745
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,120
Stop thinking about that.

746
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,270
How regretful I am.
