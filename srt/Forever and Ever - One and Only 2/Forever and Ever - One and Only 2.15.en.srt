4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,990
Mr. Mei.

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,720
Come on in.

6
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,340
Something to drink?

7
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll have some

8
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,160
-Wisk...
-Sorry.

9
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
My assistant took all the liquor.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,640
There are only drinks.

11
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,980
In the fridge.

12
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,760
It's fine then. I'm not thirsty.

13
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,570
Our families are old friends.

14
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
You and I

15
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,850
should have been friends a long time ago.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,430
In my opinion,

17
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,260
it's the most convenient

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,940
for you and me

19
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,500
to maintain this working relationship.

20
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,180
I haven't had a chance to read

21
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,540
the files your secretary sent yet.

22
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,300
If that's what you're here for,

23
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,100
then you're bound to return empty-handed.

24
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,660
Is there a problem

25
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,900
with my project?

26
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,900
Or

27
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,060
have you found any loopholes?

28
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,579
If you are afraid that there are loopholes,

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,060
you can have your legal team

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,100
go over it again.

31
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,260
I don't mind.

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,180
Anyway,

33
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm too busy now to read it.

34
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,980
Then I'll keep waiting.

35
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,740
I won't take anymore of your time.

36
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,100
By the way,

37
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,500
there's one more thing.

38
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,660
Go ahead.

39
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,940
My assistants didn't know how to behave.

40
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,540
If they have offended you in any way,

41
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,580
please forgive them.

42
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,540
It's nothing.

43
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,019
My lawyers

44
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,060
also

45
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,500
always strive for efficiency.

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,380
They can sometimes be unkind.

47
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:12,460
So if they

48
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
offend you in any way,

49
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,300
please forgive them too.

50
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,780
By the way,

51
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,500
I hate troubles.

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,780
I hate it when people drag me into trouble.

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,860
And I very much hate wasting time helping people.

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm not a compassionate person.

55
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,780
So I don't have many friends.

56
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,460
Zhousheng Chen

57
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,700
is one of my few

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,620
best friends.

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,340
Furthermore,

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
he is the most important one.

61
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,060
My eldest brother is lucky.

62
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,380
So if something happens to him again in Bremen,

63
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,700
I'll definitely blame you for that.

64
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,460
He's of good character.

65
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,100
I am not.

66
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,740
He is tolerant.

67
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,140
I'm definitely not.

68
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,580
You remember this.

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,140
Mr. Mei.

70
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,280
I think you have a wrong impression of me.

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,780
You are the only person

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,500
who's had a conflict of interest with him

73
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,580
during these several years.

74
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,140
It's only natural to be suspicious of you.

75
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,460
Then let me give you a serious answer.

76
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,020
I'm his younger brother.

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,340
I'm more worried about his safety

78
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,500
than anyone else.

79
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,340
That's right.

80
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,180
Blood is thicker than water.

81
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,180
He's your own brother.

82
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,340
I won't hold you up.

83
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,940
I'll read your files

84
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
as soon as I can.

85
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,460
I'll wait for your good news.

86
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,820
I've been feeding them for a week now

87
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,100
but I still don't even know their names yet.

88
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,659
The one with the big pincers is called sodium chloride.

89
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,220
The other one is called monosodium glutamate.

90
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,350
I know sodium chloride.

91
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,620
The other one, sodium glutamate?

92
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,220
MSG.

93
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,380
Ah I see.

94
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,100
By the way,

95
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,060
the internet at my new place is still not ready.

96
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,060
I want to move the day after tomorrow.

97
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,340
I won't cause you any trouble, right?

98
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,420
No. He won't be back for a while.

99
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,940
Why?

100
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,260
Something came up at the research institute

101
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,900
he works in.

102
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,260
He's not sure when he'll come back.

103
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,100
The two of you only saw each other

104
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,659
a few times after getting married.

105
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,580
Now you have to live apart again.

106
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,460
Don't you think that'll affect your marriage?

107
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,060
We're taking things in stride and getting closer.

108
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,740
Ms. Shi.

109
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,900
You're in danger.

110
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,980
You're numbing yourself and living in your fantasies.

111
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,620
We only live once.

112
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,580
Why make it hard for yourself?

113
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,500
Fine, fine, you're tolerant.

114
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:53,900
Right.

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,700
The finals for the dubbing contest

116
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,020
is set in Wuzhen.

117
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,900
Do you want to go?

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,860
You're going to be one of the judges, so what am I going for?

119
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,690
I'm the main judge.

120
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,420
I can take one person with me.

121
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,000
Your professor can't go.

122
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,340
That's why you're begging me to go.

123
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,500
It's free of charge, do you want to go?

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,620
Did the organizers book the whole of Wuzhen?

125
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,540
Nothing like that.

126
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,090
They booked a few inns.

127
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,650
The organizers gave me two rooms.

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,300
If you go, I'll share one with you.

129
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,620
Fine.

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,620
This is going to be a difficult one.

131
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,540
Yes and no.

132
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,580
I'm just curious about Zhousheng Chen.

133
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,100
Think about it.

134
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,660
How could a scientist

135
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,980
with a simple background

136
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,780
who didn't know anything about business

137
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,020
before the age of twenty-eight

138
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,900
suddenly come back

139
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,620
and take the helm of the family business?

140
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,430
If you were asked to take over the family business,

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,300
you wouldn't do it?

142
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,620
I read all his papers

143
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,100
to get to know him better.

144
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,180
He's a

145
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,620
real scientist.

146
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,740
He's the real deal.

147
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,420
If he really wanted to inherit the family business,

148
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,970
why would he stay in a lab

149
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,620
and work his ass off for 10 years?

150
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,740
What's the point?

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,580
Fine.

152
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,260
You think about it.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,180
I'll go back and catch up on my sleep. I have a headache.

154
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,700
I was busy with work for the past two days

155
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,140
and didn't have time to reply to your messages.

156
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,420
Where are you?

157
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,420
What are you doing?

158
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,460
I just got back from a business trip.

159
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,900
You were so busy that

160
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,820
you didn't even have time to send me a message?

161
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,540
I've been quite busy these days.

162
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,380
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,100
But I won't be working tomorrow.

164
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,980
I'm going to Wuzhen tomorrow.

165
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,740
To work or to have fun?

166
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,580
Fun, I guess.

167
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,780
Wuzhen.

168
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Wuzhen is a nice place.

169
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,620
I visited that place before.

170
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,340
It's good.

171
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,340
So, are you going with friends?

172
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,700
Yes, my roommate.

173
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,300
Wuzhen.

174
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Wuzhen is really nice.

175
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,980
One of the four ancient towns of Jiangnan.

176
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,780
If I have the chance,

177
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,340
I'd really like to go there again.

178
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,500
You're not working tomorrow, right?

179
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,460
Let's go together.

180
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,260
It's not far anyway.

181
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,540
Aren't you going with your roommate?

182
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,940
Would it be convenient?

183
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,820
She's on a business trip and I'm coming with her.

184
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,940
You can come along

185
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,900
and help me carry my bag.

186
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,860
No problem.

187
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,260
I'll make arrangements tonight

188
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,980
and let you know.

189
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,820
Okay, see you then.

190
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,420
See you later.

191
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:35,900
Bye, bye.

192
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,660
You're here.

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,020
I'll do the introductions.

194
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,140
This is Du Feng.

195
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,220
This is Shi Yi.

196
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:00,820
Hello.

197
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,340
Hello.

198
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,580
Your rooms

199
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
are not in the same inn as mine.

200
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,660
But it's not far away.

201
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,060
I'll be treating my colleagues to dinner tonight.

202
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,100
Why don't you two come as well?

203
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,420
What's the occasion?

204
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,140
I won a prize last time. So I promised.

205
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,420
Okay.

206
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,900
Let's go to the inn first.

207
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Let me introduce you guys.

208
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,980
These are my colleagues.

209
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,060
Mr. Liu Jin.

210
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,220
The dubber for

211
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,100
the documentary of the Three Qin Lands.

212
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,460
This is Mr. Dong Pei.

213
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,860
And this is Mr. Wan Yongcheng.

214
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,700
My dubbing partner

215
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,860
in "Bones of a Great Man".

216
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,060
You've made such a detailed

217
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
introduction, Shi Yi.

218
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,460
Actually, we'll get acquainted

219
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,540
as we eat.

220
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,020
Come on, come on.

221
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,580
Right.

222
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,020
Thanks to Ms. Shi

223
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,820
for treating us to a meal.

224
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,820
Let me introduce you.

225
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,780
This is reporter Hong Xiaoyu.

226
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,500
She's usually a professional too.

227
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,700
Anyway, we are all the same today.

228
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,580
Those who can sit here

229
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,780
are all professionals.

230
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,180
Come on.

231
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,900
Tonight we gather in Wuzhen.

232
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,620
Let's let loose

233
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,580
and just have fun.

234
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,020
All right!

235
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,420
Cheers!

236
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,740
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

237
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,580
Let's eat.

238
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,260
Come on, eat.

239
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,220
This is... this is yam, right?

240
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,540
Let me tell you.

241
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,220
When you're done eating,

242
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,020
don't wander around.

243
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,860
Most water towns

244
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,780
are haunted.

245
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,180
What?

246
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,780
Didn't you tell us last time?

247
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,780
The story of the water town in Jiangnan.

248
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
There was a man who lived there

249
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,420
that suddenly disappeared.

250
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,860
Then out of nowhere, he came back.

251
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,220
Why would you suddenly bring this up?

252
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,060
Don't you know Shi Yi is timid?

253
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,700
It's not even dark yet.

254
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,780
It's not that bad.

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,100
At night it will be.

256
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,540
All right, all right.

257
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,300
Let's eat.

258
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,820
How does he know you're timid?

259
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,980
People who have worked together with me for a long time know this.

260
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,820
It's normal.

261
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,900
It's not.

262
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,580
Not at all.

263
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,500
It's very abnormal.

264
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,980
Don't gossip.

265
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,340
One last question.

266
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,620
If your husband

267
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,140
knows someone likes you,

268
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,700
will he be jealous?

269
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,100
I think so.

270
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,820
You

271
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,260
think so?

272
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,340
That's why I said

273
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,980
you should marry someone who

274
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,620
loves you more than you love him.

275
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,700
I can see that you like him a lot.

276
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,740
How you guys got together.

277
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,420
You even agreed to legally marry him

278
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,140
without going through the proper ceremony.

279
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,620
You're too attached to him.

280
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,340
You're a precious heirloom.

281
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,220
But you sold yourself as a pearl at a roadside stall.

282
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,700
What kind of metaphor is that?

283
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,660
It is what it is.

284
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,340
His love for me is better than any ceremony.

285
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,260
He never treated me

286
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,820
like a pearl from a stall.

287
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,140
[Zhousheng Chen]

288
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,980
I'll take a call.

289
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,700
Come on.

290
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,660
One more.

291
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,340
Okay. Cheers.

292
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,260
Cheers!

293
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:01,980
Have fun!

294
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,660
Cheers!

295
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,700
We're having a gathering,

296
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,620
it was a bit noisy there.

297
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,380
Then I'll start.

298
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,820
Go ahead.

299
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,620
This morning,

300
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,580
I got up at 5:45.

301
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,300
as I usually do.

302
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,190
But last night,

303
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,860
there was a heavy rainstorm in Bremen.

304
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
So the whole balcony

305
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,300
was full of water.

306
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,540
It took me ten minutes

307
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,260
to clean up the balcony.

308
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,260
Then it took me another

309
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,620
ten minutes

310
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,340
to bake a piece of toast,

311
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,820
and warm up a glass of milk.

312
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,740
It was dawn

313
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,980
when I finished breakfast.

314
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,340
I think someone is interested in me.

315
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,680
Wang Yingdong?

316
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,140
How do you know?

317
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,220
I've always known.

318
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,380
Do you want to ask

319
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,900
if I mind?

320
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,860
You can take it as

321
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,580
I do mind,

322
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,740
that's why I want to

323
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,380
keep track of you all the time.

324
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,340
It's also because I mind

325
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,340
so I remembered his name.

326
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,340
Really?

327
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,580
Yes.

328
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,140
What?

329
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
Thinking about the wonders of marriage again?

330
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,140
If someone is pursuing your wife,

331
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,660
what would you do?

332
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,180
Wouldn't this solve the problem?

333
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,060
Someone's after your wife?

334
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,500
What's your solution then?

335
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,780
Why is Shi Yi so afraid of the dark?

336
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,940
It's rare to see an adult

337
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,020
to be this afraid of the dark.

338
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,420
It's normal.

339
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,340
After my grandmother got old,

340
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,980
she too refused to live at home by herself.

341
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,260
She either had someone with her,

342
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,300
or she went to her children's home.

343
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,300
There must be a story behind this.

344
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,380
Were you taking a random guess?

345
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,740
Was I right?

346
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,340
She

347
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,940
dreamed a lot ever since she was a child.

348
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,140
All her dreams were about wars.

349
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,820
After this went on for some time,

350
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,220
she began to fear the dark.

351
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,060
She didn't like to be alone.

352
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,460
And she didn't talk to the others.

353
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,660
She even went to see a psychiatrist.

354
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,540
But,

355
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,820
they didn't find anything wrong with her.

356
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,780
Then she took two years off from school

357
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,860
and got better when she came back.

358
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,340
But she's still afraid of the dark.

359
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,540
Of course,

360
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,860
she much better now than when she was a child.

361
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,860
But my mother said

362
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,940
maybe it's because she is

363
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,300
born artistic

364
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,820
and is more sensitive to stuff.

365
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,700
She is very good at Chinese painting.

366
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,060
In junior high school, she was one of

367
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,380
the best Guzheng players.

368
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,740
After she graduated from junior high school,

369
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,900
she didn't want to practice Guzheng anymore

370
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,060
and started to learn Guqin.

371
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,460
She won many more awards for that too.

372
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,300
She seems pretty capable.

373
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,140
What?

374
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,980
You seem

375
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,940
particularly interested in her.

376
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,460
No, I was just asking.

Shi Yi is married.

378
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
I know, you told me.

379
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,340
I'm telling you.

380
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,300
I have a thing about acting morally.

381
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm only interested in unmarried women.

You're still awake at this hour?

384
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,980
I had a dream.

385
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,720
The same dream

386
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,740
repeated over and over again.

387
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,040
I knew I was dreaming.

388
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,140
But I just couldn't wake up.

389
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,140
I could only watch it.

390
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,980
A nightmare?

391
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,820
Yes.

392

Those water towns

393
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,340
more or less have stories with them.

394
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,790
I've heard some of folklores

395

before.

396
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,020
But I didn't believe them.

397

Are you too tired during the day?

398

I heard some strange noises.

I was copying the names of famous teas in the past.

He brought a lot of things here.

519
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,860
I've also prepared something for your colleagues.

520
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,260
All of Shi Yi's colleagues.

521
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,060
Thank you.

522
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,380
Such a good kid.

523
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,980
It's Chen's idea.

524
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,900
He said she was on a business trip.

525
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,980
If I only

526
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,860
prepared stuff for her,

527
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,860
it'd be impolite.

528
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,940
Shi Yi.

529
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,300
Can I take a look around?

530
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:15,940
Go ahead.

531
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,300
Lian Sui.

532
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,460
Why the sudden visit?

533
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,180
I don't know.

534
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,140
This morning Ren said you were in Wuzhen.

535
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,860
He didn't even give us

536
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,500
time to prepare

537
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,780
and just came straight here.

538
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,100
Right.

539
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,660
In fact, he also prepared a cook for you.

540
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,420
It wouldn't be nice to say it in front of your colleagues.

541
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,180
If need be,

542
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,580
you can get the cook to make you something nice.

543
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,420
Are you not happy?

544
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,340
Don't you miss us?

545
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,140
I miss you every day

546
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,840
and look forward to you coming home soon.

547
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,350
I do.

548
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,940
I'll go clean up first.

549
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,860
Ren.

550
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,700
I'll go back later.

551
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,860
Are you coming with me?

552
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,380
No.

553
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,700
I'll stay here.

554
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,900
You'll stay here?

555
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,220
What if

556
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,980
they are busy with work

557
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,660
and don't have time to take care of you?

558
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,300
Shi Yi.

559
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,940
When will you finish your work?

560
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,100
I need to go to the finals later.

561
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,540
After that, I can keep you company.

562
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,100
Can I come along?

563
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,380
Yes, you can.

564
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,340
But I don't have time for you.

565
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,300
Meilin.

566
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,660
Could you help me

567
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
take care of him.

568
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,500
The higher-ups are coming today.

569
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,460
I need to entertain them.

570
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,820
Then give me a ticket. I'll go on my own.

571
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,900
On your own?

572
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,540
That's right.

573
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,540
Don't you try to follow me.

574
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
I don't care.

575
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,420
I'll go then.

576
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,900
Shi Yi.

577
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,020
I'll stay here and read.

578
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,820
You do your work.

579
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,860
I won't bother you.

580
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,140
Okay.

581
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,260
Why do I feel like

582
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,620
a parent?

583
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
The emperor died in the Palace of Changle.

584
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,700
After the death of the emperor,

585
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,420
seals were given to the vassal princes and kings.

586
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,060
The Junior Prince of Nanchen...

587
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,820
Shi Yi, are you writing about

588
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,980
the Zhousheng Chen

589
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,060
from ancient times?

590
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,500
You know him too?

591
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,580
Yes.

592
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,820
He's in my family tree.

593
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,140
He was a traitor.

594
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,140
But he's pretty admirable.

595
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,660
Admirable?

596
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,820
He was with the crown princess,

597
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,540
isn't that cool?

598
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,140
Who was the crown princess?

599
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,940
She basically would become the future empress.

600
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,500
Yet she gave up everything

601
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,820
and jumped off the wall

602
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,980
for him.

603
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,340
Don't you think he's a cool guy?

604
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,340
That's true.

605
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,900
I heard from my mother

606
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,460
Chen deliberately

607
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,860
took his name.

608
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,780
So I became

609
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,020
more interested in him.

610
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,500
It's a pity that there's little information.

611
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,220
Yes, there is very little information about him.

612
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,460
And all the records said he was a bad person.

613
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,380
A traitor, a sycophant, a treacherous minister.

614
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,460
So you want to write

615
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,860
what you know about him?

616
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,620
I'm writing it for myself.

617
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,100
Just like you.

618
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,980
Chen was named after him,

619
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,340
so I'm so interested.

620
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,220
Then, after you finish it,

621
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,620
can you show it to me?

622
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,580
Sure.

623
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,300
But you have to finish reading this first.

624
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,900
Okay.

625
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,740
The Junior Prince of Nanchen refused to cry when he got the seal.

626
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,780
He said, "The seal is smaller."

627
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,780
"I'm afraid there have been changes in the capital."

628
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,580
Ren, it's time to go.

629
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,930
You should let Shi Yi rest.

630
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,820
Good night, Shi Yi.

631
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,820
Sleep early.

632
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,620
Leaving now?

633
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,820
Good night, Meilin.

634
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,460
Good night.

635
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,860
I almost thought

636
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,660
he was going to stay here

637
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,100
and keep chatting until dawn.

638
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,780
But don't you think

639
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,780
he is such a good boy

640
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,030
when he's reading a book?

641
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,240
How come?

642
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,540
I have a feeling

643
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,820
Zhousheng Chen was like this too

644
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,620
when he was a kid.

645
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,260
I should get used to it.

646
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,180
What's wrong? You don't want to leave yet?

647
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,780
Are you thinking

648
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,420
if you were a girl,

649
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,660
you'd be able to stay overnight?

650
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,900
You don't understand.

651
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,020
Chen is worried about Shi Yi.

652
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:31,820
Otherwise

653
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
he wouldn't have asked me to come here.

654
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,500
Besides,

655
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,500
there is someone interested in her living here.

656
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,220
Though he's not a threat.

657
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,220
You guys

658
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,140
should work hard

659
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,500
and pay attention to the situation here.

660
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,180
Yes, sir!

661
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,390
He'll definitely become a jealous lover

662
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,020
when he grows up.

663
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,620
I'm going to meet

664
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,700
the winner this afternoon.

665
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,620
I can't take you there.

666
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,220
If you don't want to go home,

667
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,580
you can stay here and do your homework.

668
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,340
Is that okay?

669
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,500
Shi Yi.

670
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,460
I found that you're better at peeling mangosteens

671
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,740
than average people.

672
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,420
Don't we all do it like this?

673
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,700
The technique looks the same.

674
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,180
But because you're beautiful,

675
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,900
it's like an art when you're doing it.

676
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,420
You brat.

677
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,660
Congratulations.

678
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,100
You've got three more students.

679
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,980
They all want you to be their teacher.

680
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,220
Which one would you take?

681
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,940
I'll take your advice.

682
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,640
♫Give me your smiling♫

683
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,150
♫Corners of mouth and eyes♫

we can help them.

It's a pity if they got wet.

814
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,380
It would become wasted effort if the dye came off.

Sure.

816
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,380
I suddenly thought of

817
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,460
a plot of a movie.

818
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
I did dubbing for it in the past.

819
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,500
Let's hear it.

820
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,780
Qingcheng was under siege.

821
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,980
The Junior Prince of Nanchen led 10,000 cavalry,

822
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,940
travelled day and night,

823
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,220
and came to reinforce the city

824
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,060
against 130,000 enemy troops.

825
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,300
Twenty days later,

826
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,820
reinforcements arrived at the city.

827
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,500
The Nanchen courtiers did not expect anything.

828
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,500
But suddenly, they saw dozens of

829
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,860
long, raven-colored fabric hanging

830
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,500
on the city wall.

831
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,220
In tatters,

832
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,700
they fluttered in the strong wind.

833
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,660
The grey banner

834
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,460
was the banner of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

835
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,920
The cloths flying around

836
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,780
on the walls of the city

837
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,780
tell the courtiers

838
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,220
this city has not yet been breached.

839
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,990
Two hundred thousand reinforcements

840
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,580
shouted and cheered at once

841
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,560
with a loud and clear voice.

842
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,020
This is the great victory of Qingcheng.

843
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,700
I feel like I've gone back to my childhood

844
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,380
listening to your story.

845
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
When I was little,

846
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,020
there wasn't much entertainment.

847
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,620
Grandma had dry eyes

848
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,980
and couldn't watch much TV.

849
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,340
So every evening,

850
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,780
we listened to

851
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,100
the radio anchor telling stories.

852
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,460
Dry eyes?

853
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,540
Is she better now?

854
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,860
She has many minor illnesses.

855
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,060
It's hard to recover.

856
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,900
Plus, she's getting older.

857
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,180
Maybe a good rest

858
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,500
is the best medicine.

859
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,980
It's raining.

860
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,460
It's raining. Hurry up and collect them.

861
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,180
Hurry up and collect them!

862
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,460
We'll give you a hand.

863
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,660
Thank you.

864
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,580
They must've been on a date here.

865
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,340
Look.

866
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,260
They are embarrassed already.

867
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,580
How interesting having a date here.

868
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,860
There are fabrics obscuring people's view.

869
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,860
They can be comfortable here.

870
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,860
Watch out.

871
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,380
Did you guys come back by boat?

872
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,140
I was worried

873
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,380
you guys would get caught in the rain.

874
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,420
It's raining so hard.

875
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,580
Are they not back yet?

876
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,380
Weren't you guys together?

877
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,220
No.

878
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,260
I had something to do so I came back first.

879
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,390
This is...

880
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,900
This is my husband.

881
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,340
Your wife is on a business trip, but you've travelled here to see her.

882
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,660
I happen to have some free time.

883
00:39:59,250 --> 00:39:59,890
Good.

884
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,580
Here, take the umbrella.

885
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,500
No need, it's near.

886
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,300
We'll run over there.

887
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,180
-Let's go.
-Okay.

888
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,780
Let's go.

889
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,180
Young people are so romantic.

890
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,140
Ren.

891
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,420
I'll take my leave.

892
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,060
He knew you're back?

893
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,780
You told him without telling me.

894
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,700
No wonder he knows.

895
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,340
Your luggage has been brought here.

896
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,820
What did you

897
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,740
call me just now?

898
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,650
I forgot.

899
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,260
Did I say something?

900
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,220
What are you working on?

901
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,660
The temperature.

902
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,540
I'm afraid

903
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
you'll catch a cold.

904
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,180
♫In the memory♫

905
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,700
♫The snow-covered city tower♫

906
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,280
♫When your name rings out♫

907
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,990
♫Finally blooming again♫

908
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,410
♫Like a flower of the soul♫

909
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:11,390
♫The dreams that have accompanied me through the light years♫

910
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,030
♫I know that with just one look♫

911
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,420
♫I can be sure it's the end♫

912
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,120
♫Not afraid of falling♫

913
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,490
♫Running to the world with you♫

914
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,700
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

915
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,550
♫With your name in each line♫

916
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,100
♫If it started all over again♫

917
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,000
♫I'd still remember our love♫

918
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,760
♫It took♫

919
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,670
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

920
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,560
♫For our love to begin♫

921
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,080
♫There's no way it'd end♫

922
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,790
♫Those familiar eyes♫

923
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:16,250
♫Lost the past when we shed tears♫

924
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,770
♫It won't change♫

925
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,340
♫Our fate of encounter♫

926
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,340
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

927
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,360
♫With your name in each line♫

928
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,870
♫If it started all over again♫

929
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,830
♫I'd still remember our love♫

930
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,670
♫It took♫

931
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,580
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

932
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,270
♫For our love to begin♫

933
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,630
♫There's no way it'd end♫

934
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,150
♫When our story became history♫

935
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,040
♫In another world♫

936
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,870
♫There are another♫

937
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,060
♫Pair of longing eyes♫

938
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,300
♫Have been waiting♫

939
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,800
♫For that everlasting romance♫

940
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,690
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

941

♫With your name in each line♫

942
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,470
♫If it started all over again♫

943
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,060
No need to turn the temperature up so much,

944
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:19,160
♫I'd still remember our love♫

945
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,500
you'll sweat later.

946
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,790
♫It took♫

947
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,880
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

948
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,790
♫For our love to begin♫

949
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:33,810
♫There's no way it'd end♫
