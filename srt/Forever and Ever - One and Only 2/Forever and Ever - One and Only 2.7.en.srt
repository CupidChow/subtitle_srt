00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,980
I appreciate it.

174
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,860
Uncle, Mother.

175
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,300
Wenchuan,

176
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,330
Mei Xing says Chen is locked

177
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,460
in a small factory

178
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,850
for three hours already

179
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,020
and no one is there to open the door.

180
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,710
I will check it out.

181
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,280
Wenchuan.

182
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,220
Wenchuan.

183
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,420
You are not well,

184
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,300
why did you come out?

185
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,260
There's something

186
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,140
I shouldn't speak in front of our mother.

187
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,260
Mei Xing says that

188
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,820
Uncle Zhao asked you about this.

189
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,860
You said you would go

190
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,660
and told everyone to leave this to you.

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,150
That's not what happened!

192
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,540
What I told Uncle Zhao was

193
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,700
no matter who locked the door,

194
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,250
the priority is to get Chen out.

195
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,220
I suppose gossip

196
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,340
is a sure way of twisting people's words.

197
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,680
Anything else?

198
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,590
I will go pick him up then.

199
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,900
Come back soon.

200
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,060
[Reception Office]

201
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,740
You're here as well, Mr. Mei.

202
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,970
Before you returned,

203
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,350
they would come to me every now and then.

204
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,710
At first, I thought

205
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,990
they were father's old friends,

206
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,020
so I tried to help them as much as I can.

207
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,040
Until I finally realized

208
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,530
I couldn't handle them at all.

209
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,500
They must be

210
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,300
ill-treating you since you just came back

211
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,260
and had little idea of what's going on.

212
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,460
Perhaps they thought you were more gullible than I am.

213
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,580
In fact, they just want your money.

214
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,460
They want you to invest in them endlessly.

215
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,740
What's that?

216
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,180
Water sample.

217
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,300
Scientists always do things differently.

218
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,260
Here's my advice.

219
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,580
The crueler you are, the less trouble you will have.

220
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,020
I have to go now.

221
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,470
Actually,

222
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,940
your younger brother

223
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,260
is more suitable to do business than you.

224
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
Unfortunately,

225
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,180
his mind is evil.

226
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,230
Come in.

227
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,220
Xiaoyu is still in bed.

228
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,980
A girl who has never been in a relationship

229
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,180
sure has all the energy in the world

230
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,620
when she gets a boyfriend.

231
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,620
Don't mind me.

232
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
Enjoy your time.

233
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,020
I take my leave.

234
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,820
Take a seat.

235
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,940
Did you drive back on your own?

236
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah.

237
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,740
It's so dangerous to drive at night.

238
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Don't do that anymore.

239
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,340
There wasn't anything urgent anyway.

240
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,340
Okay.

241
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,700
Take a seat.

242
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,260
I am sorry.

243
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,100
Have a seat.

244
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,660
I promised

245
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,220
to take you to see the wedding house.

246
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,540
The house won't run away,

247
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,700
neither will I.

248
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
They happen to be sticking the wallpaper in the master bedroom today.

249
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,859
I want you to have a look

250
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,940
and see if you like it or not.

251
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,140
Oh, and the bed has also arrived.

252
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,540
Uncle Lin didn't tell me

253
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,700
what's it like in the living room

254
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,099
and I have no clue either.

255
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,780
We can check it out when we get there.

256
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,540
But Uncle Lin did say

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,610
we are both

258
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,860
somewhat introverted.

259
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,780
So the living room doesn't really matter.

260
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,780
The study and the bedroom would be more important.

261
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,470
The most important thing right now

262
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,740
is your breakfast.

263
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,300
What do you want to have?

264
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,220
Breakfast?

265
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,670
The cereal the other day

266
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,660
would be good.

267
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,680
I gave you that

268
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,820
because there was nothing left at home that day.

269
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,780
It's okay, I like it.

270
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,860
Okay, wait here.

271
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,380
Come on in.

272
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,100
Is this your house?

273
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,820
My father left it to me.

274
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,580
It is still being redecorated.

275
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,480
You can only move into

276
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,180
the wedding house

277
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,370
after your marriage.

278
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,180
Do you understand?

279
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,940
Yes.

280
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,420
Show me around.

281
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,900
Okay.

282
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,180
This study room

283
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,580
will be yours in the future.

284
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I will use the other one.

285
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,580
[Shi Yi]

286
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,100
What's this?

287
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,500
I asked someone to make a stamp with your name

288
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,580
and stamped them here.

289
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,980
What's it for?

290
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,260
The invitation cards would be stamped using a wooden carved stamp.

291
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,580
I asked them to let you pick the font first.

292
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,220
What type of font would your family prefer?

293
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,220
The seniors at home

294
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,700
prefer the Tang style.

295
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,620
They like neat and properly written regular script characters.

296
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,540
Among four great regular script calligraphers,

297
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
only Zhao Mengfu was from the Yuan Dynasty.

298
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,140
Since they prefer the Tang Dynasty,

299
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,100
we will choose from the rest of the three.

300
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,660
I quite like Yan Zhenqin's works.

301
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,460
However, he died of unjust treatment.

302
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,860
I suppose it is ominous to use that.

303
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,340
After all, we are having a wedding.

304
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,780
Forget it.

305
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,900
The Liu style.

306
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,500
The Liu style is a bit too serious.

307
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,100
Maybe it won't fit well on an engagement invitation letter.

308
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,060
[Shi Yi]

309
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,560
Since we rule out the former three.

310
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,980
Let's use the last one then.

311
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,980
You two are putting so much thinking into picking the right font

312
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,580
for your engagement invitation letter.

313
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,100
I can imagine

314
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,700
how much trouble you will have for your wedding.

315
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,220
Shi Yi, since you are free,

316
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,710
let's go and try on your dress.

317
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,380
Go give it a try.

318
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,340
Okay.

319
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,420
Why are there so many of them?

320
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,620
It can't be helped.

321
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,620
Our families have been very close to each other for generations.

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,180
We will make as many dresses

323
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,380
as we are told.

324
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,860
Do you like them?

325
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,630
Since this is your engagement banquet,

326
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,990
these sample dresses

327
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,820
were made by my brothers and I.

328
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,180
Your wedding dress on the other hand,

329
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,260
would be tailored by my grandma.

330
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,060
The dress she'll make for you would not only be beautiful.

331
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,260
My grandma barely made any dress

332
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,900
after she turned 70.

333
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,580
The last time she made a dress was for Zhousheng Chen's mother.

334
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,140
That was also a wedding dress.

335
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,760
That was at least 28 years ago then.

336
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,660
25 years.

337
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,060
Zhousheng Chen is 28.

338
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,460
But his mother got married

339
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,060
25 years ago?

340
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,780
Choose the one you like.

341
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,340
For us tailors,

342
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,180
people and clothes have a connection.

343
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,330
The one you like at first sight

344
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,470
is the one that suits you the most

345
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,820
and the one that looks the best on you.

346
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,460
I knew it would be that one.

347
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,000
It was pretty obvious that you took a few more glances at it

348
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,460
when I was hanging it.

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,660
Let me try it.

350
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,460
I know your grandma is old,

351
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,980
can she still take the workload of making dresses?

352
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,220
She is in good health.

353
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,460
The reason she doesn't make clothes for other people

354
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,900
is not because she can't.

355
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,420
It's because ever since my grandfather passed away,

356
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,500
she didn't have the mood

357
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,020
to make festive dresses anymore.

358
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:19,940
Why

359
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,340
do they all love Qipaos?

360
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,180
Their family and ours are pretty alike.

361
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,860
Our families became wealthy during the last century,

362
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,180
in the 1930s and 40s.

363
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,630
At that time, the Qipao was fashionable

364
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,780
and trendy.

365
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,130
My aunties' closets

366
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,020
are full of them.

367
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,140
It's a mark of their generation.

368
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,700
And now that habit has become second nature to them.

369
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,380
After this habit takes root,

370
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,300
it becomes a rule that restricts people.

371
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,860
Very clever.

372
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,700
This dress suits you very well.

373
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,020
It belongs to you.

374
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,260
The decorations at the cuffs can be taken out.

375
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,940
A beauty like you does not need a complicated dress.

376
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
Less is more.

377
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
Try the next one.

378
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Hold on.

379
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,740
I want to go downstairs.

380
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,220
Why did you come downstairs?

381
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,460
I was thinking of

382
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,380
going upstairs to find you

383
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,580
when you were done.

384
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,860
Does it look good?

385
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,740
Yeah.

386
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,420
Come on in.

387
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,560
Chen.

388
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,020
What brings you here?

389
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,820
I heard that you and my sister-in-law

390
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,900
would come here to see the wedding house today.

391
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,940
As I've never met my sister-in-law,

392
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,410
I stopped by for a visit.

393
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,180
I am Wenchuan.

394
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,540
Nice to meet you.

395
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,000
This is my wife, Tong Jiaren.

396
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,340
Nice to meet you.

397
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,140
The two of you

398
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,260
seldom see each other.

399
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,500
How about staying for dinner?

400
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,580
I will get things ready.

401
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,660
Okay.

402
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,660
Shi Yi,

403
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,460
go upstairs to continue trying out the dresses.

404
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,260
You guys can wait for me in the living room.

405
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,340
I will go help Uncle Lin.

406
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,820
I will make some adjustments to the dress when I go back.

407
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,020
When I get to Zhenjiang,

408
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,060
I will take them to the Zhou Residence to have you try them.

409
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,660
You said

410
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,140
the two of you were not only colleagues,

411
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,500
but studied in the same school as well.

412
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,300
He is a lot smarter than me.

413
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,140
While I was still studying for my undergraduate degree,

414
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:45,860
he was already

415
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,020
a doctoral degree holder.

416
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,340
My brother is a

417
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,740
genius with an IQ score of 190.

418
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,140
He went to university

419
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,940
at 17

420
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,340
and got his doctoral degree at 19.

421
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,580
But as far as I know,

422
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,900
according to the Guinness Book of World Records,

423
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,860
the person who has the highest IQ ever recorded

424
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,820
is not my brother.

425
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,740
There is another person

426
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,140
who got a PhD in physics at 15.

427
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,700
Shi Yi.

428
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,540
Let me in on your secret.

429
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,380
How do you manage to keep in shape?

430
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,300
I don't try to keep myself in shape.

431
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,140
I do aerobics every day till midnight

432
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,260
and do yoga in the morning.

433
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,060
I don't even have staple food anymore,

434
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
but still, it doesn't work.

435
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,780
Grandma might have a heart attack

436
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,140
if she hears the noise you make when doing aerobics.

437
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,540
I actually do know of a way

438
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,420
to lose weight.

439
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,700
Utilizing acupuncture

440
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,060
or doing a belly massage.

441
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,380
It promotes urination and draws out the excess water, while simultaneously promoting metabolism.

442
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,300
As long as your metabolism is good,

443
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,140
your body will not store

444
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,420
too much fat or trash.

445
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,500
Thus, you can lose weight.

446
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,700
But be aware

447
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,340
that acupoint might cause your body to become heaty.

448
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,580
Remember to drink some warm water

449
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,540
before and after the acupuncture session.

450
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,780
Okay, I got it.

451
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,340
You know about acupuncture points too?

452
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,980
Just a little.

453
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,500
When did you learn that?

454
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,180
A long time ago.

455
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,260
When I was young, I had poor health

456
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,220
and visited the Chinese medicine doctor a lot.

457
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,660
Because of that, I became interested in the subject

458
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,500
and signed up for a class.

459
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,540
I learnt a bit.

460
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,220
Maybe I can give you a treatment someday.

461
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,740
No need, I am fine.

462
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,540
Your posture must be pretty bad

463
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,260
when you work on experiments.

464
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,540
That's why your neck must be stiff.

465
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
Let me have a go at it.

466
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,940
If you don't think it works,

467
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,780
then I will stop.

468
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,100
Your work is already very tiring.

469
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,540
If you need to give me acupuncture at night,

470
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,780
you might not get enough rest.

471
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,180
I won't get tired

472
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,420
if it's for you.

473
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,580
All right.

474
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,100
I had an appointment with my friend.

475
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,460
You guys continue without me.

476
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,300
I have to go now.

477
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,580
Let me give you a ride.

478
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,140
It's fine.

479
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,780
Do you like this?

480
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,140
I was just having that.

481
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,860
It's very delicious.

482
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,220
Man.

483
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,060
Man.

484
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,790
I thought you already left.

485
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,420
Let me drive you home.

486
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:35,900
No, it's okay.

487
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,460
You knew how much effort I had to put in

488
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,700
in order to take over

489
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,860
what my father had.

490
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,460
You are so smart.

491
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,100
What happened just now,

492
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,980
you definitely know what's going on.

493
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,880
You know very well

494
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,160
who she cares about and loves.

495
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
I can see that,

496
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,980
your wife has a crush on your big brother.

497
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,020
I am not the eldest son

498
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,260
and I only have my mother's support.

499
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,060
Thus I can only accept

500
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,940
who she tells me to marry.

501
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,810
Yes.

502
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,420
I owe you more than an apology.

503
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,700
You are a married man.

504
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,420
Act like one, please.

505
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,420
[With long eyebrows and beautiful, striking eyes, the man is charming and irresistible]

506
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,660
[the man is charming]

507
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,420
[and irresistible]

508
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,700
It's already late,

509
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,980
why aren't you in bed?

510
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,500
Did you write this?

511
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,500
I wrote it when I was bored.

512
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,540
Have you read it?

513
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
The whole passage.

514
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,220
The rhapsody Shanglin fu.

515
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,420
Can you give this to me?

516
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,100
If you like it,

517
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,700
I could put in more effort to write another one.

518
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,380
I scribbled this down previously.

519
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,100
No, I'll take this.

520
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,140
All right.

521
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,340
[Bones of a Great Man]

522
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,080
[In this world, very few people have got great bone structure. Some may have good bone structure, but not beautiful facial features; many have beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure.]

523
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,580
[Most people are shallow, for they only see the beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure.]

524
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,420
[With long eyebrows and beautiful, striking eyes, the man is charming and irresistible]

525
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,560
What's up?

526
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,940
In the past, you would never waste a minute

527
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,100
when you travelled

528
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,620
between Zhenjiang and Shanghai.

529
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,940
You would either read a book,

530
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
or a magazine.

531
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,740
This is the first time I see you zoning out.

532
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,380
Zoning out for a girl too.

533
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,740
You've put in effort

534
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,020
in designing the invitation letters.

535
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,980
The handwriting looks great.

536
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,340
He wrote it.

537
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,340
The engagement banquet is on next Saturday.

538
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,700
When I asked Shi Yi

539
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,940
to give me a list of her relatives she wants to invite,

540
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,340
she said she's fine

541
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,940
as long as you two are present.

542
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,340
Other families

543
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,740
only hold a wedding banquet.

544
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,660
And their present will be recorded

545
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,740
so they can return a gift in the future.

546
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,140
If we ask our friends and relatives

547
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,740
to come to our engagement banquet.

548
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,140
Do they need to bring gifts?

549
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,340
If not,

550
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,540
they won't feel right.

551
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,900
If they do, then I would feel embarrassed.

552
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,220
My daughter Shi Yi

553
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,460
never cared about

554
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,260
these social conventions in the past.

555
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,740
But she changed a lot

556
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,820
after she met you.

557
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,780
It has nothing to do with him.

558
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,860
It's my opinion.

559
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,780
My family will definitely send gifts in return.

560
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,740
The gifts we return

561
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,540
will surely be of higher value.

562
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,820
So, please don't be too concerned.

563
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,300
Let's forget it.

564
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,140
Let's stick to

565
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,970
your family tradition.

566
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,140
Let's just treat it as a formality.

567
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,220
I agree.

568
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,940
Shi Yi's mother and I,

569
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,100
as parents from the girl's side,

570
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,500
will definitely come.

571
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,260
As for other relatives,

572
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,060
they can come to the wedding.

573
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,660
I think it depends

574
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,860
on the scale.

575
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,460
If it's a grand banquet,

576
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,140
it would seem disrespectful

577
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,940
if only the two of us went.

578
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
By the way, Chen.

579
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,420
Where is your family going

580
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,020
to hold

581
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,180
the engagement banquet?

582
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,140
And how many tables would there be?

583
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,180
Right now, it's 16 tables.

584
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,260
We are not going to hold it outside.

585
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
We'll have it at home.

586
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,820
They have a big family.

587
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,460
There are not as many people in our family.

588
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,140
Nor are there as many relatives.

589
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,620
How about this?

590
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,300
Let's say we

591
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,260
invite your uncle's family,

592
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,540
along with your grandma and grandpa.

593
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,940
So, we could sit at one table.

594
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,340
Yeah.

595
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,380
That wouldn't be disrespectful, right?

596
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,700
It's all up to you actually.

597
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,300
You don't have to care about

598
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,660
our family traditions.

599
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,180
This matter

600
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,820
is actually giving me a headache.

601
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,500
Well, every family gets their own problems.

602
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,740
In my opinion,

603
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,900
it may be because

604
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,840
you have a lot of family members,

605
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,140
that's why there are a lot of things to worry about.

606
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,100
Honey, what are you talking about?

607
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,940
Who would say his future son-in-law's

608
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,900
got too many things to worry about?

609
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,940
Seriously.

610
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,420
It's just chit-chat.

611
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,860
Right, you guys continue.

612
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,770
I, I will make a call

613
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,580
to your uncle.

614
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,180
The bond between each other

615
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,740
is sometimes hard to explain.

616
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,340
You two are now engaged

617
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,810
but we two

618
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,060
haven't had a proper conversation

619
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,180
or spent some time with each other.

620
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,900
What hobbies do you have?

621
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,460
Playing chess.

622
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,060
Go?

623
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,540
Chess?

624
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,100
I can play them all.

625
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,100
Backgammon is fine, too.

626
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,540
You know how to play Backgammon?

627
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,780
Dad, you've found an opponent now.

628
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,219
Board games are good.

629
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,739
How a person is, is shown by the way he plays chess.

630
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,820
Your innate characters,

631
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
and even how generous you are,

632
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,540
everything is displayed on the chess board

633
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,340
Nothing can hide.

634
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,820
Let's find time to play!

635
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,500
Okay.

636
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,580
My dad seems to like you very much.

637
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,719
This is my first time being a son-in-law.

638
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,739
I don't have much experience.

639
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,659
I am just trying to do my best.

640
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,500
Then you need to impress him.

641
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,300
For the game later,

642
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,699
is it better for me to win,

643
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,060
or to lose?

644
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,340
What do you think?

645
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,620
Whether I win or lose,

646
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,220
I need to be respectful and friendly.

647
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,380
Hurry up.

648
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,140
Okay.

649
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,740
Place it more to the inside.

650
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,500
How unsightly!

651
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,390
Will do, Sir!

652
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,500
I'm warning you!

653
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,100
You better do a good job at setting up the wiring.

654
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,820
There are many people wearing high heels

655
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,580
this month.

656
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,860
It would be disastrous if someone tripped!

657
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,620
Sui.

658
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,500
You're up early.

659
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,660
Have you had breakfast?

660
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,700
I did.

661
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,980
Why don't you put the sheet on?

662
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,150
They will come tomorrow.

663
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,140
This is ridiculous.

664
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,060
I will do it tomorrow morning.

665
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,660
No one will be sleeping on it tonight.

666
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,220
It will gather dust.

667
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,020
It's just one night.

668
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,820
How dusty can it be?

669
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,500
You should just put it on.

670
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,660
They won't notice the dust anyways.

671
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,140
Where dust is visible to your naked eye

672
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,540
is called the ancient tomb.

673
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,900
Is it sweet?

674
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,820
Yeah.

675
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,260
Are you tired when you are sitting there?

676
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,220
Not...not really.

677
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,700
Why are you still sitting there?

678
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,860
Do the cleaning!

679
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,660
From tomorrow on, remember,

680
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,540
you shouldn't come here without permission.

681
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,620
Why is that?

682
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,620
They aren't sleeping together, right?

683
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,220
Are you even a man?

684
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,380
I am.

685
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,700
I thought you knew men very well.

686
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,940
All right, I got it.

687
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,100
Madame Sui, where else should I clean?

688
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,500
The whole place.

689
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,180
Got it.

690
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,860
Still alive?

691
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:49,020
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

692
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,980
Are you envious?

693
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,780
This is what the eldest son gets.

694
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,060
It's even more grand than our wedding.

695
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,260
Aren't you supposed to be happy

696
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,300
that your big brother is getting married?

697
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,260
Yeah, I am.

698
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,260
How about you?

699
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,540
As his sister-in-law,

700
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,660
aren't you supposed to prepare a gift for him?

701
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,660
My parents have done that.

702
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:40,900
Thank you.

703
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,780
How are you doing?

704
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,780
Are you nervous?

705
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,540
I'm all right.

706
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,580
That didn't sound honest.

707
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,820
It's just whenever I think about going to their place,

708
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,220
the first thing that comes to my mind

709
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,260
is always his mother's face.

710
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,460
That's why I am a bit scared.

711
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,580
The relationship between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws

712
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,780
has always been a topic of Asian culture.

713
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,140
And always the trigger that leads to domestic problems.

714
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,740
Even a beauty like you

715
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,300
cannot run away from it.

716
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,260
Why don't you help me figure it out

717
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,500
instead of making it even worse?

718
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,900
We can't help you

719
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,780
with something like this.

720
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,500
However,

721
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,100
you will live in Shanghai in the future

722
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,700
and his mother will live in Zhenjiang.

723
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,620
Which means you will only see her, once a month.

724
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,420
Don't be afraid.

725
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,260
You've got a point.

726
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,300
Actually, what I am most nervous about

727
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,900
is that I am going to

728
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,900
move in with him soon.

729
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,500
Soon.

730
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,540
Tomorrow night.

731
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,980
You girls feel me?

732
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,220
Totally!

733
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,700
That's why I came here

734
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,640
to give you some encouragement.

735
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,770
Matters like this.

736
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,900
Do it or not,

737
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,420
you will need to face it eventually.

738
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,260
I am not trying to avoid it.

739
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,820
We are not having an affair.

740
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Why should I hide!

741
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,900
It seems someone is not nervous.

742
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,580
She's actually looking forward to it.

743
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,900
Even her heart is racing.

744
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,590
But honestly,

745
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,660
what stage are you guys in now?

746
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,340
Yeah!

747
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,500
Who's got the problem?

748
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,900
I think it's Zhousheng Chen.

749
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,180
It must be him.

750
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,980
Our dear Shi Yi

751
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,900
is as healthy as an ox.

752
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,100
And her mental health is great.

753
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,500
Stop it.

754
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,460
It's not the right time yet.

755
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,730
Maybe it's

756
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,700
our Shi Yi who's got the problem.

757
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,500
We can't only blame the guy.

758
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,690
You two definitely need to stay together for two weeks.

759
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,620
Here's a little advice.

760
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,660
Men

761
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,740
cares about practicality.

762
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,790
You should take your shot, Shi Yi.

763
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,300
Stop fooling around.

764
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,620
You're already 27. You can't be shy about this!

765
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,260
I am looking for a bag to put my shoes in.

766
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,060
Staying there

767
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,940
I need at least a pair of high heels,

768
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,100
a pair of flats,

769
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,660
and a pair of sneakers.

770
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,620
Oh yeah,

771
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,740
do you think I need to bring a pair of rain boots?

772
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,620
They live

773
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,740
deep in the mountains, right?

774
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,420
I guess you do.

775
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,140
What if you come across some muddy roads?

776
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,140
Their home is connected to the main roads!

777
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,460
You are back.

778
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,280
Who's going to pick up the bride tomorrow?

779
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,340
I am a bit worried,

780
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,500
so I came back to have a look.

781
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,620
I will leave soon.

782
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,340
Don't address her

783
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,100
as the bride.

784
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,180
Why not?

785
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,060
Just because his mother doesn't like Shi Yi?

786
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,420
It's none of my concern whether she likes Shi Yi or not.

787
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,620
Marriage is a very formal thing

788
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,060
for a girl.

789
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,860
We need to follow the steps.

790
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,060
They are currently engaged.

791
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,140
It's not their wedding yet.

792
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,780
That's why she's not a bride yet.

793
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,780
I see.

794
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,260
This place

795
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,500
is finally going to have

796
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,860
a hostess living here.

797
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,610
Allow me.

798
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,340
Where is Uncle Lin?

799
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,340
Uncle Lin and Chen went to the wedding house.

800
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,700
They asked me to pick you up.

801
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,860
You need to go to the recording studio first, right?

802
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,300
Yeah, I have a recording session in the morning.

803
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,620
I heard from my uncle

804
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,500
that you have recording sessions

805
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,380
every month.

806
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,500
They are all about

807
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,940
doing charity and making donation

808
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,980
with some famous voice actors and radio anchors.

809
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,660
Yeah.

810
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,620
We have been doing it for 3 to 4 years.

811
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,180
It's like a get-together for some old friends.

812
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,220
Just for fun.

813
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,300
But how do you do charity with recordings?

814
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,700
We have a fixed number of listeners.

815
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,940
So we can do a program

816
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,500
and insert charity advertisements in between sections.

817
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,370
Other times we would compete with one another.

818
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,700
With one person representing one project.

819
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,580
Whoever wins,

820
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,920
the sponsor of the program

821
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,720
will donate the

822
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,700
to that project.

823
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,060
Having skills sure is nice.

824
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,330
Even if you're only doing a good deed, there would still be people to help you. .

825
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,400
Hope in.
