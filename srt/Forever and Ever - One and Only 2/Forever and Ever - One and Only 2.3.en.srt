[Episode 3]

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,520
It feels like I'm in a fantasy world,

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,440
coming here abruptly at midnight like this.

6
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,600
You said you liked classical novels.

7
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,320
So I figured

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,320
you would like this kind of place.

9
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
I do like them.

10
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
But I read them

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,880
as a collection of novels.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,600
Some people like to read modern novels

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
while others like to read classical ones.

14
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,560
It's just a matter of personal preference.

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,600
I think we

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,920
have some things in common.

17
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,520
For example?

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,280
For example,

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
I like to collect Wu Ge's embroidery.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,760
Wu Ge contains many erotic songs

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,240
and poems about what happens in the bedroom.

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
I don't think they are the same.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,360
By the way,

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
is it hard

25
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,600
doing experiments?

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,000
It's all right.

27
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,280
It depends on the project.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Some are harder.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
Some of the raw materials

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
come in big bags.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,440
So students need to

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
carry them to the lab themselves.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,160
That sounds like a lot of work.

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
That's how it was when I was a student.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,600
There were actually worse things.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,040
But

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
I enjoyed it all.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
This is your Steamed Drunken Crabs.

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
We didn't order this.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Today is our restaurant's anniversary.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,480
This is on the house.

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,760
Enjoy your meal.

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,079
Thank you.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,120
Hairy crabs in this season

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
are the best.

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,920
Here.

47
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,920
I don't eat this.

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,960
You don't eat crab?

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
I used to.

50
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,320
Not anymore.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,760
All right.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,079
Let's eat.

53
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
I've arrived.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,960
I'll be going back and forth

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,400
between Shanghai and Zhenjiang

56
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,800
for these three months.

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,440
Zhenjiang?

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,120
What's the matter?

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
My ancestral home is Zhenjiang.

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,120
What a coincidence.

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,080
Yes, how coincidental.

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,080
The number in your phone…

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,840
You can reach me anytime

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,440
you want.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm going up then.

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,600
Go on.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,080
Good night.

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,160
Good night.

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,680
I didn't realize

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,640
you had a close lady friend.

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
She's just a regular friend.

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,360
Yes, an important regular friend.

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,720
Xiaoyu, breakfast is ready.

74
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,280
You said he asked you out at 11:00

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,080
last night?

76
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
Had supper at 1:00.

77
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,040
And then sent you home at 2:00?

78
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,720
Is he not afraid

79
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,920
you'll think of him as a hooligan?

80
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,240
If it was anyone else, I wouldn't have agreed to it.

81
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,120
But since it was him,

82
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
there was nothing strange.

83
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,120
He used to answer my emails in the middle of the night.

84
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm used to it.

85
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
How long will he stay in Zhenjiang this time?

86
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,000
What for?

87
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
I didn't ask him.

88
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,000
Probably a business trip.

89
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
But they're treated nicely this time.

90
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,640
They got him a car and a driver.

91
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
That's because of work.

92
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,040
He doesn't own it.

93
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,720
But he should be able to afford a car

94
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
with his age.

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm not sure

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
if he can afford to buy a house, though.

97
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
But you have a house.

98
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,960
After you get married,

99
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,280
you guys can move in together for a while.

100
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,520
I'll have to find a new place then.

101
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,400
So far I've only

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,280
had dinner with him once.

103
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,800
If there is a first time, there is a second time.

104
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,280
If there is a second time,

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,520
there will be countless times after that.

106
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,680
Anyway, let me know in advance

107
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,120
if you two are going to live together,

108
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,440
so I can find a new place.

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,160
Do you have some loose screws?

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,680
Yeah.

111
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
That's why I'm still single.

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
Eat your food.

113
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm so scared that I can't hold my chopsticks.

114
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,160
You sure you don't want to ride a bit more?

115
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
Where on earth did you go last night?

116
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,120
Coming back until the morning.

117
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
I had a midnight supper.

118
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
With a girl?

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,040
If it was a man,

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,440
you would have asked me to join you.

121
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,039
Yes, with a girl.

122
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,000
Another one?

123
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
The same one.

124
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,159
Shi Yi?

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
It's a nice day today.

126
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,400
I'll take you to some of the workshops

127
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
later on.

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,000
They were left by my father before.

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,560
Aren't they far from here?

130
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
Not too far and not too close.

131
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,800
Is there enough time for you to tell me

132
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
about Miss Shi Yi?

133
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,960
Well, I'm afraid not.

134
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,800
Give me something.

135
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
A brief introduction will do.

136
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,040
A few words won't do.

137
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,920
Come on, man.

138
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Let's go.

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Well,

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,720
your brother is going to get married.

141
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
Your brother is in talks with

142
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
an overseas water company

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,760
and three buildings in Bremen.

144
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,520
The funds required are staggering.

145
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,320
The procurement plan will be completed next month.

146
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,360
You still have time.

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,840
You're a professional.

148
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,000
Tell me

149
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
what I should do.

150
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
Announce that your family

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,120
will invest significantly into national industries

152
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,680
and support national manufacturing

153
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,400
in the investment meeting.

154
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,520
Show people that

155
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,080
your family will focus on the domestic market

156
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
for the next ten years.

157
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
Do this to affect their confidence.

158
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,480
All right.

159
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
But at the same time you have to get married.

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
If you don't get married, it's all empty talk.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,760
Your father wrote

162
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
very clearly in his will.

163
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
All of his children

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
will be given corresponding shares after marriage.

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,760
There are no exceptions, which means you too.

166
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,320
I know that.

167
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,840
You don't have to emphasize it.

168
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,480
It's just that marriage,

169
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,120
is not something

170
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
I can decide on my own.

171
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,120
I did some calculations.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
If you start seeing

173
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,680
the girl your mother introduced to you from tonight,

174
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,760
you can expect to get married in May.

175
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,640
You're making fun of me, right?

176
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,040
Here, look at these again.

177
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
What are these?

178
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
Zhou Wenchuan's business.

179
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,160
There's something fishy about them.

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,480
You should hurry up and

181
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,560
take back the business at home.

182
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,320
If not,

183
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm really afraid

184
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,840
he'll get your entire family involved.

185
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,320
Is there any other way?

186
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,600
Get married first.

187
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,960
I have a suggestion.

188
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,000
What?

189
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,080
Shi Yi.

190
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
She likes you.

191
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,760
You have feelings for her too.

192
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,680
I admit it.

193
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,040
She's very special to me.

194
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,280
But don't you think it's ridiculous

195
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,920
if I talk to her

196
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,840
about marriage right now?

197
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,080
Everything I said to you

198
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
were not to tease you.

199
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,920
They are my sincere advice.

200
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,400
-Chen.
-You...

201
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
Mom wants you to go over.

202
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
I haven't seen you for a while.

203
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,120
Now you're all grown up.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,320
Auntie.

205
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
You're getting prettier too.

206
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,200
You're so sweet.

207
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,320
Mother.

208
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,160
That's nice.

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
Here you are.

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,560
This is my oldest son.

211
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,880
She's our guest for tonight.

212
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,080
Have a seat.

213
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,160
Auntie said you just came back from Germany.

214
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,600
Yes.

215
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,160
I studied in Europe too.

216
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,760
You won't go back to Germany anymore, right?

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,680
That's right.

218
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
Since you're staying for good,

219
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
won't the lab

220
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,440
require prepping again?

221
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,000
Mother.

222
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,400
What's the matter?

223
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,880
I'm having troubles solving some questions

224
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
and I would like my brother to help.

225
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,800
Go ahead.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
Then I'll

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,720
show you around.

228
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,240
Don't be late

229
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,680
for the wedding banquet later.

230
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,640
Okay.

231
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
Come, this way please.

232
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,720
Sit down.

233
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,560
What do you want to ask?

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
(Personal Information of Shiyi)

235
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,120
Actually, ever since you met her

236
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
at Guangzhou Airport,

237
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
our whole family has found out about it.

238
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
Mother knew about her too.

239
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
Who gave this to you?

240
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
Someone close to my father.

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,080
You know,

242
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm his only son

243
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,240
and I'm naughty,

244
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,600
so I always get what I want.

245
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,320
You're so lucky.

246
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,520
She's so pretty.

247
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,080
And she's a celebrity too.

248
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,320
She is…

249
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
She is just one of my

250
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,760
ordinary friends.

251
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,600
Okay then, I'll leave now.

252
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
Chen, you're going out?

253
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,520
I've met her twice,

254
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
the girl mom introduced to you.

255
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,120
She's nice.

256
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,640
But she's even younger than me.

257
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
So it feels weird calling her elder sister-in-law.

258
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,720
If she's someone nice,

259
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,440
I shouldn't stop her from finding someone better.

260
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
Why do you say so?

261
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,520
You're such a good person.

262
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,440
Don't worry about this matter.

263
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,160
Head back in.

264
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,920
No need to see me off.

265
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,600
You don't have to call her ahead?

266
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,720
No need.

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,800
(Zhou Shengchen)

268
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,319
What am I going to say to him?

269
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,119
To repay him for that supper?

270
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,440
Are you hungry?

271
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No.

272
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,880
Young people can endure hunger.

273
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,120
I won't wait with you then.

274
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,640
I hope you don't mind waiting here alone.

275
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,240
I'll go find something to eat.

276
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,200
What are you thinking about?

277
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm thinking about when I can finish work.

278
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,520
Did you two fight?

279
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
What fight?

280
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,160
If you're two are not fighting,

281
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,840
you should go up there

282
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,120
or ask her to come down.

283
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,760
She must be working right now.

284
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
I don't like to be disturbed

285
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,080
when I'm working.

286
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,440
I think she's also like that.

287
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,880
I thought you weren't hungry.

288
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,080
It's time for dinner.

289
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,880
Eating on time

290
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,000
is taking care of your body.

291
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,480
Xiaoyu said you arrived home

292
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,760
after 2 am.

293
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Didn't you finish work at 12?

294
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,040
Where did you go?

295
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,520
Did you go with...?

296
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
Yesterday, I…

297
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,840
Hello?

298
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,200
Okay, I'm coming down.

299
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,640
I'll go get the delivery.

300
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,040
Hello.

301
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,600
Your food delivery.

302
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,320
Thank you.

303
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,880
How did you get hurt?

304
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,720
I accidentally fell

305
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,240
on the road.

306
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,600
You should go to a hospital.

307
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,680
You are my last order.

308
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
I'll go now.

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,040
By the way,

310
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,760
can you help me with something?

311
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,560
This is my bike.

312
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,120
Can you look after it for me?

313
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,680
I can't ride it right now.

314
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,080
I'm scared it might get stolen.

315
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay, okay.

316
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,080
I'll ask the receptionist

317
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,080
to keep an eye on it for you.

318
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,880
Okay, thank you.

319
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,760
Do you want me to call a cab for you?

320
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,600
No, no, no.

321
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
I...I'll be fine.

322
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,160
Thank you.

323
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,440
Wait.

324
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,080
Give me a second.

325
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,880
I have some rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs here.

326
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,160
You can clean the wound first.

327
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,200
Thank you.

328
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,000
It's okay.

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,400
Well.

330
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,520
I can do it myself.

331
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,400
Don't mind me.

332
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
Be safe, then.

333
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,560
Okay, thanks.

334
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,400
It's okay.

335
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,520
Are you okay?

336
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,160
Yes, I'm fine.

337
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,640
Should I take you to the hospital?

338
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
Uncle Lin, take him to the hospital.

339
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,840
No, no, no, it's not appropriate.

340
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm fine on my own.

341
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,960
I don't want to cause you trouble.

342
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm free anyway.

343
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
I'll be glad to help you.

344
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,640
Okay.

345
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,200
Sir, you're a funny guy.

346
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,720
Is this your car?

347
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,400
It's his.

348
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,520
I wanted to take a walk

349
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,440
and didn't feel like taking the car.

350
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,520
You should hurry up.

351
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,560
Go to the hospital.

352
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,720
You're wounded so badly.

353
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,520
Thank you.

354
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,400
It's okay.

355
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,040
Thank you.

356
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,680
It's fine.

357
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,120
The girl who helped you just now

358
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
is his girlfriend.

359
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,080
No wonder.

360
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,880
They're both so kind-hearted.

361
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,600
Get in.

362
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,240
Thank you.

363
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
Take it easy.

364
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,960
Thank you.

365
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,520
Remember

366
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,240
to finish the milk in the fridge.

367
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,880
By the way, I know you're going back to Zhenjiang to pay homage to your ancestors.

368
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,880
But would you go look for him?

369
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,200
He didn't give me

370
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
his own phone number.

371
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,560
It'll be weird to call him.

372
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
I don't think it's a good idea.

373
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,160
And people usually gather with their families

374
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,560
on Qingming Festival.

375
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,880
It's not a good time to ask him out.

376
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,240
Make some time out.

377
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,520
Let's talk about it when I get back.

378
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
He should be more proactive.

379
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,800
Wasn't he proactive to ask me out for dinner

380
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
in the middle of the night last time?

381
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,080
I guess that counts.

382
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Since he took the initiative last time,

383
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,840
I've decided to do something for him.

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,920
When I come back,

385
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
I'll treat him to dinner.

386
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,240
Then we'll be even.

387
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,880
Have a meal.

388
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,000
Talk about family, career, and friends.

389
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,320
Then after dinner, take a walk along the river.

390
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,960
When walking, get closer to each other.

391
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,360
Casually touch his hand a few times.

392
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,040
Be casual about it.

393
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,440
Then casually hold his hand

394
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,840
and finally close your eyes.

395
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
You and your wild imaginations.

396
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,880
I only talk about it.

397
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,600
But that's what you want

398
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,560
to do in your mind, right?

399
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,560
Did you go looking for Shi Yi?

400
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,360
Yes.

401
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Had supper with her again?

402
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,040
I didn't see her.

403
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,160
What were you doing there then?

404
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,760
You didn't just wait for her

405
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
downstairs, right?

406
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,760
I was downstairs.

407
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,280
I wanted to make sure...

408
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,760
I had feelings for her.

409
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,040
And how did you test that?

410
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,720
If I'll get bored

411
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,480
going back and forth for eight hours again

412
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,120
for her.

413
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,040
And the answer is...

414
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,680
I enjoyed every second of it.

415
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,920
You're finally admitting it.

416
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,200
So what's next?

417
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,000
What are you going to do?

418
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,880
Next, I'm going to

419
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,520
propose to her.

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,160
You've been checking your phone

421
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,040
constantly

422
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,000
after we left Shanghai.

423
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,600
Is it work related?

424
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,680
I have a friend in Zhenjiang.

425
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm wondering if I should contact him.

426
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,360
We have nothing to do

427
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,680
after visiting the grave.

428
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,360
If you want to see your friend, go ahead.

429
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,480
He might not be in Zhenjiang.

430
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
He might have gone back to his hometown.

431
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
You can't call him and ask him that?

432
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Do you feel embarrassed to ask this person?

433
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
Mom!

434
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Fine, I won't interfere.

435
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm not against you having friends.

436
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,000
But if

437
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,160
you want to have a boyfriend,

438
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,280
you must bring him to see me.

439
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,680
I have to help you check him out.

440
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,840
You're going too far.

441
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,080
Your mother

442
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,000
is sometimes very conflicted.

443
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
She's afraid that you'll have too high of a standard

444
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
and won't be able to get married.

445
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
However, she's also afraid that

446
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,920
you'll get cheated

447
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,880
by those

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,480
powerful and influential people

449
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,520
since you're so beautiful

450
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,200
and end up doing something bad.

451
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,520
No, I wouldn't.

452
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
I am not interested in money.

453
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,240
I won't be seduced by that.

454
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,640
Here are the agreements you want.

455
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,840
You draw them up so quickly?

456
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,960
I have a template.

457
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,640
Miss Shi Yi has come to Zhenjiang.

458
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,000
They just passed the checkpoint.

459
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,640
How do you two keep bumping into each other?

460
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,920
She's here in Zhenjiang.

461
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Why not tell her in person?

462
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,120
Let's go home first.

463
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,320
What?

464
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
Afraid you'll get rejected?

465
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,240
How much do you think

466
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
the probability of success is

467
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,560
if you're asked to propose to a girl

468
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,480
you've only been

469
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,760
on one date with?

470
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,360
That depends on how charming you are.

471
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,360
Are there so many people visiting the graves this year?

472
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,880
We've been stuck in traffic for an hour already.

473
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,280
I don't think they're all going for that reason.

474
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,720
I heard from Shi Feng that many entrepreneurs

475
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,680
have been going in and out of Zhenjiang

476
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
in the past two days.

477
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
They say it's about investing in projects.

478
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,680
Maybe that's why.

479
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
There are investment projects here?

480
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,360
How come I haven't heard of it?

481
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
They're not investing in Zhenjiang.

482
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,760
There is a conference

483
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,120
that's being held here

484
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,000
meaning to attract investment

485
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,480
and support the local high-end manufacturing industries.

486
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,520
Doing business abroad has been

487
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,400
pretty risky this couple of years.

488
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,720
So the upgrade of the manufacturing sector

489
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,000
is sure to come.

490
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
In other words, the development of the high-end manufacturing industry

491
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,360
would be the top priority in the next few years.

492
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,400
Shi, you've said so much.

493
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,840
But what does it have to do with traffic jams?

494
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,560
Well,

495
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
they've invited rich businessmen

496
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,400
to invest here.

497
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
The people who invited them have a vision.

498
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,400
Not only that,

499
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,760
they also have to be capable

500
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,920
in order to attract more capital.

501
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,400
They also need to have a kind heart,

502
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,040
to help the national economy.

503
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,760
Yes, a kind heart.

504
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,040
As expected of a father and daughter,

505
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
you two are always on the same page.

506
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
The son of an old friend of mine

507
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,840
is also here

508
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,680
for this investment meeting.

509
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,240
He wants to take this opportunity

510
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,560
to learn from his father.

511
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,920
I've met

512
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,720
his son before.

513
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,920
Okay.

514
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,520
You're not getting to the point.

515
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,080
Your uncle

516
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,560
is inviting him to dinner tomorrow night.

517
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,200
You should go too.

518
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,320
Get to know them.

519
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,520
I don't think I'll go.

520
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,960
Go and get to know each other.

521
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,360
You guys can be friends.

522
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:58,800
That's right.

523
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,400
What do you think?

524
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
After getting his masters,

525
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,160
he joined his family's business.

526
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,160
He's a practical person.

527
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,120
He worked his way up as a sales rep.

528
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,960
He's not

529
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,520
arrogant at all.

530
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,600
It's a shell company.

531
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,080
A shell company?

532
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,640
No, no, no.

533
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,400
I used the wrong expression.

534
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,280
It's a company that produces briefcases.

535
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,200
That's right.

536
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,480
And...

537
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,760
he's also

538
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,520
going to that investment meeting.

539
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,640
If you have time,

540
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,720
you could come with me.

541
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,040
I'll introduce you to each other.

542
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,960
Take a look.

543
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,720
I'll take a look at it later.

544
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,800
I'll go see Yuanyuan first.

545
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,400
Zhenjiang has changed so much.

546
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
Don't go.

547
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,120
That man is not handsome enough.

548
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,880
Little girl.

549
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,080
What are you thinking about?

550
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm thinking is it too noisy here

551
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,680
to make a phone call?

552
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,520
Noisy?

553
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,520
How is this place noisy?

554
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,120
Uncle Lin.

555
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
Let me use your phone.

556
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,560
Thank you.

557
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,280
What's so funny?

558
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
Make the call.

559
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,760
I'd better do this in my room.

560
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,720
It's quieter there.

561
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,040
He's making it so tense.

562
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
He's just cautious.

563
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,320
Hello?

564
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
Hello? It's me.

565
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,720
I know.

566
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,440
You're in Zhenjiang.

567
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,240
How do you know?

568
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,160
I found out

569
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,360
right after you passed the checkpoint.

570
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Checkpoint?

571
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,200
I think you should have heard

572
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,840
about the special event that's being held in Zhenjiang.

573
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,440
That's why they are registering

574
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,600
the cars entering and leaving the city.

575
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I heard about it.

576
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,000
There is an investment meeting.

577
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,560
That's right.

578
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,080
I have the information about your family.

579
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,800
I checked with the people at the checkpoint just now

580
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,240
and confirmed it was your father's car.

581
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
I'll explain this

582
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,200
to you when we see each other.

583
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Right now,

584
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,760
I have something to ask you.

585
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,960
Go ahead.

586
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,600
I need to

587
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,320
get engaged to someone right now.

588
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,560
Miss Shi Yi.

589
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,199
Are you his girlfriend?

590
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,239
Don't talk nonsense.

591
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,159
I heard that Mr. Zhousheng

592
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,480
has a fiancee.

593
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,639
So, it's all true.

594
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,280
He does have a fiancee.

595
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,360
Then why did he ask me out?

596
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,639
What kind of man is he!

597
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,080
Shi Yi.

598
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,520
Thank you

599
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,840
for telling me that.

600
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,639
I hope the two of you will be happy.

601
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,320
That's not what I mean.

602
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,840
What I'm trying to say is,

603
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,840
Shi Yi,

604
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,600
would you like to be engaged to me?

605
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,560
Shi Yi.

606
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,120
What you're saying is...

607
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,560
What I said is true.

608
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
We're not

609
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,240
strangers anymore

610
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,880
and we have feelings for

611
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,480
each another.

612
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,280
Maybe we can get engaged and give it a go.

613
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,680
We're getting engaged just because we have feelings for each other?

614
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,120
I don't know many girls.

615
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,840
If getting engaged is a must,

616
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,080
then I hope that person is you.

617
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,840
You can refuse if you want.

618
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,680
Maybe

619
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,840
you have someone better in mind.

620
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,880
I don't have anyone...

621
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm rather shy and slow to warm up to people.

622
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,560
It may take

623
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,520
a very long time

624
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,760
for me to develop feelings for something or someone.

625
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,560
If you find that unattractive about me

626
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,760
after getting to know me

627
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,160
or

628
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,920
you don't have any feelings for me,

629
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,400
I will choose

630
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,040
the most suitable way to end it.

631
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,320
We can even cancel the engagement at any time.

632
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,080
I won't make things hard for you.

633
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,560
Can I ask you a question?

634
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,480
What is it?

635
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,440
You know about my family.

636
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,000
But I don't know anything

637
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,040
about yours.

638
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,840
My ancestral family is from Zhenjiang.

639
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,840
Same as yours.

640
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,760
The other things,

641
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,520
you'll find out very soon.

642
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
What if I

643
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,560
reject you…

644
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,040
In that case, I won't disturb you

645
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,240
anymore.

646
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
Okay, I accept your proposal.

647
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,880
Hello?

648
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,400
Are you there?

649
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,320
I didn't expect you to say yes.

650
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,280
Then is it too late

651
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
for me to say no?

652
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,520
You can still change your mind.

653
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,120
You're not kidding?

654
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,800
Of course I'm not.

655
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,880
Okay.

656
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,240
So what do we do next?

657
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,360
What's going on?

658
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,400
Who are you engaged to?

659
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,200
Next,

660
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,600
can you tell me

661
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,720
your body measurements?

662
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,280
I need to get you

663
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
some clothes later.

664
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,440
92, 62, 90.

665
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,840
This, this is?

666
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,840
My BWH.

667
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,640
I got it.

668
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,160
Could you give me a second?

669
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,640
I can't believe I said yes.

670
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,760
I may also need to know

671
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,400
your neck circumference, the measurements of your upper arm,

672
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,600
forearm, wrist, calve, thigh.

673
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,600
and ankles.

674
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,080
Then I'll come back to you

675
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
when I'm done measuring.

676
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,520
Okay.

677
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,880
I'm impressed.

678
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
When did you come up?

679
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,640
Trust me.

680
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,600
If a girl

681
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,160
agrees to become your fiancee,

682
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,840
she must like you.

683
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,080
You're good, Professor.

684
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,600
The first time you called, you had a midnight supper.

685
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,440
The second time you called, you asked for her hand in marriage.

686
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,440
You are

687
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,960
efficient,

688
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,360
just like your experiments.

689
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,400
Didn't we communicate with each other

690
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,280
with email for six months already?

691
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,200
Are you trying to convince yourself?

692
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,600
She already said yes.

693
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,600
Mr. Zhousheng.

694
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
You have to believe in yourself.

695
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,440
You have your charms.

696
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,440
Really?

697
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Where are you going?

698
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,640
To prepare a gift for her parents tomorrow.

699
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,480
Shi Yi.

700
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,680
This must be the biggest gossip in the world.

701
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,360
You haven't told me yet

702
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,720
but my heart is already racing!

703
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,320
Give me a break.

704
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,200
If you don't tell me,

705
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,120
I'll open the door and announce the news now.

706
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,320
My parents don't know about this yet.

707
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,760
They'll find out eventually.

708
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,640
I didn't tell them

709
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,760
I had a boyfriend.

710
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,960
Someone's being bold.

711
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,160
Are you doing a flash marriage?

712
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
I don't think it's that.

713
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,880
We've known each other for six months already.

714
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,800
What does he do?

715
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,600
Is he handsome?

716
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,960
How did you meet him?

717
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,160
Let me think about

718
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,200
how to explain this to my parents, okay?

719
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,920
This is so exciting.

720
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,920
There are her parents,

721
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,840
uncle, aunt

722
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,160
and a cousin.

723
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,760
Uncle Lin, could you help me

724
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,000
pick a gift

725
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,160
that's appropriate?

726
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,800
You've come to the right person for that.

727
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,800
Although Uncle Lin had a relationship in the past,

728
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,520
I never had to give a gift

729
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,040
to her father.

730
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,400
Clearly, I didn't ask

731
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,080
the right person.

732
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
I'm just kidding.

733
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,120
The older, the wiser.

734
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,000
Let's go upstairs.

735
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,440
I will help you choose something. Let's go.

736
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,080
Mom.

737
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,960
Sit down

738
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,720
Are you hiding something from me?

739
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,280
Sit down.

740
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,160
Classes have been tough lately, right?

741
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,200
I'll give you a massage.

742
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,920
I know what you're up to.

743
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,960
Tell me, what is it?

744
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,200
I've got a boyfriend.

745
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,440
The one you mentioned this afternoon?

746
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,520
He just proposed to me.

747
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,720
What?

748
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,040
Didn't you two just start dating?

749
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,640
Yes.

750
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,400
But he really wanted to get engaged.

751
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,040
I said yes.

752
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,040
Shi Yi.

753
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,960
I really don't know

754
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,240
what to say.

755
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,400
Have you given it some thought?

756
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,080
I don't know.

757
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,720
I just wanted to say yes.

758
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,840
He sounded very sincere

759
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,120
when he proposed just now,

760
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,240
I was shocked too.

761
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,160
I didn't think he would suddenly propose to me.

762
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,040
Fine.

763
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,320
I can see that

764
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,560
you like him.

765
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,920
But what's the rush?

766
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,400
I really don't understand.

767
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,640
Can't you two take time?

768
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,080
I don't know how to explain it to you.

769
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,080
Mom.

770
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
You should meet him.

771
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,120
You'll like him when you see him.

772
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:48,960
Yeah,

773
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,520
of course I'll meet him!

774
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,280
What's his name?

775
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,080
What does he do?

776
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,400
His name is Zhousheng Chen.

777
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,280
He's an associate professor.

778
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,440
He's under thirty.

779
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,880
What about his family?

780
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,120
And what do his parents do?

781
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,200
Where are they from?

782
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,480
From Zhenjiang.

783
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,240
Same as us.

784
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,520
You little rascal.

785
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,240
You didn't tell me about it this afternoon.

786
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,160
This afternoon,

787
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
I didn't expect

788
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,560
he would propose to me.

789
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,400
So I didn't say anything.

790
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,600
Well.

791
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,480
Since he's here,

792
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,520
let's meet him here

793
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,080
and have dinner together.

794
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,840
But I should warn you

795
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,640
we have to have another discussion

796
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,560
after we've meet with him.

797
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,600
You hear?

798
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,400
He said he would come tomorrow.

799
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
This guy.

800
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,280
Is he really in such a hurry?
