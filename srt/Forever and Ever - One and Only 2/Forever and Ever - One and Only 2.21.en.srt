[Episode 21]

4
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,060
Has Shi Yi woken up?

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,900
I've informed the kitchen to make something nutritious.

6
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,500
We'll send it to her tomorrow.

7
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,940
She just woke up today,

8
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,340
so it's better for her to have something light.

9
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,620
I want to talk

10
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,139
alone with Wenchuan.

11
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,740
Since you brothers have things to discuss,

12
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,700
we'll take our leave then.

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,940
I'll walk you out.

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,740
Chen.

15
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,380
What's wrong?

16
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,700
As soon as I got back,

17
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,500
I heard that something happened to Miss Shi Yi.

18
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,660
Does this have

19
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,180
anything to do with you?

20
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,600
Chen, what do you mean?

21
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,840
Are you saying I'm a part of it?

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,620
That lake is not deeper than two meters.

23
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,340
Even if a kid falls in,

24
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,329
there will be plenty of time to save him.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Besides,

26
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,440
isn't Shi Yi fine now?

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,670
People should be cautious

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,250
near water.

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,700
It's getting colder with every rainfall in the autumn.

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
After this rain,

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,940
it'll be autumn.

32
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,190
Right.

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
It'll be autumn.

34
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,560
Qin Wan,

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,829
in all these years,

36
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,000
you've been taking care of the family business

37
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,280
on your own.

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,540
It's not been an easy journey.

39
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,150
Now that the kids are all grown up,

40
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,800
it's time for you to rest and enjoy yourself.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
The kids are older,

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
but there are also more problems.

43
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,150
So busy that I

44
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,800
don't even have time for you all.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,480
We are family.

46
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,870
Don't say that.

47
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,500
No need to accompany us anymore.

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,710
We should go.

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,960
Bye.

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,200
See you.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,640
Here, have some water.

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,640
Thanks.

53
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,980
I think it was

54
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,580
an accident this time.

55
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,370
The boatman is one of Uncle Lin's men.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,470
In other words,

57
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,260
all the workers in the mansion

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,659
have been replaced

59
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,460
by Uncle Lin and Uncle Chen.

60
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,270
So there shouldn't be any problems.

61
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,700
I've thought about it.

62
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,380
Let's take this as a warning to him

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,820
for what happened to you that night.

64
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
If that's the case, then what I did was not

65
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,780
crossing the line.

66
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,720
Shi Yi is up, right?

67
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,500
She is.

68
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,780
By the way,

69
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,980
why is Wenxing in your place?

70
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,980
She had a fever last night

71
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,300
and no one could do anything about her.

72
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,860
It didn't seem proper for me

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,820
to go into your mother's yard.

74
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,540
So I asked them

75
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,900
to send her to me.

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,980
I know how to

77
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,780
deal with her.

78
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,020
After all,

79
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,740
she grew up under my watch.

80
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,210
Compared to Zhou Wenchuan and me,

81
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,820
you are more like her brother.

82
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,250
Wenxing, what are you doing out here?

83
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,100
Here.

84
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,940
Chen,

85
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,300
I want to see Shi Yi.

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,340
You can go tomorrow.

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,740
You just had a fever.

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,060
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
If I'd known sooner...

90
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,620
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,780
No one would have wanted this to happen.

92
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,820
You don't understand.

93
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,780
I want to apologize in person.

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,540
Right now.

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,260
Let her go.

96
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,780
Otherwise,

97
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,580
she'll have trouble sleeping

98
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,460
and it'd cause more problems.

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,540
Fine.

100
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,620
Wenxing wants to check on you.

101
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
She is downstairs.

102
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,300
Tell her to come up now.

103
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,140
Let's measure your body temperature first.

104
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
You're still having a slight fever.

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,260
Are you having a headache?

106
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,700
A little.

107
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,820
Anything else?

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,380
A slight stomach ache.

109
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,700
Your brain was deprived of oxygen for a while.

110
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,260
So these symptoms are normal

111
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,380
for someone that suffocated in water.

112
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,390
You'll feel better in a couple of days.

113
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,200
Get some rest.

114
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,780
Shi Yi.

115
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,580
I should've been more cautious.

117
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,660
I made you jump in to save me.

118
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,900
It was my fault.

119
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
I didn't know you couldn't swim.

120
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,180
When they were saving you,

121
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,740
Chen's face turned pale.

122
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,980
He didn't say anything else

123
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,380
but your name

124
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,780
when he was beside you.

125
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,740
I was really scared.

126
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,340
Terrified.

127
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,059
If anything happened to you,

128
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Chen would hate me to death.

129
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:30,220
He would not.

130
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,659
He loves you.

131
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,580
All right.

132
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,340
It's fine now, Wenxing.

133
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
I'm fine, aren't I?

134
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,580
Stop crying, honey.

135
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,980
Both of you

136
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,460
need to rest.

137
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,260
Stop crying.

138
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,780
It'll slow down recovery.

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,180
Poor thing.

140
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,700
She can't stop crying.

141
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,140
And Chen can't say the right thing to stop her.

142
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,660
The only person that make her stop

143
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,860
is Meixing.

144
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,420
Wenxing doesn't feel strong now.

145
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,860
I'll send her back.

146
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,580
Go and take care of Shi Yi.

147
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,700
Fine.

148
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:33,980
Come on.

149
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,020
Let's go.

150
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,380
Chen.

151
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,100
Your grandma didn't

152
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,340
get up today.

153
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,060
We thought she was reluctant to get up

154
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,220
because of rheumatism.

155
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,060
But then she started to talk nonsense.

156
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,420
What's the current situation?

157
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,940
We already talked to the doctor.

158
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
The doctor said

159
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,740
that she is just old

160
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,580
so she becomes easily confused.

161
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,580
If anything happens here

162
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,540
with Shi Yi,

163
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,580
call me.

164
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I'll go over now to see her myself.

165
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,300
Sure.

166
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,740
Chen.

167
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,940
You've had a long day.

168
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,300
You haven't rested

169
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,740
since yesterday.

170
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,740
My mom

171
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,060
lives here

172
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,580
on her own.

173
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,020
Thank you for keeping her company.

174
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,380
And about Wenxing,

175
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,460
I know

176
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,110
that you are the most worried one in the whole family.

177
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,740
They are not only your family members,

178
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,540
but also mine.

179
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,420
For me,

180
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,220
family is always worth the effort.

181
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,020
Thank you.

182
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,620
Mom,

183
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,820
Shi Yi

184
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,660
is also my family,

185
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,460
someone close to me.

186
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
I don't want her to feel wronged.

187
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,340
Shi Yi...

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,300
What Shi Yi wants

189
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,220
is nothing else

190
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,260
but a

191
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,500
normal relationship

192
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,660
with her family.

193
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,380
Granduncle.

194
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,260
You are back.

195
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,180
We made some porridge in the morning.

196
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,020
She didn't feel like eating

197
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,380
and only had a little.

198
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,940
This was just cooked.

199
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,780
Give it here.

200
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,380
You...

201
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,260
What are you doing?

202
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,180
I'll go add a quarter spoon of white sugar.

203
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,620
Having something sweet now is bad, right?

204
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,100
There is also dried meat floss.

205
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,180
Shi Yi likes it this way.

206
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,420
I'll go and get the sugar.

207
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,540
Wait for me here.

208
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,460
Why didn't you have the porridge?

209
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,500
It's too plain.

210
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,580
You should try to have some.

211
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,220
I'll feed you.

212
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,220
It's sweet.

213
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,220
Where were you last night?

214
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,620
I went to go check on grandma.

215
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,740
Is she feeling unwell?

216
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,020
She is better now.

217
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,980
What about Wenxing?

218
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,540
Wenxing is not doing

219
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,460
well now.

220
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,140
Then why did you bring her here to see me?

221
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,340
She insisted.

222
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I couldn't talk her out of it.

223
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
A lucky jade.

224
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,660
Right.

225
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,540
A lucky jade.

226
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,300
Please keep me safe.

227
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,300
The other day,

228
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,260
how did you fall into the water?

229
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,440
The boat was turning around

230
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,840
when Wenxing lost her balance.

231
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,190
I wanted to keep her steady

232
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,410
but fell in instead.

233
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,600
You lost your balance?

234
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,100
Maybe I

235
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,280
stood too close to the edge.

236
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,660
It was not flat where I stood

237
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,620
so I tripped and fell.

238
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,300
Here.

239
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,160
I don't want any more.

240
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,100
Lie down with me for a while.

241
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,700
Lian Sui said you barely had any sleep.

242
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,900
You must feel exhausted.

243
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,630
Finish your porridge first.

244
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,120
If I finish the porridge,

245
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,060
you will have to lie down with me.

246
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,540
As long as you eat it all up,

247
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,710
I'll lie down with you.

248
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,800
You are so annoying.

249
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,140
Here.

250
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,010
♫Time can't steal memories♫

251
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,520
♫With all my strength♫

252

♫Tenderly and carefully♫

♫Rewrite the end of the past♫

♫Let the story continue♫

259
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,540
♫You're in my dreams♫

260
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:19,000
♫It's getting clearer and clearer♫

261
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,570

♫I know what heartache feels like♫

♫Forever and ever is like a dream♫

♫I'll still be with you♫

272
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,100
It's already dark.

273
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,580
You were too tired.

274
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,060
Take me to grandma's

275
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,060
tomorrow,

276
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,740
will you?

277
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,820
But you have not recovered yet.

278
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,180
You need to rest.

279
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,820
I'm fine.

280
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,580
For real.

281
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,500
Grandma likes me.

282
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,980
She'd be happy to see me.

283
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,340
Just take me.

284
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,340
If you must visit her,

285
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,980
then you might need

286
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,020
to prepare yourself first.

287
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,580
She might not be able

288
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,020
to recognize you now.

289
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,340
She was fine

290
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,100
the last time we saw her, right?

291
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,660
Are you hungry?

292
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,660
A little.

293
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,140
I'll go and cook up something

294
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,260
for you.

295
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,580
Wait here.

296
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,180
Mother.

297
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,100
Auntie.

298
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,260
You look better.

299
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,380
Are you feeling better?

300
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,100
Much better.

301
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,220
I'll be fine after a few more days.

302
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,300
Young people recover fast,

303
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,580
but you cannot be careless.

304
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
It's all right to rest for a few months

305
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,420
after going through something so traumatic.

306
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,660
Do not be careless,

307
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,740
got it?

308
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,020
Yes.

309
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,700
Grandma chased me out.

310
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,900
It's better for me to leave.

311
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,140
You guys go ahead.

312
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,070
By the way, Chen.

313
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,410
Grandma is now confused

314
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,100
and thinks Jiaren is pregnant.

315
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,540
Don't burst her bubble.

316
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,780
Make her feel better for me.

317
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,580
All right.

318
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,940
Miss Shi, thank you

319
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,260
for visiting grandma.

320
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,460
Sure.

321
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,660
Your mom's sudden kindness toward me

322
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,100
makes me a little afraid.

323
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,020
What are you afraid of?

324
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,860
I can't tell.

325
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
What happened?

326
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,580
Why is she suddenly like this?

327
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,500
Come on.

328
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,540
Let's go in.

329
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,780
I'm too old now.

330
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,940
Who knows

331
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,620
if I can meet the baby?

332
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,060
Of course, you can.

333
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
We are counting on you to give him a nickname.

334
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,070
Really?

335
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,500
Your nickname

336
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
also came from me.

337
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,140
Right.

338
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,660
How time flies.

339
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,040
Now you are already going to have kids.

340
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,220
Chen.

341
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,780
Grandma.

342
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,180
Who is this?

343
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,100
Grandma.

344
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,420
This is Shi Yi.

345
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,300
My wife.

346
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,620
Nice to see you, grandma.

347
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,820
Wenchuan,

348
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,580
you brothers

349
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,420
barely see each other.

350
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,660
Now that the two of you are here,

351
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,900
why are you two not talking?

352
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,340
Our wives are here to chat with you

353
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,340
and we are good here watching.

354
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,180
Grandma, we came here

355
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,500
to see you.

356
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,180
We juniors have plenty of time

357
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,340
to talk to each other.

358
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,660
Have a seat.

359
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,660
Have a seat.

360
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,820
Sit.

361
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,540
A gentleman has three prohibitions.

362
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,260
When he is young and immature,

363
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,720
he should refrain from sex.

364
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,260
When he is an adult and mature,

365
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,100
he should refrain from competing.

366
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,900
He should refrain from competing.

367
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,660
When he is old and weak,

368
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,540
he should refrain from being proud.

369
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,660
You brothers

370
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,720
are now adults and mature.

371
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,240
Remember to not

372
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,340
fight each other

373
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,980
over some lousy possessions.

374
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,870
Not everyone has the luck

375
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,660
to have brothers.

376
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,460
Grandma.

377
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,990
You are overthinking this.

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,910
Chen and I are fine.

379
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,060
Grandma,

380
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,300
it won't happen.

381
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,140
They are siblings.

382
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,810
Even if anything happens,

383
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm here to help.

384
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,450
Right, grandma.

385
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,740
You are overthinking it.

386
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,340
Shi Yi.

387
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,320
Grandma.

388
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,220
Shi Yi.

389
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,260
It's our first time meeting.

390
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,300
I don't know

391
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,680
what you like.

392
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,930
I have these prayer beads

393
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,120
of 18 Buddha pearls.

394
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,110
I want you to have them.

395
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,640
Let's go and get them.

396
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,580
Grandma,

397
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,380
you have already asked Zhousheng Chen

398
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,460
to give them to me.

399
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,710
Have I?

400
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,040
Yes, grandma.

401
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,350
She already got them.

402
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,440
Good, good, good.

403
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,500
I had been waiting to give them

404
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,610
to my eldest grandson's wife.

405
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,540
Thank you, grandma.

406
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,340
Mrs. Zhou asks you two

407
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,460
to join her for tea tomorrow.

408
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,820
I heard from Wenxing

409
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,580
that you read many ancient books.

410
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,100
Only some.

411
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,060
I think the words and sentences in ancient books

412
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,820
are just beautiful.

413
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,340
What are your favorite ones?

414
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,740
There's no specific type.

415
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,140
I like both the published ones

416
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,580
and the collected ones.

417
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,100
A girl that likes reading.

418
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
I like that.

419
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,380
What made you

420
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,820
fall for Zhousheng Chen?

421
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,300
I heard

422
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,340
that you communicated with each other via email for six months.

423
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,260
When you only knew

424
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,060
that he was a researcher

425
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,700
and nothing else,

426
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,060
why did you agree to marry him?

427
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,180
Actually

428
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,460
he has many attractive

429
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,500
characteristics.

430
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,460
For example?

431
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,050
For example,

432
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,170
the day we met each other in Xi'an.

433
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,180
It was a coincidence

434
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,580
and he left

435
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,460
briefly after.

436
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,740
He said

437
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,830
that if the rain stopped,

438
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,100
we'd talk about meeting up.

439
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,800
The rain stopped eventually at midnight

440
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,580
and he really sent me an email

441
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,900
which was very cute.

442
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,020
In the email, he said that it was 4:36am

443
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,020
when he left the lab and it was not raining.

444
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,340
And if it doesn't rain

445
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,740
at 11:30am,

446
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,180
then let's meet at Azure Dragon Temple at 12pm.

447
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,420
It was just an email

448
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,940
but it showed a lot.

449
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,380
It showed that he was disciplined and sincere.

450
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,740
A man that would keep his words.

451
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,740
They are all

452
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,540
the things I like about him.

453
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,660
What if he was faking it?

454
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,780
What if he was pretending so that you would like him ?

455
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,780
No way.

456
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,610
During our six months of email communication,

457
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
every one of his emails

458
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,100
were like that.

459
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,280
His emails

460
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,460
always make me laugh.

461
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,380
I've never met someone that is so

462
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,420
adorably disciplined.

463
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,740
Adorable?

464
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,450
Everything he does

465
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,630
seems adorable to me.

466
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,180
So adorable

467
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,740
that as long as I'm thinking about him,

468
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
no matter how busy work is,

469
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,140
I could never feel tired,

470
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,340
and no matter how annoying things become,

471
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,740
I would never be bothered.

472
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,940
I never thought

473
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,260
that you'd like him

474
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,100
because you think he is adorable.

475
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,260
Tell me more,

476
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,340
your perspective is very refreshing.

477
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,740
As his mom,

478
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,980
I've never seen this side of him.

479
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,420
From you,

480
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,420
I get to know him better.

481
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,140
I asked him

482
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,180
why he would dedicate himself to science.

483
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,260
He said that he wanted

484
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,060
to make more people happy.

485
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,900
It's odd.

486
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,940
I used to hate it

487
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,980
when people say fancy things like that,

488
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,760
but he is the only exception.

489
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,200
As long as it's him,

490
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,160
I'll totally buy it

491
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,520
and believe that's what he thinks.

492
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,760
Not at all would I think he's trying to fool me.

493
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Looks like

494
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,120
you are the perfect girl for him.

495
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
However,

496
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,360
I still insist

497
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
on my previous thought

498
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,120
that you are not the right person for this family.

499
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,690
You come from a good family,

500
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,540
not very rich or powerful,

501
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,340
but very knowledgeable.

502
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,980
Your parents are happy.

503
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,260
You don't have siblings

504
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,860
or a complicated social life.

505
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,720
You have stable life routines

506
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,800
and stable things to do.

507
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,600
You have regular work

508
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,880
yet it's also flexible.

509
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,080
Is it all true?

510
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,960
Yes.

511
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,640
I stay with my parents on weekends.

512
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,560
On workdays, I read in the morning

513
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,240
and work from noon

514
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
to midnight.

515
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,400
All I have to face to are the scripts

516
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,600
and the recording directors.

517
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,000
When I just started to work,

518
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,210
I didn't go to a fixed recording studio...

519
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
Later on I got my own studio,

520
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,960
I didn't need to run around anymore,

521
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,160
so there were less people for me to meet.

522
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,740
Besides,

523
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,490
I don't like offline activities,

524
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,560
so I barely attend any.

525
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,400
You've known your coworkers for years

526
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,470
and have several close friends.

527
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,690
Your social circle has always been small and intimate.

528
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,720
I like to put my time

529
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,190
into working and reading.

530
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,880
The rest

531
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,960
I spend it with my parents.

532
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,680
A simple social life

533
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,520
suits me better.

534
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,280
You've made such a

535
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,680
good life for yourself.

536
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,440
You have such a good job.

537
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,000
Why don't you go back

538
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,960
to your own life?

539
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,880
Shi Yi,

540
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,680
listen to me.

541
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,520
A few decades ago,

542
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,880
Ren's mom

543
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,400
passed away from an accident.

544
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,640
To protect Ren,

545
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,720
we decided to tell him about it

546
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,640
several years later.

547
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,160
However,

548
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,640
the entire Zhou family could not let it go.

549
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,320
The fourth uncle even called the police

550
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,800
to investigate me.

551
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,040
It was chaotic.

552
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,320
Until today,

553
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,600
the fourth uncle and I haven't seen each other.

554
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,200
Of course,

555
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,110
the fourth uncle is an honest and decent person,

556
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,690
he was also used by those relatives.

557
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,440
I never really blamed him for anything.

558
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,520
In a big family

559
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,180
like ours,

560
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,480
with so many people.

561
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,170
It's just like a small society.

562
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,330
Where there are both good and bad people.

563
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,820
Some people are good

564
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,560
while some are bad.

565
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,000
Some of them

566
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,740
may not do anything bad,

567
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,480
but they are far from being nice.

568
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,400
They'd only give you a hard time

569
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,510
and wish you a bad life.

570
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,160
It would be fine

571
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,870
if they were just strangers.

572
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,580
Unfortunately, they are your relatives.

573
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
What should you do with them?

574
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,680
You don't even like

575
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,560
complicated relations.

576
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,040
Why must you make yourself suffer

577
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,080
and join our big family?

578
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,400
Mom.

579
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,080
You look good.

580
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,420
What are you doing here?

581
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,230
You secretly invited Shi Yi for tea..

582
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,600
So I came to have some as well.

583
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,440
What were you guys talking about?

584
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,310
We were talking about...

585
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,970
We were just talking about Shi Yi's painting.

586
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Mr.Chen is usually

587
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
hermitic and proud,

588
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,070
yet he said so many nice things about Shi Yi.

589
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,770
I like that painting too.

590
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,410
Too bad Grandpa Chen got it.

591
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,560
Why don't you paint more one

592
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,950
and we can keep it at home?

593
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,040
Why don't I try to recreate it ?

594
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,080
It's very similar.

595
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,880
It's almost 70 to 80 percent alike.

596
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,719
But the feelings are very different.

597
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,320
It looks the same to me.

598
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,900
Shi Yi's painting is more

599
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,850
like the last lotus flower at the end of the summer.

600
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,760
Cold and distant.

601
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,389
While Chen's painting is freer.

602
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,260
It's more like the fresh lotus flower

603
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,179
in a green pond

604
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,270
at the beginning of summer.

605
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,560
My eldest brother is a fresh lotus flower

606
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,080
passionately waiting

607
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,520
for his partner to blossom.

608
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,850
So he is waiting for Shi Yi.

609
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,080
Is it similar?

610
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,710
Yes.

611
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,080
Look at how clean and pure the lotus flowers are.

612
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,580
[Look at how clean and pure the lotus flowers are. It should be the same for the heart.]

613
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,940
It should be the same for the heart.

614
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,420
Chen,

615
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,360
you are referring to a poem by Meng Haoran, right?

616
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,540
It goes well with this painting.

617
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,980
[Look at how clean and pure the lotus flowers are. It should be the same for the heart.]

618
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,600
Mother.

619
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,200
There you are.

620
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,400
Did Shi Yi draw this?

621
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,440
Chen drew it.

622
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,600
Chen?

623
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,680
Look at the lotus flower,

624
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,960
it is clean even though it's surroundings are muddy.

625
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,080
He wants to remind himself

626
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,280
that he should not be affected by worldly troubles

627
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,540
and to protect his own heart.

628
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,900
This painting

629
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,300
is for us.

630
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,540
Why is it for us?

631
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,420
He is not good at expressing himself

632
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,780
so this is the only thing he can do.

633
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,180
He is trying to tell us

634
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,620
that he cares about Shi Yi

635
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,580
from the bottom of his heart.

636
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,700
If it's not that,

637
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,420
then how can he

638
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,300
imitate her work so well

639
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,940
from only looking at it once?

640
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,380
[Shufeng Garden]

641
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,820
Seems like

642
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,500
I am not right for your family.

643
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,620
Neither am I.

644
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,540
Were you like this when you were a kid?

645
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,500
I was similar to you when you were a kid.

646
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,220
Could you get used

647
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,860
to living in such an environment

648
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,740
when you were young?

649
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,340
I could not get used to it and I did not like it.

650
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,020
But I couldn' t get rid of it.

651
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,700
I think blood relations

652
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,420
is the only connection

653
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
between people

654
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,900
that we can't get rid of.

655
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,060
I prefer a simple life.

656
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,780
You like Venus

657
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,780
better than Earth

658
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,380
where you live in.

659
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,100
Mars is also acceptable.

660
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,740
Do you regret it?

661
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,740
Suddenly coming back?

662
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Back in Bremen

663
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,180
when you talked about these,

664
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,660
I did not know much about your family.

665
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,180
But now,

666
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
it looks like

667
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,660
no one wants you back.

668
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,460
I have no regrets.

669
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,220
No matter how much you achieve,

670
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,820
you should always try your best

671
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,620
to guard the ground beneath your feet.

672
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,610
If you can't,

673
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,940
your people will have no one

674
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,980
strong enough to rely on,

675
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,660
won't they?

676
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,980
Just like the Jewish people in old times.

677
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,500
No matter where they lived

678
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,420
in this world,

679
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,220
without a powerful homeland,

680
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,380
they could lose it all at any time.

681
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,660
You have too many things

682
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,260
stored here.

683
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,900
I'm fine with only occupying a small part.

684
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,260
But,

685
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,740
I want everything that's related to romantic love.

686
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,540
Sure.

687
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,940
It's all yours.

688
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,940
Lin Fei went to the lake

689
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,700
to get this fish this afternoon.

690
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,020
It's fresh.

691
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,980
Medicated diet coming through.

692
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,980
Is this all for me?

693
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,900
Your wife asked for it.

694
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,460
It's supposed to be very nutritious.

695
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,260
Granduncle.

696
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,300
Enjoy the food.

697
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,140
It's very nutritious.

698
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,820
You've been working too hard these days.

699
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,660
You can really use it.

700
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,460
I don't need any.

701
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,180
I looked it up online.

702
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,020
It's good for your health.

703
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,340
Try some.

704
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,700
Fine.

705
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,980
There is traditional Chinese medicine inside?

706
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,100
You had too much when you were young

707
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,380
and you don't like it now?

708
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,940
I don't fancy traditional Chinese medicine that much.

709
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,740
Bitter medicine is good for health.

710
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,820
And it's not even medicine.

711
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,940
It's just food that has medicinal properties.

712
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,380
It's tasty.

713
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Just try some.

714
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,740
Have some more.

715
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,580
It's pretty good.

716
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,740
Where are you going?

717
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,660
Delivering grapes.

718
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,420
How many times are you doing this in one day?

719
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,420
Are you delivering grapes one by one?

720
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,260
Can't you give them some alone time?

721
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,380
I now wish

722
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,540
that they have already passed this passionate phase

723
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,260
and become an old couple

724
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,860
so

725
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,700
that they wouldn't feel bothered by me.

726
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,500
Gee,

727
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,340
he married her

728
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,860
for you, didn't he?

729
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,060
Can you give them some space?

730
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,020
None of your business.

731
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,620
Is something bothering you?

732
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,020
Nothing.

733
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,340
I have been reading, haven't I?

734
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,820
You move around every other minute.

735
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,500
It doesn't seem like you're reading.

736
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,140
I...

737
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,500
You are not working either,

738
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,980
aren't you?

739
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,740
How else could you know

740
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,500
that I was not reading?

741
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,620
How about

742
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,140
we continue this on the bed?

743
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,340
No, let's do it here.

744
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,260
Granduncle!

745
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,540
Granduncle.

746
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,140
Come out for a minute.

747
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,860
I'm going out then.

748
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,170
Something happened.

749
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,380
I'll go and check it out.

750
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,220
You should rest early.
