[Episode 10]

4
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:41,900
Hello, Mom?

5
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,620
Shi Yi, your father and I

6
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,380
came to Zhenjiang earlier than expected.

7
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,340
We had a discussion.

8
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,580
We feel

9
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,820
that it's impolite of us

10
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,700
to only meet Chen's parents

11
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,460
during the engagement banquet.

12
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,380
Can you

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,460
discuss this with him

14
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,060
and arrange for us

15
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,100
to meet his mother tonight?

16
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,940
See if she's free tonight.

17
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,540
Something happened to their family.

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,860
They might not be able to make it tonight.

19
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,460
What happened?

20
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,820
Is it serious?

21
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,260
It's just a conflict between their relatives.

22
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,540
I didn't ask him much.

23
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,260
Alright then.

24
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,100
But you must remember this.

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,020
No matter what,

26
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,860
the two families need to meet each other once

27
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,940
before the engagement banquet.

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,700
Did you hear me?

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,820
And

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,100
your grandparents are here as well.

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,500
So,

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,940
if Chen can't make it tonight,

33
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,380
you should come by yourself.

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,860
Okay?

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,380
Alright.

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,980
That's it for now.

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,780
What's wrong?

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,900
Something happened to Chen's family.

39
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,180
We can't meet them tonight.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,740
How about tomorrow?

41
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,700
If they can't make it tomorrow, how about the day after tomorrow?

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260
Anyway, we applied for leave.

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,260
We have ample time to meet them.

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,780
Alright then.

45
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,940
Let's go and take a walk.

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,980
Lian Sui.

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,140
Where is he?

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,060
I don't know.

49
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,900
Lin Fei,

50
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,140
where's Zhousheng Chen?

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,460
His mother wanted to see him
for an urgent matter.

52
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,140
He had to leave early.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,540
He didn't get to tell you before he left.

54
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,020
Is that so?

55
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,420
Is there a car available here?

56
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,220
I don't need a driver.
I can drive it myself.

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,700
A car?

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,820
There isn't?

59
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,380
Everyone went out.

60
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,100
We don't have any cars for now.

61
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,140
I can call a cab for you.

62
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,579
But maybe you need to wait
for half an hour.

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,260
Ren has a car.

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,100
Go and ask him.

65
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,220
Hurry up.

66
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,820
I don't like to talk to him.

67
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,540
He's mean.

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,700
Are you going or not?

69
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,020
Fine. I'll go.

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,660
You're so annoying.

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,780
Let me pack my things.

72
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,860
I won't lend it to you.

73
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,100
I have mysophobia.

74
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,780
I dislike it when people sit in my car.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,340
Even my father hasn't
ridden my car before.

76
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,620
Fine.

77
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,740
I think I should call a cab

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,540
for Miss Shi then.

79
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,860
Who's borrowing the car again?

80
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,500
Shi Yi.

81
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,420
She wants to go back home.

82
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,620
She wants to go to her uncle's house in Zhenjiang.

83
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:08,180
Ask her to wait for me.

84
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,300
I'll change my attire.

85
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Why are you changing clothes

86
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,940
when you're seeing
your cousin's mother-in-law?

87
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,220
Miss Shi.

88
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,220
Thank you for lending me your car.

89
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,100
Don't mention it.

90
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,060
Is this outfit suitable when I meet

91
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,820
your parents later?

92
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,500
Are you planning to go with me?

93
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,700
Now there's no one home.

94
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,500
No one will eat with me once you leave.

95
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,820
Sure. I'll bring you along.

96
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,420
The key.

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,420
Do I need to tell your mother

98
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,580
that you're following me back?

99
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,460
No need.

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,620
Someone else will tell her about it.

101
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,580
What are you doing?

102
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
I'm following you guys as well.

103
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,140
No.

104
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,860
You're not allowed to sit in my car.

105
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,060
Miss Shi is much more aggressive
at driving than me.

106
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,540
Shi Yi!

107
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,780
You can go down for now.
I'll park the car.

108
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,460
Alright.

109
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,780
Hello, my name is...

110
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,860
Shi Yuanyuan.

111
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,100
Did Shi Yi tell you my name?

112
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,100
You're the youngest daughter

113
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,340
of Miss Shi Yi's uncle,

114
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,220
the only child of your family.

115
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,700
You went to a girls' school
during junior high.

116
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,659
You couldn't get used to it,

117
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,460
that's why you transferred to
an ordinary key junior high school.

118
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,820
You got into its senior high directly.

119
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,700
Your result of the National Higher Education Entrance Examination wasn't great.

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,660
You repeated your grade for one year.

121
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,700
You're in your thirteenth grade.

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,620
I suppose this is the first time
we're meeting each other.

123
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,540
That's right.

124
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,500
How did you know about me?

125
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,660
We have information regarding
the engagement banquet's guests

126
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,300
so that it's convenient for us

127
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,140
to find a topic for our first meeting.

128
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,940
If not, the first meeting

129
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,860
would be awkward.

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,420
You're considerate indeed.

131
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,500
And, the food you like,

132
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,180
the food you dislike,

133
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,060
the food you avoid,

134
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,020
the food you're allergic to,

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,780
I didn't take a close look at them.

136
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,660
I gave them to the kitchen staff.

137
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,460
You're being too considerate.

138
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,260
Yuanyuan.

139
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,340
Shi Yi.

140
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,540
This is Zhousheng Ren.

141
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,820
He's the cousin of Zhousheng Chen.

142
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,260
It's a pleasure to meet you.

143
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,260
Let's go.

144
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,300
Let's go.

145
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,900
Before I met Miss Shi,

146
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,700
I thought Chen

147
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,100
was the incarnation of a monk.

148
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
He had no time for girls.

149
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,820
He only has time for his reagents,
test tubes,

150
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,740
and his thesis.

151
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Ordinary men

152
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,220
usually put on the same disguise.

153
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,340
They make it as if they're not
into worldly desires.

154
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,140
But in reality,

155
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,340
they're ordinary men.

156
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,220
All of them are the same.

157
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,380
Why should we lie to you?

158
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,180
Do you think there's a benefit to it?

159
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,140
Of course there is.

160
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,220
It can help your cousin to gain
a favorable impression before the wedding,

161
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,420
thus, making the elders like him.

162
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,540
I'm helping you out.

163
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,940
You're pulling the rug from under my feet.

164
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm really helping you out.

165
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,740
Think about it.

166
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,220
Now, my grandparents

167
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,740
haven't managed to see your cousin yet.

168
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,460
We try our best to lower

169
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,540
our expectations

170
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,940
and we try to badmouth him.

171
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,659
So, when they meet him in person,

172
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,540
they'll find he's better than what they have expected,

173
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,300
then the wedding will proceed smoothly, right?

174
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,540
If

175
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,380
you raise their expectations of him too high,

176
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,180
they'll expect too much from him,

177
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,220
and find all kinds of faults with him

178
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,420
when they see him.

179
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,500
Why should we do so?

180
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,260
Am I right?

181
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,100
This little girl.

182
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,540
Look at that lass.

183
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,540
Look at you.

184
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,260
Your dark circles can
cover the entire earth.

185
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,780
Finish your milk.

186
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,500
You better sleep well when you go back.

187
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,700
Don't stay up late again.

188
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,180
If not,

189
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,820
your custom wedding dress will be wasted.

190
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,380
Alright, Mom.

191
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,500
By the way,

192
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,300
your aunt told me

193
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,700
that during the wedding ceremony,

194
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,460
the parents of both parties

195
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,780
need to give their speeches.

196
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,020
Do we need to give a speech
during the engagement banquet?

197
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
I have no idea.

198
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,340
I forgot to ask him about that.

199
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,460
I'm inexperienced.

200
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,260
If you're inexperienced,

201
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,539
that means I'm inexperienced as well.

202
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,059
This is the only time
I'm marrying off my daughter.

203
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,620
After you go back,

204
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,419
ask your future mother-in-law

205
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,539
and see when she's free.

206
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,740
We need to arrange for a meeting.

207
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,260
We need to be familiar with each other.

208
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,620
They're our future in-laws.

209
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,980
We need to face them
for the rest of our lives.

210
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,700
We must have a good start to it.

211
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,540
[Zhousheng Chen]

212
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm downstairs.

213
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,770
Don't worry.

214
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,020
He's here.

215
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,220
Over here.

216
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,380
Uncle, Aunt,

217
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,540
I've been quite busy
for the past few days.

218
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,380
That's why I had no time to visit you.

219
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,900
That's fine.

220
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,980
Shi Yi had explained everything to us.

221
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,820
Dad, Mom, we'll leave now.

222
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Drive safely, alright?

223
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,460
Goodbye.

224
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,020
Goodbye, Shi Yi.

225
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,420
Take care.

226
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,540
Goodbye, Chen.

227
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,100
Okay, bye.

228
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,420
I don't know.

229
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,820
We don't know

230
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,500
how that happened as well.

231
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,980
Precisely.

232
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,300
Uncle Lin is here.

233
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,580
Why would the Tang family
report this case?

234
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,900
They already received
two notices of critical illness.

235
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,940
It's quite serious.

236
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,380
What did you guys see on that day?

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,420
We don't know either.

238
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,180
We only knew

239
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,580
that Tong Jiaren and Tang Xiaofu
had an argument.

240
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,780
After that, Tang Xiaofu got hurt.

241
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,780
That's right.

242
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,420
Wenchuan was the one
who sent her to the hospital.

243
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,610
-Hello.
-Hello, mister.

244
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,950
-I'm the housekeeper here.
-We know nothing about it.

245
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
You can tell me what's going on.

246
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,650
Yes.

247
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,730
How

248
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,740
did it become like this?

249
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,860
Yeah.

250
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,580
Let's go.

251
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,060
Mr. Chen!

252
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,700
Your mother and your uncle

253
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
need to see you for something.

254
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,180
Wait for me in the room.

255
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,300
I'll be back soon.

256
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:07,900
Let's go.

257
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,660
Let's go in.

258
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,500
Why are you here?

259
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
I'm here to find Shi Yi

260
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,800
so that she can try
the custom wedding dress.

261
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,090
It's quite noisy over there.

262
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,150
Even I can't stand the noise.

263
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,220
Something happened to my family.

264
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,180
I guess the engagement banquet
will be canceled.

265
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,180
You're back?

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,580
Sorry for waking you up.

267
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,260
I've never gotten the chance
to ask you this.

268
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,900
Is voice acting fun?

269
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,540
It's pretty interesting.

270
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,820
But you need to be very good
at imagining things.

271
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,380
For example?

272
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,300
For example,

273
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,220
the recording engineer
often tells me this.

274
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,340
Miss Shi Yi,

275
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,860
you need to imagine

276
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,460
that you're the one walking in the rain.

277
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
You're the one who fell out of love.

278
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,940
You need to cry without tears.

279
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,660
Back then, I felt pretty helpless.

280
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,940
When actors are performing,

281
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,780
they can refer to other actors.

282
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,940
For me, I can only look at my script

283
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060
and the microphone.

284
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,060
I need to imagine how it feels like
to cry without tears.

285
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,980
Are you not used to

286
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,940
being with a person like me?

287
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
A little bit.

288
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm afraid something might pop up.

289
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,740
Just like what happened at the gate
in the afternoon.

290
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,500
I don't know what was going on.

291
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,180
And I don't know
what I can do to help you.

292
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,380
It's Tang Xiaofu,

293
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,180
the wife of my cousin
whom you've seen before.

294
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,100
She was hospitalized

295
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,420
ever since that incident.

296
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,620
Last night,

297
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,860
the doctor gave us

298
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,980
two notices of critical illness.

299
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,700
How is she now?

300
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,780
It's not optimistic.

301
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,860
She only stayed here

302
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,700
because of the engagement banquet.

303
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,260
But she got into an accident.

304
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,220
Even now, her life is still in danger.

305
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,220
Today,

306
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,780
the people from her mother's side are here.

307
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,260
They had a heated argument.

308
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,020
The cops came just now

309
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,180
because the Tang Family

310
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,940
reported the case to the police.

311
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,580
They said someone was trying to harm her.

312
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,380
So...

313
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,260
So, after my mother's
careful considerations,

314
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,380
she plans to cancel
the engagement banquet.

315
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,220
Sorry, Shi Yi.

316
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,540
Seems like I've been apologizing to you

317
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,420
quite often.

318
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm making myself look like a fraud.

319
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,820
There's no way we can hold a banquet

320
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,060
after something like this has happened.

321
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,020
Actually,

322
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,380
my parents aren't that hard to convince.

323
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,620
The problem is they brought
my grandparents to Zhenjiang

324
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,580
because of our engagement.

325
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,180
And my uncle and aunt are also here.

326
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,820
I'm afraid they might be unhappy.

327
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,340
I'll return home tomorrow

328
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,260
and explain it to them.

329
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,820
I should be the one who's upset

330
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,140
after our engagement has been canceled.

331
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,420
You should think of a way
to make it up to me

332
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,900
instead of apologizing.

333
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,080
Make it up to you?

334
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,620
Teach me how to do so.

335
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,500
Professor Zhousheng,

336
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,860
do you need me to teach you?

337
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,020
I think so.

338
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,460
No matter what I do,

339
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,860
it doesn't necessarily

340
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,820

I didn't sleep at all.

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,060
Did you really sleep well until morning?

346
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,700
Will you be happy

I didn't sleep until morning.

349
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,660
You're responsible for directing them.

350
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,780
Put them into the car.

Chen,

356
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,300
your mother had given us instructions

357
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,460
about your engagement banquet.

358
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,740
We've paid them.

359
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,020
They will leave this afternoon.

360
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,420
We've canceled all of the food.

361
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,780
Hurry up.

362
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,820
Have you taken your breakfast?

363
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,060
I'll ask them to
prepare something for you.

364
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,060
I plan to hold the engagement banquet

365
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,700
in Shanghai.

366
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,940
We only need the elders from both sides
to attend the banquet.

367
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,460
So, I hope you can

368
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,820
spare some time

369
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,820
to meet their parents officially

370
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,340

here before?

You'll be upset if I tell you the truth.

I'll be upset

if I lie to you.

I'm sure you thought

382
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,140
it was a poignant story.

383
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,700
You thought your mother was rejected by my family,

marry into the family,

Isn't that so?

388
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,460
Of course not.

Your father was much more rebellious
than you.

There are some ingredients

It's a waste for you to throw it away.

that his wife might run away
because she was angry at him.

They have the right to be angry.

511
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,500
Pour Chen some tea as well.

512
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,780
Alright.

513
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,180
Alright.

514
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,140
Actually, we're here today because...

515
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,380
Let me break the news to them.

516
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,100
Lately,

517
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,700
something happened to my family.

518
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,220
My cousin's wife was experiencing
preterm labor.

519
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,220
Her life was in danger.

520
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,100
Now, she's still in the hospital.

521
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,260
She hasn't regained consciousness yet.

522
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,540
Now,

523
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,820
my family is in chaos.

524
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,740
So my mother

525
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,620
wants to postpone our engagement banquet.

526
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,260
It's my family's fault

527
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
to change the date.

528
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,620
I'm here today

529
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,500
to explain our current situation

530
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,380
to you.

531
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,180
And I want to apologize you.

532
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,500
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,860
So that's the case.

534
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,180
Chen,

535
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,900
I'm sure you didn't wish for

536
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,940
something like that to happen to your family.

537
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,980
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

538
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,140
Yeah.

539
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
Family trouble is unavoidable.

540
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,420
It's fine.

541
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,580
Yeah.

542
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,100
Our family

543
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,620
doesn't have the tradition

544
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,260
to hold an engagement banquet.

545
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,180
When Shi Yi's father

546
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
told us about it,

547
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
we just took it

548
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,060
as a relaxing trip to Zhenjiang.

549
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,300
We're here just to see our children.

550
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,260
I think

551
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,900
it's enough for the elders
of both families

552
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,020
to have a meal together.

553
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Yeah, we should have a meal together.

554
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,020
You see, your uncle and I

555
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,580
have applied for a four-day leave.

556
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,740
After you go back, ask your mother

557
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,220
and discuss it with her.

558
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,060
We will

559
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,340
follow your schedule.

560
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,180
What do you think?

561
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,820
Yeah, we will follow her time.

562
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,020
My mother...

563
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,180
Don't tell me

564
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,980
your mother doesn't want to see us.

565
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,300
Why should we proceed with the engagement

566
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,180
if his mother despises our family?

567
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,420
Parents of both families

568
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,140
should have met with each other
before you proceed with the engagement.

569
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,020
My brother and sister-in-law thought they lived far away from you,

570
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,140
so they said nothing.

571
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,540
But now, the banquet is canceled

572
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,140
because of your family matter.

573
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,140
Considering the circumstances,

574
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,340
your parents

575
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,700
should book a restaurant,

576
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,060
explain the situation, and apologize to us

577
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,580
instead of sending you here

578
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,140
in hopes of resolving this issue.

579
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,260
Uncle,

580
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,580
that isn't the case.

581
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,020
Their family is quite complicated.

582
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,180
Every family gets some complicated issues.

583
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,940
You shouldn't be impolite

584
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,580
to your future in-laws.

585
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,500
Later,

586
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,580
I'll explain the situation
to you guys in private.

587
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,620
No need for that.

588
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,220
We'll be family in the future.

589
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,940
We shouldn't hide anything
from each other.

590
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,980
Sorry.

591
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,020
My mother

592
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,500
wasn't unsatisfied with your family.

593
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,420
She's unsatisfied with me.

594
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,940
My mother and I

595
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,500
are the causes of our every conflict.

596
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,700
Sorry.

597
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,660
Have a seat.

598
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,900
Actually, I can understand why

599
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,260
your uncle was so furious

600
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,940
about it.

601
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,580
He's just afraid that you might suffer

602
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,340
when you marry into that family.

603
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,740
I understand.

604
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,500
He's in conflict with his mother.

605
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,340
That's why

606
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,420
he couldn't persuade his mother
to meet you.

607
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,850
Shi Yi,

608
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,540
I don't need you

609
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,420
to marry into a great family.

610
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,820
If you're not used

611
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,900
to a family like that,

612
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,380
you can still change your mind.

613
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,690
To be honest with you,

614
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,860
youngsters nowadays

615
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,180
treat their marriages and divorces
like child's play.

616
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,460
You two just got engaged to each other.

617
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,980
You still have the time and chance

618
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,420
to think twice about your marriage.

619
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,180
Although

620
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,580
I do like that boy,

621
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,220
I really hope

622
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,820
you could live as an equal
when you marry into another family.

623
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,940
Mom, I understand.

624
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,020
I will surely take good care of myself.

625
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,780
If you have the chance,

626
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,300
you should visit his relative
in the hospital.

627
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,100
Hello?

628
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,220
Hello, Professor.

629
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,940
I've published my thesis.

630
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,660
Congratulations.

631
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,640
They ask me to take them a meal.

632
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,760
I'm thinking

633
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,730
to rent an entire cab

634
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,700
so that we can attend
your engagement banquet in Zhenjiang.

635
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,340
I've witnessed your love journey
together with Miss Shi

636
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,060
from the start till the end.

637
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,020
So, I must never miss out

638
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,540
on your engagement banquet and wedding.

639
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,740
The engagement banquet

640
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,940
is canceled.

641
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,380
Canceled?

642
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,540
But why?

643
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,340
Did Shi Yi change her mind?

644
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,620
Shi Yi and I are doing great.

645
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,660
There's no problem

646
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,820
with our relationship.

647
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,820
That's great to hear.

648
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,860
But you'll go on a business trip soon.

649
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,480
Won't you feel insecure

650
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,420
after your engagement banquet was canceled like this?

651
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,940
I feel very secure about it.

652
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,020
I'll hang up for now.

653
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,020
How was it?

654
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,340
My mother told me to ditch you.

655
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,980
You must be afraid, right?

656
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,500
I told you it would be best for me
to return here by myself.

657
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,380
But you insisted on coming with me.

658
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,260
What do you want to do now?

659
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,500
I want to make you happy.

660
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,540
Our family is the one
who canceled the engagement banquet.

661
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,420
Why are you trying to make it up to me?

662
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,620
Because you're more upset than me.

663
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,820
Last time, you said

664
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,420
there was a mountain path
which was very steep.

665
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,740
You didn't bring me there.

666
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,780
Let's go for a drive today.

667
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,740
Sure.

668
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,620
Let's go.

669
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,580
How do you feel?

670
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,380
Do you feel better

671
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,340
after our drive?

672
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,620
I think so.

673
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,460
Let's go.

674
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,780
I'll bring you to have something nice.

675
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,100
What is it?

676
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,179
It's a secret.

677
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,940
In the past, my mother

678
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,179
brought her students here
for their training.

679
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,100
It was during summer break back then.

680
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
