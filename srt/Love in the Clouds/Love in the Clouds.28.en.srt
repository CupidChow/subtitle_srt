1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,200
My Lord, did you drain
your own power to refine

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,440
the Golden Millet Dream directly?

4
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,880
Planting the Golden Millet Dream
within someone

5
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,520
takes an enormous
amount of spiritual power,

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,080
and the process
feels like being flayed alive.

7
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,040
You did all this so Ming Yi
could take it directly, didn't you?

8
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Did you really go that far?

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Sorry, Master.

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
I made an oath and promised you

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
not to let
Golden Millet Dream appear again,

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
but

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,320
I must save her.

14
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,680
It's boring if you don't go crazy once.

15
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,720
I… I really don't know what to say.

16
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,240
You said you'd use
the Golden Millet Dream as bait

17
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
to avenge Fairy Bo,

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,120
so you hadn't used it on yourself.

19
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,240
And now, you suddenly
offered it to someone.

20
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,240
You exhausted a lot
of your spiritual power,

21
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
so you probably cannot use
the Spirit Well anymore.

22
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm worried that
you'd suddenly do something rash

23
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
at the Qingyun Tournament,

24
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,200
the Heavenly Grief in
you relapse again suddenly,

25
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,960
but you can't even use the Spirit Well.

26
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,800
So you'll just die suddenly.

27
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,920
If I had known,
I shouldn't have listened to you

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
and killed Ming Yi.

29
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,280
All right.

30
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
It's my first time
hearing you say so many things.

31
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,240
Drink a little.

32
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,400
This is just temporary.

33
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
Spirit Well isn't gone.

34
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't know what to say.

35
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,040
I don't agree
with you and Ming Yi being together.

36
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,600
Now that we have given her
so much as the betrothal gift,

37
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,240
you must marry her no matter what!

38
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
Well said!

39
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
-Do you think I was serious?
-Of course.

40
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,920
I…

41
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
I'm sure she knows everything now.

42
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
I hope she is sensible

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
and will marry
you immediately to repay you.

44
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Buxiu, no one offers a medicine

45
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
and expects the other person
to marry him in return.

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
Besides, why must she repay me?

47
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Did you not even tell her that?

48
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,400
I…

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
You are not giving her
an ordinary medicine.

50
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,520
You are giving her your life!

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,320
Indeed, she doesn't know
it was me who saved her.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,480
She thought it was Situ Ling

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,280
who exchanged his heart's blood
for her lifespan.

54
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
What in the world?

55
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,880
I don't know what to say.

56
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,560
Heart's blood can only extend
one's lifespan for a few hours.

57
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,480
Did she think

58
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
it could repair the spiritual
veins destroyed by Heavenly Grief?

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
My Lord, Ming Yi isn't a fool.

60
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
Why would she believe that?

61
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Situ Ling must have acted
like a magnanimous savior too.

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, that was my heart's blood.
I stabbed myself for you.

63
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
Ming Yi was charmed.
And so touched she was that…

64
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,040
My Lord, have you told Ming Yi
about Situ Ling's real identity?

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
Not yet.

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
I understand.

67
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,280
I'll go and kill Situ Ling now.

68
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,040
What do you understand? Come back.

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
You're not going to tell Ming Yi
Situ Ling's true identity

70
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,840
and you won't allow me to kill Situ Ling.

71
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,120
Now, you're letting Ming Yi think
it was Situ Ling who saved her.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,280
How can you marry her if you do that?

73
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
Ming Yi isn't that kind of person.

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,120
She won't marry someone
because they saved her.

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
It's pointless.

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,120
I want her

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
to marry me willingly.

78
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
I forgot to tell you.

79
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,800
I moved to Shouhua Academy as well
to make training more convenient.

80
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm staying downstairs.

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,760
These are from Granny Xun. Take them.

82
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,640
GLACIER CRYSTAL

83
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,320
ARTIFACT INTRODUCTION

84
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,520
MAGICAL GUQIN INTRODUCTION

85
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
Immortal Ji.

86
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,240
We meet again, old friend.

87
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,200
-Immortal Situ.
-Ming Yi.

88
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
Can I go in?

89
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
Please come in.

90
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,560
Why are you here?

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
I heard Fairy Zhang Tai say
you've moved to Shouhua Academy.

92
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Ming Yi, have you recovered?

93
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,680
Yes.

94
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,840
It's all thanks to you, Immortal Situ.

95
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
You've helped me so much.

96
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,920
I don't know what I can do to repay you.

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
-Tell me…
-Ming Yi.

98
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Your identity will be exposed easily here.
You must leave with me.

99
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
-I can't leave.
-Why?

100
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I promised the Empress
to help her out at Shouhua Academy.

101
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,720
Besides, the tea gathering
will happen soon.

102
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
I can't leave.

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
Ming Yi.

104
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,040
Ming Yi.
You said you were cold last night.

105
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
I prepared a blanket specially for you.

106
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,840
Immortal Situ, you're here too?

107
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
You didn't even tell me we have a guest.

108
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,840
Forgive me for not welcoming you.

109
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,680
Since he's already here,
let's invite him to have a meal together.

110
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,720
Ming Yi, why is he here?

111
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,960
-He is here…
-Of course, I'm here to accompany my wife.

112
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
-What's wrong?
-Ji Bozai.

113
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet, Ming Yi.

114
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,080
The teahouse has a few new dishes.

115
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640
Let me treat you to a meal.

116
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,960
How can we let you treat us?

117
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,680
You are our guest, Immortal Situ.

118
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,040
I should be the one treating you.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
What do you say, Ming Yi?

120
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,120
I…

121
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
I want…

122
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,560
I want both of you to eat without me.

123
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,320
Are you not coming?

124
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,920
Fresh flowers!

125
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,600
Have a look at some fresh flowers, miss!

126
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,360
Have a look at the flowers.

127
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,600
Lanterns!

128
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,200
What a coincidence.
Did you come here to eat, too?

129
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,040
Let's eat together.

130
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,560
The new dishes taste
better than the old ones.

131
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,760
Try them, Ming Yi.

132
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Only two people can sit here.

133
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,760
Why are you still here then?

134
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
Don't you think you're a nuisance?

135
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
Here. This is your favorite.

136
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,360
You should try this instead.

137
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,360
Something that you
haven't tried before is always better.

138
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,520
Let me try it.

139
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,680
It tastes so bad.

140
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,040
It's rancid.

141
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Fine. Enjoy the food.
Don't waste anything.

142
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
I'll be leaving.

143
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
They will pay for me.

144
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
Sure.

145
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,920
Immortal Situ, thanks for paying the bill.

146
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,640
However, I must remind you
that you know who you truly are.

147
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,000
If you insist on
approaching my wife, Ming Yi,

148
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,760
and bring trouble to her,

149
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
I won't forgive you.

150
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,960
What do you mean?

151
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,320
-Sir, pack them for me.
-Sure.

152
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,160
Buy two, get one free!

153
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,760
Final two pairs!

154
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,400
-Thank you.
-Take care.

155
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,600
Sorry.

156
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,560
Watch where you're going!

157
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,680
Fresh flowers!

158
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
Take a look at some fresh flowers!

159
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Excuse me.

160
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,480
Fuyue.

161
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,560
No matter how much I've done

162
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,840
and how long I've waited,

163
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,440
when I see her eyes again,

164
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,800
they

165
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
are still the same as before.

166
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,839
She does not see me.

167
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,560
My Lord,

168
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
I will never betray you.

169
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,880
If you want,
I can share my lifespan with you.

170
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
Is it worth it?

171
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,000
You did so much for Ming Yi,
but it was all in vain.

172
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,720
Have you asked yourself
the same question as well?

173
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,040
I thought it was worth it
in the beginning.

174
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,040
But I asked myself again and again today,

175
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,400
what can I do for her

176
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,840
that I haven't done yet?

177
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,000
I could even give up my life,

178
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,560
but she still

179
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
doesn't care about me.

180
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,920
Who hurt you so badly?

181
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,560
She set up
the Yaoguang Mountain Fire Array.

182
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,480
I duped her
with a secret skill of Yousu Fox Tribe

183
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,600
and made a copy.

184
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
They won't find out.

185
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,360
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS

186
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,720
My Lord,
it's time to think about yourself now.

187
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,120
You can use this
to complete His Majesty's mission

188
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,080
or use it to create
the Golden Millet Dream.

189
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,040
I wanted to use the Golden Millet Dream
and grew spiritual veins in the past

190
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,040
for her.

191
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,080
If I can't be with her,

192
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,240
all of this is meaningless.

193
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Only by obtaining spiritual veins

194
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,000
and rising to a high position

195
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,680
will we not be bullied by anyone else.

196
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
My Lord, you can become
the person you want to become

197
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,640
for your own sake.

198
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,240
Can I?

199
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,000
You're back.

200
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Yes.

201
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,040
I followed Situ Ling
to the cliff by the border.

202
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,480
However, he used a spell
to cover all his tracks.

203
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,440
It's fine.

204
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,000
Go to the tea
gathering with me after this.

205
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,800
Keep a close eye on Zhushui's
and Yaoguang Mountain's movements.

206
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,920
Once they make a move,

207
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
they'll surely give themselves away.

208
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,880
We just need to wait
for them to make a mistake.

209
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,480
At least for now,
Situ Ling bears no malice toward Ming Yi.

210
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,160
Maybe not toward Ming Yi,

211
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,200
but surely toward you.

212
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,240
You really are talking more and more now.

213
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,600
Isn't that good?

214
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
Good.

215
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,600
Very good.

216
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
You feel more human now.

217
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,000
My Lord,
did you experience something good today?

218
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
Even if you don't tell me, I can guess it.

219
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm sure it's related to Fairy Ming Yi.

220
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480
Did Fairy Ming Yi finally decide
to marry you?

221
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,800
I told you so.

222
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,120
Your previous method
of pretending to be cold won't work.

223
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,160
You need to tell her
so she knows your true feelings.

224
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,680
I want to tell her my feelings as well.

225
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,960
If only I had a chance.

226
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,320
What did you say, My Lord?

227
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,120
I said you were right.

228
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,520
You were right.

229
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,760
You haven't fallen for anyone before.

230
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,240
You are clueless about many things.

231
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,600
In my opinion, you should meet

232
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,600
some female dragons,
butterflies, or phoenixes.

233
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,480
Don't be so violent to the point
that you've turned into a fool.

234
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
Take a look.

235
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,040
Take a look, miss.

236
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
-I want this.
-Sure. Let me wrap it up for you.

237
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,200
-Osmanthus cake!
-Come again.

238
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,120
Sure.

239
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,440
Zheng Tiao is such a jerk.

240
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,680
I sent him a total of 200 missives.

241
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,240
Unless he's dead,

242
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,800
why would he reply to me
with just a "I'm fine"?

243
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,160
He's mostly dead.

244
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,120
Tell me. Do you think
he is married already?

245
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,080
Or is he cheating on me?

246
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm Jixing Abyss's fairy.

247
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,480
Am I being lied to by this brat?

248
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,520
-No.
-You won't.

249
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,840
I asked you to drink
but I didn't ask you to get drunk.

250
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,200
-Slowly.
-Be careful.

251
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,520
Mind her head.

252
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,480
-Lie down.
-All right.

253
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,360
You can follow me to the tea gathering
and ask him about it.

254
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,200
How are you getting along with Ji Bozai?

255
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,000
Well…

256
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,200
Well…

257
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,600
I…

258
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,320
The Qingyun Tournament
is the priority now.

259
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,080
The Qingyun Tournament is the priority.

260
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,600
-Men can go away.
-Go away.

261
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,400
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

262
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,840
You should sleep.

263
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,320
Ming Yi, something just came to my mind.

264
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Why don't you join Shouhua Academy
as an official warrior?

265
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,840
There's something wrong with the wine.

266
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
-What?
-My head hurts.

267
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,680
Ming Yi.

268
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,840
Ming Yi.

269
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
Ming Yi!

270
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,560
Master Ming Yi.

271
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Have some tea and take a break.

272
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,920
Chen Xi,
I've always wanted to ask you this.

273
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,760
I didn't take you in as my disciple.
Why do you keep calling me your master?

274
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,120
The Empress said
you came to Shouhua Academy

275
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
to teach me forging.

276
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,640
Therefore, you are my master.

277
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,040
Sit.

278
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,600
There are many warriors
who want to participate in battles.

279
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,640
Why do you want to become a forger?

280
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,320
My brother was also a forger.

281
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,960
He was attacked by Gudiao

282
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,000
when he tried to save his friends

283
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,600
and died in the Qingyun Tournament.

284
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,880
Your brother might no longer be around

285
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,360
but the skills he taught you allow you

286
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,240
to make more
powerful weapons to help others,

287
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,840
so that those with weak spiritual powers

288
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,320
can protect the people they love.

289
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
From today onward,

290
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,640
I will monitor
you daily so you'll work hard

291
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,160
and forge more powerful weapons
to protect Jixing Abyss.

292
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,160
Are you ready?

293
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,320
I'm ready!

294
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,120
Master!

295
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,640
Immortal Situ, you asked for me?

296
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,920
Something urgent happened back home.
I'm here to bid farewell.

297
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,800
Ming Yi,

298
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,280
I expended my heart's blood for you.

299
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,800
Do you appreciate this favor?

300
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,040
-Of course.
-Then, I'm sure you still remember

301
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,200
your promise to me.

302
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,680
Do you now know what you want?

303
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,160
Ming Yi,

304
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,640
is Ji Bozai your final decision?

305
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,400
No. I choose myself.

306
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,920
I can't repay your kindness.

307
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,800
I'll be loyal to you forever,

308
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,200
but we are only friends.

309
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,680
I know you well.

310
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
However,

311
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
I also know

312
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,520
that if it was Ji Bozai before you,

313
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,560
you would never be so decisive.

314
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,800
-This is…
-Don't be nervous, Ming Yi.

315
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,560
To me, you are
the most important person in this world.

316
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
So, I will surely protect you.

317
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,120
Ming Yi,

318
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,880
is Ji Bozai

319
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
your final decision?

320
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,200
No. I choose myself.

321
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,040
If it was Ji Bozai before you,

322
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,040
you would never be so decisive.

323
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,240
My Lord, you did so much for her

324
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,040
yet she only saw it as a favor.

325
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,760
I highly doubt
she treats Ji Bozai the same way.

326
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,920
Enough.

327
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,920
I just want her to be safe.

328
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,040
Is that so?

329
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,360
Ask yourself, My Lord.

330
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,960
Are you sure you just want her to be safe?

331
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,480
There has never been a hopeless romantic
from Zhushui Spiritual State.

332
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,280
Are you sure
you don't want anything in return?

333
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
Chao Yuan.

334
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,520
Can you see your true self now?

335
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,000
Want nothing in return?

336
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,200
That is just your disguise.

337
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,920
Throughout your lowly life,

338
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,360
you've never gotten anything you want.

339
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,240
And that makes
you afraid of admitting what you want.

340
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,040
Ask yourself.

341
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,920
Are you asking for a lot?

342
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,760
Not at all.

343
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,920
You only want her by your side.

344
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,520
If you are as strong as Ji Bozai,

345
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,800
do you think she will reject you?

346
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,480
As long as I can save you,
I can do anything.

347
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,040
Merge with me!

348
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,360
Didn't you feel the power before?

349
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,000
The only thing that can help you
when you're in despair

350
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,440
will always be power!

351
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,160
Merge with me!

352
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,800
Only with my power

353
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,440
can you possess her

354
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,520
and everything you want!

355
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,400
TIGER-SUBDUING SHIELD BLUEPRINT

356
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,120
This will make
the power of the shield stronger.

357
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,080
I need to draw with a smaller brush.

358
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,160
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

359
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm sure I have a smaller brush.

360
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,960
This…

361
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,560
Don't simply come into my room!

362
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
I don't know
when Master She gave this to me.

363
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,239
This…

364
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,760
What is this?

365
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,159
Isn't this yours? Why are you asking me?

366
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,400
I…

367
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,600
Why did I bring it from Yaoguang Mountain?

368
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,040
Twenty-Seven. I saw that.

369
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,400
Why are you picking up
random items all the time?

370
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,199
I haven't reprimanded you
for picking up Ming Xin's shoes.

371
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
What is this? It looks nice.

372
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,000
See? You just pick up all kinds of junk.

373
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,560
Twenty-Seven brought it to me
at Yaoguang Mountain.

374
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,480
Cats like to pick up shiny items.

375
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,960
I don't know what it is. I…

376
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,680
-Why do you have one as well?
-This is a Recording Mirror.

377
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,000
I found my half at Dragon Carp Terrace.

378
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
After Buxiu's investigation,

379
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,280
the name list left behind by Mu Qibai
is this Recording Mirror.

380
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,720
When Mu Qibai made
a deal with the Upper Three Realms,

381
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
he split a Recording Mirror in two.

382
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,480
They'll each keep one half
to keep each other in check.

383
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,520
Immortal Ji, are you saying
that the two pieces we have now

384
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,200
are the Recording Mirror?

385
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Your half must be Mu Qibai's.

386
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,720
Mine is Ming Xin's.

387
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
Twenty-Seven is quite smart.

388
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
Did he just so happen
to steal this from Ming Xin?

389
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,800
Who knows?

390
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,120
Perhaps it's because you are the owner.
The cat is just like its owner.

391
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,080
Although we are still missing one piece,
it's enough to see some things.

392
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,440
The Heavenly Grief you asked for.

393
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,360
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.

394
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
With the Heavenly Grief,

395
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,960
Ming Xian will no longer be
the Warrior God of Yaoguang Mountain.

396
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,240
It was Ming Xin
who made the deal with Mu Qibai.

397
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
I can recognize
his voice even if he is mute,

398
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,120
let alone not seeing his face.

399
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,360
Twenty-Seven is an amazing thief.
He stole this.

400
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
Are you missing something?

401
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,040
It seems like Ming Xin was the one
who poisoned you with Heavenly Grief.

402
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,960
The truth is not surprising at all.

403
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,560
The missing piece of the Recording Mirror
is probably with Ming Xin.

404
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,800
I must get it during
the tea gathering this time

405
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
so that I have complete evidence

406
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,840
to prove that it was
Ming Xin who poisoned me.

407
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,400
Oh, one more thing.

408
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,840
You were grateful
to Situ Ling for saving you

409
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,960
and didn't expose his identity.

410
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,040
I asked Buxiu to find out who he is.

411
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,840
You know everything now?

412
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,160
Yes.

413
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,840
I also found out Situ Ling
is the youngest son of Zhushui's Emperor,

414
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,760
Chao Yuan.

415
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,000
He came to Jixing Abyss
for the Golden Millet Dream.

416
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,280
He saved me after I came out of Wugui Sea.

417
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,160
He told me honestly
that he was from Zhushui Spiritual State

418
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,360
and that he came to
Jixing Abyss for the Golden Millet Dream.

419
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,280
Moreover…

420
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,600
Are you all right?

421
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,800
We must leave here immediately.
Zhushui Spiritual State has a backup plan.

422
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,440
How do you know that?

423
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,160
No wonder he went
to the Sunken Abyss that day

424
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,200
without waiting for us.

425
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,360
He even gave Master She
the Bo's Medical Classics he found.

426
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,600
That was when Master
and I started feeling suspicious.

427
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,280
In that case,
he is still a dangerous person.

428
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,600
You're back.

429
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Father.

430
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,360
I've found the complete
formula for the Golden Millet Dream

431
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
and all the herbs required.

432
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,200
However, the catalyst herb,
Diwu tree's core,

433
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,040
has been extinct for 10,000 years.

434
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,120
I don't know where to find it.

435
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,840
Please aid me, Father.

436
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,400
Do you think I will have something
that has been extinct for 10,000 years?

437
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,280
If it cannot be found
in Zhushui Spiritual State,

438
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,800
then there's no need

439
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,280
for this formula to remain in this world.

440
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,440
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS

441
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,480
Father, I'm the only one
who has read the whole book.

442
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,880
I remember every word in it

443
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,120
and can copy it down any time.

444
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,960
Once I make this medicine,
I'll surely hand it over to you, Father.

445
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,760
Chao Yuan, you've achieved this mastery
with the Thousand Insect Spell.

446
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,080
You are also braver
than you were in the past.

447
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,240
You actually dare negotiate with me.

448
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,880
Great. I like it a lot.

449
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,480
You've laid low for many years.

450
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,120
Tell me what your ambition is.

451
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,880
I want to grow my own spiritual veins

452
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,760
and become the ruler
of Zhushui Spiritual State

453
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,800
that everyone admires.

454
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,440
I want to become
the heir whom you recognize.

455
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,880
I want you to tell me everything.

456
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,360
Under your arrangement,

457
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,240
what will become of
Zhushui Spiritual State

458
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,080
and the Qingyun Tournament?

459
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,040
I want to overcome destiny itself.

460
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,640
Among my sons, you resemble me the most.

461
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,440
Two years ago,
Jixing Abyss lost in the tournament

462
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,120
and had to offer a tribute
to Yaoguang Mountain and our realm.

463
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,400
The rarest of the tributes
were two wilted roots of Diwu tree.

464
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,800
The one offered to Yaoguang Mountain
was stolen by Bo Yulan.

465
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,040
That was why
Bo Yulan was caught by Mu Qibai.

466
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,200
The remaining one was sent to this realm.

467
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,520
It's up to you now
to nurture it back to health.

468
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,240
Thank you, Father.

469
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,800
Come out.

470
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Your Majesty, congratulations
on soon obtaining theGolden Millet Dream.

471
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,680
You may rule over the Six Realms.

472
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,520
There's no need to flatter me.

473
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,600
I summoned you here
to give you an important task.
