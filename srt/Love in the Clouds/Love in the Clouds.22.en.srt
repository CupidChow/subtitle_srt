1
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,840
“ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,280
Now that it has come to this,

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
let's settle our public
and personal grudges together.

4
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,160
Mu Qibai.

5
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,040
When you killed my master back then,

6
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
you should've known
you would end this way.

7
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,000
You tortured and killed countless
innocent people

8
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
and brought netherbeasts
to harm the Six Realms.

9
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,200
The only ending you deserve

10
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
is to have your primordial
spirit turn into ashes

11
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,760
to appease the spirits of those
you've killed.

12
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
You've lost, Mu Qibai.

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,120
You don't deserve to die in my hands.

14
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,720
Quick, everyone! Hide behind us!

15
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,160
Hide behind us, hurry!

16
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,560
Mu Qibai is indeed useless.

17
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
There's no need to worry.

18
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
The netherbeast army will devour
and destroy Jixing Abyss.

19
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Ming Xian, if you are there as well,

20
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,680
you should die with them.

21
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Take care.

22
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
Protect Jixing Abyss with our lives!

23
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

24
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,160
Why?

25
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Why?

26
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
When we were young, didn't we agree

27
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,920
to protect Jixing Abyss together?

28
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,280
For so many years,

29
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,720
the weak can only look up to the strong.

30
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,320
We begged for pity
yet we still wouldn't be treated fairly.

31
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,920
If Jixing Abyss is just barely surviving,

32
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
it might as well be destroyed.

33
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,040
If you were on my side,

34
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,440
we could have gotten more blessings

35
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,200
at the cost of a few lives.

36
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
We could've succeeded!

37
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,360
Foolish!

38
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,800
You brought trouble

39
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,120
and invited danger to our place.

40
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,320
You have no right to decide
other people's lives for them!

41
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Why have the netherbeasts
suddenly become stronger?

42
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,000
Once the netherbeasts go on a rampage,

43
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,280
they won't even obey their master's order.

44
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
They might even strike back
at their master.

45
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,480
When the time comes,
the whole Jixing Abyss

46
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,400
and even the Six Realms
will be in torment.

47
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,200
Is this what you want?

48
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,520
I can rule the Six Realms
with the netherbeasts.

49
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,360
Jixing Abyss will no longer
be bullied by anyone else.

50
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,280
How do you know that I can't succeed?

51
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
You are no longer

52
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,840
the tough brother

53
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,240
who rose to the challenge in my memory.

54
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,240
Why have you become so weak

55
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,200
for the sake of peace?

56
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,360
You're a coward who compromises.

57
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,280
You should've worked with
Zhushui Spiritual State.

58
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
-We could've…
-There's no working together!

59
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,880
If we had done that,

60
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,320
you'd only become a political hostage.

61
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,400
I wanted you to stay by my side

62
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
so I could protect you better.

63
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,000
In the end, I still failed.

64
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Bai.

65
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Can you…

66
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,360
Can you forgive me?

67
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
In the past,

68
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,640
I thought my brother was a great hero

69
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,679
who could rise to greatness.

70
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,559
Now, I have finally realized

71
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,520
that everything

72
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,760
is just a fleeting dream.

73
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
The netherbeasts are going to
devour everyone!

74
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
Hold on!

75
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
Don't give up!

76
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,760
Hold on.

77
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,680
The netherbeasts
have completely lost control.

78
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,640
There's only one way now.

79
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
What if I say,

80
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,320
instead of you protecting me,

81
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
why don't

82
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,080
we protect each other?

83
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,000
Xun Ming mentioned Heartbond Array
in the Illusory Realm.

84
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,720
Ancient tomes also said
that it could seal netherbeasts.

85
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,440
To use the array, the spellcasters
must be of one mind and one heart.

86
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,480
If not,

87
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,920
they will be caught in self-immolation.

88
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
And it's precisely due to this high risk

89
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,440
that no one has practiced it since then.

90
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
If that's what we have to do,

91
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,880
then it's not that complicated.

92
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,240
After all,

93
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,040
we are of the same mind.

94
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,680
-By the purity of my intent.
-May your feelings be stirred true.

95
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,120
The Heartbond Array

96
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
will only succeed when two people
are of the same mind.

97
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
-Radiant deity who subdues evil!
-Radiant deity who subdues evil!

98
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,360
-We die together!
-We die together!

99
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,200
-We live together!
-We live together!

100
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Seal!

101
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,280
Vanquish!

102
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
We've done it!

103
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,360
That's great!

104
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
It's a success.

105
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,840
We survived.

106
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,400
That's great!

107
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,800
The Heartbond Array.

108
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
That's great.

109
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
We did it.

110
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,320
Wonderful!

111
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Ming Yi!

112
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,240
-It's over.
-Great!

113
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,640
Great!

114
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,320
Almost there. Hold on.

115
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,120
Twenty-Seven.

116
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,320
I coughed up blood
because you were rushing me.

117
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,920
How can you
still joke at a time like this?

118
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
Thankfully, there's one petal left.

119
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,760
Ming Yi, we run out of time.

120
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,280
If this goes on, you won't even last
until the Prayer Night is over.

121
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,320
The Heavenly Grief will kill you soon.

122
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,880
I can hold on.

123
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Don't worry.

124
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,280
-I'm still alive.
-How can you still smile?

125
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,480
If something went wrong
when using the Heartbond Array,

126
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,440
the spellcasters would die.

127
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,840
I was so worried.

128
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,760
Thankfully, you and Ji Bozai
are of the same mind.

129
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,680
What's wrong?

130
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,360
-No. I'll go and find Ji Bozai now.
-Twenty-Seven.

131
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,360
and ask him to give
you the Golden Millet Dream.

132
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
Twenty-Seven.

133
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,920
If you

134
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,000
tell him

135
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,960
that I'm doing everything
to stay by his side

136
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,480
just to obtain the Golden Millet Dream,

137
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,160
what will he think of me?

138
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,680
You are different from other people.

139
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,720
Both of you have gone through so much.

140
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
Ji Bozai likes you.

141
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,560
If he knows you are poisoned
by Heavenly Grief,

142
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,480
he will surely save you.

143
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
How are you doing?

144
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,680
I didn't see you just now.

145
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,760
The Heartbond Array exhausted
all my spiritual power

146
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,000
but you don't seem affected. How annoying.

147
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Are you really fine?

148
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
You don't believe me

149
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,280
and asked me twice.

150
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
This is unlike you.

151
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,360
Were you afraid?

152
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
Yes.

153
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,080
For a moment just now,

154
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,080
I thought you had left.

155
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,400
I told you

156
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,520
that you could never escape.

157
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,320
However, if you want to leave,

158
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,480
I won't stop you.

159
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,680
The Prayer Night has just begun.

160
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,040
It'll last for three long nights.

161
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
I'll let you decide.

162
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,120
Father's Blood Moon Ring?

163
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,760
I thought Qibai poisoned me

164
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,040
but it was a drug that made me lose
my spiritual power and faked my death.

165
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,000
It was all my fault for not doing my duty
as his brother to guide him.

166
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,760
Uncle deserved it.

167
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,640
You are not at fault.

168
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,160
Don't be too upset, Father.

169
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,240
Zhushui will never give up now.

170
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,280
So, we must tighten our defenses.

171
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Conflicts between the Six Realms
are showing.

172
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,080
The intensity of
Shouhua Academy's training

173
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
should be increased as well.

174
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
Jixing Abyss can only be proactive

175
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,600
if it maintains its
Upper Three Realms status.

176
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,920
Father,

177
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
I still have one thing to inform you.

178
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,880
I made the announcement

179
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,920
that Soul-hiding Nails
would no longer be planted

180
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
in every fairy of Jixing Abyss
with spiritual veins.

181
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
I will also recruit females into
Shouhua Academy

182
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,040
as warriors.

183
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,160
Is it because of Fairy Ming Yi?

184
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,920
It's not just because of Ming Yi.

185
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,440
I think

186
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,200
fairies who have spiritual veins

187
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,440
haven't done anything wrong.

188
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,840
If people are worried that they
might rebel with a netherbeast army,

189
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
that's even more ridiculous.

190
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
The ones who started a rebellion

191
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,040
were obviously Uncle
and Zhushui Spiritual State.

192
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,280
Yan Xiao had acted as a double agent

193
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,320
for me and Qibai in the last few years.

194
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,800
Qibai made me pass out.

195
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,280
Yan Xiao used his power in secret

196
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,240
to keep me safe.

197
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,960
He didn't tell me but I could feel it.

198
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,200
Perhaps he is not the person
we've seen on the surface.

199
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,720
Yan Xiao might have followed Qibai
for many years,

200
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,120
but he should be spared
from all the punishments

201
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,400
now that he has turned around.

202
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
He no longer needs to feel
bad about his origins

203
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,320
and should only focus on serving
Jixing Abyss.

204
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Tianji,

205
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,360
how I treat him

206
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,560
isn't important.

207
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
The most important thing
is what you think of him.

208
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,800
Your Highness.

209
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,640
The immortals who were attacked by
the netherbeast army

210
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,240
have been attended to.

211
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,840
-Cast your worry aside.
-Do you have something else to say to me?

212
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
When would you ever stop deceiving me

213
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,800
if I hadn't seen you work with Ji Bozai?

214
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
Am I not worthy of your trust?

215
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,680
No, I…

216
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,080
Tianji,

217
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,800
I was born into a low status.

218
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,880
I served Mu Qibai
to repay him for his tutelage.

219
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,560
I also used him to rise higher.

220
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,320
In the beginning, he told me
everything he did

221
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,040
was to make Jixing Abyss truly powerful.

222
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,920
I used to believe in him.

223
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,480
Later,

224
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,240
I saw him doing all
those evil deeds in secret.

225
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,920
I saw how he neglected
the lives of others.

226
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,800
-That was when I knew I was wrong.
-You could've told me then.

227
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,040
We could've come up with a plan together.

228
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,680
Don't you know how dangerous it is
to do things alone?

229
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,280
Or perhaps you don't care about me at all.

230
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,040
I…

231
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,320
He didn't use a flower to cast a spell
to enter previously.

232
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,040
What is he trying to do?

233
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,760
Why are you so surprised?

234
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
You came here to save me back then,
didn't you?

235
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,680
HOU ZHAO

236
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,520
XUN MING

237
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,720
MU QIBAI

238
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,600
Master, may you rest in peace.

239
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
Ming Yi,

240
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,880
I haven't told you about my past

241
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,000
with my master, have I?

242
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,320
Back then, I was in a dire situation

243
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,440
after escaping from the Sunken Abyss.

244
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
However, the Heavenly Grief took effect

245
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
and I almost died.

246
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,960
Coincidentally,

247
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
Master was a wandering doctor
of the Bo family

248
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,160
who gathered herbs and healed others.

249
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,400
She found me,

250
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,720
barely alive, near the Sunken Abyss.

251
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,600
This is a medicine that slows
the poison of Heavenly Grief.

252
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,720
Drink it and you'll feel better.

253
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,480
In the beginning, I didn't believe in her.

254
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,080
However, Master did her best to cure me.

255
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,040
I was grateful

256
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,960
and called her my master.

257
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,000
The Bo family developed Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream,

258
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,200
which caused chaos in the Six Realms.

259
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,200
So, they warned their descendants
not to make them again.

260
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,840
However, Master disobeyed
her ancestral rules

261
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,760
and made the Golden Millet Dream
to save me.

262
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,320
In the end, she died in Mu Qibai's hands.

263
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,880
We were strangers who crossed paths,

264
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,040
but she saved me

265
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,040
and it cost her life.

266
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,040
I couldn't repay her in any way.

267
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,840
Master left a dying wish.

268
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
She would not let anyone obtain
the Golden Millet Dream.

269
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,280
So, I decided to hide the
Golden Millet Dream once and for all.

270
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,760
Later, I made the Spirit Well,

271
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,680
joined the Qingyun Tournament,

272
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
and approached the nobles of Jixing Abyss

273
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,400
to avenge Master.

274
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,000
You went through so many difficulties.

275
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,040
Fortunately,

276
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,920
you've finally avenged your master.

277
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,800
Ming Yi,

278
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,960
there's nothing
I'm hiding from you anymore.

279
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,080
Master.

280
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,680
She is the person
I told you about previously,

281
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,400
Ming Yi.

282
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,840
My wife.

283
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,160
He actually undid the blood seal.

284
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Stupid dragon, use less oil.

285
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,040
If His Lordship is here,
it'll be livelier.

286
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,080
I beg to differ.

287
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,840
Twenty-Seven. Your fish.

288
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,080
Thank you.

289
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,760
You should eat more longan.

290
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,240
Buxiu said you loved grilled fish.

291
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,000
What's wrong? Something's on your mind?

292
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440
Not at all.

293
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,680
Something feels off about you.

294
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,040
How so?

295
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,160
Do people sell lanterns
during the Prayer Night?

296
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
I heard they are pretty.

297
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,920
The lanterns are for the people you love.

298
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,920
Stop dreaming. No one likes you.

299
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,880
What a joke.

300
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,120
Is there anyone who doesn't like cats?

301
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,160
I also heard there are flying dance
performances on the Prayer Night.

302
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,720
Fly for me.

303
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
-Do you want a beating?
-You…

304
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,560
I want to see the fireflies. Can I?

305
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,520
Seriously.

306
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,720
It's the Prayer Night.

307
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,560
It's the grandest festival in Jixing Abyss
every year.

308
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,840
So no lanterns

309
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,800
and no flying dance performance.

310
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,600
I just want to see the fireflies.

311
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm not asking for anything else.

312
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,760
I just want

313
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,280
to see the fireflies in the sky
like bright stars.

314
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,360
There are no such rules
for the Prayer Night.

315
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,200
Don't make them up.

316
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,960
So I can't have this or that.

317
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,120
Did I come to Jixing Abyss just to suffer?

318
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
Why are you here if not to suffer?

319
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,040
Travel around?

320
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,360
-You…
-How annoying.

321
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,960
Granny Xun.

322
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,440
Are you complaining about me as well?

323
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
I…

324
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,280
I can't live here anymore.

325
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,120
Ming Yi,

326
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,440
have you gotten the Golden Millet Dream?

327
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,760
What a childish trick.

328
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,440
He helped His Lordship suppress
the netherbeast army after all.

329
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,600
Whether Ming Xian is a friend or a foe,
we are all on the same side on this.

330
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Before Ming Xian comes back to
retrieve Twenty-Seven,

331
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,240
we can live peacefully with each other.

332
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,960
If Ming Xian comes back,

333
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,920
will he bring Ming Yi away as well?

334
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,000
That wretched Ming Xian.

335
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,000
Dream on!

336
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,440
Fragrance pouches!

337
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,920
Come and take a look.

338
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
Fragrance pouches!

339
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,560
-Pibo shawl!
-Lanterns!

340
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,320
Fairy, get yourself a Pibo shawl.

341
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,000
Take a look.

342
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,360
Pibo shawls!

343
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,000
Ming Yi, it's the Prayer Night.

344
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Unfortunately, I have work to do.

345
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,040
I hope we can still celebrate
the festival together next year.

346
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,200
Here's a Blessing Flower for you.
Situ Ling.

347
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,840
Ming Yi?

348
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,000
Wasn't he addressing you as
Sister Yi previously?

349
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,320
You said you told your master about me.

350
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
What did you tell her?

351
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,080
Do you want to know?

352
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,640
Not really.

353
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,400
Back then, I told her…

354
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,680
I told her

355
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,160
I didn't care about everything
in the past.

356
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Your identity is also not important to me.

357
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm sure that you care about me sincerely.

358
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,240
No matter what happens in the future,

359
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,640
I trust you.

360
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,320
The Grief Blossom only has one petal left

361
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,120
and it is starting to wilt.

362
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,920
Ming Yi, you are running out of time.

363
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,760
Xianxian.

364
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,840
Ruoning!

365
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,639
Miss, which one do you want?

366
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,600
-This item can help you ward off evil.
-Sorry.

367
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,760
Aren't you Zhang Tai?

368
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,880
Did you serve Xun Ming previously?

369
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,639
The general is dead.

370
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,840
How can a widow like you
show yourself in public

371
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,000
and run a stall?

372
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,520
How funny!

373
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,760
Funny?

374
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,679
What's so funny about it?

375
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,880
I like to show myself in public.

376
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,159
-It's none of your business.
-Stop!

377
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,240
Apologize to me!

378
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,760
You…

379
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,760
How could you use your spiritual vein?

380
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,760
Great. You don't have Soul-hiding Nails
in you?

381
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,400
You assaulted her first.

382
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
Whether a fairy has a Soul-hiding Nail
or not is none of your business.

383
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
Stop while you still can.

384
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,560
Thank you.

385
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,600
I am Zhang Tai. You are…?

386
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,720
ZHENG TIAO, WARRIOR OF FLOWING WAVE GORGE

387
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,040
Zheng Tiao.

388
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,560
Immortal Zheng, you are
from Flowing Wave Gorge.

389
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,720
Do you travel to Jixing Abyss often?

390
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,480
Not at all.

391
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,160
However, I heard the stars here are pretty

392
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,600
so I want to take a look during the
Prayer Night.

393
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
That's easy.

394
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,120
Today's weather is good.
Let me show you around.

395
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,960
-Wonderful!
-Wonderful!

396
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,120
Thank you, Your Highness!

397
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,920
Your Highness, thank you
for making the announcement!

398
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Fairies no longer need Soul-hiding Nails
in them.

399
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
We can finally use our spiritual veins

400
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
and have a chance to become warriors!

401
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,080
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Thank you, Your Highness!

402
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,440
Thank you, Your Highness!

403
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,320
Thank you, Your Highness!

404
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,480
Thank you, Your Highness!

405
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
Go and pray for your blessing, everyone.

406
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Thank you, Your Highness!

407
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,960
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Thank you, Your Highness!

408
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,320
May the stars shine forever
and the Blessed Raid befall us.

409
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,080
May the stars shine forever
and the Blessed Raid befall us.

410
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,920
All of them can pray in peace.

411
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,880
Our efforts to protect everything

412
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,240
by sacrificing ourselves are not in vain.

413
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,400
Looking at this,

414
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,800
isn't it worth it?

415
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
I feel it was worth it

416
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
even if I'm not from here.

417
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,400
However, I'm surprised to hear
you ask me that question.

418
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,840
-That's great!
-It's so great!

419
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,040
It's like you are no longer

420
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,360
the Ji Bozai who only cares
about getting revenge.

421
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,880
However, this is not enough.

422
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,520
Zhushui Spiritual State will not give up.

423
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,600
We don't know how many people
in the Six Realms

424
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,880
are involved in this.

425
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,760
After all, everyone wants absolute power.

426
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,000
If we are facing more foes,

427
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
it'll only be more difficult
in the future.

428
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,720
We?

429
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,840
If someone from Yaoguang Mountain
is involved,

430
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,200
will you still hold firm to your beliefs?

431
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,280
You know I won't.

432
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,200
However, I…

433
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,320
I also have my own concerns.

434
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,040
Let's go and have fun.

435
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,280
Just like how we did it
when we were children.

436
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll make a puppet to stand in your stead.

437
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,880
I am

438
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,240
different now.

439
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,960
Right now, I think

440
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,000
protecting them
gives me another form of joy.

441
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,640
Then, I bring the most delicious
Blessing Cake

442
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,680
and the prettiest lantern to you.

443
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,360
I hope my baby can grow up healthy.

444
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,840
Come and make a wish. Hurry.

445
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,680
But you are different.

446
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
If he knows you are poisoned
by Heavenly Grief,

447
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
he will surely save you.

448
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,800
I have something to tell you.

449
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,200
I…

450
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
Mu Qibai is dead.

451
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,600
For that, you avenged Ming Xian
who was poisoned by him.

452
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,440
You owe neither him

453
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,520
nor me.

454
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,720
So, you are free.

455
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,160
I told you

456
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,320
I wanted

457
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,280
an answer after three days.

458
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,400
I also want the truth.

459
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,280
However, I'm afraid…

460
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,880
I thought

461
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I would do everything to make you stay.

462
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,520
However, at this moment,

463
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
I also hate to put you
in a difficult position.

464
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
My Lord,

465
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,880
you are not hiding anything from me now.

466
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,560
Aren't you afraid that
I might want something from you?

467
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,240
What do you want from me?
Golden Millet Dream?

468
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,960
Everyone in the Six Realms
wants my Golden Millet Dream,

469
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,320
except for you.

470
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,600
What if I tell you

471
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,360
that I also want the Golden Millet Dream?

472
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,000
Haven't you seen it already?

473
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,120
In the Spirit Well,

474
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,920
you had so many opportunities to grab it.

475
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,040
No?

476
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,400
Yes.

477
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,720
Why do you trust me so much?

478
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,320
What?

479
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,200
This is…

480
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,080
You gave this to me back then.

481
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,080
Ji Bozai is very cautious.

482
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,840
He will not drink the wine you give him.

483
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,600
It's fine.

484
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,920
He might not drink it now,

485
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
but he might in the future.

486
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,080
I thought you didn't drink something
given to you by outsiders.

487
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,040
That's not true.

488
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,160
What do you mean?

489
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,280
It's not from an outsider.

490
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,760
I've kept the wine for so long.

491
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,000
I finally have the chance

492
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,080
to drink with you now.

493
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,120
What? Did you drug the wine?

494
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,760
I did.
