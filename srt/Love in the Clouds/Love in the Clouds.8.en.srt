1
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
<i>LOVE IN THE CLOUDS</i>

2
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,760
YOUNG SITU LING

3
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
YOUNG MING XIAN

4
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,520
Why are you sitting here alone?

5
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
I… I can't get in.

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
Didn't your parents buy you a ticket?

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,040
I came secretly.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,360
My father never brought me
to Qingyun Tournament.

9
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,960
Why?

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,320
Because…

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm useless.

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm the only one in my family
without spiritual veins.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,520
They all look down on me.

14
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,480
Forget about standing on
the Qingyun Tournament stage.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm not even worthy of watching a match.

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,680
Kid. Lift your head for me.
Who said you're useless?

17
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
Isn't it true?

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Without spiritual veins,

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,400
I'll never have anything to do
with Qingyun Tournament.

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,840
But I really admire Warrior God Ming Xian.

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,840
I know a lot about him,
but I've never seen one of his matches.

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,240
He joined the tournament at 13
and never lost a single match.

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm 13 this year too.

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
But I'm just a useless person.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Don't be sad.

26
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,480
Come on, I'll take you inside.

27
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,040
So just because
you don't have spiritual veins,

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
your older brothers bully you?

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
Your father only takes
them to see Qingyun Tournament

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
but never takes you?

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,880
What kind of father and brothers are they?

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,440
Forget it.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,520
I have a younger brother,
who's no good either.

34
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,840
You're amazing.

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,880
It's a pity I was born
without spiritual veins.

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
I'll never have the chance

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
to become someone like all of you.

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Can I borrow this for a while?

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,920
You can,

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,600
but you must take good care of it.

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Alright.

42
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,280
In today's tournament of two realms,

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
it's Yaoguang Mountain
against Jixing Abyss.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,480
Warriors of the two realms,
enter Zhuojin Tower!

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,959
Wait. I'll win this match for you.

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,279
- Ming Xian!
- Ming Xian!

47
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
Ming Xian is amazing!

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,960
- Ming Xian!
- Ming Xian!

49
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,160
Ming Xian will win!

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he's actually Warrior God Ming Xian!</i>

51
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Ming Xian!

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Ming Xian!

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,960
Bad news.

54
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,160
This warrior's artifact
can restrain Ming Xian's armor.

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,320
Is Ming Xian about to lose?

56
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Ming Xian.
My artifact can counter your armor.

57
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,600
- Ming Xian!
- Ming Xian!

58
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
JUDGMENT HALL

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Did you come for me?

60
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,480
Well… could we talk?

61
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,880
Of course.

62
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,560
I've been waiting for you.

63
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,240
Immortal Situ.

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,800
I came today just to…

65
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
to thank you.

66
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
Ming Yi. I recognized you.

67
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,200
Do you still remember this?

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,960
- This is…
- Don't be nervous.

69
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,720
In this world, you matter the most to me.

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,360
So I will protect you well.

71
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,120
Can I borrow this for a while?

72
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,280
You can,
but you must take good care of it.

73
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,080
That's why I recognized
you right away that day.

74
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
Immortal Situ, you're mistaken.

75
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm just an ordinary attendant
in Moonlit Blossoms.

76
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,680
I saw Fairy Ruo Shui in danger that day,
and cast a spell at random.

77
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,680
Somehow I luckily saved her.

78
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,960
I must still thank Immortal Situ
for helping me that day.

79
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,280
Are you unwilling to acknowledge me?

80
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,600
You really have the wrong person.

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
I know.

82
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't worry.

83
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,559
I won't tell anyone.

84
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Sorry to disturb you today.
I'll take my leave first.

85
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,760
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

86
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,160
It's just that
we're about to leave Jixing Abyss.

87
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
So I wanted to tell you something.

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,240
If it weren't for you, Father…

89
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Hou Zhao…

90
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,480
The bewitching spell Hou Zhao cast on me

91
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,760
would probably… have made me a sacrifice.

92
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

93
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,360
It's nothing more than an exchange
of interests between you and me.

94
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,800
You need not feel any gratitude toward me.

95
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,920
No need to thank me.

96
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,560
You're always doing this.

97
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,800
But I know

98
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,520
that you're really kind.

99
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,280
You're escorting me out even now.
Aren't you?

100
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,000
It was the deal we made.

101
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,440
Escorting you away will complete our deal.

102
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
What are you doing?

103
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,200
I ate Moonshade Grass.
My Withered-Branch Disease is cured.

104
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,200
So I want to give this
to Immortal Ji as a gift.

105
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,440
That won't be necessary.

106
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,520
Your Lordship, that's impolite.

107
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
Could she really
think of me as her savior?

108
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,640
From beginning to end,
I was only using her.

109
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,440
You call that "using"?

110
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,600
But didn't you tell me
to give her Moonshade Grass

111
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,080
before she exposed Hou Zhao?

112
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,640
That's right.

113
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,320
So that's what you call "using"?

114
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
General Xun Ming has come to visit.

115
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,640
Forgive our lack of hospitality.

116
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,840
You know me?

117
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,280
Lord Hanfeng told me you would be coming.

118
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,520
I do have an urgent matter
that requires Judgment Hall's attention.

119
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
An urgent matter?

120
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Lord Hanfeng summoned me earlier.

121
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,640
He's concerned about the netherbeast
that appeared at Shouhua Academy.

122
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,480
This matter still requires investigation.

123
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,080
Investigation takes time.
That I understand.

124
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,800
But Lord Hanfeng worries

125
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,600
that netherbeasts have vanished
from the Six Realms for 100 years.

126
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
If they've truly reappeared,

127
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,320
Jixing Abyss and even the entire
Six Realms will be in great trouble.

128
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,720
So Lord Hanfeng hopes
to speed up the investigation.

129
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Ideally, we should
investigate door-to-door

130
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,560
to check whether there
are any traces of a netherbeast.

131
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,120
Ji Bozai must have
Golden Millet Dream in his possession.

132
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,080
Lord Hanfeng secretly investigated
Wugui Sea multiple times

133
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,520
but found nothing.

134
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Why not let Judgment Hall

135
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,920
investigate openly
and aboveboard this time?

136
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,320
This artifact can accurately locate
the position of Golden Millet Dream.

137
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,720
Once it's found,
I will retrieve it immediately.

138
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,560
This artifact is Zhu…

139
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,080
It's specifically crafted
by Lord Hanfeng's command.

140
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,360
It can accurately
detect a netherbeast's aura.

141
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,720
Please use this artifact

142
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,920
and search door-to-door
to check for any signs of a netherbeast.

143
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,040
This way, Lord Hanfeng can rest easy.

144
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Understood.

145
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,200
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

146
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Now that you have someone you love,
you no longer cherish women.

147
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,720
I'm just joking with you.

148
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,120
It seems the legend
of Yousu Fox Tribe is true.

149
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
You really are hard to kill.

150
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
Because of Ming Yi,

151
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,000
you won't even visit
Moonlit Blossoms anymore.

152
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,480
And the one time you do,
you make fun of me and even kill me.

153
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,280
Immortal.
You strangled me so hard that it hurt.

154
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,520
How could you treat me like that?

155
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,880
What exactly do you want to do?

156
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,880
Tell me how one can kill Yousu Fox Tribe.

157
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,840
You want me to betray my tribe's secret?

158
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,440
You really underestimate me.

159
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,400
How would I dare look down
on the owner of Moonlit Blossoms?

160
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,240
Do you think I'm sincere now?

161
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,760
To betray my tribe
would be to kill my own conscience.

162
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,360
With my character,

163
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,680
I still wouldn't agree
even if you kill me.

164
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,840
Unless the compensation

165
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,400
is triple the amount you offered here.

166
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,240
Deal.

167
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
Even the most powerful Yousu Fox

168
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,360
uses simple methods
to hide their primordial spirit.

169
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,680
As long as you find
the memory each fox treasures most,

170
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,200
you can then find their true body
hidden within Illusory Realm

171
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,120
and kill them.

172
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,640
No wonder you're not afraid to tell me.

173
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,880
Even if I know
how to deal with a Yousu Fox,

174
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,280
it wouldn't work on you.

175
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
Not necessarily.

176
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,680
How do you know

177
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,040
that my most treasured memory
isn't related to you?

178
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
You must have
deliberately revealed this to me.

179
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,000
How could you tell me
Yousu Fox Tribe's secret so easily?

180
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,320
Let me speak frankly.

181
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,560
The times are changing.

182
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,840
Business isn't easy anymore.

183
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,840
There's word
that you will marry Princess Tianji

184
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,560
and inherit Jixing Abyss.

185
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,960
I merely want to place my bet on you.

186
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,040
Why has Judgment Hall
suddenly come to Wugui Sea?

187
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,280
I made it very clear
that His Lordship is not here.

188
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,160
No outsiders may enter without permission.

189
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,079
No matter who comes today,
the answer is the same.

190
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,640
Then I can only apologize.

191
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,359
Lord Hanfeng has ordered it.

192
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,480
A netherbeast has appeared.

193
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,839
It concerns the safety of Jixing Abyss,

194
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,599
so every household must be searched

195
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,360
to see if there are
traces of a netherbeast.

196
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
All residences in Jixing Abyss
have been searched, except Wugui Sea.

197
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
We can't give you special treatment.
Judgment Hall must check.

198
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,240
What are you doing?

199
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
Stop. Don't fight!

200
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,720
Stand down.

201
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
Are you alright?

202
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,240
You two really protect me well.

203
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,120
Granny Xun.

204
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,560
Immortal Situ already said a netherbeast's
appearance is no small matter.

205
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,560
Besides, it's Lord Hanfeng's order.

206
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Every household in
Jixing Abyss must be searched.

207
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,480
If we insist on refusing,

208
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,440
wouldn't we be
causing trouble for Lord Ji?

209
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,000
No, His Lordship isn't here…

210
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,000
We should prove
Lord Ji's innocence even more.

211
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,000
Immortal Situ, please.

212
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,000
Where do you live in Wugui Sea?

213
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,480
That's a private matter.

214
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,080
I see.

215
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,520
Where do you live in Wugui Sea?

216
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,320
Over there.

217
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,320
And where does Immortal Ji live?

218
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
You don't need to whisper like that.

219
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
Where does Immortal Ji live then?

220
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Ming Yi.

221
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,720
Why exactly did you come here?
Is it to kill Ji Bozai?

222
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,400
I also think
he doesn't deserve to beat you.

223
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
You're not wrong about that.

224
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,760
I mean I'm not that person,
but what you said is right.

225
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,920
Ming Yi.

226
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Are you having a good life here?

227
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,480
Judgment Hall
doesn't need to care about that.

228
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm not asking as
someone from Judgment Hall.

229
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,680
You must have gone through a lot
that you can't tell me.

230
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,080
I just want to know one thing.

231
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,320
Are you… doing well?

232
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Lord Hanfeng has given orders today.
I must come.

233
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,400
Only in this way
can you stay out of trouble.

234
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,000
What's this?

235
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,440
An artifact specially
made by Lord Hanfeng.

236
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,320
It's said to be able to detect
the aura of netherbeasts precisely.

237
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
<i>That's the direction of Spirit Well.</i>

238
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,400
<i>We can't let them find it.</i>

239
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,360
- Isn't that Immortal Ji's treasury?
- Treasury?

240
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Over there.

241
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,920
<i>How could there be</i>
<i>netherbeasts in Wugui Sea?</i>

242
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,480
<i>Mu Qibai must be using</i>

243
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,600
<i>the search for netherbeasts</i>
<i>as an excuse to find Golden Millet Dream.</i>

244
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,920
<i>We must find a way to drive them off.</i>

245
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,080
The treasury holds
Immortal Ji's most precious artifacts.

246
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,080
They must be kept from fire and light.

247
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,240
If anything happens,
we'll all be dead when he returns.

248
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,600
Immortal Situ. That won't do.
We can't see anything.

249
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,760
No. I said no firelight!

250
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,960
Ming Yi, are you alright?

251
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,560
Ming Yi, are you alright?

252
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,000
Are you all okay?

253
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,040
- We're fine.
- We're fine.

254
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,960
But Immortal, this won't work.

255
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,280
We need light.

256
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,160
Then light the fire. Light it up.

257
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
No. These artifacts fear fire.
We can't light any fire.

258
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,440
I beg you not to light any fire.

259
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,600
Immortal Situ,
I'll light things up for you.

260
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,480
Run!

261
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,040
Go!

262
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Immortal Ji's treasures!

263
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,200
What do you all mean by this?

264
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
I told you that our artifacts fear fire.

265
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,720
Yet you still lit a fire!

266
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Was it you? Was it you who lit the fire?

267
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,680
Why are you so defiant?

268
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,440
- Did you do it on purpose?
- Ming Yi. Calm down.

269
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,840
- Calm down, Ming Yi.
- No, Granny Xun.

270
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
It's all gone. What am I going to do?

271
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,960
How do I explain this to Immortal Ji?

272
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,880
- I'll fight you all.
- Ming Yi.

273
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,600
Stop being angry.

274
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,760
What kind of world is this?

275
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,000
This was the only artifact in
the world that can track netherbeasts.

276
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
And it just burned to ashes.

277
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,480
This was also
the only lotus lamp in the world.

278
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,000
This was the only
Diamond Demon-Subduing Pestle.

279
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,240
And the only boomerang in the world.

280
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,720
How are you going to compensate me?

281
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,560
How do I explain this to Immortal Ji?

282
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
I…

283
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,080
I've lost everything.

284
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,840
Fairy Ming Yi.

285
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,600
This is Judgment Hall's fault.

286
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,320
But your injuries can't be ignored.

287
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,960
How about this?

288
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,440
Let's find a clean place.

289
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
How about I treat your wounds for you?

290
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,840
I'll help you hold this.

291
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,120
So this is where you live.

292
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
What are your plans?

293
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,080
The reason I came today
is to see how you've been doing

294
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,680
and because Lord Hanfeng has always
had ulterior motives toward you.

295
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,720
If he really has some scheme in mind,

296
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,400
rather than letting
someone else handle it,

297
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,960
it's better that I do it myself.

298
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,280
What do you mean by
"it's better that you do it yourself"?

299
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
My Lord.

300
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,040
You're finally back.

301
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,320
They're bullies. Look at me.

302
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600
Immortal Situ. What's going on?

303
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,520
I was acting under Lord Hanfeng's orders

304
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,840
to search for traces of netherbeasts
near Jixing Abyss.

305
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,640
If Judgment Hall wants to search,
then search.

306
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,120
But what's with setting fire to my home?

307
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
My apologies. It was an accident.

308
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,160
I accidentally caused the fire.

309
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,040
Accidentally?

310
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,120
You accidentally
burned all my treasured artifacts

311
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
and accidentally injured my family.

312
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Family?

313
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,360
Family.

314
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,360
This is the only lotus lamp,

315
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,040
the only Diamond Demon-Subduing Pestle

316
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,600
and the only single
throwing dart in the world.

317
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
Sir.

318
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
How do you plan to compensate me?

319
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,280
Single throwing dart?
It's not coming back?

320
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,760
My Lord.

321
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,760
Smell if I'm practically roasted through.

322
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,240
You were too careless.

323
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,720
What do you intend to do to my person?

324
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,160
She has no title or rank.
How is she yours?

325
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Did you buy her?

326
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,720
I'll pay ten times the price. Let her go.

327
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,200
In your dreams.

328
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,360
Let go. Let go.

329
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,520
Ouch.

330
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,960
Did I grab you too hard?

331
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm fine.

332
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
Wait.

333
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I accidentally burned down your home.

334
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
I deeply apologize.

335
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,560
I'll compensate for all your losses.

336
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
That won't be necessary.

337
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm sorry.
It was the one who ruined the treasury.

338
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,440
It's only right that Immortal Ji was angry
and took it out on me.

339
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,040
It's alright, Ming Yi.

340
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,280
<i>He looks upset.</i>

341
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,240
<i>Could he be mad</i>
<i>that I burned down his treasury?</i>

342
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,600
My Lord, here's what happened.

343
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,360
Immortal Situ said he was ordered
to search for traces of netherbeasts.

344
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,080
I thought you would definitely have
nothing to do with netherbeasts.

345
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,960
And if I insisted on stopping him,
others would surely misunderstand.

346
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,720
So I let Immortal Situ search.

347
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,920
Who would've thought
his artifact would react to the treasury?

348
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,520
So I figured
this netherbeast thing must be a cover-up.

349
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
The artifact must've
been looking for something else.

350
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,960
Well… I didn't dare to ask you directly.

351
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,880
My Lord.

352
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,120
We're now in the same boat.

353
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,040
When you're not home,
I have to guard Wugui Sea for you.

354
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,240
Right?

355
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,960
Why are you defending Situ Ling?

356
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,560
Are you familiar with him?

357
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,960
You two aren't working together, are you?

358
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

359
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
Say something.

360
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
<i>He's mad about this?</i>

361
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,520
My relationship with you isn't ordinary.

362
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,640
If this were before,
he would've doubted me, no matter what.

363
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,320
But now this sounds more like jealousy.

364
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,840
Do you really mind other men that much?

365
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,040
How about this? My Lord.

366
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,240
Why don't you marry me
and form a heart imprint with me?

367
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,880
No other man will come looking for me.

368
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,600
- Not a single honest word.
- My Lord, I'm serious.

369
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,640
I thought it was enough
just to stay by your side.

370
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
But now…

371
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,520
I've become greedier.

372
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,080
I want to be your wife.

373
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,800
A loving and loyal wife

374
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,680
who's rightful.

375
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,040
Would that be alright?

376
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,440
<i>Looks like there's hope.</i>

377
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,600
Your Lordship.

378
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,120
Fuyue. You took in a dancer named Ming Yi.

379
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,120
Why didn't you tell me?

380
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,000
You summoned me just to ask about this?

381
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,120
Moonlit Blossoms
gets new dancers every day.

382
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
What's so special about Ming Yi?

383
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,960
She's the one I've been telling you about.
I finally found her.

384
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,400
She is… Ming Xian?

385
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,200
How could that be possible?

386
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,880
Ming Xian, a fairy?

387
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
Your Lordship, perhaps you're mistaken?

388
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,200
No, it's definitely her.

389
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,760
I thought she was
a man for many years too.

390
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,200
You seem quite happy about it.

391
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,480
Yes. If you hear any news of her,
you must inform me immediately.

392
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,200
Understood.

393
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,120
By the way,

394
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,320
Mu Qibai sent someone
to persuade me to search Wugui Sea.

395
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,360
He said this artifact could
detect the aura of netherbeasts.

396
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,840
But I can't shake the feeling
that it's not that simple.

397
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,280
The compass has already been destroyed.

398
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,120
Whatever Mu Qibai was planning,
it's all ruined now.

399
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,920
It seems staying by Ji Bozai's side
is quite dangerous for her.

400
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,560
I used to think that working in
Judgment Hall was difficult.

401
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,760
I even regretted choosing this place.

402
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,800
But thinking back,

403
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,080
I'm glad I'm part of Judgment Hall.

404
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
At least I can help Ming Yi.

405
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,520
Didn't you only plan to stay
in Judgment Hall to muddle along

406
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,840
and search for Golden Millet Dream?

407
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,240
Your Lordship.

408
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,080
Ming Yi belongs to Ji Bozai.

409
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,160
Mu Qibai wants to go against Ji Bozai.

410
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,120
If you help Ming Yi,

411
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,480
you'll be standing against Mu Qibai.

412
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,520
So what?

413
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,120
She's the only light
in all my miserable past.

414
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,440
As long as I can help her,
I have nothing to fear,

415
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,920
even if I must defy the Six Realms.

416
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,920
Did you summon me just to ask all this?

417
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,000
Are you done asking?

418
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,600
I will now take my leave.

419
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,719
<i>I won using the sleeve badge you gave me.</i>

420
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>It has already reached</i>
<i>Totem Platform before you.</i>

421
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,239
<i>As long as you have the will,</i>
<i>nothing can hold you back.</i>

422
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,520
<i>Even without spiritual veins,</i>

423
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,960
<i>perhaps one day</i>
<i>you could create spiritual veins yourself.</i>

424
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,360
<i>Or maybe you could change the rule</i>
<i>that only those born with spiritual veins</i>

425
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,280
<i>can compete as warriors.</i>

426
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,440
<i>Someday, you'll become very strong too.</i>

427
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,000
Can…

428
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,199
I really?

429
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,000
<i>From the moment you were born,</i>
<i>you were everything I wished I could be.</i>

430
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,960
<i>I want to find Golden Millet Dream</i>
<i>to grow spiritual veins,</i>

431
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,320
<i>so I can become as strong as you</i>

432
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,360
<i>and one day protect you.</i>

433
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,120
<i>Since you vanished from Yaoguang Mountain,</i>
<i>I've been searching for you.</i>

434
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,800
<i>Now, I've finally found you.</i>

435
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,160
As ordered by General Xun Ming,

436
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,080
we placed one of our men
in Situ Ling's search of Wugui Sea.

437
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,640
They did see the artifact pointing
to Ji Bozai's treasury.

438
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,200
Later, it went just as I reported earlier.

439
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,920
That Ming Yi ruined everything.

440
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,200
It seems Ji Bozai's
people are really vigilant.

441
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,760
They even came up with a way

442
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,920
to sabotage our plan
and burn the compass at the same time.

443
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,280
Maybe the two of them
already knew each other.

444
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,480
Perhaps when they met at Moonlit Blossoms,

445
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,440
Ji Bozai was just
putting on a show for us.

446
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,400
That woman must know something.

447
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,800
Go to Moonlit Blossoms
and investigate that woman.

448
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,680
Watch your step.

449
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,520
Is this your first visit here?

450
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,840
You look unfamiliar.

451
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,120
Since you're a new guest,
let me offer you a pot of wine.

452
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,600
You're a fellow tribesman.

453
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,120
I've long heard the owner here
is also of the You Su tribe.

454
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,800
I came today to inquire about something.

455
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,640
Please ask freely.

456
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,920
I will tell you all I know.

457
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,240
I heard that Moonlit Blossoms
once had an attendant named Ming Yi,

458
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,280
who was later taken home
by Immortal Ji of Shouhua Academy.

459
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,400
I'd like to know

460
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,800
when exactly Fairy Ming Yi
first arrived at Moonlit Blossoms.

461
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,600
She…

462
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,800
Ming Yi…

463
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,080
- Good!
- Good!

464
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,240
What a wonderful dance!

465
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Her dancing is absolutely top-notch.

466
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,240
Immortal.

467
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,320
This fairy's name is Zhang Tai.

468
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,000
A treasure I found
from the East Sea of Jixing Abyss.

469
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,040
She descends from the Jingwei tribe

470
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,000
and is the best dancer here.

471
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,120
Her music skills are also unmatched.

472
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Her name's…

473
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,600
Zhang Tai?

474
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
Here.

475
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,920
His Lordship said
you may handle all this as you please.

476
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,760
He's giving them to me again?

477
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,680
- You don't want them? Forget it then.
- I'm very grateful.

478
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,240
Ji Bozai really has strange habits.

479
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,120
You do his errands, and he just pays you.

480
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,640
How much can a warrior like him even earn?

481
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,400
No idea.

482
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,560
Whatever it is,

483
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,960
you can be sure
that he spends it all on women.

484
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
When he used to
pretend to be a ladies' man,

485
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,080
he probably spent plenty on women.

486
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,080
Now he spends them all on you.

487
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
Why's that?

488
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,840
He's thanking you
for helping him get rid of Situ Ling?

489
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,120
I think he's declining me.

490
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,600
Because I told him
I wanted to be his rightful wife.

491
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
But he can't marry me,

492
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,440
so he gives me
these gifts to brush me off.

493
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,440
That's not so bad.

494
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,200
At least he won't think
you've got hidden motives. Right?

495
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,440
But after all we've done,
he still refused.

496
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,320
What should we do next?

497
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,360
Without marrying him,
we can't enter Spirit Well.

498
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,080
Without entering Spirit Well,
how long will it take

499
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,840
to get Golden Millet Dream
and save your life?

500
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,360
I have to be useful enough
to make him marry me.

501
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,880
I must finish what's before us first.

502
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,480
How's your investigation of Xun Ming?

503
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,480
No valuable news so far.

504
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,240
But I did find something earth-shattering
that I must tell you.

505
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,040
Your good friend,
Zhang Tai, is getting married.

506
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,960
Why are you laughing?

507
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,200
Twenty-Seven. I'm sorry.

508
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,720
I haven't taken good
care of you these days.

509
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,640
- It's alright.
- Look at you.

510
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,200
Your fur's all split.

511
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,000
And your claws haven't even been trimmed.

512
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,360
Did you gnaw them yourself?

513
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,400
How smelly.

514
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,120
Your ears must be all matted too.

515
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,760
You've probably hurt your hearing.
Let me check for you.

516
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,320
Are you kidding me right now?

517
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,760
Don't talk nonsense. I'm very clean.

518
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Sometimes I bathe three times a day.

519
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,680
No, I'm telling the truth.

520
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,040
Zhang Tai really is getting married.

521
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,320
If you don't believe me,
go to Moonlit Blossoms and ask.

522
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,600
Impossible.

523
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,240
How could Zhang Tai get
married without telling me?

524
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm her best…

525
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,640
Really?

526
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,920
My Lord, I want to go out.

527
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
What's the hurry? Where are you going?

528
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,800
I want to go back for a bit.

529
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,400
My good friend Zhang Tai,
the one you've met.

530
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,920
She's suddenly getting married
and didn't even tell me.

531
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,360
- I must go and find out what's going on.
- Who is she marrying?

532
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,920
I only heard he's also of Yousu Fox Tribe,
same as Ms. Fuyue.

533
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,920
I'll go with you.

534
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,640
By the way, since she's your friend,
did you prepare a gift?

535
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,440
Of course I did.

536
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,320
I plan to give all the jewelry
you gave me to Zhang Tai.

537
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,880
It seems you really are friends.

538
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,600
Your Lordship, why are you accompanying
Ming Yi to Moonlit Blossoms?

539
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,480
Zhang Tai is marrying
someone from Yousu Fox Tribe.

540
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,040
In the whole divine
capital of Jixing Abyss,

541
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,640
there are only a few Yousu Foxes.

542
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Xun Ming?

543
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,000
Mu Qibai and the others

544
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,440
have always worried
the Sunken Abyss affair would be exposed.

545
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,040
Ming Yi's parents died
from Blood Pearl Bloom poison.

546
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,640
And she exposed
it publicly to seek justice.

547
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,120
Clearly, Ming Yi isn't on their side.

548
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,320
That makes her even safer and more useful.

549
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,240
If Zhang Tai really is marrying Xun Ming,

550
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,880
we can use
Ming Yi's relationship with Zhang Tai

551
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,760
to get close to Xun Ming
and find a way to kill him.

552
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,400
It seems I've overlooked.

553
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,880
It turns out these past few days,

554
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,200
you've nearly given away
all of Wugui Sea's wealth to Ming Yi,

555
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,080
just to win her over.

556
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,280
You're truly wise.
