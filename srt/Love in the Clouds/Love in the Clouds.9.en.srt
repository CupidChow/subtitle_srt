00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,360
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG
SHUANG'S "LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,760
A FEW MONTHS AGO

4
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,560
Ming Yi.

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
Ming Yi.

6
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
What talent.

7
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
Truly one of a kind.

8
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
All these years at Moonlit Blossoms,

9
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,680
I've never seen
a dance as unique as yours.

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
You've practiced it countless times!

11
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,200
How can you still not
remember a few simple moves?

12
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,600
Madam, go easy on her.

13
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,720
It's my fault.

14
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,160
I taught her the wrong steps last night.

15
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
Zhang Tai,

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,800
you've always been the best dancer here.

17
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
You never make mistakes.

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
You're saying this

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,040
just to protect the newcomer, aren't you?

20
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,800
Do you think I won't punish you

21
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,400
because I favor you?

22
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Go. Both of you.
Pour a bucket over yourselves.

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,040
I just recovered from illness last month.

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,720
If I fall sick again,

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Immortal Xue,
Immortal Hao, and Immortal Liu

26
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,400
won't get to see me.

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,240
Don't blame me if
you lose business because of it.

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,800
You're getting
far too bold for your own good.

29
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,760
Don't push your luck.

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,680
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

31
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
Madam,

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm a bad dancer and
haven't practiced enough.

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
It's my fault.

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,680
Moonlit Blossoms has
always rewarded and punished fairly.

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,640
Don't break the rules because of me.

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,640
EPISODE 9

37
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,000
- Immortal Ji.
- Immortal Ji.

38
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,040
My apologies, fairies.

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm here today for…

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
Who?

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
Her?

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm here with
Fairy Ming Yi to get something done.

43
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
How dull.

44
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Take this.

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
- Eat it yourself.
- Here.

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,360
I got my hopes up for nothing.

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
Seriously?

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,440
Even if there's no deal,
we can part on good terms.

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
Not even a word to make me stay?

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,920
Want some snacks?

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,640
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

52
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,320
So pretty.

53
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,560
How lovely.

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,240
- Zhang Tai, you're so kind.
- What a big pearl.

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,640
And these jade pieces are so exquisite.

56
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm getting married.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,960
General Xun Ming said you could

58
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,800
pick whatever you like from these gifts.

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,840
Zhang Tai,
you're marrying General Xun Ming?

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
Why didn't you tell me?

61
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Immortal Ji, what are you holding?

62
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Some snacks for you.

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

64
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
You're welcome.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Now that I'm engaged,

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,960
I shouldn't visit
Moonlit Blossoms anymore.

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
But since we've
been sisters all these years,

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,960
even if we won't see each other again,

69
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,280
I want to say goodbye properly.

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Zhang Tai,
your general treats you so well.

71
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,960
No wonder you fell for him.

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Yes. He's learned, courteous,

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
honest, and loyal.

74
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,400
Since when do you praise men like that?

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,000
You used to say things like,

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
"He's so handsome."

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,760
- "He's so tall."
- "He's so rich."

78
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,120
"I wish he'd do my eyebrows."

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,120
Take your time choosing your gift.

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
I must return to serve the general now.

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Wait.

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,280
Zhang Tai, how's your wrist injury?

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,280
Have you been using
the medicine I gave you?

84
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
It's much better. Thank you, Ming Yi.

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
Ming Yi, what's wrong?

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,080
Her injury isn't on her wrist.
It's on her back.

87
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,320
She is not Zhang Tai.

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
There's a puppet
mark on the back of her neck.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,120
That wasn't the real Zhang Tai.

90
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,680
It was a puppet made in her likeness.

91
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,800
Then where's the real Zhang Tai?

92
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,080
To make a puppet
move like a certain person,

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
one has to extract
the seven senses from the person.

94
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
Only then can the puppet look convincing.

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Once the three souls and
seven senses are extracted,

96
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
the person will die

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
within 15 days.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Ming Yi, Immortal Ji,

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,680
is there any way to save Zhang Tai?

100
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
She was always so kind.

101
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,040
Every time the Mistress punished me,
she took the beating for me.

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,160
When Xianxian's family was in trouble,
she gave her money.

103
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
The Jingwei Tribe is wiped out.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,760
Zhang Tai has no family in this world.
We must help her.

105
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,120
Yes, please help her.

106
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
A bit higher.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,520
No… I'm exhausted.

108
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,040
Hungry?

109
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
How could I not be?

110
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
I haven't eaten in days.

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
Why haven't you eaten?

112
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
I ran out of money.

113
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,600
How's that possible?
You always get the biggest tips.

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,400
I just lost my appetite. That's all.

115
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,200
You're lying, aren't you?

116
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,840
Last time at the Huansha Market,
you bought me an eyebrow pencil.

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,120
It was so expensive.
Did you spend all your money on it?

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,200
You're overthinking it.

119
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,760
You liked it, didn't you?

120
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,039
Come on. It's no big deal. Stop pouting.

121
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,280
You could hang an oil bottle off that lip.
Not cute at all.

122
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,920
- Are you ticklish?
- No.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,560
Then what are you afraid of?

124
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,560
Stop it! Stop!

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
- I'm ticklish!
- You call this not ticklish?

126
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
I am!

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,160
Ow…

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,720
- My back hurts… It hurts.
- Are you all right?

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,560
- Does it really hurt?
- Just messing with you.

130
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,480
- What's this?
- Scallion pancake.

131
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,720
I don't want it.

132
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,680
Then what do you want?

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,760
Roast duck.

134
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
You're a bird. You can't eat roast duck.

135
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,080
Dreams are free.

136
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Here, I'll share a duck leg with you.

137
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,360
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

138
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
How I wish for a proper meal.

139
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
Lord Ji, I have a favor to ask.

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,360
To be honest, I still feel a bit wronged

141
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,320
about being tied up
and punished last time.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
Did I give you all
those jewels for nothing?

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
Of course not.

144
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,800
But I was hoping
for a little more in return.

145
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
Say it. What do you want me to do?

146
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,240
Lord Ji, you're clever.

147
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,800
You must have guessed it already.

148
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,480
If we are to save Zhang Tai,

149
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,520
we'll be facing
the strongest fox in Jixing Abyss.

150
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,640
I won't be able to
protect you at all times.

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,480
Xun Ming could tear you apart with ease.

152
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Are you sure about this?

153
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,400
It sounds

154
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,200
like you're not
refusing to help me save her.

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,880
Thank you, Lord Ji.

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,720
It's just a friendship.

157
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,800
Is that really worth so much to you?

158
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,640
Yes.

159
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
To me, friendship weighs
more than a thousand mountains.

160
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,520
My wife said
that since she was married to me,

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
she no longer wished to
meet anyone from her past.

162
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,720
But since you requested it, Immortal Ji,

163
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,520
I can't say no.

164
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,960
General, I'm just too
worried about Zhang Tai.

165
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,760
Once I see her myself, I'll stop worrying.

166
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,440
This way, please.

167
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
- Zhang Tai!
- We have guests.

168
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,240
Zhang Tai, it's us.

169
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,520
I'm not receiving visitors.

170
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,000
Look up. It's me.

171
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,800
Again, I'm not seeing anyone today,

172
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,040
no matter who it is.

173
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,160
- No, I have to talk to her.
- Ming Yi, what are you doing?

174
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,240
She's ignoring me.
She must be angry with me.

175
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,320
If she won't see you,
she must have her reasons.

176
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,320
Don't cause a scene.

177
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
- Lord Ji…
- My wife has cut ties with her past.

178
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,560
You insisted on seeing her,
and I allowed it.

179
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,200
Are you still not satisfied?

180
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,400
General, that's not what she meant.

181
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,040
Lord Ji, please
persuade the General for me.

182
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,440
- Enough, Ming Yi.
- I just want to talk to her. Please…

183
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,440
Quiet.

184
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,640
General, perhaps she's simply hungry.

185
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,880
She hasn't eaten.
That's why she's being so difficult.

186
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,600
Would you be kind
enough to grant us a meal?

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,560
We'll leave once we finish.

188
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,560
Right?

189
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,080
All right.

190
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,800
Please, enjoy. Once you're done,

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,480
please see yourselves out.

192
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,760
Thank you for your hospitality, General.

193
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
Go on, Ming Yi.

194
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,080
Ming Yi, aren't you hungry?

195
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Eat up.

196
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,600
Try this.

197
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,280
<i>You won't eat a thing yourself,</i>

198
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,160
<i>but you have no problem making me eat.</i>

199
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Try this.

200
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,880
Here. Let me feed you.

201
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,960
How about some chicken?

202
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Easy. Stop feeding me.

203
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,840
Do you like it?

204
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Open your mouth.

205
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
Go on.

206
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,440
Fire!

207
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Look, it's huge!

208
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
General, what's going on?

209
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Spit it out.

210
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,680
Lord Ji, that was impressive.

211
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,680
It's just a natural fire.

212
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
You should be quite familiar with it.

213
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,640
- The illusion is in place.
- Let's go.

214
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,320
Zhang Tai.

215
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,960
A puppet loses awareness when separated
from its master for too long.

216
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,840
Isn't it dangerous to cast spells
at a place so close to him?

217
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,240
Xun Ming isn't easy to deal with.

218
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
Do you have a solution in mind?

219
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
This puppet

220
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,160
retains only two of
Zhang Tai's senses, strength and vitality.

221
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,000
Xun Ming has separated
her three souls and seven senses.

222
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,880
Illusion Trap. A fox tribe technique.

223
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,160
You know about that?

224
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,760
Our mistress comes
from the Yousu Fox Tribe.

225
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,960
I've been worried about Zhang Tai.

226
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
Of course I know
something about the tribe.

227
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,600
Xun Ming used Zhang Tai and lured her in,

228
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,040
trapping her within his Illusory Realm.

229
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,440
Travel with your primordial spirit,

230
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,440
and I can use her two senses
to let you see her.

231
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,440
But you won't be able to bring her back.

232
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,760
Only by finding and recreating Xun Ming's
most cherished memory

233
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,600
can you truly enter his Illusory Realm

234
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,520
and save Zhang Tai.

235
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,520
I can find out what that memory is
from Zhang Tai.

236
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,040
But let me warn you,

237
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
traveling with
your primordial spirit is dangerous.

238
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,040
I'll set up the array here.

239
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
You'll only have one incense stick's time,

240
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,960
barely enough for a few words.

241
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
If Xun Ming comes,

242
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll go immediately and leave you behind.

243
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm counting on you, Lord Ji.

244
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,320
Be careful.

245
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,720
Zhang Tai…

246
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,960
Zhang Tai.

247
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,119
That's Ming Yi's voice.

248
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,000
Ming Yi, is that you?

249
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,120
Zhang Tai.

250
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,400
Ming Yi.

251
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,800
Ming Yi, where are you?

252
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,240
I can't see you.

253
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,120
Zhang Tai, stop struggling.

254
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,480
Xun Ming trapped your primordial
spirit in his Illusory Realm.

255
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,000
I can only reach
you through your two senses.

256
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,760
But I can't pull you out.

257
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,280
Only by recreating what
the Yousu Fox Tribe treasures most

258
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,680
can I break the Illusory Realm
and free you.

259
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
So tell me,

260
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,560
what is Xun Ming's most cherished memory?

261
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Tell me everything between you two.

262
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,320
All right.

263
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
Back at Moonlit Blossoms,

264
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,720
Xun Ming wouldn't let go of my hand.

265
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
He wouldn't look away from me.

266
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,760
He was different from all the other men.

267
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
<i>And as you know,</i>

268
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,640
<i>he was tall, handsome,</i>

269
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,200
<i>and seemed rich.</i>

270
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,680
<i>I naively thought</i>

271
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,080
<i>I'd finally found</i>
<i>someone to spend my life with.</i>

272
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,920
<i>But after marrying him, I realized</i>

273
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,600
<i>he really was different from others.</i>

274
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,600
<i>He's insane!</i>

275
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,640
He kept performing
fox-tribe wedding rituals with me

276
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,000
<i>again and again,</i>

277
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,960
<i>never skipping a single step.</i>

278
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,960
<i>We've done it at least 20 times.</i>

279
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,560
<i>And every time,</i>
<i>he made me play music with him</i>

280
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,160
<i>until my fingers hurt,</i>

281
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,640
<i>and he still wouldn't stop.</i>

282
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,480
<i>He even forced a new name on me:</i>

283
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,600
Mu Xinliu.

284
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,120
<i>- Mu Xinliu?</i>
- The more I thought about it,

285
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,160
the weirder it felt.

286
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,640
Maybe he had a lover by that name?

287
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,760
But how could I resemble her?

288
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,920
No, impossible.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,240
I don't believe it.

290
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
No one could be as beautiful as I am.

291
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,600
Get to the point.

292
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,720
What's his most cherished memory?

293
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,240
His most cherished memory?

294
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,400
I… I'm not sure.

295
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,560
It probably has something
to do with that woman he loved.

296
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
Do you remember how you got
trapped in this Illusory Realm?

297
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,960
Well, I kept talking about going
back to Moonlit Blossoms to see everyone,

298
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,000
and it upset Xun Ming.

299
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,520
To cheer him up, I gave him wine

300
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,760
and tried to get him to talk
about that woman he loved.

301
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,120
<i>He got drunk</i>

302
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>and kept saying,</i>

303
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
<i>"Whether you have</i>
<i>true feelings for me or not,</i>

304
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
you're the only one I love."

305
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,760
Then he tried to kiss me.

306
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,480
Xinliu…

307
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,480
<i>If it'd been only once or</i>
<i>twice, it would've been fine.</i>

308
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,040
He's not bad-looking,

309
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,720
so I didn't really mind.

310
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,480
- But after 20 kisses, I went numb.
- Zhang Tai!

311
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,520
We're running out of time.

312
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,880
Once the incense
burns out, I have to leave.

313
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,320
Get to the point.

314
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,480
I'm getting there.

315
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,080
<i>We held another wedding ceremony.</i>

316
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,320
<i>The same ritual. The same steps.</i>

317
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,240
I'm tired of playing music.

318
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,520
<i>He walked toward me,</i>

319
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>and I suddenly fainted.</i>

320
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,000
When I woke up, I was here.

321
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
Here? In this forest?

322
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,960
Forest?

323
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,400
What forest?

324
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,160
From what I see,

325
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,920
you're trapped in a forest.

326
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,400
Where are you really?

327
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I'm in Xun Ming's Dengxian Cave.

328
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
He… he locked me in what was supposed
to be our bridal chamber.

329
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,600
You are just like her.

330
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,880
Zhang Tai, listen to me.

331
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,320
You are probably trapped
inside an Illusory Realm Xun Ming created.

332
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,560
Think carefully.

333
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,480
Is there anything strange around you?

334
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,240
Ming Yi,

335
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,400
I hear strange sounds.

336
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,840
Women's voices.

337
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,400
I don't think I'm the only one.

338
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,280
Before me,

339
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,240
he probably married many others
who resembled the woman he loved.

340
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,680
They might all be dead now.

341
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,200
And I might also…

342
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,280
Ming Yi,

343
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,240
I don't think I can hold on much longer.

344
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,360
<i>There's no time left.</i>

345
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,360
I haven't eaten this much in a while.

346
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
Why did you eat so much?

347
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,320
You kept feeding me.

348
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
Here.

349
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Here.

350
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Are you full now?

351
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
General, you're back.
Is the house all right?

352
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,760
Thank you for your hospitality.

353
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,240
We've finished our meal.
We'll be leaving now.

354
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,800
- Thank you, General.
- Let's go.

355
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,920
The fox tribe sure makes good chicken.

356
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,920
Little glutton.

357
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,000
Zhang Tai didn't know
what Xun Ming's most cherished memory was,

358
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
but she thought

359
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,400
it would be about his unforgettable love,
Mu Xinliu.

360
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,200
Someone from the Mu clan?

361
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,800
I know where we might find clues.

362
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,560
So one can enter the Langhuan Pavilion
simply by registering during the day.

363
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,080
Then last time, why did you…?

364
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,800
It was theft last time.

365
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,080
This time, we're borrowing books.
Not the same thing.

366
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,840
Not this one either.

367
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,720
GENEALOGY OF THE MU CLAN

368
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,360
You found it?

369
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,640
It's the royal genealogy of Jixing Abyss.

370
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,640
Good job, Lord Ji. Let me see.

371
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,480
So only Judgment Hall officials
can touch this book?

372
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,880
Wait, Lord Ji.
If you open it by force and damage it,

373
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,240
how will we explain that?

374
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,640
This flimsy seal is nothing to me.

375
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,640
Greetings, Immortal Situ.

376
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,360
He's here.

377
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,000
Hide. Trust me.

378
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,040
Hurry…

379
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,880
What a coincidence.

380
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
Sister Yi?

381
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,640
Greetings, Immortal Situ.

382
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,040
Sister Yi, what are you doing here?

383
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
- "Sister Yi."
- Is there something you want to know?

384
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,280
I can help you.

385
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,440
I can even make it seem
like the Judgment Hall is behind it.

386
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,640
It's nothing special.

387
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,840
Immortal Ji often
takes me out to socialize,

388
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,720
and there's a lot I don't know.

389
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
He said the Judgment Hall's archive

390
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,800
has plenty of books I can borrow and read

391
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
to avoid making mistakes.

392
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,280
But I just can't open this one.

393
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,640
You're in charge here.

394
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,880
Surely you can open it, right?

395
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,360
You're keeping Ji Bozai company.

396
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,800
He should be bearing the consequences.

397
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,960
He has no right to
make you do anything for him.

398
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,520
Thank you in advance, Immortal Situ.

399
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,520
Please, help me this once.

400
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,400
Fine.

401
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,640
I'll help with whatever you need.

402
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,240
However,

403
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,200
could you not
mention Ji Bozai in front of me again?

404
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,680
All right.

405
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,000
Thank you, Immortal Situ.

406
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,160
MU QIBAI

407
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,120
Are you investigating Lord Hanfeng?

408
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,200
Investigate?

409
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,680
That sounds harsh.

410
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,040
I only mean to learn more about him,

411
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
given his high status.

412
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,120
This royal genealogy
is all about the Mu clan.

413
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,920
If they marry outside the clan,
does it go unrecorded?

414
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,360
By custom,
once two people form a heart imprint

415
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,680
and carve their names on
the Marriage Stone at Mengyuan Pond,

416
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,280
their names are
entered into the genealogy.

417
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
MU XINLIU, MARRIED TO XUN MING

418
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,720
<i>Mu Xinliu married Xun Ming.</i>

419
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,440
Jixing Abyss really excels
at making artifacts.

420
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,600
Even this book has
more than meets the eye.

421
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,120
Sister Yi, don't say things like that.

422
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
If anyone overheard,

423
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,800
they might suspect
you're not from Jixing Abyss.

424
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,240
I suddenly feel a chill.

425
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,560
It is a bit cold here.

426
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,040
What a coincidence.

427
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,960
Immortal Ji, you've been here all along.

428
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Why did you hide?

429
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
I wasn't hiding.

430
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,760
We were on a tryst.

431
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
But someone intruded unexpectedly.

432
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,440
By the way,
I heard you call her "Sister Yi" just now.

433
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,560
Since you are so eager to be her family,

434
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,000
why not drop the formalities
and call me "Brother-in-law"?

435
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,080
Why so shy all of a sudden?

436
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,880
We still have matters to attend to.
We'll be going now.

437
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,840
Again, thank you for
your help today, Immortal Situ.

438
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,440
Let's go. Come on.

439
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,560
Come on.

440
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,200
Hurry…

441
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
Thank you.

442
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,320
Your Lordship, didn't you find any clues

443
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,640
about the Golden Millet Dream
in the archive?

444
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,680
So far, there are no new discoveries.

445
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,120
I only know the Bo clan's old residence
on Zhangwei Mountain was exposed,

446
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,080
and Mu Qibai took the chance
to seize the "Bo's Medical Classics."

447
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,800
But the formula of the Golden Millet Dream
was only found in fragments.

448
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,480
Even the Sunken Abyss
failed to reproduce it.

449
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,840
If I can't find the Golden Millet Dream,

450
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,400
I'll never have
spiritual veins in this life.

451
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
Even without them,

452
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,760
you mastered the Thousand Insect Spell.

453
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,760
But I can hardly compete in
the Qingyun Tournament with that.

454
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,800
Don't lose heart.

455
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,800
There's still Ji Bozai.

456
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,120
They all say he has
the Golden Millet Dream.

457
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,440
It vanished from the Six Realms long ago.

458
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,760
How do you think
he gained spiritual veins all of a sudden?

459
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,560
He's probably connected to the Bo clan.

460
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,120
He might even be one of its descendants.

461
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,800
- Why is he always brought up?
- What?

462
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,240
Nothing.

463
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,760
Anyway, since Jixing Abyss has been
refining medicines in the Sunken Abyss,

464
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,920
they must have the formulas.

465
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,760
I was hoping to find clues in
the Judgment Hall's archives,

466
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,720
something to help me make
the Golden Millet Dream myself,

467
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,320
but I found nothing.

468
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,680
The fastest way

469
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,920
is still to steal it from Ji Bozai.

470
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,720
Fuyue,

471
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,840
that makes me feel so useless.

472
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760
Then I'll go steal it.

473
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,160
I'll be the useless one. Is that better?

474
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,160
By the way,

475
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,240
I checked for you.

476
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,360
After Ming Xian lost
the last Qingyun Tournament,

477
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,400
she vanished from Yaoguang Mountain.

478
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Some say she defected.

479
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,000
As for why she reverted to her female form

480
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,040
and is now staying by Ji Bozai's side,

481
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,640
I haven't been able to figure it out yet.

482
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,400
You looked into her?

483
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,640
Wasn't it you who wanted
news of her, Your Lordship?

484
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,160
But I never said to investigate her.

485
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,880
Fuyue,

486
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,120
you must not hurt Ming Yi.

487
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,320
This is the first time you've scolded me.

488
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,480
I'm sorry, Fuyue.

489
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,200
I will follow your orders, Your Lordship.

490
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,000
I…

491
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,280
Lord Ji.

492
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,080
Are you close to Situ Ling?

493
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,840
You've known him a long time, right?

494
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,120
<i>Jealous again.</i>

495
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,520
Of course not.

496
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,400
Immortal Situ rescued me and Ruo Shui
from a netherbeast.

497
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,080
I only stayed in contact with him
out of gratitude.

498
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,280
We're not close.

499
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,640
Then why is he so willing to help you?

500
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,080
Earlier,

501
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,239
he used Mu Qibai's artifact
to search Jixing Abyss,

502
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
causing a huge scene,

503
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,280
but then he let it slide so easily.

504
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,719
Maybe…

505
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,920
maybe he took a fancy to me.

506
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,000
Stay away from him.

507
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm worried he'll trick you

508
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
into saying things you shouldn't.

509
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I didn't ask for an explanation.

510
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,080
Lord Ji, you were right.

511
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,120
Mu Xinliu really was Lord Hanfeng's cousin

512
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
and Xun Ming's late wife.

513
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,560
According to Zhang Tai,

514
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Xun Ming made her reenact

515
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,840
the Yousu Fox Tribe
wedding again and again,

516
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,400
and she entered the Illusory Realm

517
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,040
during the ceremony.

518
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,280
So I think

519
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,800
Xun Ming's most cherished memory

520
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,600
must be his wedding to Mu Xinliu.

521
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,480
To enter Xun Ming's Illusory Realm,

522
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,760
you must recreate his wedding.

523
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,440
If we are to recreate
a Yousu Fox Tribe wedding,

524
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,000
we can't use an outsider to play along.

525
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,400
It would be too unpredictable.

526
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,760
You have a point.

527
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
Why don't you and
Granny Xun stage the wedding?

528
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,440
That way, we can respond quickly
if something goes wrong.

529
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,640
But if Granny Xun and I hold a wedding
and invite Xun Ming,

530
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,880
will he really attend?

531
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000
You're actually willing to do this?

532
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,320
Has it occurred to you
that Granny Xun might refuse?

533
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,120
She would?

534
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,600
In that case,

535
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,760
the only people suitable
to stage this fake wedding

536
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
are Ming Yi and you.

537
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,680
But you don't trust her, do you?

538
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,920
All this time,

539
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,600
Ming Yi has had no
contact with the outside.

540
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,440
Besides, with her weak spiritual power,
she poses no threat.

541
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,520
When you enter the Illusory Realm
and get rid of Xun Ming,

542
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,360
even if she notices something,

543
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,480
we can deal with her quickly.

544
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,280
But Your Lordship, I must warn you:

545
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,680
when the time comes,
you must be ruthless with Ming Yi.

546
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,440
If she must be sacrificed,

547
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,240
do not hesitate.

548
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Fine.

549
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,360
I know what to do.

550
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
It's settled then.

551
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,240
Your acting has never been better.

552
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,160
You can go to Ming Yi now.

553
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,560
Ask for her hand and
trick her into marrying you.

554
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,720
What a plan.

555
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,640
Go.

556
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
Let me think.

557
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,920
Lord Ji, didn't you say we should check
Moonlit Blossoms

558
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,200
for any missed clues about
the Yousu Fox Tribe? Hurry…

559
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,000
Are you really worried about Zhang Tai?

560
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,720
Of course.

561
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
Before I left the Illusory Realm,
Zhang Tai said she could barely hold on.

562
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,920
You also said

563
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,240
that once someone's three
souls and seven senses are taken,

564
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,480
they won't live more than 15 days. I…

565
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,320
<i>Your acting has never been better.</i>

566
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,080
<i>You can go to Ming Yi now.</i>

567
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
<i>Ask for her hand and</i>
<i>trick her into marrying you.</i>

568
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,240
<i>No fighting or bloodshed needed.</i>

569
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,120
<i>Just get married and it's done.</i>

570
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,480
<i>Ask for her hand and</i>
<i>trick her into marrying you.</i>

571
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,440
<i>So simple. I believe in you.</i>

572
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>Just get married and it's done.</i>

573
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,440
<i>Ask for her hand and</i>
<i>trick her into marrying you.</i>

574
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,840
<i>No fighting needed.</i>

575
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,800
<i>So simple. I believe in you.</i>

576
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,360
<i>- Ask for her hand…</i>
<i>- It'll be a piece of cake.</i>

577
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>- And trick her into marrying you.</i>
<i>- Just get married and it's done.</i>

578
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,840
Marry me, Lord Ji.

579
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,920
We'll separate afterward.
That will be easy.

580
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,480
Let's get married and save her first.

581
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,080
- Besides…
- All right.

582
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,280
I know

583
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,160
you only want this wedding

584
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,520
because you want to save Zhang Tai.

585
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,800
Rest assured. This marriage will be fake,

586
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,760
and I will only invite Xun Ming.

587
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,720
We will not carve
our names on the Marriage Stone.

588
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
Nor will we form a heart imprint.

589
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,400
Your reputation

590
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
won't be affected in any way.

591
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,320
Lord Ji, you needn't worry about me.

592
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,040
As for carving names
and forming a heart imprint…

593
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,960
You have sacrificed
enough for your friends.

594
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,800
You must not sacrifice any more.

595
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,320
Trust me.

596
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
You always think things through.

597
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,040
You refused to marry me before.

598
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,800
Why are you willing to make
such a sacrifice to help me now?

599
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,800
Do you have some other plan in mind?

600
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,800
Must I always have some scheme?

601
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,560
Thank you for helping me.

602
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,120
You're helping me out of a sense of duty.

603
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,120
I will not let you suffer for it.

604
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,040
After we save her, we'll part if you wish.

605
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,360
Although I like you,

606
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
I will not cling to you.

607
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,200
All right.

608
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,800
<i>After we save her, we'll part if you wish.</i>

609
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,120
<i>Although I like you,</i>

610
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,400
<i>I will not cling to you.</i>

611
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,920
Is Your Lordship plotting
how to make Xun Ming attend the ceremony?

612
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
I already know how to make him come.

613
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,720
Then what are you thinking?

614
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,800
INVITATION TO JI
BOZAI AND MING YI'S WEDDING

615
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,280
How dare Ji Bozai hold his wedding

616
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,640
at Xinliu's burial site?

617
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,640
Luosheng Forest.

618
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,960
It was also the place

619
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,800
where you and my cousin pledged your love.

620
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,000
If they chose that place,

621
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,680
they must expect you to show up.

622
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,680
Go if you want.

623
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I will not stop you.

624
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,240
But remember this:

625
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,480
do not lose your composure because of it.

626
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,240
Don't worry.

627
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,360
I'm not that useless.

628
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,840
INVITATION, MING YI

629
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,520
JI BOZAI
