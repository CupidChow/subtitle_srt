1
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,440
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 30

3
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,440
Spiritual power from
Zhushui Spiritual State?

4
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,480
Did the Emperor of Zhushui give it to you?

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,200
No wonder your power surged
at the tea gathering.

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,240
Who are you taking me to?

7
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,280
The Emperor of Zhushui?

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
So you were faking it all along!

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,640
The black lingzhi mushroom
can revive your cat.

10
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm sure Ming Xin knows that already.

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Do you intend to play along?

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,520
Is there anything else
in my mind that you can't read?

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Right, Warrior Goddess.

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,160
Everything is within your calculations.

15
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,360
Ming Xin will show himself.

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
I want to settle the score with him

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,240
and might as well use the opportunity

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,840
to get the last piece
of the Recording Mirror.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,040
Do you dare return to Yaoguang Mountain?

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
What if Father punishes you?

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,040
Punish me?

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
Why should I be afraid of that?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,320
When I reveal the truth to everyone,

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,560
who should be afraid? You or me?

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
Now that you've fallen for the trap

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
let's settle our score once and for all.

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,960
Open your eyes and see what I have here.

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
How can this be?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,040
Mu Qibai has half of the Recording Mirror.

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
How did you get the one in my possession

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,640
that went missing?

32
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,040
Impossible.

33
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,880
You have the Heavenly Grief.

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
How can you…

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
The Recording Mirror

36
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,680
will prove that you poisoned me
with the Heavenly Grief

37
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
and colluded with the Emperor of Zhushui.

38
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
How do you think Yaoguang Palace
will punish you?

39
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,480
Your punishment will be more important

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,079
than my identity.

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
I hate

42
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,160
that I didn't kill you back then
in Jixing Abyss when I had

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,200
the Blood Moon Ring
that could catalyze the netherbeasts!

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,920
Do you have any idea what you did?

45
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
You poisoned me so that you
can be the crown prince.

46
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
That's a personal agenda.

47
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,200
But letting the netherbeasts out

48
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
will only bring suffering
to the Six Realms!

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,200
You're the greatest fool ever!

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,600
So what?

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,480
Ming Xian. Were you the one

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,880
who sealed the netherbeast army
alongside Ji Bozai?

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Ji Bozai and you fell in love?

54
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,240
How preposterous.

55
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,280
You ruined the plan of the
Emperor of Zhushui.

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,520
Do you think he will let you go?

57
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
Your right hand is your dominant hand.

58
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
Therefore,

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,320
you poisoned me with your right hand.

60
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,240
Ming Xian, what are you doing?

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
No!

62
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Ming Xin.

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,720
You poisoned me.

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,280
Because of that, my spiritual veins
were damaged and I lost

65
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
in the tournament.

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
To fulfill your selfish desire,

67
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
you forsook your duty to Yaoguang Mountain

68
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,160
and colluded with Zhushui Spiritual State.

69
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,760
You summoned the blood moon

70
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,120
and attempted to destroy Jixing Abyss
with netherbeasts.

71
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,240
Today, I shall take away
all your dexterity.

72
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,160
An eye for an eye.

73
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Impossible.

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
Mu Qibai told me

75
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,880
that only the Golden Millet Dream
could cure the Heavenly Grief.

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,160
You can use your spiritual veins
at will now,

77
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
which means you are cured.

78
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,560
Did Ji Bozai truly have the
Golden Millet Dream

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,080
and give it to you?

80
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,800
DIWU TREE ROOT

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
My Lord.

82
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
Considering the two hundred or so

83
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,400
wandering spirits given
by Yaoguang Mountain recently,

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
you will soon master
the secret technique of Zhushui,

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
the art of illusory assassination.

86
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
Fuyue,

87
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,720
I once told you many times

88
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,640
that I would never become
like my father or brothers.

89
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,600
You then asked if it was a promise to you

90
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,200
or to myself.

91
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,920
But I have seen the truth now.

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,200
The blood of Zhushui flows within us.

93
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,680
Are we all that different?

94
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,400
We all worship the deities of
Zhushui Spiritual State.

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,120
Perhaps we were all cursed from the start.

96
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,280
Only by sacrificing our souls

97
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,679
can we attain true heights.

98
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,800
If that is the price to rise above all,

99
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
so be it.

100
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,360
My Lord.

101
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,840
Whatever you have become,
you are still you.

102
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,000
I will always stay by your side.

103
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
I couldn't defeat her

104
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,880
and she even broke one of my arms.

105
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
My bone won't ever heal again.

106
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,840
The Recording Mirror…

107
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,360
Wait.

108
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,960
I must talk to Father before she does.

109
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,120
The tea gathering isn't over.

110
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,080
Why are you back so soon?

111
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,040
Father, I rushed back

112
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
because there's something affecting
the name of Yaoguang Mountain

113
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
that you must know.

114
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,240
Whatever could tarnish our reputation?

115
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,480
Tell me.

116
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,360
All of you are dismissed.

117
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

118
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,440
What happened to your arm?

119
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
I met Ming Xian during the tea gathering.

120
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,120
He broke my arm.

121
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Ming Xian?

122
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,320
He's still alive?

123
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,360
Not only is he alive,

124
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,040
but he also betrayed Yaoguang Mountain,

125
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,520
and sided with Jixing Abyss.

126
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,160
Are you sure?

127
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
Absolutely.

128
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,840
I speak the truth.

129
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,760
Moreover,

130
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,800
I found something even more terrifying.

131
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
Ming Xian

132
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,160
is a girl.

133
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
What do you mean?

134
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,960
I could hardly believe it at first

135
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,760
because it was just ridiculous.

136
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,360
But I saw it with my own eyes.

137
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,160
The warriors with me can attest to it too.

138
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,400
Ming Xian is a girl.

139
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,760
She got a new name, Ming Yi,

140
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,240
and married Ji Bozai.

141
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,520
The so-called respected Empress
must have told this lie

142
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
to secure her position.

143
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,920
She told everyone
she had given birth to a son.

144
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
Then, she had her daughter disguised
as a man

145
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,720
and deceived Yaoguang Mountain
for 21 years.

146
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,680
Impossible.

147
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
He is my son.

148
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,200
He is not a girl.

149
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,160
I do not know
what evil trick the Empress used.

150
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,320
But Ming Xian worked with the rival realm

151
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,280
and lost on purpose during
the Qingyun Tournament.

152
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,960
We then became one of the lower realms.

153
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,400
This is the truth.

154
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
I see.

155
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
I shall investigate thoroughly.

156
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,360
If Jing Shu truly committed
such an atrocity,

157
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,920
I would revoke her title as the Empress.

158
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,360
I have one more favor to ask.

159
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,800
Father, after the tea gathering,

160
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,640
please hold the
Crown Prince Conferment Ceremony

161
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,960
and appoint me as the crown prince.

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,880
His Majesty said yes?

163
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,960
The conferment ceremony
will be held after three days.

164
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,080
Then, I'll be the official
crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

165
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Great.

166
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,840
Great! Xin.

167
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,880
Why do you look so worried?

168
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,400
Mother.

169
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
There's one more problem.

170
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,000
I procured the Heavenly Grief
from Mu Qibai.

171
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,080
He recorded everything
with the Recording Mirror.

172
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,600
And the mirror

173
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,640
is in Ming Xian's possession.

174
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,400
What? Then…

175
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
Then you should get the mirror
back from her.

176
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,720
But Ming Xian somehow
got back her spiritual veins.

177
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
She's too strong for me.

178
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,680
But the Emperor of Zhushui

179
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,720
suspects Ming Xian of being
the descendant of the Bo clan.

180
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,840
He asked me to capture her alive
and bring her to Zhushui Spiritual State.

181
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,920
Assuming he is right,

182
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
then Ming Yi

183
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,360
does not carry the bloodline
of Yaoguang Palace.

184
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,880
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS

185
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,680
Spiritual veins destroyed
by the Heavenly Grief

186
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
may only be restored by planting
the Golden Millet Dream in the victim.

187
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,080
There is no other alternative.

188
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,160
The Heavenly Grief in me
suddenly went away.

189
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,560
The only possible explanation

190
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,120
is that you gave it to me.

191
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,480
But I had no idea at all.

192
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,680
It seems like you have dealt with
Ming Xin swiftly.

193
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
It is unscathed.

194
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,160
To revive your companion beast,

195
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,640
you need to resonate with it using
your spiritual veins.

196
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,360
It will be painful.
Let me stay here with you.

197
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,720
The black lingzhi mushroom is working.

198
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,640
If I nurture it for a while,

199
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,400
Twenty-Seven will return.

200
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,079
I finally did it.

201
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
What?

202
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,920
Won't you ask

203
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,800
what I did to Ming Xin?

204
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
After all, he was going to be
the crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

205
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
If I hurt him,

206
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,160
Jixing Abyss might be in trouble.

207
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,800
In trouble?

208
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,400
As in neither of us
can handle the consequences?

209
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,440
If you kill him, I'll bring you the blade.

210
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,480
If you spare him, I'll cover your tracks.

211
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,800
I have the Warrior Goddess with me.

212
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,800
What else is there to worry about?

213
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
I got the Recording Mirror,

214
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,120
but I spared Ming Xin.

215
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,320
He's going to reveal my identity
to my father.

216
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
And you already have a plan?

217
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
Yes.

218
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,920
But there's one important thing

219
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,440
I need to check with you.

220
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,320
When did you give me
the Golden Millet Dream?

221
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,960
Didn't you see me
destroy the Golden Millet Dream?

222
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,480
How could I possibly give it to you?

223
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,800
I undid the seal on Bo's Medical Classics.

224
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
The Golden Millet Dream

225
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,320
is the only cure for the Heavenly Grief.

226
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,920
You gave it to me.

227
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,200
Like I said, I did not.

228
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,680
In Zhangwei Mountain,
you asked if I was Ming Xian.

229
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,760
You said you'd only ask me
that question one last time.

230
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,240
So today,

231
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm asking you again one last time.

232
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,680
If you won't answer my question,

233
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,280
I will not ask it again.

234
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,560
Did you enjoy the scallion pancake?

235
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,720
You brought a scallion pancake
to Zhangwei Mountain?

236
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,360
Is it weird?

237
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
I came here for you anyway.

238
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,920
Thank you.

239
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,600
I only realized now

240
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
that you're more important to me

241
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,840
than I imagined.

242
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,040
Don't spill anything.

243
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,360
Come. Eat it.

244
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
See?

245
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
I'd hate to see you look at me like that.

246
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,560
I gave you the Golden Millet Dream
for one purpose only,

247
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,800
so that you can live.

248
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,320
I don't want you to feel indebted to me

249
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,040
or that you need to do anything
to repay me.

250
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,600
You ought to know me better.

251
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,080
I'm a prideful woman.

252
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,760
I will never fall for someone
out of indebtedness.

253
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes. You and your pride.

254
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,240
You're invincible.

255
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
Ji Bozai.

256
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,920
Ming Xian.

257
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,920
You two trespassed into Yaoguang Palace

258
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,680
to kidnap me.

259
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
What?

260
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Are you betraying Yaoguang Mountain

261
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
and siding with Jixing Abyss now?

262
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,240
Looking for something?

263
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,040
Oh, this thing from the Emperor

264
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,840
of Zhushui?

265
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,080
What do you want?

266
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,560
Easy.

267
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,680
It won't be for long.

268
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,280
I can finally
use this Soul-seizing Technique on you.

269
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,280
Are you ready?

270
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,880
Speak. The Emperor of Zhushui
gave you power

271
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
and even the compass.

272
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,000
What did he tell you to do?

273
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,160
Ming Xian.

274
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Do you think you can be the crown prince

275
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,880
just because you
have the Recording Mirror?

276
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,600
Dream on!

277
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,960
You will not steal my thunder again!

278
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
Ming Xian.

279
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,160
Only I can be the crown prince.

280
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,160
So his greatest fear is you?

281
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,160
That's my loser of a brother for you.
Don't mind him.

282
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,680
Smiling? You have no right to be smug.

283
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,880
What did the Emperor tell me to do?

284
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Listen carefully.

285
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,760
He told me to capture you alive
and bring you to Zhushui Spiritual State.

286
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,080
You're an outsider.

287
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,560
You don't carry
the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

288
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,040
You are a descendant of the Bo clan!

289
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
What did you say?

290
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,880
The elders in Yaoguang Palace claimed

291
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,760
that two wandering physicians
once sojourned in Yaoguang Mountain.

292
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,960
One of them

293
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,480
fell in love and had a child with
one of the local warriors.

294
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,080
Can you guess if it's you?

295
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,240
The Emperor of Zhushui also said

296
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,360
that since you could
enter the Zhulong Barrier,

297
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,480
it meant you were the descendant
of the Bo clan.

298
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,200
Father. Mother.

299
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,320
Look.

300
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,600
The crown prince

301
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,680
of Yaoguang Mountain can only be me!

302
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,920
Let me find out the truth
in Yaoguang Palace.

303
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,960
Ming Yi.

304
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Father has found out.

305
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,160
He has erected a barrier

306
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,520
so that I cannot return.

307
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,040
The barrier is now broken.

308
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,760
Guards will arrive soon.

309
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,520
Don't worry. I'll stand guard.

310
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,520
No one will bother you.

311
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,280
Ming Yi.

312
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,440
I can handle it.

313
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,880
You…

314
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,960
How did you come back?

315
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,880
How could they do this to you?

316
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,200
They know you're a fairy.

317
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,480
So they agreed to appoint Ming Xin
as the crown prince.

318
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,720
You shouldn't have come back.

319
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
I'll take you away from this place.

320
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,440
Your father thinks you're a traitor.

321
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,800
Even you can't be sure that
you can get out of this place alive.

322
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
And you want me to come with you?

323
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
Do you think you can escape?

324
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Master told me
that you were safe in Yaoguang Palace.

325
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Look at you now.

326
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,640
I will bring you to safety even
if it means

327
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
everyone will view me as an enemy.

328
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,200
Just go. I will not leave with you.

329
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
Your Majesty, you won't come with me

330
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,480
because you don't think
I can bring you to safety

331
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,440
or because

332
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,440
I am not your daughter?

333
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,560
What did you say?

334
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,160
Ming Xin was given the task
of taking me back alive

335
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,920
by the Emperor of Zhushui

336
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,840
because the Emperor found out

337
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,040
that I do not carry the bloodline
of Yaoguang Palace.

338
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,040
He said I was a descendant of the Bo clan.

339
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,240
No wonder you never called me Mother

340
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,440
after you barged into this place.

341
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,440
Master She.

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,080
Ming Yi wrote to me,

343
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,480
telling me that you gave the
Golden Millet Dream to her.

344
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,280
I've never thanked anyone in my life.

345
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
But I'll make an exception today.

346
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,920
Stand upright.

347
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,280
Stand upright.

348
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,960
Master She.

349
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,800
Do not return the bow.

350
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,280
Rest assured.

351
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,800
I will repay the favor.

352
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,560
I will find the Diwu tree's core
as soon as possible

353
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,680
and make the Golden Millet Dream for you.

354
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,840
Thank you, Master She.

355
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,040
No need.

356
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,840
Ming Yi also mentioned

357
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,800
that Ming Xin accused her
of being a descendant of the Bo clan.

358
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,200
Did that happen?

359
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
What else did Ming Xin say?

360
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,600
Tell us.

361
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,160
So where did the wandering Bo
physicians go?

362
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,800
I was told one died
from labor complications.

363
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,680
And the other one was last seen

364
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,000
leaving Yaoguang Palace

365
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,600
with a newborn baby.

366
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,080
You returned

367
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
to find the truth.

368
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,360
If I tell you the truth,

369
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,400
will you stop pestering me?

370
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,040
Have you ever wondered

371
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,640
why I have treated you so

372
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
ever since you were little?

373
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,520
You are smart.

374
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,400
You won every Qingyun Tournament.

375
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
You wouldn't even dare

376
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,160
to make a mistake or lose

377
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,320
in your training.

378
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,640
But I never cared what you wanted,

379
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
or if you were hurt or hungry.

380
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,920
No mother would ever
treat her child like this.

381
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,800
Given your intelligence,

382
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,280
I thought you'd have guessed it.

383
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,560
So…

384
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,360
So who am I?

385
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,080
Your father, the Emperor of Yaoguang,

386
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,120
and I do not love each other.

387
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,200
He took Madam Meng in
as his consort one day

388
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,000
and showered her with affection.

389
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Everyone in Yaoguang Palace said

390
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,840
that when Madam Meng gave birth
to a son with spiritual veins,

391
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,800
she would replace me

392
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,680
as the Empress of Yaoguang.

393
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,000
Therefore,

394
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,280
I must give birth to a son

395
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,680
with spiritual veins before she does.

396
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,920
20 YEARS AGO

397
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,840
There, there.

398
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,760
Good boy.

399
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,880
Baby. My baby.

400
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,280
Quick.

401
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,480
Bring me my baby.

402
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,120
My baby.

403
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,480
Impossible. This can't be right.

404
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,400
My son must have spiritual veins.

405
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
-Who would have thought
-Impossible!

406
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
This is impossible!

407
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,280
The son whom I toiled so much to conceive

408
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,200
was born without spiritual veins?

409
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,280
Without spiritual veins?

410
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,520
Yes. The irony of it.

411
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,080
God took pity on me and gave me a son.

412
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,680
But in everyone's eyes,

413
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,160
he's just a useless person
with no spiritual veins.

414
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,160
He can never be a crown prince.

415
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,560
He won't even be able to survive.

416
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
So

417
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
who am I?

418
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,680
The serendipitous but hapless victim
of this tragedy.

419
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,040
Coincidentally, another baby was born

420
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,280
at the same time in Yaoguang Palace.

421
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,440
It was a baby girl

422
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,640
yet she was born
with strong spiritual veins.

423
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,800
So I made the decision.

424
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
To save my son,

425
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,000
I took you, who were born on the same day,

426
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,600
away to replace my son.

427
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,800
Your Majesty, I'm begging you.

428
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,080
Yucen is already dead.

429
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,000
This is her only child.

430
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,080
Bo Yulan, you know very well

431
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,760
why your sister died
from birth complications.

432
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,760
She was hunted down
by Zhushui Spiritual State

433
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,720
and was gravely injured.

434
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,080
She was too weak to carry a baby,

435
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,800
yet she risked everything
to deliver her baby

436
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,400
for the sake of love.

437
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,280
And her lover couldn't do anything
to protect her baby.

438
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,960
He is a warrior

439
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,760
but he consummated with a foreign fairy.

440
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
He is now imprisoned.

441
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
I felt bad for Yucen,

442
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,800
so I snuck her into the palace
for her delivery.

443
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,679
Now that Yucen is gone,

444
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
do you think you can protect the baby?

445
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,719
This baby was born with unrivaled

446
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
spiritual veins and potentials.

447
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,600
She is destined to rise above all.

448
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,160
I know

449
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,640
your clan has something
called the Veil of Illusion

450
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,680
that can conceal her gender.

451
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,920
You and your sister
used that technique to evade the manhunt

452
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
in Zhushui Spiritual State.

453
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,280
Tell me how to use the technique

454
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,680
and I'll release your sister's lover.

455
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,840
This baby

456
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,760
will be the respected crown prince
of Yaoguang Mountain.

457
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,640
I will make her the ruler of Six Realms.

458
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,040
So,

459
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,800
I really am…

460
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,280
Yes, the daughter of Bo Yucen,

461
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,720
the descendant of the Bo clan.

462
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,520
Then, my father is…?

463
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,720
Master She.

464
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,240
I heard

465
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,200
that the ancestors of the Bo clan
would leave behind portraits.

466
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,360
As long as someone pays respect
to the portraits,

467
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,040
their divine consciousness

468
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,880
will remain in the Bo clan's
ancestral home.

469
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,520
That day, in Zhangwei Mountain, Ming Yi

470
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
saw another fairy from the Bo clan,

471
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,160
Bo Yucen.

472
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,840
She saw Yucen?

473
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,200
She truly saw Yucen?

474
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
So, you do know Bo Yucen.

475
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Fairy Bo Yucen

476
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,880
said something weird to Ming Yi.

477
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,640
What did she say?

478
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,320
The Bo clan still has one descendant
in this world.

479
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,360
And that's my child.

480
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,320
But I hope

481
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,240
no one will ever find out
about her identity

482
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,040
or whereabouts.

483
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,720
Oh, my baby.

484
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,760
Never have I ever imagined

485
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,600
that I would be able to see you again.

486
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,880
Ming Yi

487
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,240
didn't know what she meant.

488
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,480
But…

489
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,680
Master She, you must know.

490
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,840
I thought that if Ming Yi could meet her,

491
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,080
it means someone
is still paying respect to her portrait.

492
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,920
Is that you, Master She?

493
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,320
Master She,

494
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,600
I admit that I once asked my
companion beast to dig around your past.

495
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,680
Ming Xian became a warrior of
Yaoguang Mountain at the age of 13.

496
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,760
And you suddenly did everything you could

497
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,480
to be the venerable
for Yaoguang Mountain's warrior ranks.

498
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,320
That's because

499
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,520
you want to tutor the crown prince,
Ming Xian.

500
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,360
Well done!

501
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,720
-Greetings, Venerable.
-Your Highness.

502
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
No need to bow to me, Venerable.

503
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,720
I am now one of the warriors.

504
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,640
I should bow to you instead.

505
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,480
Your Highness,
your form was excellent just now.

506
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,440
Perhaps you shouldn't call me Venerable.

507
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,600
Let me be your master.

508
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,840
I'll take you in as my disciple.

509
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,680
You?

510
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,080
Why should I be your disciple?

511
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,840
What can you teach me?

512
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,720
Prideful, aren't you?

513
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,840
Let's have a match then.

514
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,240
If I win, you'll have to call me Master.

515
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,920
Sure.

516
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,360
After Ming Xin confessed,

517
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,680
you began to suspect me, didn't you?

518
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
I didn't mean to offend you.

519
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,320
All I'm after is the truth.

520
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,960
Will you tell me the truth, Master She?

521
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,520
Were you in love

522
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,320
with Fairy Bo Yucen?

523
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,640
Your father was the warrior

524
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,080
of Yaoguang Mountain, She Tianlin.

525
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,280
So in the Bo clan's ancestral home,

526
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,600
I met my mother.

527
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,720
The one I've known since I was little,

528
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,000
the one who has been staying by my side,

529
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,240
the one whom I call Master is…

530
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,400
So Ming Yi

531
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,480
is your child with Fairy Bo Yucen.

532
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,240
When Yucen went into labor,

533
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,920
I was imprisoned by the Empress.

534
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,520
When I was released,

535
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,560
Yucen had already passed

536
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,040
from birth complications.

537
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,480
I couldn't even look at her one last time.

538
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,280
By then,

539
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,120
your daughter

540
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,480
had already become the son of the Empress.

541
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,280
I was at my wits' end.

542
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,160
I had no other option.

543
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
What can I do?

544
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,560
I was just an ordinary warrior

545
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,280
and they were the entire Yaoguang Palace.

546
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,040
Could I fight them all?

547
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,680
Could I fight the Empress?

548
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,760
I could only endure it silently.

549
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,080
Yucen's portrait

550
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,160
contains our shared memories.

551
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,120
For 21 years,

552
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,920
for all 21 years,

553
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,440
those cherished past memories,

554
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,520
and Ming Yi's future

555
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,040
have kept me alive.

556
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,160
For 21 years,

557
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,040
have you never intended

558
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,680
to tell Ming Yi the truth?

559
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,400
You would rather Ming Yi live

560
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,520
in deception forever?
