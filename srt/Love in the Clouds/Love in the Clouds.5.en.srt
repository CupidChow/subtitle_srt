1
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG
SHUANG'S "LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
YOUNG JI BOZAI

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
Want to eat?

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
Then look carefully.

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
Even my dog is nobler than you.

7
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,640
- Kneel, and you may eat.
- I will not kneel!

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,680
- Will you kneel or not?
- I will not!

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
You are nothing but a wretch

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,880
your own parents abandoned at the border.

11
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,160
Do you understand?

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Defy me again, and I will break your legs!

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
I…

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,920
I wasn't abandoned.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
<i>I wasn't!</i>

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,160
<i>I must get out of here alive.</i>

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,840
Search over there!

18
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
Don't let him escape!

19
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,960
EPISODE 5

20
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
The painting is right there.

21
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,280
There wasn't a single trap on the way.

22
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,160
The defenses are
so lax that it feels wrong.

23
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,880
I don't think the traps are absent.

24
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
They just haven't been triggered.

25
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,160
They're waiting for
us to walk right into them.

26
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Lord Ji,

27
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,880
it's my duty to protect you.

28
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,600
Even thunder from
the underworld should fall on me.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,040
If something happens to me,

30
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,360
so be it.

31
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,560
But if anything happens to you,

32
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,880
who will hold the household together?

33
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Let me go in your place.

34
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,560
Go, then.

35
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,080
<i>He actually let me go?</i>

36
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

37
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
No traps at all.

38
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
Even if there's the slightest risk,

39
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
it should be me who takes it.

40
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,920
<i>Chapter 14:</i>

41
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,120
<i>"Ming Yi Takes Risks for Wealth."</i>

42
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,320
Are you all right?

43
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,360
We got the painting.

44
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
That's what matters.

45
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,480
<i>Feeling for me, aren't you?</i>

46
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
<i>More attacks?</i>

47
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,120
Look out!

48
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,480
Are you hurt?

49
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
You've been struck by
a Soul-Devouring Arrow.

50
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,280
Let's head back now.

51
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,560
Lord Ji, we should take the valuables too.

52
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,120
I can buy you more later. Let's go.

53
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,760
No, we need to stage a burglary.

54
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,720
The more convincing, the better.

55
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
I see.

56
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,919
JUDGMENT HALL

57
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
The portrait of the Bo
clanswoman was stolen

58
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,000
right under your nose.

59
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,800
Situ,

60
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
you just took office
and already made such a blunder.

61
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,720
You must get to the bottom of this.

62
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,160
The work of the Judgment Hall
still relies on you, Lord Hanfeng.

63
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,800
Tell me what you need me to do.

64
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
That is what I value in
you: your tact and discernment.

65
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,400
At yesterday's banquet,
I noticed that Ji Bozai

66
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,600
showed keen interest in that painting.

67
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,960
If you can search Wugui Sea thoroughly

68
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,760
and clear Immortal Ji's name,

69
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,040
that would be best.

70
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,480
Immortal Ji is a warrior.

71
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,800
I have no solid evidence right now.

72
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,080
To storm Wugui Sea
based on flimsy suspicion would be rash.

73
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,880
If he confronts me,

74
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,520
I have neither the reason
nor the power to prevail.

75
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,320
How is that rash?

76
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,560
Searching Wugui Sea
is simply to find out if thieves broke in.

77
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,480
That's your way of protecting Immortal Ji.

78
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
He has spiritual veins, and I don't.

79
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,680
Who will be protecting whom?

80
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,800
Aren't you reversing our roles?

81
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,200
Didn't you just say
you would follow my orders?

82
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,800
I said you could give orders,

83
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,160
but I never
promised to carry them all out.

84
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
Outrageous!

85
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
How dare you speak
to His Lordship like that?

86
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,760
Never mind.

87
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,680
Yan Xiao.

88
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
You'll go.

89
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,880
Yes, Your Lordship.

90
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,960
Yan, what brings you here at this hour?

91
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,640
Ji, you might not know,

92
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,000
but the Judgment Hall
was robbed last night.

93
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
I've been ordered to
make routine inquiries.

94
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
Sorry to disturb you.

95
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,440
The Judgment Hall was robbed?

96
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
What does that have to do with Wugui Sea?

97
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,800
Besides, isn't there a new chief in place?

98
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,080
Talk about a dog chasing a mouse.

99
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,760
Who's the mouse here?

100
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Who's the dog, then?

101
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,440
The thief stole not only treasures

102
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,840
but also the fairy portrait
displayed at Lord Hanfeng's banquet.

103
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,280
Over that worthless thing,

104
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
the thief got struck by
a Soul-Devouring Arrow.

105
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
A new broom sweeps clean.

106
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,520
Chief Situ has ordered me

107
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,320
to investigate everyone
who saw the painting at the banquet.

108
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,120
As a humble physician, I have to
follow his orders.

109
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
Investigate away.

110
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,480
Help him put on the injury detector.

111
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,080
This proves

112
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,120
I wasn't hit by
a Soul-Devouring Arrow, right?

113
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,960
Of course.

114
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
It was a baseless suspicion.

115
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
Good.

116
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
Now that you've done your job,

117
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,960
I'll be on my way.

118
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
Please wait, Ji.

119
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,720
One of the banquet guests,

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,760
Fairy Ming Yi, hasn't been examined yet.

121
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,280
Did you wake up too
early and lose your wits?

122
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,280
Did you even hear yourself?

123
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,320
Do you really think a lowly fairy

124
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,120
can go in and out of
the Judgment Hall at will?

125
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,360
Here's the thing, Ji.

126
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The array at Judgment Hall's main entrance

127
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
was forcibly broken last night.

128
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Until it's repaired,
anyone can come and go at will.

129
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,520
So Chief Situ ordered
that even fairies without spiritual veins

130
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,720
must be examined.

131
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,640
Who came so early in the morning
to spoil my plans?

132
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,480
Didn't I tell you to wait in the chamber?

133
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Why did you come here?

134
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,560
I waited so long,
and you still didn't return,

135
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,440
so I grew impatient.

136
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
What's the hurry?

137
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,600
Fairy Ming Yi, you came just in time.

138
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,040
Immortal Yan, you're an early bird.

139
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
It makes sense.

140
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,400
You're a single man, so you don't know

141
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,320
that people can't bear
to be disturbed sometimes.

142
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,480
If you need to examine anything,
do it quickly.

143
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,920
Don't waste our time.

144
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,480
This is an injury detector.

145
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,680
If you've been struck
by a Soul-Devouring Arrow,

146
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,280
it'll cause pain
that eats into your bones.

147
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
If not, you will feel nothing.

148
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,880
Fine. Examine me and get it over with.

149
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
Why so nervous?

150
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,080
I was messing with you.

151
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,240
Did you really think I sneaked
into the Judgment Hall?

152
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,000
Are you done?

153
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,360
Should we keep testing until
the next Qingyun Tournament?

154
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,760
Why not just go back
and tell your real master

155
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,400
to frame us outright?

156
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,560
That would be
a quicker way to get what he wants.

157
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Sorry for troubling you.

158
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,280
So tiring.

159
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,880
Let's head back.

160
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
Next time, come later.

161
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
As expected, Yan Xiao examined even me.

162
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,960
- How are you feeling?
- I'm really fine, Lord Ji.

163
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Thanks to you casting a spell beforehand
to hide my wound,

164
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
they couldn't see I was injured.

165
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,600
All they had was
that shabby artifact to test me with.

166
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,200
And I didn't show
the slightest sign of pain.

167
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,920
Ming Yi!

168
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,080
Ming Yi!

169
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,160
Ming Yi!

170
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm fine.

171
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,600
It's just an arrow wound
and a check for injuries.

172
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,360
Every Qingyun Tournament
left me worse than this.

173
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,440
That brat Ji Bozai

174
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,359
actually let me test
the Judgment Hall's traps.

175
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,359
Truly ruthless.

176
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,480
But

177
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,880
if a small price like this

178
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,920
can earn his trust,

179
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,119
it's worth it.

180
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
Even though this wound

181
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,320
has brought you closer
to the Golden Millet Dream,

182
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,600
you must never take such risks again.

183
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,640
Someone's coming. Hide, quickly!

184
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,800
All right.

185
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
<i>I shouldn't have fainted.</i>

186
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
<i>I could've applied it myself.</i>

187
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,040
Lord Ji.

188
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
If it hurts, tell me.

189
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,400
What's wrong?

190
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,000
Every time I was hurt before,

191
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
I was never allowed to complain.

192
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,720
This is the first time
someone has said that to me.

193
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,800
You went through so
much at Moonlit Blossoms.

194
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,560
You'll never

195
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,920
need to go back again.

196
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,520
What medicine is this, Lord Ji?

197
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
It stopped the pain so quickly.

198
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,080
Blood-Calming Powder.

199
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,040
Blood-Calming Powder?

200
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,960
It's a rare medicine.

201
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,360
You really spared no expense.

202
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,520
Don't move.

203
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,760
Warriors treasure
their spiritual power above all.

204
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,400
- Lord Ji, you need not waste it…
- You were injured because of me.

205
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,120
How could I turn a blind eye?

206
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,920
What is it?

207
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
Is the medicine backfiring?

208
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,840
I…

209
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm hungry.

210
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
Feel free to look around!

211
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,560
Come and take a look!

212
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,600
- Cabbages from our own fields!
- Thank you, Lord Ji.

213
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Fresh cabbages!

214
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,800
Take a look!

215
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,240
- Cheap and fresh!
- Take a look!

216
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,240
- Come and take a look!
- Make way, please.

217
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,200
Sir, madam, would you like some fine silk?

218
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,440
- Take a look!
- Scented sachets!

219
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,400
Lord Ji, this place is delightful.

220
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,360
Zhang Tai used to bring me here for fun.

221
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,480
See those spirits?
They've all taken human form.

222
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,480
Isn't it fascinating?

223
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,840
- Take a look at the sachets!
- Come take a look!

224
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,760
All homegrown!

225
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
- No, thanks.
- Flowers!

226
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
- You can…
- Immortal,

227
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,440
buy some flowers for the lady beside you!

228
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,160
…find anything here.

229
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,280
- There's nothing you can't buy.
- Fresh flowers! Take a look!

230
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,160
GRANNY'S EATERY

231
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,400
- You bought quite a lot this time.
- Yes.

232
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,000
My husband asked me to.

233
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,320
Hurry and cover it up.

234
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,640
It won't taste good once it's cold.

235
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
Madam.

236
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
What would you like?

237
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,040
Two scallion pancakes.

238
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,720
Here you go.

239
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,400
Thank you.

240
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,360
What's wrong?

241
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,080
Aren't you hungry?

242
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,120
Scallion pancakes are
my favorite food in the world.

243
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,600
Do you like them too, Lord Ji?

244
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,560
You actually remembered.

245
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
I never forget anything.

246
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,880
Is it really that easy to please you?

247
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,120
It's just a pancake.

248
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
Eat it before it gets cold.

249
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,440
<i>This is from Her Majesty.</i>

250
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
<i>Scallion pancakes, your favorite.</i>

251
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
<i>We wish you victory in the tournament.</i>

252
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,200
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

253
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,600
We'll be waiting for you!

254
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,800
- You can do it!
- Yes.

255
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,240
Your Highness, we'll be waiting for you!

256
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,240
<i>I wonder how Mother is doing.</i>

257
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,640
<i>I must neutralize the poison soon</i>

258
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,480
<i>and return to Yaoguang Mountain.</i>

259
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,200
Ming Yi?

260
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
What's wrong?

261
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,760
Does the wound still hurt?

262
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,560
Let me see.

263
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,800
It… it's healed.

264
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,920
Oh, well…

265
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,640
What's the matter?

266
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,880
Lord Ji, why are you so good to me?

267
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,040
I'm just a little fairy
from Moonlit Blossoms.

268
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,200
Having a place to stay at Wugui Sea

269
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,160
is already a dream come true.

270
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,480
If Wugui Sea gets a true mistress one day,

271
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,040
you'll surely cast me aside.

272
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,840
So why even bother to remember
what I like to eat?

273
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,200
That only feeds my wishful thinking.

274
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,240
<i>She actually has true feelings for me?</i>

275
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,720
When did I ever say I'd cast you aside?

276
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,280
So, are you saying

277
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,600
you won't leave me?

278
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,680
Is that right?

279
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,320
I understand.

280
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
I won't leave you.

281
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,120
What?

282
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,920
<i>Ming Yi's gamble has paid off!</i>

283
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,480
After taking
the Moonshade Grass, Fairy Ruo Shui

284
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,680
has recovered.

285
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,000
Your Lordship, did you just go
to the Huansha Market with Ming Yi?

286
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,640
While stealing the portrait for me,

287
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,360
she deliberately took other treasures

288
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,240
to make it look more like a theft.

289
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,840
As for the spygrass at home,
I blocked its vision with spells.

290
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,080
The Judgment Hall found no clues,

291
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,760
so the case is closed for now.

292
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,240
But Yan Xiao still has men watching me.

293
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,560
I went out to let them think

294
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,240
I spent my days in pleasure.

295
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,480
That serves us well.

296
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,000
- I understand, but…
- I haven't had my revenge.

297
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,320
I have no mind for other things.

298
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,920
I saw these medical books
while cleaning the side hall.

299
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,040
Do they belong to the Princess?

300
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,000
No, these are Immortal Yan's.

301
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,520
Back when he served
at the Jade Rabbit Hall,

302
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,880
these were his favorite books.

303
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Immortal Yan?

304
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,720
You mean Immortal Yan Xiao,
the one serving Lord Hanfeng?

305
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,240
Yes.

306
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,160
But doesn't the Princess despise him?

307
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,320
When he was a guard
at the Jade Rabbit Hall,

308
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
the Princess favored him greatly.

309
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
Later, he studied medicine on his own,
passed the Immortal Examination,

310
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,560
and clung to Lord Hanfeng's power.

311
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,360
Once he rose to prominence, he changed.

312
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,560
He even hid
His Majesty's condition from the Princess.

313
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,920
Naturally, she came to dislike him.

314
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,400
Your Highness,
aren't you going to visit His Majesty?

315
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,400
Let's go.

316
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,680
BOUNDLESS MISTY WATERS

317
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,800
Insolence!

318
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,280
The Princess is here to see His Majesty.

319
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,320
Step aside.

320
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,400
His Majesty is in seclusion.

321
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,760
No one is allowed to disturb him.
Please return, Your Highness.

322
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,800
Father has been unconscious for so long.

323
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,840
Whose order was this?

324
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,840
Lord Hanfeng's?

325
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,000
Has the Jixing Palace
already fallen under his rule?

326
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,040
Your Highness, please go back.

327
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
Today, I will see

328
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,960
whether my words
still hold weight in this palace.

329
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,120
Step aside!

330
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,600
Your Highness.

331
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,920
Those guards defied my command,

332
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
yet you can make them obey.

333
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,640
His Majesty truly needs peace.

334
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,400
Perhaps Your Highness
has been coming too often,

335
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,360
and they feared
it would disturb His Majesty.

336
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
Those servants were out of line.

337
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,440
I will discipline them.

338
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,800
Servants?

339
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,040
Since when do
you have the right to call them that?

340
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,520
Halt.

341
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,840
Without His Majesty's permission,
no one enters.

342
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
I only came to deliver books.

343
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,520
I just want to pick them up.

344
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,480
Go ahead.

345
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,400
RADIANT SUNLIGHT ON ALL CREATURES

346
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,880
You used to trail behind us like a dog.

347
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
After reading a few medical texts,

348
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,840
you think you can
soar to power in one leap?

349
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,520
You think you can become a physician?

350
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,760
What a ridiculous dream!

351
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,640
Are you here today
for the warrior selection

352
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,680
to be held in three days, Your Highness?

353
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,800
Thanks to your superb medical skill,

354
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
my father must still be
lying unconscious, isn't he?

355
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,160
Does the reason for my visit even matter?

356
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,360
In the end, you are the one who decides

357
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,040
whether he wakes to attend the selection,

358
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,040
aren't you?

359
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,200
Surely you jest, Your Highness.

360
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,160
The selection is important.

361
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,360
His Majesty will not be absent.

362
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,400
Then I suppose
I should thank you, Immortal Yan.

363
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,400
And when Ji Bozai and I have our wedding,

364
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
we will also have to rely on you

365
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,600
to make sure Father is present, right?

366
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
With heaven's blessing,

367
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,680
His Majesty will recover for sure.

368
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,480
But are you certain
your wedding with Ji Bozai

369
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,760
will truly happen?

370
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,000
I heard
Immortal Ji already turned you down.

371
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,600
Yes,

372
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,400
that's what makes
it all the more challenging.

373
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,040
I will work very hard to win his heart.

374
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,600
So Your Highness will
marry no one else but him?

375
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,000
Of course.

376
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,400
Who else could I marry?

377
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
You?

378
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Immortal Yan, don't flatter yourself.

379
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,800
Once, I was deceived
by your handsome face.

380
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
But now, I see

381
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,360
that you are nothing special,

382
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,040
even somewhat repulsive.

383
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,040
Even if you marry Ji Bozai,

384
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,120
it doesn't mean you will always
control the Shouhua Academy.

385
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,320
At the end of
the day, he's just a warrior.

386
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,840
- Why do you have to…?
- Because I like him.

387
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,560
Don't you understand?

388
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,640
If I didn't truly like him,

389
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
why would I stake my marriage on him?

390
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,920
If I didn't truly like him,

391
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,760
why would I tolerate his arrogance

392
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,040
and womanizing ways?

393
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,560
- If I didn't truly…
- Enough.

394
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,080
Aren't you great at putting on an act?

395
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,080
This isn't like you.

396
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,680
<i>Xiao!</i>

397
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,720
<i>Xiao!</i>

398
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,160
<i>Xiao!</i>

399
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Xiao, have you been waiting long for me?

400
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm still not grown up yet.

401
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,960
But when I am, I'll marry you, all right?

402
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,720
Are you coming in or not?

403
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,080
Haven't you played enough?

404
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,560
Stop meowing.
If you want to come in, hurry up.

405
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,920
I'm locking the door soon.
No waiting after that.

406
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,920
What are you doing?

407
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,200
Stop meowing already.

408
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,000
- I've got news for you.
- I was talking to the cat.

409
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,480
Guess what good news I brought back?

410
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,880
First,

411
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,440
your younger brother Ming Xin

412
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,040
was carried back to Yaoguang Mountain.

413
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,480
He won't be getting out
of bed for at least a month.

414
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,720
Really?

415
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
How did he manage to
become even more useless?

416
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,400
I've got nothing to say
about that brother of yours.

417
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,520
Still, it works in our favor.

418
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,520
At least no one will bother us for now.

419
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,840
Second,

420
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,320
this is the portrait you drew from memory.

421
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,920
I've found out who it is.

422
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,400
You know who it is?

423
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,240
You'd never guess it.

424
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,760
Stop teasing. Just tell me!

425
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,440
All right…

426
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,240
I was just about to tell you.

427
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
The fairy in the portrait

428
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,719
is named Bo Yulan.

429
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,880
She came from the Bo clan, which was
once renowned across the Six Realms

430
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,440
for its traveling physicians.

431
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,880
The Bo clan?

432
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
The clan that created the Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream?

433
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,199
Exactly. The portrait's ability to move

434
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,920
also comes from one
of the Bo clan's secret arts.

435
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,719
I sneaked into
the Langhuan Pavilion of Jixing Abyss

436
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,040
and checked the records.

437
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,920
They said the Bo clan

438
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
had long lived in
seclusion on Zhangwei Mountain.

439
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,560
But over 20 years ago,

440
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,560
a mountain fire broke out,

441
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,679
and the clan was nearly wiped out.

442
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,320
Since then, there's been no trace of them.

443
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,760
It wasn't a natural fire.

444
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,800
Someone clearly started it

445
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,840
to get the Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream.

446
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,360
My master studied the Bo clan in depth.

447
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
He once told me

448
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,080
never to believe
everything written in books.

449
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,360
The Bo clan was likely destroyed

450
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,880
for having something others desired.

451
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,280
Someone was after their medicine.

452
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,400
So Ji Bozai is connected to Bo Yulan?

453
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,440
No wonder he has the Golden Millet Dream.

454
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
Does this mean he is
a descendant of the Bo clan?

455
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,160
That would make sense.

456
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,720
But then why was Bo Yulan's portrait
in Mu Qibai's hands?

457
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Could it be

458
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,440
that Mu Qibai killed her?

459
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,040
If I were Ji Bozai,

460
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,800
I wouldn't be sitting
around eating dried fish.

461
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
I'd be out for revenge.

462
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,040
How did Ji Bozai end
up in the Sunken Abyss?

463
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,680
There are plenty of crimes
that could send someone there.

464
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,560
What I mean is,

465
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,800
maybe Ji Bozai was framed.

466
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,440
Think about it.

467
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,000
How old was he when he was sent
to the Sunken Abyss?

468
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,360
No one can commit crimes
before they even learn to walk, right?

469
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,760
If Ji Bozai was framed,

470
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,480
are the people in the Sunken Abyss
truly criminals at all?

471
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,320
I am late.

472
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,840
Please forgive me, Lord Hanfeng.

473
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,760
What did you find out yesterday?

474
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,600
Was Ji Bozai the one
who stole the painting?

475
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,760
No wound from
the Soul-Devouring Arrow was found.

476
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,520
Could there be another explanation?

477
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,000
The Judgment Hall
lost a great deal of treasure.

478
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,360
Perhaps the theft was really for money,

479
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,280
not for the painting itself.

480
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,840
I have failed in my duty.

481
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Did the spygrass you placed in Wugui Sea
catch anything?

482
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,120
Please see for yourself.

483
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,360
After I left Wugui Sea,

484
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,920
this is all Ji Bozai did.

485
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,200
<i>- Slow down, Lord Ji.</i>
<i>- When was I ever fast?</i>

486
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,320
The spygrass has been
watching him all this time,

487
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,560
and this filth is all it recorded?

488
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
Forget it.

489
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,160
The warrior selection in three days

490
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,080
requires His Majesty's presence by law.

491
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,560
Make sure nothing goes wrong on your end.

492
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,120
Understood.

493
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,520
I will take my leave.

494
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,480
Your Lordship.

495
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,240
Ji Bozai is likely
aware of our surveillance.

496
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,800
Summon Xun Ming back.

497
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,520
Understood.

498
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,520
Master,

499
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,360
I bow to you on my knees.

500
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,560
I only hope

501
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,600
you will not regret
taking me as your master today.

502
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,760
Master, your compassion and healing arts

503
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,360
saved my life.

504
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,880
I will never regret it.

505
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,480
Master,

506
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
in three days,

507
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,240
I will offer the blood of our first enemy

508
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,880
as tribute to you.

509
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,160
SHOUHUA ACADEMY, JIXING ABYSS

510
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,640
WARRIOR SELECTION, JIXING ABYSS

511
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,320
- Amazing!
- Excellent!

512
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,440
Wonderful!

513
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,120
Being the Chief of
Judgment Hall is such a hassle.

514
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,280
You have to show up everywhere.

515
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,640
The preliminaries have already started,

516
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,320
and Ji Bozai still hasn't shown up.

517
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,200
Can Tianji handle it alone?

518
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
You should call her "the Venerable" now.

519
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,480
Sure, in person.

520
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
But we're talking in private here.

521
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,840
Back then,
you were a guard at Tianji's palace,

522
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,840
and I was her study companion.

523
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,600
Given how close the three of us were,

524
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
in the mortal world,

525
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,520
we would be called
"childhood sweethearts."

526
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,800
And their silly son.

527
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,480
How could you be our son?

528
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,400
Tianji and I were never like that.

529
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,560
What are you talking about?

530
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,400
You know what? I envy you sometimes
for being so clueless.

531
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,040
How am I clueless?

532
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,320
I know everything about Tianji.

533
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,560
There are still many people

534
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,360
who don't recognize her as the Venerable.

535
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,200
Even if Ji Bozai doesn't show up,

536
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,040
His Majesty will surely
come to support her, right?

537
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,920
Rabbit candy. Your favorite.

538
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,840
Nice move.

539
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,480
Perfect timing for a strike.

540
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,520
The first half of the selection is over.

541
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,480
Please wait for the second half.

542
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,720
Your Highness, half the rounds are done,

543
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,600
and Immortal Ji still hasn't appeared.

544
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,640
Immortal Ji is here.

545
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,120
Immortal Ji is here.

546
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,560
Who's that beside him?

547
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,760
- That's inappropriate.
- Who's that beside him?

548
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,640
Isn't that the fairy
from Moonlit Blossoms?

549
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,120
He brought a female companion?

550
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,960
That's so disrespectful to the Princess.

551
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,440
I've heard of
your exploits before, Immortal Ji,

552
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,960
but I didn't expect to
witness one firsthand today.

553
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,200
Your affection is enviable.

554
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,240
But this is a warrior selection.

555
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,760
Do you really need a female companion?

556
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,000
Exactly.

557
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,040
You are embarrassing the Princess!

558
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,360
You're wearing an amulet
your child gave you, aren't you?

559
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,000
What? This is…

560
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,800
She's my amulet too.
