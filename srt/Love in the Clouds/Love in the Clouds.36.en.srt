1
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,960
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,280
It's beautiful here.

3
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,080
So beautiful.

4
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
I wish time

5
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
could stop at this precious moment.

6
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,040
Yet, it's time to wake up.

7
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
Is my dream not beautiful to you?

8
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,880
Why do you want to wake up?

9
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,440
Because I have family and friends,

10
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,840
and all lives of the Six Realms
need us to seal the Sky-Swallowing Array.

11
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
Who are you?

12
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
I am the ruler of
the netherbeast army from Cangwu Hill.

13
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,560
Lin Ziyao.

14
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
I've finally found someone

15
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,520
who is truly willing
to sacrifice for the Six Realms.

16
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,360
You are the Spiritual Veins Fairy

17
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,279
who caused the Netherbeast Calamity
a hundred years ago.

18
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,400
Yes.

19
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
I used a spell to hide the last
trace of my divine consciousness

20
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
inside this Sky-Swallowing Array.

21
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,640
I have long waited for someone
from a later time to meet me here.

22
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,080
Fairy Lin,
what exactly happened back then?

23
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,160
The Netherbeast Calamity a century ago
was not my doing.

24
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
Let me tell you the truth.

25
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
A hundred years ago,

26
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
the Emperor of Zhushui bred netherbeasts
to rule over the Six Realms.

27
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,000
But he knew that refining them
would damage his primordial spirit.

28
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Hence, he used love as bait

29
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,560
and tricked me into raising
the netherbeasts at Cangwu Hill.

30
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,840
When I discovered
his plot to destroy the world,

31
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,480
I tried to stop him, and failed.

32
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
He ended up imprisoning me.

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,240
While I was imprisoned,
the Emperor of Zhushui

34
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,600
released the netherbeasts to wreak havoc.

35
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,720
Countless lives across
the Six Realms perished

36
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
and war spread once again.

37
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,000
To the outside world, he pretended
to have destroyed the netherbeasts

38
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,040
and acted like a savior.

39
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,560
To truly end the disaster,

40
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,080
I had to trick him into performing
the Heartbond Array with me

41
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
to subdue the netherbeasts.

42
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,400
But he had planned ahead.

43
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,160
He used me as a tribute
and forged the ancient forbidden spell,

44
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,520
the Sky-Swallowing Array.

45
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,760
He set the Sky-Swallowing Array
inside the Zhuojin Tower.

46
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,280
He planned to activate
it during the Qingyun Tournament,

47
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
to seize the source
of spiritual power from the Nine Heavens,

48
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
and consume all the Blessed Rain

49
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
so he could control the Six Realms.

50
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,040
The Sky-Swallowing Array
must be cultivated for a century.

51
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,920
It required someone from the Bo clan
who possessed the special spiritual veins

52
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,560
born from Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream

53
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,120
to truly unlock it.

54
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,080
You had already passed away,

55
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
but with your spiritual power

56
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
you sealed the last of
your divine consciousness

57
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
inside the Sky-Swallowing Array,

58
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,280
all to stop the Emperor of Zhushui.

59
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,720
Correct.

60
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,200
Only those who are
willing to sacrifice themselves

61
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,480
and offer their lives
as tribute can see me.

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,080
Only then do we have
a chance to save the Six Realms of Hexu.

63
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,800
Fairy Lin,

64
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,400
did you know the Emperor of Zhushui
blamed everything on you?

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,440
He claimed that you raised
netherbeasts and brought chaos.

66
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
Every Spiritual Veins Fairy after you
was seen as a bad omen.

67
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,920
I never imagined

68
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,120
that I would become the excuse
to condemn the fairies of the future.

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,240
How ridiculous.

70
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,080
To seal the Sky-Swallowing Array,

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,680
someone at the Transcendent Stage
must die to destroy it.

72
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,440
You are both at the Transcendent Stage.

73
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,680
Luckily, you entered the array together.

74
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,280
Your divine consciousness is connected,

75
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,840
and, most importantly,
your hearts are in sync.

76
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
You trust each other.

77
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,800
I have a plan.

78
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,120
With the last of my spiritual power,
I can merge your spiritual veins.

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,600
That will grant
you the strength of the Perfected Stage.

80
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
You may escape safely and destroy
the Sky-Swallowing Array.

81
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,000
You must protect the Six Realms

82
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,600
and change everything.

83
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,200
We will not fail you.

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,520
The Six Realms will finally have
the justice they deserve.

85
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,799
The peace of the Six Realms
will be in your hands now, younglings.

86
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
Ming Yi, you're alive!

87
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,240
What have you done?

88
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Chao Yuan.

89
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,520
Everything the Zhushui Spiritual State
has done must come to an end today.

90
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
Impossible.

91
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,520
None of you will ever defeat me.

92
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,840
No one in this world

93
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,480
will ever surpass me again!

94
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,040
My loyal soul shall live and die with you.

95
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,920
My loyal soul shall live and die with you.

96
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,920
Bear witness!
We guard the Primordial Realm.

97
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,840
What is happening?

98
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,080
No idea.

99
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Wake up!

100
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
What's going on?

101
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,160
Ming Yi.

102
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,880
I remember now.

103
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,120
My life has never had any real worth.

104
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,240
But back then,

105
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,320
I met you.

106
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Do you think I could ever be like you?

107
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,400
My whole life feels like a joke.

108
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Ming Yi.

109
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,520
Do you still remember our promise?

110
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Immortal Situ.
In the end, I was the one who owed you.

111
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
Ming Yi, promise me one thing.

112
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,000
I haven't decided yet.

113
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,720
But whatever it is I ask for,

114
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,760
you'll make it happen for me, won't you?

115
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,920
Right?

116
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,600
I've decided.

117
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
In the next life,

118
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,960
let's meet again and start over.

119
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,920
I hope that in your next life,
you'll live for yourself.

120
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,440
The Emperor of Zhushui,
Chao Heng, and Crown Prince Chao Yuan

121
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,320
attempted to control the Six Realms
during the Qingyun Tournament

122
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
by manipulating the Sky-Swallowing Array.

123
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
Their crimes were unforgivable.

124
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,520
Both have met their end.

125
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,680
This announcement is made
to Hexu to set the record straight.

126
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
CHAO HENG OF ZHUSHUI SPIRITUAL STATE

127
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,040
The Sunken Abyss is gone.

128
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,800
We stopped Zhushui Spiritual State's plot.

129
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,520
As for Chao Heng,
he was overthrown by the traitors.

130
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,480
In future Qingyun Tournaments,

131
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,720
the title of the top
warrior of the Six Realms

132
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,880
will be decided with only fairness.

133
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,720
From now on, the Six Realms'
Blessed Rain will be shared equally

134
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,600
between the Upper and Lower Realms.

135
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,160
Fairy Bo.

136
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,240
The truth is, the debt between us
can never really be settled.

137
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
But I do know that

138
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,280
when you first came to find me,

139
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,079
you truly wanted to save me.

140
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,960
And I also know

141
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,119
that you taught me
with everything you had.

142
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,480
You protected me with your own life,

143
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,000
so I could cure the poison,

144
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
and live safely until today,

145
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,000
and see for myself
what this world is really like.

146
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,600
So, you see,

147
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,440
I have no right to hate you.

148
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,600
Whether you did it to atone for your sins,

149
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,600
or out of kindness and loyalty,
either way,

150
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,800
I could never repay you.

151
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,960
From this moment on,

152
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,040
you may rest in peace.

153
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,240
Under the proposal
of Empress Tianji of Jixing Abyss,

154
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,920
the rulers of all realms
reached a joint decision.

155
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
From now on, the Qingyun Tournament

156
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
will have only one final round.

157
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,440
The tests of spiritual power
will end once a clear result is shown.

158
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
No matter the outcome,

159
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,960
all Six Realms will share
the Blessed Rain of the Nine Heavens.

160
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
-Great!
-Wonderful!

161
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,760
That's wonderful.

162
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Come on, tell us
about Ming Yi and Ji Bozai.

163
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,800
Is he still a warrior of Jixing Abyss?

164
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,280
The final match was interrupted.

165
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,200
The rematch is next month.

166
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,840
Does that mean Ming Yi
will face Ji Bozai once more?

167
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,320
-Exactly.
-That's right.

168
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,840
That Ji Bozai really is something.

169
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,840
He's carefree and reckless, as always.

170
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,200
When the Emperor of Yaoguang
asked what his future plans were,

171
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,360
he said he only wanted
to remain a warrior in the warrior ranks.

172
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,120
The Emperor of Yaoguang
was furious about it, of course.

173
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
But Ji Bozai told him,

174
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,240
"Your Majesty, you're still in your prime.

175
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,320
You could always
raise another crown prince."

176
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,080
That's exactly what Ji Bozai would say.

177
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,520
Only he could come up
with something like that.

178
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,040
You're telling me.

179
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,280
-Exactly.
-Totally.

180
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,320
So, he is living on Yaoguang Mountain,

181
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,760
apart from Ming Yi
who is now at Jixing Abyss?

182
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,040
Ji Bozai still has the Spirit Well.

183
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,640
That's right.

184
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,080
He can bend space itself.

185
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,240
So meeting up isn't a problem at all.

186
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,760
Those two really are quite the pair.

187
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,400
They can fall in love one moment,

188
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,560
then fight side by side the next.

189
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,600
They manage to do
both without missing a beat.

190
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
Exactly.

191
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,560
I really do wonder
which of the two of them

192
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,680
is the strongest in all Six Realms.

193
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,680
We'll find out next month.

194
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,640
I can't wait to see who will actually win.

195
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
Speaking of Ming Yi,

196
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,200
her spiritual veins are said
to be the purest and strongest of all.

197
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,320
It's simply peerless.

198
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,960
Why did you catch so few fish?

199
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,400
Next time you go fishing, take me along.

200
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,560
By the way, where did you catch them?

201
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,480
They taste amazing once they're dried.

202
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,920
You never stop eating or talking. Shut it.

203
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,800
I was trapped
inside that bell for so long,

204
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,840
I couldn't even eat a single dried fish.

205
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,520
Now I just want to make it up
to myself, what's wrong with that?

206
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll catch you a whole bucket tomorrow.

207
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,520
Are you coming with me?

208
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,200
Of course I am.

209
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,920
The dried fish I eat
has to be handpicked by me.

210
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,400
You'll just catch them for me.

211
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,200
So, who do you think will win?

212
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Ji Bozai or Ming Yi?

213
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,200
-That's obvious…
-Of course it's Ming Yi, right?

214
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,800
-I…
-I told you so. Think about it.

215
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,160
Ming Yi has defeated
every opponent across the Six Realms.

216
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,520
If it weren't for the Heavenly Grief,
she would have won.

217
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
I wouldn't be so sure.

218
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,480
His Lordship's
spiritual veins have recovered.

219
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,520
He also has the Spirit Well.

220
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,640
What about the Spirit Well?

221
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,560
Is it really that powerful?

222
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,880
Can it surpass
Ming Yi's extraordinary veins?

223
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,600
Besides, she has that unbeatable
companion beast, Twenty-Seven.

224
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,840
Then, stop eating your dried fish.

225
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,160
Fine, I won't.

226
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,880
Their strength is evenly matched, though.

227
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,200
Ming Yi will win for sure.

228
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,600
No, His Lordship will.

229
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,560
-Ming Yi will win.
-His Lordship will win.

230
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,920
-Ming Yi will win.
-His Lordship will win.

231
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
Ming Yi will win!

232
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,840
Ladies, if there's any jewelry
you like, just tell me.

233
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,320
I'll knock a few spirit
stones off the price today.

234
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,600
Come and have a look!

235
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,600
Oh my!

236
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,480
You're having twins!

237
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,600
-Can you please be more careful?
-It's fine.

238
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,760
You've gone from
running a stall to owning a shop.

239
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,280
You're earning even more Blessed Rain now,

240
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,920
but that doesn't mean
you should get too excited.

241
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
I'm not that fragile.

242
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
Empress Tianji has issued a decree.

243
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,920
Even non-warriors
can enter the Outer Realm.

244
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,760
Ming Yi, Ji Bozai, Zheng Tiao,
and I, can travel freely now.

245
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,680
Of course I'm happy about it.

246
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,360
My love.

247
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,960
I missed you.

248
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I missed you too.

249
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll get back to work.

250
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,280
Take your time.

251
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Ming Yi told me to keep tomorrow free.

252
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,680
She probably has something planned.

253
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,880
I heard that Immortal Ji proposed
to Fairy Ming Yi several times,

254
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,920
but she turned him down.

255
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,520
So what?

256
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,400
Ming Yi doesn't have to say yes
just because he proposed.

257
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,320
If you ask me,
I wouldn't want to marry either.

258
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,720
Marriage only ties people down.

259
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,400
It makes them soft.
How can you focus on your career that way?

260
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Your Majesty, don't worry.

261
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,040
I'll do everything I can to assist you.

262
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,680
I'll protect Jixing Abyss

263
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,280
and never let you waver even for a moment.

264
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,200
You're surprisingly understanding.

265
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,040
Well then…

266
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,640
Will you do so even
without a name or a title?

267
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,360
I think

268
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
that's fine with me.

269
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,480
If that day truly comes,

270
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,120
when you become just
one butterfly among millions,

271
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,520
no different from the rest,

272
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,280
I would still recognize you.

273
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,960
This wine of yours is quite good.

274
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,600
Fairy Ming Yi,
I brewed it for you with Blessing Flowers.

275
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,720
Really?

276
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,440
You dare to steal my food?

277
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
Why are you fighting with a child?

278
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,800
Why are you fighting your brother?

279
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Don't you have your own?

280
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
-So unfair.
-How is that unfair?

281
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,800
Wine!

282
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
The cat can't drink that.

283
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,440
Ming Yi.

284
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
Zhang Tai!

285
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,120
No.

286
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,480
Careful, the baby.

287
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
-I forgot.
-It's fine.

288
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,480
Sorry.

289
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,600
Happy birthday.

290
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,640
You didn't have to bring a gift.

291
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
-Zhang Tai chose it carefully.
-Didn't you?

292
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
Come out quickly.
Stop troubling your mother.

293
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,680
-Come play with your brother.
-I see now.

294
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
So that's why you asked me
to keep today free.

295
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,960
It's your birthday.

296
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,080
Empress.

297
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,880
You only prepared one gift?

298
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm not the only one celebrating today.

299
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
Try it.

300
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,600
But don't eat too much.

301
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll accept it on his behalf.

302
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,000
Other than Master Ming Yi,
who else has a birthday today?

303
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,480
Chen Xi.

304
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,680
-You're not as quick-witted as I am now.
-Where is he?

305
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
Of course he's…

306
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,400
Immortal Ji, happy birthday.

307
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,840
Don't move.

308
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,040
-Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi.
-Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi.

309
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,640
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

310
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Happy birthday.

311
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,920
Wishing you good health.

312
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,640
Wait.

313
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,880
What a lively crowd.

314
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,920
You lot of rascals,
you're all behaving outrageously.

315
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,560
How could you drink without inviting me?

316
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,760
Father.

317
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,760
My precious daughter, happy birthday.

318
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,600
And happy birthday to you too.

319
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,800
Originally, I had arranged
with Emperor Cangwu

320
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,720
to go teach the children to cultivate
their spiritual power at his place.

321
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,560
But when I received this invitation
saying it was your birthday banquet,

322
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
how could I miss it?

323
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
I changed my plans at once
and hurried here.

324
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,840
Next month, you two will return to
the finals' arena.

325
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,720
You little devil, I'm telling you,
last year my daughter drew Heavenly Grief,

326
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,840
that doesn't count.

327
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,680
This year you must
really compete properly.

328
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,400
I'll warn you first,
do not, because of personal feelings,

329
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,720
let him win.

330
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,400
Master She is right.

331
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,760
Don't go easy on me.

332
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,560
Father.

333
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,160
Men won't slow my sword-drawing speed.

334
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,960
That's my precious daughter.

335
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,520
She'll have
you picking teeth off the ground.

336
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,880
Someone wants to be my son-in-law?

337
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,200
But it's not that easy.

338
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,520
You must pass my test.

339
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,040
Father, don't organize it,
nobody will drink.

340
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,480
Dare you?

341
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
If you dare, come with me.

342
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,400
-Come on.
-Don't.

343
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,680
This one was brewed by Meng Yangqiu.

344
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,600
Just humor him, don't show off.

345
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,160
Try it.

346
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,960
-It's delicious.
-Twenty-Seven.

347
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,200
You've eaten so much and you still eat?

348
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,600
You've taken mine twice.

349
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,840
How did you get this drunk?

350
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,120
With my father's capacity for wine,
no one would've been able to crawl out.

351
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,080
This way.

352
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,280
So then, he must've gone easy on you.

353
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,560
How much did you drink? About two jars?

354
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,840
I drank…

355
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,120
How many was that?

356
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,720
Slow down.

357
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,040
No, don't lie here.

358
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,920
Just a few more steps.

359
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
Come on.

360
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,080
What do you mean?

361
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,720
A wall.

362
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,240
A whole wall of wine?

363
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,920
A wall of wine, you two…

364
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,880
My father-in-law said
he wanted to test my character.

365
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,080
How could I possibly lose?

366
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,920
Of course I had to drink.

367
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,880
You could've shown a bit
of weakness, it wouldn't kill you.

368
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,880
What is it?

369
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,480
This is outside, no, that's not good.

370
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,320
Scallion pancake.

371
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,880
This taste…

372
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,080
It was the Empress of Yaoguang
who asked me to bring it to you.

373
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,840
She also wanted me to tell you,
happy birthday.

374
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,280
How is she?

375
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,880
She…

376
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,240
His Majesty has already…

377
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,120
already lifted her confinement.

378
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,840
But she still doesn't dare to see you.

379
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,480
In a few days, I'll go see her.

380
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,800
I've never seen you like this before.

381
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,000
Could you be like this more often?

382
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
Like what?

383
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,560
Just show me this side of you sometimes.

384
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,840
A little.

385
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,760
That tickles.

386
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,560
Ming Yi.

387
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,040
Actually…

388
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,800
I…

389
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,760
I…

390
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,560
I still owe you an apology.

391
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,120
I said,

392
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,360
I still owe you an apology.

393
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,160
The Sky-Swallowing Array, right?

394
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,800
Indeed, you shouldn't
have hidden it from me.

395
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
So what do we do?

396
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,080
But I lied to you before as well.

397
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,280
So I owe you an apology too.

398
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,040
That makes us even.

399
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,320
But we must promise
never to deceive each other again.

400
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,320
Never to deceive each other.

401
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
What are you doing?

402
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,040
What… What are you doing?

403
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,120
I want to do this.

404
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
What?

405
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,520
I want.

406
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
You want to do this?

407
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,800
I like this.

408
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
I like you.

409
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,880
I've never told you before.

410
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,680
I like you.

411
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,840
I really, truly like you.

412
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,600
I want to be with you, forever and ever.

413
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,000
I want to stay by
your side forever and ever.

414
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,520
Will you…

415
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,200
Will you never,

416
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
ever leave me?

417
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
All right.

418
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,360
Really?

419
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,960
You… You've accepted my proposal?

420
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,800
Wait.

421
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,600
That just now was a proposal?

422
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,280
That's all it takes?

423
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,280
Then could we rewrite our names
together on the Marriage Stone?

424
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,440
I… I'm asking you.

425
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,080
I want to rewrite our names
on the Marriage Stone…

426
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,840
Why won't you answer me?

427
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,000
I already have.

428
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,520
What are you doing?

429
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,800
Do you think
you can eavesdrop on His Lordship?

430
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,679
You know,
after the Qingyun Tournament ends,

431
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,800
you'll be traveling
through the Six Realms.

432
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,920
You won't have
another chance to eavesdrop.

433
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,040
Right now, it's your master's
final great trial in life.

434
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,239
Final great trial in life?

435
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,480
Makes sense.

436
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,360
No peeking, kids.
What are you two looking at here?

437
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,520
-I…
-Go back quickly.

438
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
Go back.

439
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,520
Still watching? What's there to see?
Go back.

440
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,880
Hurry back.

441
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
Let's go, Granny Xun.

442
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
Let's go.

443
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,840
-Let's go.
-You little brats,

444
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,240
I'll deal with you later.

445
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,040
What exactly must
we carve on the Marriage Stone

446
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,480
to make sure
we aren't punished by the heavens?

447
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,320
Carve Ming Yi and Ming Xian?

448
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
That sounds too strange.

449
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,840
I don't want you changing
your name back to Ming Xian.

450
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,200
I was jealous of that guy long enough.

451
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,880
Then we can't carve
Ji Bozai and Ming Yi again, can we?

452
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
Let me think.

453
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,920
Maybe this time
it'll work without any trouble.

454
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,560
After all, the last time we came here,
we both held something back.

455
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,040
Especially you.

456
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,080
You complete liar.

457
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,120
Then let's try again.

458
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,480
This time, I'll do the carving.

459
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,880
After all, the Marriage Stone
teaches couples this way.

460
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,240
Even divine punishment
should be taken in turns.

461
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,800
Go ahead.

462
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,200
I'm joking.

463
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
I'll do it.

464
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,320
JI BOZAI

465
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,240
JI BOZAI, MING YI

466
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,120
JI BOZAI, MING YI

467
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
-Let's congratulate
-Let's congratulate

468
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
-this old couple
-this old couple

469
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,200
-on their renewed bond of love!
-on their renewed bond of love!

470
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,480
So it really is true.

471
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,440
See? I told you it would be like this.

472
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,400
If back then you'd given me
even a little more sincerity,

473
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,600
I wouldn't have had
to face the lightning tribulation.

474
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Ji Bozai.

475
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,840
I… I was only joking with you.

476
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
I didn't mean it seriously.

477
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,640
Are you really angry?

478
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,960
The names were just carved
and you're already…

479
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,280
All right, it's my fault, all right?

480
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,080
I'll apologise to you.

481
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,040
Ji Bozai, I already…

482
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,120
Who do you think will win?

483
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,240
I think Ming Yi looks promising.

484
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,600
-I bet Ming Yi wins.
-I bet Ji Bozai wins.

485
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,760
After all, she's won seven years in a row.

486
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,560
The only time she lost
was because of Heavenly Grief.

487
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,840
-Right.
-I'm not so sure.

488
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,680
I heard Ji Bozai
has made a breakthrough lately.

489
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,680
He's reached the Perfected Stage.

490
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,480
Then we can win too.

491
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,120
Ming Yi
has also reached the Perfected Stage.

492
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,600
-Ji Bozai for sure.
-He's incredible.

493
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,080
No, Ming Yi will win for sure.

494
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,520
Fairy Ming Yi, please.

495
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
Immortal Ji Bozai,
please grant me your guidance.

496
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
THE END
