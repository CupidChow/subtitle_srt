00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 34

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,240
You still haven't explained
why you must see Ji Bozai.

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,680
How do I know you will not harm him?

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,400
I know that,
because of my current identity,

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,600
it is hard for Your Majesty to trust me.

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,040
But if I wished to harm Ji Bozai,

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
I've had hundreds of chances to do it.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,320
Why would I wait until now?

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,280
Your Majesty, please let Fairy Ming Yi in.

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,760
His Lordship's spiritual veins
are shattered,

12
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,800
and his pulse is faint.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,600
His spiritual veins are shattered?

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Your Majesty,

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,600
right now, I'm the only one
who can save your Crown Prince.

16
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,280
You must let me see him.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Ji Bozai promised me
that he had cut ties with his past.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,480
That's why I agreed not to punish you
for your crimes.

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
After this,

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
don't come to Yaoguang Mountain again.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,440
Buxiu, Twenty-Seven, stand guard outside.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,120
Don't let anyone learn of
Ji Bozai's condition.

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,240
-Understood.
-Understood.

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,480
Back then, because of the absence
of the Diwu tree's core,

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
the Golden Millet Dream
that my lord took was incomplete.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
It could only suppress
the poison temporarily,

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
and there was always a risk of relapse.

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
Before she died,

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,800
Fairy Bo refined a complete
Golden Millet Dream.

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
But my lord refused to take it.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
He used it as bait
to draw out his enemies.

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,040
He's suffering a relapse now

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,640
because he burned through
his spiritual power

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,000
to refine the Golden Millet Dream again.

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
Not only did he exhaust
his spiritual power,

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,040
but he also forced open his Spirit Well
to save you.

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
he's suffering a complete relapse
of the Heavenly Grief.

38
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,200
Your heart's blood?

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Why would you use your heart's blood?

40
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,320
Ming Yi,

41
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,920
how much of it do you even
have to give before it drains you dry?

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So what?

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Have you ever thought about
how it feels for me to see you like this?

44
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,040
You knew you would relapse,

45
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,240
yet you still gave me
the Golden Millet Dream.

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,000
You never told me. I didn't know a thing.

47
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I just received my master's reply.

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,720
He said he still hadn't found the
Diwu tree's core.

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
What am I supposed to use to save you?

50
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
You know that without
the Diwu tree's core,

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,440
even with the recipe,

52
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,840
the Golden Millet Dream can't be made.

53
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
So why risk your life doing this?

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
Shut up.

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
Ming Yi. Ming Yi.

56
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Ji Bozai,

57
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,880
I used to think that in this life,

58
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,600
I'd always be trapped
in the name of Ming Xian,

59
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
never able to be myself

60
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,640
or know how it felt to love someone.

61
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
But because of…

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
because of you,

63
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,320
everything changed.

64
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,640
So don't hide everything from me

65
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
and make me…

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,040
make me stand by and watch you die.

67
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
I won't let that happen.

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,080
Enough.

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,040
Ming Yi,

70
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,760
you've already done more than enough.

71
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
I thought I'd never see you again.

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,280
Ji Bozai.

73
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
There, there.

74
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm fine now.

75
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
Did you really think

76
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,840
I'd just sit by and watch you
make the Golden Millet Dream?

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
If you want it,

78
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,440
take it.

79
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Don't play tricks on me.

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You used a winged leech against Ji Bozai

81
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
to trigger a relapse of the
Heavenly Grief?

82
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,640
I truly underestimated you before.

83
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
But tell me, Chao Yuan,

84
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,400
why would someone as cautious as Ji Bozai

85
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
let you get close to him so easily?

86
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,520
Father, everyone has a weakness.

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
And Ji Bozai's weakness

88
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,920
-is love.
-Love?

89
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,840
Who could he possibly love?

90
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Don't tell me it's Ming Xian.

91
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,480
The upheaval at Yaoguang Mountain
is no secret to anyone.

92
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,920
Ming Xian usurped
Ji Bozai's title and power,

93
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,720
and yet he ended up falling
in love with her?

94
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
How utterly laughable.

95
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,920
Indeed, Father.

96
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
In your eyes,

97
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,880
all emotions must seem laughable.

98
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
What, are you displeased with me?

99
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,240
I would never dare.

100
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,520
You have lived for over a century

101
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,320
and witnessed the rise
and fall of countless things.

102
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,760
Naturally, nothing moves you anymore.

103
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Someone like me could never

104
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
compare to even a fraction
of your insight or cultivation.

105
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,280
Now, hand over the Diwu tree at once.

106
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,600
Once I make the Golden Millet Dream,

107
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,520
you shall have your share,

108
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,800
and you will finally have
what you've always wanted:

109
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
spiritual veins of your own.

110
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,560
Since I've accomplished
such a great task for you, Father,

111
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
could you reward me with
the title of Crown Prince?

112
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
Insolent!

113
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,880
So you meant to bargain with me all along?

114
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,040
Hand over the Diwu tree now!

115
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,680
Unfortunately,

116
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,440
I've already planted it in my heart.

117
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,320
If you want it…

118
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,920
Father,

119
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
if you had hesitated for even a moment,

120
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,560
just one moment,

121
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
I would not have done this to you.

122
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,920
You… you are just like that woman.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,480
You both betrayed me.

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,160
The Golden Millet Dream
is already within me,

125
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
and Chao Yan is dead.

126
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,000
I am the only son you have left.

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,720
It is time you told me how
you really plan to seize control

128
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,560
of the Six Realms.

129
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
You wretch.

130
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
If you tell me everything, Father,

131
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,840
I will

132
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,560
spare your life.

133
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,760
Fine. I will tell you.

134
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,320
I once foolishly believed

135
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,960
that I could share my ambitions

136
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
with the one I loved,

137
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,320
and that we could rule
the Six Realms together.

138
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,640
However…

139
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,120
Your Majesty, you promised me

140
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,240
that you would form
the Heartbond Array with me.

141
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,760
What exactly is this Heartbond Array?

142
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,720
It can enhance the power
of the netherbeasts, of course.

143
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,640
You know I would never do anything
that could harm you.

144
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,560
She… she lied to me.

145
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,040
The Heartbond Array sealed
the netherbeasts.

146
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I truly cared for her,

147
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,520
but she betrayed me

148
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,360
and ruined my grand plan.

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
You lied to me.

150
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,680
You and I should both go to hell together.

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
DIVINE CRIMSON PALACE

152
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,640
Lin Ziyao,

153
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,080
even without the netherbeast army,

154
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,760
I still have the Sky-Swallowing Array.

155
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,280
You have already
reached the Perfected Stage.

156
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,720
By sacrificing you

157
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,360
and combining that with the Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream,

158
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,720
I will be able to activate the array,

159
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,800
seize all the Blessed Rain
of the Six Realms,

160
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,040
and rule them all!

161
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Now you see, Chao Yuan,

162
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,400
how foolish I once was.

163
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,520
To achieve true dominion,

164
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,280
one must cast aside all emotion.

165
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,040
Father, you can rest now.

166
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
I will not take your life.

167
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,520
I finally understand
why you became who you are now.

168
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,560
But I am not like you.

169
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Emotion does not make me weak.

170
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
It only makes me stronger.

171
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,960
In celebration of Prince Chao Yuan's
appointment as Crown Prince,

172
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,599
Zhushui Spiritual State will exhibit

173
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,079
the long-lost treasure of the Six Realms,

174
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,640
the Diwu tree, at the Zhushui Palace.

175
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,000
This announcement
is to be shared across Hexu.

176
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,440
-Ming Yi!
-What are you doing here?

177
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Buxiu and Twenty-Seven sent me a message.

178
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,920
They…

179
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Wait, what's wrong? You look pale.

180
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm fine.

181
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,760
I just got word that the Diwu tree
is in Chao Yuan's hands.

182
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,520
I'm going to Zhushui Spiritual State.

183
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,720
You mustn't go!

184
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,560
That boy is setting a trap for you.

185
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
That little brat.

186
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
Even back when he was Situ Ling,

187
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
he had already tricked me
into revealing too much.

188
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,160
He knows the final catalyst herb for
the Golden Millet Dream is the Diwu tree.

189
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,840
But I am clearly his target.

190
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,720
Even if it's a trap,
even if it's a deadly one,

191
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,080
I have to go.

192
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,640
As expected, it's fake.

193
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,320
Should I call you Situ Ling

194
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,120
or Chao Yuan?

195
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,680
You can call me whatever you like.

196
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
I don't think you ever wanted

197
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
to return to Zhushui Spiritual State
as its prince.

198
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,280
What made you decide to
become Chao Yuan again

199
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
and abandon your life as Situ Ling?

200
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Ming Yi,

201
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,880
as soon as Ji Bozai's life was in danger,

202
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,920
I spread word across the Six Realms

203
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,160
that the Diwu tree was in my possession.

204
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,720
You're clever. You must have realized

205
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,560
that his relapse was my doing,

206
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,920
and that the Diwu tree

207
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,720
was the bait I set for you.

208
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200
You knew there would be a trap,

209
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,360
but you still came.

210
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
For him,

211
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
you would really risk everything,

212
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
even knowing you're walking
straight into a trap, wouldn't you?

213
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
Chao Yuan,

214
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,120
why don't you just tell me

215
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,600
what I have to do to
get the Diwu tree's core?

216
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't you already know

217
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,320
what I want from you?

218
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,200
Ming Yi,

219
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
this is the wedding gown
I prepared for you.

220
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Chao Yuan,

221
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,360
you're a Crown Prince now.

222
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,160
You've captured me,

223
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,960
yet instead of eliminating
a powerful rival for your father

224
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,640
before the Qingyun Tournament,

225
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,280
you're holding a ridiculous wedding?

226
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,320
Yes.

227
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,560
Compared to eliminating a rival
before the Qingyun Tournament,

228
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,600
I actually want this wedding more.

229
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,600
Even I don't know

230
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,400
how important

231
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,760
you've become to me.

232
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,120
You want the Diwu tree?

233
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,480
I can give it to you.

234
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,360
I can give you anything you want,

235
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
as long as you marry me.

236
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,440
Sure.

237
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,200
It's just marriage. Fine by me.

238
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,720
I see that you've formed spiritual veins.

239
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,880
You must have

240
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,560
used the Diwu tree's core to make
the Golden Millet Dream.

241
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,720
Since the Diwu tree
is no longer useful to you,

242
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,760
give it to me,

243
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,720
and I'll marry you.

244
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,840
I'll marry you once, twice,
however many times you want.

245
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,360
How could you say
that like it means nothing to you?

246
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,160
You were once the only reason I was alive.

247
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
Why do you have to hurt me like this?

248
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,080
Once?

249
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,600
What about now?

250
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,720
Are you living for yourself now?

251
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,880
As long as you're by my side,

252
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,320
nothing else matters.

253
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,280
Is that so?

254
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,040
Then let me be the
Crown Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State.

255
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,600
It's true. I'm not the same as before.

256
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,320
But from now on,
as long as you're with me,

257
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,880
you won't need to fight for recognition
like in Jixing Abyss,

258
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,600
or fear being abandoned

259
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,360
like in Yaoguang Mountain.

260
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,280
But that's not love.

261
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,560
If you love someone,

262
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,440
you won't dig a pit for her to fall into.

263
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,240
You won't trap her here.

264
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,000
And you won't hurt
the people she cares about.

265
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,720
The people she cares about?

266
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,920
Ming Yi,

267
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,280
who do you care about most?

268
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,840
Is it Ji Bozai?

269
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,800
Why do you care about him?

270
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,840
Why can't you love me, even a little?

271
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
What does he have that I don't?

272
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
Why do you choose him and not me?

273
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,400
Ming Yi,

274
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
can't you try to love me,
even just a little?

275
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
Just a little.

276
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,400
The Diwu tree is right here.

277
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,800
Shall we continue? I don't mind.

278
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,560
Ji Bozai?

279
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,520
You tricked me.

280
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,600
But I am clearly Chao Yuan's target.

281
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,520
Even if it's a trap,

282
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,480
-even if it's a deadly one…
-Wait.

283
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,440
I have to go.

284
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,960
Perfect timing. Talk some sense into her.

285
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,960
You can't go alone.

286
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,280
-Don't try to dissuade me.
-I mean, I know I can't stop you.

287
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,760
I'll go with you.

288
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,280
Chao Yuan wants to lure
you into a meeting,

289
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,040
and it's clear
he intends to claim you for himself.

290
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,960
So, I'll disguise myself as you
and meet him.

291
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,880
That way, we can buy some time.

292
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,760
Meanwhile, you and the others

293
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,920
can search Zhushui Palace
for the Diwu tree.

294
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,880
A trap for a trap. You're welcome.

295
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,400
Your Heavenly Grief has flared up.

296
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,080
You're already at your limit.

297
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,480
Are you really going to fight me?

298
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,880
Are you all right?

299
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,680
Not dying yet.

300
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Immortal Situ,

301
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
this may be the last time I call you that.

302
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,600
Now that I've been cured
of the Heavenly Grief,

303
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,760
you're no match for me.

304
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,560
Give up.

305
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,520
I was wondering how
your spiritual veins recovered.

306
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,680
Ji Bozai
doesn't have the Golden Millet Dream.

307
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,920
He spread false news

308
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,440
to lure those who covet it.

309
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,800
He never had the antidote.

310
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,720
You lied to me.

311
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,040
Ji Bozai had
the Golden Millet Dream all along.

312
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,000
He gave you the antidote.

313
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,480
How touching.

314
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,920
You're both willing to risk your
lives to protect each other.

315
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,360
I suppose

316
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,040
you really are a perfect match.

317
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,440
This…

318
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,080
hurts more than being killed.

319
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,960
You planted the Diwu tree
in your own heart?

320
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
What are you doing?

321
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
You…

322
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,080
You…

323
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,400
Isn't the Diwu tree so precious to you?

324
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,840
Then let me

325
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,280
destroy it

326
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,240
right before your eyes!

327
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,800
Chao Yuan.

328
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
Chao Yuan!

329
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,440
Let's go.

330
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,400
You're not going anywhere.

331
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,800
Ji Bozai!

332
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,440
Your Lordship, we've taken down
all the guards outside.

333
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,520
Let's wait for her outside.

334
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,320
Why save me?

335
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,800
Wouldn't it be better

336
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,880
to let me die?

337
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,480
Chao Yuan,

338
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,040
I once told you

339
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,800
that you might develop
spiritual veins of your own one day

340
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,680
or change the rule

341
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,600
that only those with spiritual veins
could become warriors,

342
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,520
and that one day,
you'd become truly powerful.

343
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,680
Now, you've done it.

344
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,120
You've become
Crown Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State

345
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,840
and developed spiritual veins.

346
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,800
You've achieved it all.

347
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,360
But are you still yourself?

348
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,480
Since you've chosen to be Chao Yuan,

349
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,040
our paths have diverged.

350
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,880
When we meet again, don't hold back.

351
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,960
It's done! I've made
the Golden Millet Dream!

352
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,480
Really? Really!

353
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,760
Fairy Ming Yi, please wait.

354
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Before it's refined,
it can't be taken directly.

355
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,600
It must be planted
in the body to take effect.

356
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Let me do it.

357
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
Ji Bozai…

358
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,080
-Ji Bozai!
-Your Lordship.

359
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,440
What's happening?

360
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,920
His spiritual veins have recovered,

361
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
and the Heavenly Grief is gone.

362
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,600
Why is this happening?

363
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,840
The Golden Millet Dream
can purge the poison,

364
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,480
but it's excruciating to have
it planted in the body.

365
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
It feels as if
one were being flayed alive.

366
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,040
But when he put the Golden Millet Dream
into a scallion pancake

367
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,760
and tricked me into eating it, I didn't…

368
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,080
Because His Lordship

369
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,520
took all the pain for you
when refining the Golden Millet Dream.

370
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,440
Now that it has come to this,

371
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,800
there's something
I must tell you on his behalf.

372
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
The truth is,

373
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,480
he never truly wanted to leave you.

374
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,720
He learned the secret
of the Sky-Swallowing Array.

375
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,280
When he said those things to you,

376
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
he was simply using the sharpest blade

377
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,800
to sever his bond with you.

378
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,480
Ming Yi…

379
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,120
Master She.

380
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,240
Let's go prepare medicine
for His Lordship.

381
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,480
All right. Go ahead.

382
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,600
You know Buxiu isn't exactly the sharpest.

383
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,600
And he can never control
the heat properly.

384
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,520
Right.

385
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,960
We can't do it without you.

386
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,640
Come on, Master She.

387
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,680
You two

388
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,000
really can't do anything without me,
can you?

389
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,320
-Yes, you're right.
-I told you

390
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,000
to watch and learn
when I refined medicine, didn't I?

391
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,880
-Yes, you did.
-You should've paid attention.

392
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,120
But did you?

393
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,560
I'm cured.

394
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,360
Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,720
Tell you what?

396
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,920
You refined the Golden Millet Dream

397
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,960
in your own way, didn't you?

398
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,600
That's why I didn't feel any pain
when I took it.

399
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,280
It was nothing worth mentioning.

400
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,480
Buxiu really can't keep a secret.

401
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,320
Nothing worth mentioning?

402
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,920
Fine. Then here's another question.

403
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,560
Why did you decide on your own

404
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,560
to stop the Sky-Swallowing Array
by sacrificing yourself?

405
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,040
You forced open
your Spirit Well to save me,

406
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,120
and that caused the relapse
of the Heavenly Grief.

407
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,280
You couldn't even handle the winged leech
that Situ Ling gave you.

408
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,600
If Buxiu hadn't told me all this,

409
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,440
were you planning to keep it from me
until the day you died?

410
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,360
I made that decision long ago.

411
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,240
There was no need to tell you.

412
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,920
Hold it steady, cat claws.

413
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,080
Don't spill it.

414
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,600
It took a lot of effort to brew.

415
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,560
Yes, Master She.

416
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,520
0And mind you,
the herbs are very expensive.

417
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,960
What's going on?

418
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,120
Did His Lordship wake up?

419
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,280
He did,

420
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,040
but he might not be coming out
anytime soon.

421
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,040
That won't do!

422
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,720
-Ming Yi! Ming Yi!
-Master She, calm down.

423
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,880
Master She.
Ming Yi was the one who sealed us out.

424
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,360
Maybe we shouldn't interfere
in whatever they're doing.

425
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,520
We shouldn't interfere?

426
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,760
That's my daughter in there!

427
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
She can't be taken advantage of!

428
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,240
-Ming Yi!
-Calm down…

429
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Uh, the medicine's gone cold.

430
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,280
We should reheat it.

431
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,000
Just warm it up with your spiritual power.

432
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,040
No, Master She,

433
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,520
it'll mean more if you do it yourself.

434
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,560
You two, let go of me!

435
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,400
You ungrateful brats. How dare you!

436
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,680
I raised you for nothing!

437
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,360
My Heavenly Grief is gone.

438
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,120
You think you can keep me here?

439
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,280
Do you enjoy clinging to me like this?

440
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,800
I do.

441
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
There's nothing I enjoy more.

442
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,400
I'm not arguing with you.

443
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,960
Have you ever thought about
what my life would be like

444
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,600
if you went off to die alone?
