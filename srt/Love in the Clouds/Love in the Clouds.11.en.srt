1
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,000
My younger cousin
might be absent-minded sometimes

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,160
but she has many people proposing to her.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,360
However, I am very picky
as her older cousin.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,520
I think no one is good enough for her

6
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,040
besides the First General
of the Six Realms.

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,040
A while ago, at the same place,

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
you mentioned

9
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,040
using my body to
help you raise netherbeasts.

10
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,360
Are you using
your younger cousin as a bargaining chip?

11
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,320
You can refuse, General.
Just assume I've never mentioned this.

12
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
I see.

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,760
EPISODE 11

14
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,320
If you had been sincere

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,240
in buying back Xinliu's freedom,

16
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
why did you even marry her?

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
You should've let her go.

18
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,680
Instead, you kept
her in the Dengxian Cave.

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Is this what you call freedom, huh?

20
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
No.

21
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,960
That's not it.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
It's you.

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
It's all of you!

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,640
Why must you doubt Xinliu's love for you?

25
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Ji Bozai.

26
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
Little fairy,

27
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,400
listen well.

28
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,200
I planned all of this

29
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
just to take Ji Bozai's life.

30
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,960
You and Zhang Tai have no value to me.

31
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,040
I can release both of you.

32
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,760
But you will be the one

33
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,680
to decide.

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,240
TOMB OF BELOVED WIFE XINLIU

35
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
What are you doing?

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Kill him

37
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,200
and I'll release you and Zhang Tai.

38
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
-What do you think?
-Dream on!

39
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,040
I will never hurt Ji Bozai.

40
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,520
Dream on!

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,400
No. I'll never…

42
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll never…

43
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
No.

44
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,720
What?

45
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Don't tell me you've
truly fallen for Ji Bozai.

46
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,520
There's no true love

47
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
without sacrifice.

48
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,880
You are wrong.

49
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
You are wrong.

50
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
If he can die for you,

51
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm sure he will feel happy.

52
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
No!

53
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,000
You are wrong.

54
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,480
I will live on with Ji Bozai.

55
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,720
Why didn't she kill you?

56
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Why didn't she kill you?

57
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
Why?

58
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,840
Why?

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,640
-Ji Bozai. Come back.
-Why?

60
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Come back.

61
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
Get out.

62
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,160
How are you?

63
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
Ming Yi.

64
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,280
As long as you kill Ji Bozai,
I will spare you and Zhang Tai.

65
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,200
Why didn't you choose the easy way?

66
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,800
Why should I do as you wish
and become trash like you?

67
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,120
How dare you scold me?

68
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
So what? Do I need to pick a day for that?

69
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,559
Mu Xinliu is dead.

70
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
So you captured

71
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,720
every fairy that resembled her
to be your puppet

72
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,280
and control them like
how you controlled Xinliu.

73
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,960
This is not true love!

74
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,760
It seems like you are
no longer trying to save her.

75
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,640
-Zhang Tai.
-Ming Yi.

76
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Xun Ming.

77
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
When you possessed me just now,

78
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,960
I could feel a seal in your memory.

79
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,680
Perhaps there's
another story to Xinliu's death.

80
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,800
What did you say?

81
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,800
Have you thought about this?

82
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Perhaps your memory with Xinliu

83
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,600
was altered.

84
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,760
Xun Ming, think carefully.

85
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
Dengxian Cave has never
seen any sunlight in the valley.

86
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,120
Why is the cave always bright
in your memory?

87
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,520
Also,

88
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
there were many "Zheng" characters carved

89
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,200
at Luosheng Forest and Dengxian Cave.

90
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
Do you really not know what they mean?

91
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,120
Or are you purposely avoiding the truth?

92
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Why?

93
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,160
Did Xinliu not want to stay here?

94
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,280
Where are my true memories?

95
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Why can't I see them?

96
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,280
The seal on your memories

97
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,120
can only be opened by an external force.

98
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Why don't we make a deal?

99
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,800
I'll help you undo the seal

100
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
and you release Zhang Tai.

101
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,640
Why should I trust you?

102
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Don't you want to know the truth?

103
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Divine souls of all realms,

104
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm willing to give away all my memories

105
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,760
without any regrets.

106
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
You should practice the qin
in Luosheng Forest more often.

107
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,640
Yes, Qibai.

108
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,880
Xinliu,

109
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,480
I want you to tell me

110
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,720
whether you have
true feelings for me or not,

111
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,400
you're the only one I love.

112
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,840
Xinliu,

113
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,240
say it to me.

114
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
Quickly.

115
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm back.

116
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
General, you leave early
and come back late recently.

117
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
You're being secretive

118
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,640
and you have blood on your clothes.

119
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,080
What are you doing, General?

120
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
Xinliu,

121
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Lord Hanfeng has agreed to our marriage.

122
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,720
The condition
is that I raise netherbeasts for him.

123
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
When the netherbeasts mature,

124
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
he will be the ruler of Jixing Abyss.

125
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
So all your injuries

126
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,680
came from the netherbeasts?

127
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
I'm willing

128
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
to do anything for you.

129
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,840
If someone finds out,

130
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,960
you should escape first.

131
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,200
After I hide my primordial spirit,

132
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
I will escape from this place to meet you.

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,280
Why must you do this?

134
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,880
You put yourself

135
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
and me in a cage.

136
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,880
Don't even think about leaving me!

137
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,480
Xinliu,

138
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,440
tell me. Whether
you have true feelings for me or not,

139
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,800
you're the only one

140
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
I love.

141
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,000
General,

142
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,760
I found the medicine to treat your body
at Jixing Palace.

143
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Thank you.

144
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm very fortunate

145
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
to have you as my wife.

146
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,400
I heard the Heartbond Array
can suppress the netherbeasts' power.

147
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,480
The side effect on
you is getting more serious.

148
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,600
My spiritual power is too weak
to cultivate the Heartbond Array with you.

149
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,720
Why don't you

150
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,840
undo the heart imprint with me

151
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,360
and find a stronger
fairy to cultivate with you?

152
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,880
Even without the Heartbond Array,

153
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,720
I can still find a way to
suppress the netherbeasts.

154
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,440
Don't even think about it.

155
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,160
No matter what,

156
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
I will not

157
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,880
let go of you forever.

158
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
What happened to your wrist?

159
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,200
I was distraught

160
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,800
and got hurt myself.

161
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,079
You used your blood

162
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,520
to concoct the medicine for me?

163
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,960
Xinliu,

164
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,000
don't hurt yourself for my sake anymore.

165
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,640
General, you are really good

166
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
at lying to yourself.

167
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,320
General.

168
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,880
Don't worry.

169
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,800
I can suppress it.

170
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
General, drink this medicine.

171
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,080
The netherbeasts' influence

172
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,080
can only be resisted with
a strong enough spiritual power.

173
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,800
What I just fed you

174
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,200
only made you weaker.

175
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,440
Why?

176
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
Why can't the netherbeast kill you?

177
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,240
-Why?
-You know why.

178
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,440
You know very well why!

179
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,480
Xun Ming, I hate you.

180
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,440
I hate you so much!

181
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,680
I hate all of you.

182
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,120
I hate all of you!

183
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Why must you marry me? Why?

184
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,840
Why must you trap me here?

185
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,280
It's just one life.

186
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,160
If you want it,

187
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
I'll give you everything.

188
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,720
Xinliu.

189
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Xinliu.

190
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,760
It turns out

191
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,000
I won't taste any freedom in my life.

192
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,680
This isn't true. This isn't true!

193
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,600
Xun Ming, these are all true.

194
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,160
All the beautiful memories you have

195
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,400
were fantasies created by your obsession.

196
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,120
Did you really love her?

197
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,360
-You only love yourself.
-That's enough.

198
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,560
Quit that act of a loyal husband.

199
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
It's time to keep your promise

200
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
and release Zhang Tai.

201
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,920
Don't you know

202
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,280
that foxes

203
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,880
are the most cunning

204
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,200
and the most untrustworthy?

205
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,120
You want to save her?

206
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,280
Dream on!

207
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,360
Xun Ming, do you still not get it?

208
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Mu Qibai altered your memories

209
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,480
so you will let him use you
to raise netherbeasts.

210
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,640
Do you think you can stop Mu Qibai?

211
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,280
Even if you can stop Mu Qibai,

212
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,880
you still can't stop
the person behind him.

213
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,000
What do you mean?

214
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,160
Why bother asking?

215
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,640
Today,

216
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,880
our souls

217
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,680
will be laid to rest here.

218
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,960
He is trying to destroy the Illusory Realm
and trap us here forever.

219
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,600
Let's go.

220
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,040
Zhang Tai's primordial spirit
is still in Xun Ming's hands.

221
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
-I…
-If you can't let go of her,

222
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,760
you can die with her.

223
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,920
Ming Yi!

224
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,000
-Ming Yi.
-The exit is closing.

225
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,680
We can't die here. Go!

226
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
How troublesome.

227
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,000
The passage is going to disappear. Go.

228
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
Go!

229
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Die here with me!

230
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
Ji Bozai!

231
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,080
Biting off more than you can chew.

232
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,640
What a fool.

233
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
We still don't know who the fool is yet.

234
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,880
Disperse all evil and return
everything to its primordial state.

235
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,320
Break!

236
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Zhang Tai.

237
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,560
Ming Yi!

238
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,960
Ming Yi!

239
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,000
Ming Yi!

240
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,920
Grief Blossom?

241
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,280
Were you poisoned by the Heavenly Grief?

242
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,880
She can't find out about my identity.

243
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,760
Ji Bozai.

244
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,880
Ji Bozai.

245
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Ji Bozai.

246
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Ji Bozai.

247
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,640
Ji Bozai forced
you to show your true form,

248
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,520
and here you are venting your anger at me.

249
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,800
He is not as disgusting as you, liar!

250
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,920
It seems like you've
remembered everything.

251
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,000
Xun Ming.

252
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,240
I saw how useless you were

253
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,320
and couldn't accept
the truth of Xinliu's death

254
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,640
so I helped you

255
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,280
by sealing your true memories.

256
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,720
Instead

257
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,920
of thanking me, you wish to go against me?

258
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,480
Have you forgotten?

259
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,720
Everything you can do means nothing

260
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,440
before the netherbeasts.

261
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
The Illusory Realm was broken.

262
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,240
You are just a spent tool.

263
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,920
You are no longer useful to me.

264
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,160
Even if I die here,

265
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,600
you will still meet
your nasty ending one day.

266
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,160
Nasty ending?

267
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,280
Since the day we raised netherbeasts,

268
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,480
His Lordship has discarded all humanity.

269
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,920
Only by raising netherbeasts

270
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,080
can Jixing Abyss
obtain the strongest power

271
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,960
and be a part of the Upper Realms forever.

272
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,480
What His Lordship is doing
is a small sacrifice for the greater good.

273
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,760
Wretches like you know nothing.

274
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,880
Sacrifice is inevitable

275
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,720
on the path to greatness.

276
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,800
When it is necessary,

277
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,840
I can even sacrifice
the person closest to me.

278
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If killing at this level

279
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,160
results in divine punishments or karma,

280
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,000
all the more reason for me

281
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,360
to rewrite the divine law.

282
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,680
Your Highness,

283
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,640
our next plan is…

284
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,920
First, it was Hou Zhao.
Then, it was Xun Ming.

285
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,880
Ji Bozai is avenging Bo Yulan.

286
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,000
His next target

287
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,320
will be me.

288
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,680
Ji Bozai is fighting for Jixing Abyss.

289
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
We can't do anything to him.

290
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,960
If we want to ruin Ji Bozai,

291
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,640
we must first remove
his identity as a warrior.

292
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,560
My Lord, you're awake.

293
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,920
Come.

294
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,480
Granny Xun and I
made this medicine for you.

295
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,240
How did we escape?

296
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,440
Thankfully, you created the exit.
We spent a lot of effort escaping.

297
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,600
Jixing Abyss's general
died during our wedding.

298
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,400
Someone from
Judgment Hall was here, right?

299
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,480
Yes. Zhang Tai was saved thanks to you.

300
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,440
After she recovered,

301
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,800
she went to
Judgment Hall with Immortal Situ

302
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,840
to accuse Xun Ming

303
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,040
of abducting fairies everywhere

304
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,320
to harvest their primordial spirit.

305
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,080
Later, Lord Hanfeng arrived

306
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,600
and said Xun Ming
committed suicide out of guilt before him.

307
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,120
Judgment Hall
stripped Xun Ming's title as a general

308
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,520
and pronounced him a criminal.

309
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,720
He still died in
Mu Qibai's hands after all.

310
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
You knew

311
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,720
who I've been trying to avenge,

312
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
didn't you?

313
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
Yes.

314
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,000
When you asked Ruo Shui
to accuse her father, Hou Zhao,

315
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,800
you weren't planning to hide it anyway.

316
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,600
I've been by your side
for so long and I'm not a fool.

317
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,280
In this current situation,

318
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,800
I'm afraid Mu Qibai already knows

319
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
that you are trying to
punish those who harmed Fairy Bo.

320
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,480
I'm not from Judgment Hall.
How can I punish them?

321
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
You could've killed all of them

322
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,600
but you spent all your efforts
searching for evidence

323
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,760
to turn them into criminals.

324
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,800
Aren't you doing that

325
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,719
because you don't want
them to die as innocent people?

326
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,600
So, you were the one telling Zhang Tai

327
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
how to accuse Xun Ming

328
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,280
at Judgment Hall.

329
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,440
Yes.

330
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,199
They hurt the innocent

331
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,560
and abducted immortals to the Sunken Abyss
to make them suffer.

332
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,880
They should be punished.

333
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,719
They are the real criminals after all.

334
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
Speaking of which,

335
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,920
when the Illusory Realm collapsed,

336
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,800
you could've abandoned me.

337
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,199
Why did you return to save me?

338
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,360
Who knows?

339
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,920
Why are you smiling?
Do I need a reason to save you?

340
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,800
I've always been kind. You know that.

341
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,720
I'm even keeping Ming Xian's stupid fan
so I can return it to him.

342
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,440
He is my rival after all.

343
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,400
You fought Ming Xian

344
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,120
because you had
a wager with Princess Tianji

345
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,360
and had to win.

346
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,040
Since you mentioned

347
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,640
how honest and kind you are,

348
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,680
had it not crossed your mind
to use any dirty tricks back then?

349
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
For example,

350
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,840
poisoning Ming Xian?

351
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
Is that what you think of me?

352
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
Why should I poison him?

353
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
If I want to win,

354
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,640
I can just win
against him fair and square.

355
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,760
If I lose,

356
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,760
dying to him isn't
something embarrassing either.

357
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,040
I see.

358
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,880
You are an honest person.

359
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm guessing that Ming Xian

360
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,960
is also happy to
have an opponent like you.

361
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,960
Those who were
fortunate enough to fight against you

362
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,800
must have had

363
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,200
their most exhilarating battle ever

364
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,200
because you are not an opponent…

365
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,840
but a despicable person?

366
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,320
…but a close friend.

367
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,120
You don't believe in anyone, right?

368
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,360
You won't eat anything
that has been touched by others.

369
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
Right now,

370
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,920
there's someone
who is willing to trust you.

371
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,760
I wonder

372
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
if you are willing to trust us more.

373
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,320
I trust you.

374
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
Immortal Situ.

375
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,080
Please come again another day.

376
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,880
Immortal Ji and Fairy Ming Yi are asleep.

377
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,560
Someone's here.

378
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,760
It's our wedding night.

379
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,560
Should we let a night visitor of Wugui Sea

380
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,680
see us planning some important business?

381
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,920
You are a philanderer, My Lord.

382
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,720
Instead of consummating

383
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,200
on your wedding night,

384
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,640
are you plotting to kill someone else?

385
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,800
You've left Moonlit Blossoms for so long.

386
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Have you forgotten how to act?

387
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,840
You saw it through?

388
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,640
Saw what through?

389
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,600
That you are not a philanderer?

390
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,160
Or

391
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,680
that you are just…

392
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,400
Ming Yi.

393
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,960
We should let our visitor
have a clearer view, at least.

394
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,760
You tricked me.

395
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,760
How can you act when your will is so weak?

396
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,240
You're biting me for real?
If I get hurt, it's on you.

397
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,760
There's no one here.

398
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,640
He's still around.

399
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,680
-There's no one at all.
-Who told you so?

400
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,960
Weren't you immersed in your act?
Continue.

401
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,680
You tricked me like this too,

402
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,000
when you first
brought me back to Wugui Sea.

403
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,400
The first night.

404
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,640
It was you

405
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,200
who caused the fire on our first night.

406
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,240
Also,
if I hadn't rejected you the next morning,

407
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,600
-does it mean…
-Yes.

408
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,920
I was thinking of an excuse.

409
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,160
Perhaps your heavy makeup

410
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,640
or bad taste in outfit.

411
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,680
Perhaps I'd say you smelled too good.

412
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,720
Ming Yi.

413
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,680
If I tell you

414
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,240
that I…

415
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,440
SHE TIANLIN, MING XIAN'S MASTER
