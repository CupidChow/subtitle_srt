1
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,720
Situ Ling let you out of the Sunken Abyss.

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,120
Then Lord Hanfeng had me

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,480
go through all that trouble
to capture you one by one.

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
It took so long and so much Blessed Rain

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,040
to fatten you up nicely.

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,440
How could I let you go now?

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,440
We are surrounded by powerful enemies.

9
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
We can't keep Ji Bozai under control,

10
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
so we must offer you

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,520
to the netherbeasts as soon as possible

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,760
to help them grow into an army.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,280
Sir, please let us go!

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,320
Please let us go!

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,720
Please spare us!

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Have mercy on us, sir!

17
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,320
Aren't you afraid?

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,880
Of you?

19
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,840
EPISODE 15

20
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Do you really think
this act of yours will work?

21
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,400
The more unpredictable our moves,

22
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
the more likely we are to confuse others.

23
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
So you mean

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Ji Bozai's sudden visit

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,840
must have alerted Mu Qibai,

26
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
and for his own safety,

27
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,160
he likely sent most of his men,

28
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,320
if not all, to Moonlit Blossoms.

29
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,160
It's uncertain if our plan will work,

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
but it's worth a try.

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
If their defenses have weakened,

32
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,840
we have a chance

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,720
at finding the method Xinliu
mentioned for breeding netherbeasts.

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Right.

35
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll be back soon.

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,200
This time, I'll find out
what that old fox's been hiding!

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
By the way,

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,920
the ledger Mu Qibai keeps,

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,760
the one recording
the dealings of Heavenly Grief,

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,480
is probably at Dragon Carp Terrace too.

41
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll sneak in and look for it.

42
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,040
Be careful this time.

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Don't worry.

44
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,120
Where did Mu Qibai hide it?

45
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,560
Why is this room so hot?

46
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,240
You never learn, do you?

47
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,200
We meet again, Kitten. Relax.

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,720
This time, I won't pretend
to let you escape.

49
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll just kill you.

50
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,600
I knew you were behind this.

51
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,440
Kitten, you've got sharp claws.

52
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,320
Messing with you is always such fun.

53
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,640
It's quite fun to mess with you too.

54
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,320
You brought backup this time?

55
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,600
GRANNY'S EATERY

56
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,120
Scallion, it's ready.

57
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,840
Take it to that table.

58
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Wheat, bring this one over too.

59
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,400
You weren't even
surprised to see me in human form.

60
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,120
You and your lord must know quite a lot.

61
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,360
Ji Bozai may not have
reached the Perfected Stage yet,

62
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,200
but he's long attained
the Transcendent Stage,

63
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,039
so it's not surprising that he has
a shapeshifting companion beast.

64
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,600
Besides, Ji Bozai
still doesn't fully trust

65
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,120
Ming Yi or me,

66
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
so I knew he'd

67
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,040
send you to keep an eye on me.

68
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,160
Scallion pancakes with dried fish.

69
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
My first time making them.

70
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm not sure how it tastes.

71
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,640
-Please, enjoy.
-Thank you.

72
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
You, a dragon,

73
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,680
are openly walking around the market.
Are you sure that's fine?

74
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,040
-His Lordship has…
-Please, enjoy.

75
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Thank you.

76
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,000
His Lordship has already
gone head-to-head with them.

77
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
I don't need to stay hidden anymore.

78
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
That's true.

79
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,600
Do you want some fish?

80
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
You dragons all eat fish, right?

81
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,720
I have a name.

82
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,760
Eat. Then go back.

83
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,680
You won't even tell me your name.

84
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,520
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

85
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,160
It's Buxiu.

86
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm Twenty-Seven.

87
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
Buxiu.

88
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,440
That's a good name.

89
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,920
Honestly, I kind of envy you dragons.

90
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
You are big and majestic.

91
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,200
And when you take human form,

92
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,400
you're pretty well built too.

93
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
You're leaving already?

94
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Wait for me!

95
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,840
BENEVOLENCE,
KINDNESS, WISDOM, AND PROPRIETY

96
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,160
Yuanfeng, isn't it funny?

97
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,480
That Ji Bozai

98
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,120
actually came to negotiate peace with me.

99
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,360
We talked all night.

100
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,480
Clearly, he was

101
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
trying to distract me.

102
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,000
Luckily, I sent men
to guard Dragon Carp Terrace.

103
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
Lord Hanfeng, he…

104
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Get lost.

105
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
Yes, My Lord.

106
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
Yuanfeng, you're asleep

107
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
and unaware of what's happening outside.

108
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,120
I once admired Ji Bozai's talent

109
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,520
and wanted him to serve Jixing Abyss.

110
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,600
Who would have thought
he'd only want to stand against me?

111
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,400
Yuanfeng,

112
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,280
he understands nothing.

113
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,720
Winning a single
Qingyun Tournament for Jixing Abyss

114
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,040
means nothing.

115
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
Only by raising

116
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,600
the netherbeasts into an army

117
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,520
and harnessing their power

118
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,240
will Jixing Abyss truly fear no one.

119
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,080
Yuanfeng,

120
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,240
for Jixing Abyss to grow strong,

121
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,280
some sacrifices

122
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
must be made.

123
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,600
I failed in my duty.

124
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,400
The intruder escaped.

125
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
What did you just say?

126
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,800
I…

127
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,400
I failed in my duty. The intruder…

128
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,680
Ji Bozai was too cunning.

129
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,640
He had a backup plan
and sent someone to help.

130
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,960
That person carried the same aura as he.

131
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,480
I suspect it was his companion beast.

132
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,160
It's likely

133
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,440
Ji Bozai has concealed
his true cultivation stage,

134
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
and his companion beast has
already learned to take human form.

135
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,800
They didn't find anything else, did they?

136
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,960
No. I swear, Lord Hanfeng,

137
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,480
I didn't give away
the existence of the Soul-Consuming Tree!

138
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,000
I failed in my duty.

139
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,960
After arguing

140
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,000
with Ming Yi, Ji Bozai was thrown out

141
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,880
and stayed the night at Moonlit Blossoms.

142
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
So we monitored
Shouhua Academy as ordered,

143
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
watching Ming Yi all night.

144
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,560
But unexpectedly, Ji Bozai

145
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,600
somehow made
Ming Xian's white cat obey him,

146
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
and together with
his companion beast,

147
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,240
-the cat…
-Yan Xiao!

148
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,880
During your days of
training at Shouhua Academy,

149
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,520
you really played
the dutiful physician well,

150
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,320
working in perfect sync with Ji Bozai.

151
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,520
I saw it every day,

152
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
and I couldn't help but wonder

153
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,160
-if you were…
-I only wanted

154
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,640
to avoid worsening my
relationship with Ji Bozai.

155
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,320
Otherwise, it would've been
even harder to get things done.

156
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I have no ulterior motives.

157
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
I ask for your discernment, Lord Hanfeng.

158
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
Me too.

159
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,040
I've spent so much effort on it,

160
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,160
but it seems this
useless thing will never grow tall.

161
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,720
I should pull it out.

162
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,160
I know of a folk remedy

163
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
that might help this Hanqing Bamboo.

164
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
You can heal plants too?

165
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
-I will fetch the materials right away.
-Fetch the materials?

166
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,200
If I remember correctly,

167
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,240
the key ingredient

168
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
in that remedy is teeth, isn't it?

169
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,600
Yes.

170
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,200
Teeth…

171
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,440
ground into powder.

172
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
I never said

173
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,120
I wanted your teeth.

174
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
I'll do it myself.

175
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,080
You are truly skilled in medicine.

176
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
You even cured Sun Liao's foul mouth.

177
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,960
Now, about caring for my brother,

178
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,960
nothing will go wrong, right?

179
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,160
I will do my utmost, Your Lordship.

180
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,920
That tree is
definitely more than it seems.

181
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
Mu Qibai loves plants,

182
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
but in his entire courtyard,

183
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,200
only that tree is thriving.

184
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,440
It's as if it's draining all the others

185
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,680
to feed itself.

186
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
The one I saw in Hou Zhao's memories

187
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,520
must have been that tree.

188
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,520
It likely extends from the courtyard

189
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,400
into a hidden chamber underground.

190
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,800
Its roots looked demonic.

191
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,640
If it can drain other trees,

192
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,280
it might

193
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,240
also consume primordial spirits.

194
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I once read

195
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,400
about an ancient
technique from the Mangfu Swamp.

196
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,640
It allows one to extract
a person's primordial spirit

197
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,960
and bind it to a towering tree,

198
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,960
turning the tree into
a Soul-Consuming Tree.

199
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,839
The air around it reeks of blood.

200
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,680
Such trees can preserve primordial spirits

201
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,280
until someone uses them.

202
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,079
Could this be
the same method Xinliu mentioned

203
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,079
for breeding netherbeasts?

204
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,800
The best nourishment for a netherbeast

205
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,160
is the primordial
spirit of a living being.

206
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,040
A century ago,
netherbeasts ravaged the realms,

207
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,599
devouring everyone in their path.

208
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,840
Even the Spiritual Veins Fairies
who raised them

209
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,960
were eaten alive.

210
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,960
If Mu Qibai

211
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,240
gathers these beasts into an army,

212
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
there will be disastrous consequences.

213
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,280
This is serious.

214
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
We should report
it to the Emperor of Jixing.

215
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,000
The Emperor has long
been under Mu Qibai's control,

216
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,800
trapped in slumber for years.

217
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,040
He's no different from a puppet.

218
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,960
Then maybe we should
alert the other five realms.

219
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,720
Those in power

220
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
are all the same.

221
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,680
If they learn

222
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,480
of a netherbeast army,

223
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,720
they'll only want to
claim it for themselves

224
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,040
and use it to dominate the Six Realms.

225
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,760
Not all who hold power are slaves to it.

226
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,520
Some still care for the lives of others.

227
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,600
We should try to unite as many as we can.

228
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,760
Unite? That's impossible.

229
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,080
But we're too few in number.

230
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
Those netherbeasts are far too strong.

231
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,040
If we fail to stop Mu Qibai,

232
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,320
what will happen to the Six Realms?

233
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,800
You grew up safely in Yaoguang Palace,

234
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,360
receiving support from
the Lower Realms for seven years.

235
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
Naturally, you believe there are still

236
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,800
righteous people in the Six Realms.

237
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,360
If you had spent even
a single day in the Sunken Abyss,

238
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,160
you would understand

239
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,960
how greedy and malicious people can be.

240
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,160
If the netherbeast army is ever exposed,

241
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
before Mu Qibai even stirs up trouble,

242
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,760
the Six Realms will all
fall into chaos over that power,

243
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,160
and Yaoguang Mountain
will be no exception.

244
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,640
The fact

245
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,920
that you take no pride in your background

246
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,840
is already rare enough.

247
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
So just being born in an Upper Realm

248
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,880
is already considered rare.

249
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,440
Tianji has issued a decree.

250
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,600
Starting today, the training is over.

251
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,800
You no longer need to
stay at Shouhua Academy.

252
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
Head back now.

253
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,600
I don't want this companion beast

254
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,720
to get into any more
trouble while in my care.

255
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,560
ZHUSHUI SPIRITUAL STATE

256
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,560
Greetings, Father.

257
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,320
Chao Yu,

258
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,440
you've done well quelling the rebellion

259
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
in Cangwu Hill.

260
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,560
Is there any reward you wish for?

261
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,080
It was only my duty. I wish for nothing.

262
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,360
You deserve a reward.

263
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,520
How about I grant
you the title of Lord Jingxi?

264
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,480
That would be a great honor, Father.

265
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,280
But truly,

266
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,680
-all I wish is to help you…
-By the way,

267
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,280
rumors have been
spreading through the Judgment Hall

268
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,400
and the Medical Hall

269
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
that I intend to name you Crown Prince.

270
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,040
Have you heard such talk?

271
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,800
Let me show you something.

272
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,800
The tongues of those
who spread the rumors are all inside.

273
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
They… they brought this upon themselves.

274
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
I'll ask you again.

275
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
You deserve a reward.

276
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,200
How about I grant
you the title of Lord Jingxi?

277
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
Father, please believe me.

278
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,400
I live only to serve and support you.

279
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
I have no ulterior ambitions.

280
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,000
Please believe me, Father!

281
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,080
Congratulations, My Lord,

282
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,480
on receiving the title of Lord Jingxi.

283
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,600
Get lost!

284
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,600
Forgive me, My Lord.

285
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,560
I thought you had the Crown Prince's
seat in the bag this time.

286
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,000
But I just heard

287
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,240
that Father only gave
you the title of Lord Jingxi

288
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,800
and even killed a few of your men.

289
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
Did you come here to mock me?

290
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,120
I wouldn't dare.

291
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,920
Father hasn't named a Crown Prince yet

292
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
because he has many sons

293
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
and wants to see who proves himself best.

294
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,760
But I truly hope

295
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,520
you'll be the one named Crown Prince.

296
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,320
What are you getting at?

297
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,600
Do you know

298
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,240
where Chao Yuan has
been these past few months?

299
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,120
That good-for-nothing?
Where else could he go?

300
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,920
He heard

301
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,840
Jixing Abyss was refining
medicine in the Sunken Abyss

302
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,840
and went to seek the Golden Millet Dream.

303
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,440
What?

304
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,440
Yu, you were always
kind to Chao Yuan growing up.

305
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,600
But if he finds
the Golden Millet Dream first

306
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
and brings it to Father,

307
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,160
do you think

308
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,040
Father will allow him
to cultivate spiritual veins?

309
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,000
That will be a great accomplishment.

310
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,640
Do you think it will earn him

311
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
a chance at the Crown Prince's seat?

312
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,320
What?

313
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,760
That great man is
coming to Jixing Abyss in person?

314
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,280
Yes.

315
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,960
But since he's a warrior,
he cannot enter the realm.

316
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,520
He specifically asked
that Your Lordship go out to greet him

317
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,440
and escort him.

318
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Your Lordship.

319
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
After all these days,

320
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,080
Mu Qibai has finally
left Dragon Carp Terrace.

321
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
Yes.

322
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,440
He prepared a ship and a carriage.

323
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,840
It seems he's going on a long journey.

324
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,280
I placed the Tracking Seal Ming Yi made

325
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,640
on his vehicles.

326
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,880
For the next 12 hours,

327
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,360
we'll be able to track his movements.

328
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,560
Those little trinkets she's made

329
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,120
really do come in handy.

330
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,320
Indeed.

331
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,720
Earlier, as per your order,

332
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,200
I observed Twenty-Seven
near Dragon Carp Terrace.

333
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
He was thorough in his search,

334
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,280
and I found nothing suspicious.

335
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,320
As Ming Xian's companion beast,

336
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,840
he's obedient to Ming Yi

337
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,800
probably because she shares a strong bond

338
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,600
with Ming Xian.

339
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,600
Let's set off.

340
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,760
Immortal Ji.

341
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,480
You've already formed
a heart imprint with Ji Bozai.

342
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,880
Now hurry and see him off

343
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
so we can head to his Spirit Well.

344
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,240
What is it?

345
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,080
You're worried I might
covet the netherbeast army?

346
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,480
If you are, come with me.

347
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,280
Of course not.

348
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,880
I believe you are just like me.

349
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,840
You won't be tempted
by this dangerous power.

350
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
It will be cold tonight,

351
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
and your journey will be perilous.

352
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,280
Please take care of yourself.

353
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,280
Would you let him go alone
in search of the netherbeasts too?

354
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,040
I mean,

355
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
the power of a netherbeast army

356
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,000
is tempting to everyone, isn't it?

357
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
Right now, aside from myself,

358
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,760
the only person
I trust is you, Immortal Ji.

359
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,800
Though he's gone,
there's still someone watching me.

360
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,080
Granny Xun,

361
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,680
did Lord Ji tell you to keep an eye on me?

362
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,080
Here, have some Blessing Cakes.

363
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,920
I'll just sit right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

364
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,240
Watch me all you want.

365
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,680
Go on. Try one.

366
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm not eating those.

367
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,240
What exactly is
your relationship with Ming Xian?

368
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,800
Since His Lordship spared you,

369
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,000
you probably aren't a real threat.

370
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,920
-But I still have to ask…
-I was engaged to Ming Xian.

371
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
Engaged? To Ming Xian?

372
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
So you're a spy from Yaoguang Mountain.

373
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,280
No, that can't be,
or Lord Ji would never have spared you.

374
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,520
Since he kept you around,
you must mean him no harm.

375
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,080
But how did you end up in Jixing Abyss,

376
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,920
in Moonlit Blossoms?

377
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,000
-I…
-Was that Ming Xian

378
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,480
as shameless as my old man who beat me
every day?

379
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,280
Did he send you to
Moonlit Blossoms to make ends meet?

380
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,200
In a way, yes.

381
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,320
To think that a Warrior God

382
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,760
could stoop that low!

383
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,200
Listen, His Lordship won't
really hold that against you.

384
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,080
He once helped me,

385
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,200
and I'm sure he's willing to help you too.

386
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,640
But you really shouldn't
have kept secrets from him.

387
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,600
You really went too far.

388
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,280
Let me tell you…

389
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,040
Granny Xun?

390
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
Granny Xun?

391
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,440
Ming Yi!

392
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,280
I've read about the Sunken Abyss.

393
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,520
It looks exactly like this.

394
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,280
Ji Bozai's Spirit Well resembles

395
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,960
the Sunken Abyss so much.

396
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,120
He's no longer a prisoner,

397
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,440
yet he's still trapped here.

398
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,120
The Golden Millet Dream is here.

399
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,240
The Golden Millet Dream?

400
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,640
A blood seal.

401
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,600
Ji Bozai formed a heart imprint with me,

402
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,720
so he added this seal

403
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,520
to keep me from taking it.

404
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Let us go, please!

405
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,840
Please spare us!

406
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,880
Have mercy on us!

407
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,080
Let us go, please!

408
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,080
Please spare us!

409
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,400
-These…
-Please let us go!

410
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,840
are the spirits of
the Sunken Abyss prisoners!

411
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,960
Please spare us, sir!

412
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,280
Please let us go!

413
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,480
Weren't those innocents already released?

414
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't want to die yet.

415
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,400
They didn't get out of
the Sunken Abyss safely.

416
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,240
Sir, spare us. Please, I'm begging you!

417
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,400
Mu Qibai had them captured again.

418
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,480
-Please let us go!
-Have mercy on us!

419
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,800
Please let me go.

420
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,320
Now,

421
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,080
their primordial spirits
have been stripped away.

422
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,520
They died here,

423
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
never to be reborn.

424
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,080
We're all innocent.

425
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,040
I really am innocent.

426
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,360
I did nothing wrong!

427
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,520
Please let me go!

428
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,560
Afraid of you?

429
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,440
I even recovered from
my Withered-Branch Disease.

430
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll live on

431
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,120
and grow

432
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,080
into a towering tree.

433
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,320
Sir, my child is still young.

434
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,920
Please, spare us.

435
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,640
Impossible.

436
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,520
Why is Fairy Ruo Shui here?
Didn't we already…?

437
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,440
Enjoy your meal.

438
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,760
Originally, you only needed to
do hard labor in the Sunken Abyss.

439
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
It was Ji Bozai who exposed everything.

440
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,240
Now, the Sunken Abyss has been sealed,

441
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
and the Judgment Hall has released you.

442
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,040
Even if you know little,

443
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,920
you might accidentally reveal a secret.

444
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,160
So we have no choice

445
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,920
but to turn you into feed.

446
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,440
Lord Hanfeng.

447
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,040
Don't blame me.

448
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,120
If you want to blame
someone, blame Ji Bozai.

449
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,000
So weak.

450
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
Pathetically weak.

451
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
One twist and you'd snap.

452
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,840
How will you

453
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,000
survive like this?

454
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,440
I'm not weak.

455
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,880
I… I even recovered from
my Withered-Branch Disease.

456
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,960
I'm tougher than I look.

457
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
I'll live

458
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,600
and grow into a towering tree.

459
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
So

460
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,840
you want to be strong too.

461
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,680
I… I was finally saved

462
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,960
after so much suffering.

463
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,960
I can't let Mother down.

464
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,800
I can't waste
the effort of those who saved me.

465
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,840
I must live on.

466
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,040
Sure.

467
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,680
Let me help you.

468
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,200
Someone as weak as you

469
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
can never become strong on your own.

470
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Better to take another path:

471
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,200
become part of someone stronger.

472
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Perhaps

473
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,200
that's a blessing in disguise.

474
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,720
What are you doing?

475
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I took the Moonshade Grass.

476
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,600
It cured my Withered-Branch Disease.

477
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,560
So I want to give this to you as a gift,

478
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,720
Immortal Ji.

479
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,440
My mother gave me this life.

480
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,160
I must live it well.

481
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,440
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

482
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,720
Your Lordship!

483
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,520
So that's what it means

484
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,680
to form a heart imprint as a couple.

485
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,680
To share joy

486
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,480
and suffering,

487
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
and to see what the other sees

488
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,520
and feel what the other feels

489
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,480
in their deepest pain.

490
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,040
Ji Bozai.
