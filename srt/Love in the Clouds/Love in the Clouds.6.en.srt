1
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
<i>LOVE IN THE CLOUDS</i>

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,240
TWO MONTHS AGO, FREEZING HOT WATERS

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,480
Where did Twenty-Seven
go to look for food again?

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
What is taking it so long?

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,600
I finally ran into someone.

6
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
Excuse me, do you know…

7
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
<i>They look like they died a sudden death</i>
<i>from poisoning.</i>

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,280
<i>They didn't even have time</i>
<i>to honor their daughter.</i>

9
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,400
BELOVED DAUGHTER, MING

10
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,400
EPISODE 6

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,560
A convict from Sunken Abyss
has now ascended.

12
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,760
Quite a grand spectacle.

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,960
To have separate seats, you must
fight in the last tournament.

14
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
Are you serious?

15
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,160
My Lord.

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,240
No one had any objections to me.

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,880
If you intrude with me by your side,

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,680
people will start to judge me.

19
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,920
I should wait for you outside.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Wait.

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
This is my amulet.

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
- What is the meaning of this?
- Yeah!

23
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
That is outrageous!

24
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,240
Immortal Ji doesn't act
like a warrior at all!

25
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,680
Shameless!

26
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,080
Why would Her Highness favor him?

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,280
- Unacceptable!
- Seriously?

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
The Princess is watching.

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,480
How disgraceful.

30
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Take it off.

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,720
Big deal!

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
I said

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
take it off!

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
- Arrogant brat.
- Outrageous.

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
This is outrageous.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,160
- Exactly.
- Utterly disgraceful!

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
Yes.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Take it off.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
I promised her I would watch with you.

40
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,280
Since the Princess has spoken,

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm counting on her to keep it
safe for me.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,160
He is too arrogant.

43
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
How can he do this?

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Get over yourself!

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
He is completely out of line.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
That is going too far.

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
I feel ashamed for him.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,240
Utterly terrible!

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,880
Your Highness.
Why don't we go and take a break?

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
- Let's go.
- He knows no shame or honor!

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
Such a disgrace!

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,680
The Princess must be upset with him.

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,680
- The worst ever!
- Indeed!

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
Tianji.

55
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Tianji.

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,120
It's from the shop that sold
your favorite candy when you were a kid.

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280
If Lord Hanfeng hadn't told me

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,120
that they had returned to Huansha Market,

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I wouldn't have found it.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
Eat this.

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,160
It might cheer you up a little.

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
What?

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
Not even candy is enough this time?

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,600
I will drag Ji Bozai over here
and beat him up.

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
I got your back!

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Enough, Meng Yangqiu.

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,120
She is not crying.

68
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
If crying were enough to rule
Shouhua Academy,

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,200
then that would be far too easy.

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,320
I was talking to Meng Yangqiu.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,840
Did I need you to cut in?

72
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,920
I was teasing you. Don't be upset.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
Thank you. I really like it.

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,080
Why would I be upset?
When have you ever seen me angry?

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,920
But still,

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
I haven't seen you happy in a long time.

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
- Xiuyun. Put it away for me.
- Alright.

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Immortal Sun Liao is amazing.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,840
<i>Jixing Abyss really is short on talent.</i>

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,480
<i>Even someone like Sun Liao</i>
<i>counts as powerful now.</i>

81
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,800
<i>Princess Tianji must be worried.</i>

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,960
If you want to make me happy,

83
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
it's actually very simple.

84
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,600
For example,

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,760
you

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,480
and he

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,200
can take part in the warrior selection.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
- That would make me very happy.
- Alright.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,200
Why?

90
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm just a physician
without spiritual veins.

91
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,720
How can I even fight?

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,680
Besides, we both know who we serve.

93
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,160
Surely, you know that.

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Are you sure

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
you want to appoint me?

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
Jixing Abyss is running out of talent.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,960
I have no other choice.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
So, are you willing

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
to lend Jixing Abyss your strength?

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Me and this guy.

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,760
We are both willing.

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Your Highness, please choose someone else.

103
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
I shall

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,960
take my leave.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
Tianji, what is wrong?

106
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,000
- Tianji.
- Tianji!

107
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Oh no!

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,760
- The Princess has been poisoned!
- We need to check on her!

109
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,360
Hurry! Get help!

110
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Come with me!

111
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Yan Xiao, how is Tianji?

112
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,520
She has been poisoned.

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
Poisoned?

114
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,640
The candy. Could it be the candy?

115
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,920
If Lord Hanfeng hadn't told me

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
that they went back to Huansha Market,

117
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
I wouldn't have found it.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
Xiuyun, the candy.

119
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Here it is.

120
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
The candy is fine.

121
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
Thank goodness.

122
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,760
No, Tianji is still sick.

123
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,120
What did Tianji touch just now?

124
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
That hairpin.

125
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,880
After touching it,
she started feeling ill.

126
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
It was Ji Bozai.

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,240
Could he be after the Venerable position?

128
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,600
He has always been ruthless to Tianji.

129
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,480
The Princess was poisoned.
Won't you check on her?

130
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,120
There is too much to see today.

131
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,640
We can skip this one.

132
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
What do you mean?

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,320
Do you know the story

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
about the fox being tricked by the rabbit?

135
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,560
No matter how sly the fox is,

136
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,520
if it gets soft,

137
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,280
its claws will inevitably be blunted.

138
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,720
In the end,
it becomes the rabbit's dinner.

139
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,080
If Ji Bozai really poisoned her…

140
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,000
Then what?

141
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't have spiritual veins,

142
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
but even if there is only a slim chance,

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
I must do whatever it takes to kill him.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
Is that so?

145
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,080
Tianji, you are awake.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
I knew it.

147
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,160
There are seven different poisons.

148
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,760
Ji Bozai couldn't have
slowly poisoned you over time.

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
No one else in this palace could do that.

150
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,640
You poisoned yourself.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,920
Immortal Yan.

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
Are you worried that I might die?

153
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Or are you

154
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
afraid that Uncle will hide from you

155
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
his plan to get rid of me?

156
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,280
After all,

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,120
that would mean losing his trust.

158
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,280
That would be earth-shattering for you.

159
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Mu Tianji!

160
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
You are putting your own life at risk.

161
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,480
You are being foolish.

162
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,440
- Yan Xiao, you…
- Where is the antidote?

163
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,600
Take it now!

164
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,840
There is no antidote.

165
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
- Your Highness…
- No.

166
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,960
I'll get someone to check again.

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640
There is nothing I can do.

168
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
My medical skills are limited.

169
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,240
There is nothing more that I can do.

170
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,560
Yan Xiao, please save Tianji.

171
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Immortal Yan!

172
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,000
The poison is cleared.

173
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,680
No next time.

174
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,400
The warrior selection has ended.

175
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
We will announce the list of candidates.

176
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,080
Before announcing this round
of selected candidates,

177
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,360
I have an important announcement to make.

178
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
Those who are chosen today

179
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,000
will not be the final team
for the tournament.

180
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,960
- Why?
- Not the final one?

181
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,880
- Why is that?
- Yeah!

182
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah, that is strange.

183
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,480
- Right.
- What is the reason for that?

184
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
- Yeah.
- Why is that?

185
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
Shouhua Academy

186
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,520
will continue to welcome
talented individuals to apply.

187
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,720
We will select the best among them

188
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,320
until we form the perfect warrior lineup.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,880
We will fight in the next
Qingyun Tournament.

190
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,840
Now, I will announce the preliminary
list of chosen ones.

191
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,120
Chief Warrior.

192
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
Warrior Ji Bozai.

193
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,040
Front Shield, Sun Liao.

194
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,200
- Sun Liao.
- Sun Liao is actually not bad.

195
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Forger, Chen Xi.

196
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,280
- Chen Xi.
- Chen Xi?

197
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
- Why him?
- Yeah, why?

198
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,680
His talent in crafting weapons is decent,

199
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,680
but he is just a kid.

200
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,600
Exactly.

201
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,880
He is too young for this.

202
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
He is not fit for this!

203
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,800
Vice Captain, Meng Yangqiu.

204
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,720
Meng Yangqiu?

205
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
- Meng Yangqiu?
- His spiritual veins are strong,

206
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,440
but he is a bit of a fool.

207
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
- Me?
- Healer,

208
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,800
Yan Xiao.

209
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,720
Immortal Yan may be skilled in medicine,

210
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
but he has no spiritual veins.

211
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,320
He is as good as dead.

212
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,480
- Exactly.
- That's true.

213
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,480
Your Highness,

214
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,200
I have no spiritual veins.

215
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,360
That doesn't meet the rules
of the selection.

216
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,120
Immortal Yan Xiao's medical skills

217
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,720
are unmatched throughout Jixing Abyss.

218
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,920
No one is more qualified than you

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
to represent Shouhua Academy as a Healer

220
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,080
and bring honor to Jixing Abyss.

221
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,800
But we can't change the old rules.

222
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,360
Every rule

223
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
exists to serve the good of Jixing Abyss.

224
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,440
If the old rules cannot help Jixing Abyss
win the Qingyun Tournament,

225
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,840
then as the one who leads Shouhua Academy,

226
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
I will change them.

227
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,560
That is against the rules!

228
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,480
How can she choose them?

229
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,760
The Princess is being reckless.

230
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,960
She has never done something
like this before.

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,000
How can she make such a decision?

232
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,760
The last time,

233
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,640
the Princess defied the old rules

234
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,840
to appoint me as a warrior.

235
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,720
So what? That is nothing special.

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,200
She is too unreasonable.

237
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,680
Such arrogance!

238
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,320
Who does she think she is?

239
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
There was even more criticism last time.

240
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,280
But everyone saw the result.

241
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,080
So,

242
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,240
any doubts or objections

243
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,040
will be mine to bear.

244
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,280
Your Highness, among the contestants,

245
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,280
there are countless
with better medical skills than mine.

246
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
I am not worthy to represent us.

247
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,480
Is that so?

248
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
During the selection,
I was unfortunately poisoned.

249
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,880
Seven different poisons
were mixed together.

250
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,000
Almost impossible to cure.

251
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,480
Xiuyun asked every physician
present at the time,

252
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,800
but none could find a cure.

253
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Yet you, Immortal Yan Xiao,

254
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,280
created an antidote

255
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
that countered all seven poisons
in such a short amount of time.

256
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,120
Everyone here
was deeply convinced by your skill.

257
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,600
That's right. I saw it with my own eyes.

258
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,640
- They saw it too.
- Yes, we can attest to that.

259
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
You should not belittle yourself.

260
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,480
Immortal Yan Xiao,
you may not have spiritual veins,

261
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
but even with a ten percent chance to win,

262
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,640
you will still give it your all.

263
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,160
Am I right?

264
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,720
The Emperor of Jixing has arrived.

265
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

266
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,520
Father.

267
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,440
MU YUANFENG, EMPEROR OF JIXING ABYSS

268
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
At the last Qingyun Tournament,

269
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,240
Jixing Abyss rose into the Upper Realms.

270
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,200
But I believe this is only the beginning.

271
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,920
More victories await us in the future.

272
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,000
All of you here today

273
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,520
are willing to fight for Jixing Abyss.

274
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,680
I am deeply grateful for that.

275
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,960
I hope that from now on,
everyone will give their best,

276
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,880
and protect the glory of Jixing Abyss.

277
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,359
We will give our all.

278
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,200
We will safeguard the glory of
Jixing Abyss.

279
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,720
Brother, don't overexert yourself.

280
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
You should return and rest.

281
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,480
I will head back now.

282
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,480
Who is that person?

283
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,520
Isn't that…

284
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,800
It's him!

285
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
- That's right.
- Yes.

286
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,640
Why did he suddenly show up?

287
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
I am the condemned Immortal Hou Zhao.
I request to see His Majesty.

288
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,600
- Hou Zhao?
- Didn't he go missing long ago?

289
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,920
I am guilty of unforgivable sins.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,640
Please grant me death, Your Majesty.

291
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,320
Hou Zhao, you have been missing
for so long.

292
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,920
You neglected your duty to
the Judgment Hall.

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,080
And now you dare show His Majesty
such insolence?

294
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
What are your true intentions?

295
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,320
- Guards!
- Yes!

296
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,080
- Seize Hou Zhao.
- Yes, Your Lordship.

297
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,120
Wait.

298
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,720
Immortal Hou Zhao, thank you

299
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,800
for giving me all your memories.

300
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Otherwise,
I will have to spend more effort

301
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,480
to find the people I want to get rid of.

302
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,480
Don't forget what I told you to do.

303
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,160
The Emperor has been unconscious
for years.

304
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,320
But during important occasions,
tradition requires his presence.

305
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,240
Whenever that happens,

306
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,360
he always wakes up as expected.

307
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,200
This year's warrior selection

308
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,880
will likely be no exception.

309
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,840
When the time comes,

310
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,720
you will meet the Emperor in person.

311
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,720
Confess your crimes in public.

312
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,800
I, the condemned Hou Zhao,

313
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,160
took advantage of my position
in the Judgment Hall

314
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,160
to secretly craft Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream.

315
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
What?

316
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,920
Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream?

317
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,640
Now I realize the weight of my sins.

318
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,840
I am willing to confess.

319
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
Your Majesty, please pass judgment on me.

320
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,120
Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream?

321
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,040
The Bo clan's elixirs
that can create spiritual veins?

322
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,000
That formula was lost for centuries
in the Six Realms.

323
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,000
How did he get it?

324
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,880
<i>Someone has been secretly crafting</i>
<i>Heavenly Grief?</i>

325
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,080
Twenty-two years ago,

326
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
I accidentally obtained
the medical texts left by the Bo clan.

327
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,320
I used the Sunken Abyss

328
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
and the labor of prisoners
to secretly brew medicine.

329
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,880
But the manuscript was incomplete.

330
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,320
Over the years,

331
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,160
I only managed to create Heavenly Grief,

332
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,040
never Golden Millet Dream.

333
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,160
If Hou Zhao is telling the truth…

334
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,880
Lord Hanfeng,

335
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,160
you are in charge of the Sunken Abyss.

336
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,800
Can you explain this?

337
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,680
Brother, allow me to explain.

338
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,840
When I oversaw the Sunken Abyss,

339
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,640
I have never heard of such nonsense.

340
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
Hou Zhao,

341
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,200
you had better think carefully
before you speak.

342
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,720
False accusations could bring disaster
upon your entire clan.

343
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
That's right, Hou Zhao.

344
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,680
Did Lord Hanfeng take part in it or not?

345
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,160
You must make it clear.
Tell the truth for his sake.

346
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
It was me.

347
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,160
Everything was my doing alone.

348
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
When I was managing the Sunken Abyss,

349
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,920
I forged Lord Hanfeng's handwriting

350
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,960
to use public power for personal gain.

351
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,480
I forced the prisoners in the Abyss

352
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,800
to make Heavenly Grief for me.

353
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,880
Immortal Hou Zhao.

354
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,320
Where is the new worker
who was supposed to grind the herbs?

355
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,480
Right here.

356
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,680
Hurry up, don't dawdle!

357
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,640
- Go that way.
- Move faster!

358
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
Hurry up!

359
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
That way!

360
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,000
How dare you slack off!

361
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
You're asking for a beating!

362
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,280
You filthy prisoners!

363
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
Do your job! Grind those herbs!

364
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,600
<i>Don't ever dream of leaving</i>
<i>this place alive!</i>

365
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,000
Immortal Situ.

366
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
If what Hou Zhao said is true,

367
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,880
how should we sentence him?

368
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,000
This case is too complicated.

369
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,760
I'll need to investigate carefully

370
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,480
to confirm the facts
before giving a verdict.

371
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
Everything I told you

372
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,200
is the truth!

373
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Very well.

374
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
From this day forth,

375
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,000
Hou Zhao will be imprisoned
in the Judgment Hall's prison.

376
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Once the truth is confirmed,

377
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,920
he will be tried.

378
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,880
- Good.
- Wise decision.

379
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,040
Very wise, Your Majesty.

380
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,080
I will make sure the Judgment Hall

381
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,520
gets to the bottom of this.

382
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
Wait.

383
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,440
Regarding Hou Zhao's crimes,

384
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,320
I have something to report to His Majesty.

385
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
Don't worry, Immortal Ji.

386
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,000
You once saved my life.

387
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,960
I will surely repay you.

388
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
What is she up to?

389
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,800
I am Ruo Shui,
a maid from Moonlit Blossoms.

390
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,200
I can face the punishment
for speaking against my superiors.

391
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,880
Despite my humble status,
I must accuse Hou Zhao.

392
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,640
What are you accusing now?

393
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
Your Majesty, please hear me.

394
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,760
This matter

395
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
is not as simple as Hou Zhao claimed.

396
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,920
Those so-called prisoners who helped him
brew medicine in the Sunken Abyss

397
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,600
were actually

398
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,560
innocent immortals he had abducted.

399
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,640
He used dark-spirit chains

400
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
to enslave them as laborers.

401
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,840
The toxic runoff
of the refinery polluted nearby villages.

402
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,560
Hou Zhao knew this perfectly well,

403
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,600
but he refused to stop.

404
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,800
Lady, how do you know all this?

405
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,480
What is your relationship with Hou Zhao?

406
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
I am

407
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,560
his illegitimate daughter.

408
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
- Illegitimate daughter?
- Really?

409
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,880
You just said
Hou Zhao is your biological father.

410
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Then, why would you expose him?

411
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,960
- Exactly.
- Yeah, why?

412
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
Fairy Ruo Shui,

413
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
perhaps you could explain the whole story

414
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,160
so the Judgment Hall can pass its verdict.

415
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,200
Ruo Shui,

416
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,880
I was wrong to abandon you
and your mother.

417
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,920
I've been trying to make it up
to you all these years.

418
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,360
Please, stop hating me.

419
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,880
You think you deserve pity?

420
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,200
Now you want to act like a good father?

421
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,080
When I was born with
Withered-Branch Disease,

422
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,440
the sign of Total Deterioration,

423
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,760
<i>you cast me and my mother</i>
<i>aside without hesitation.</i>

424
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,320
<i>Mother fell sick from grief</i>
<i>and exhaustion.</i>

425
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,480
<i>She eventually died because of it.</i>

426
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,320
Heaven's justice never fails.

427
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,960
You abandoned us

428
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,280
just to have a healthy child.

429
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,880
But your entire Hou bloodline

430
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,760
died from the same disease!

431
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,760
Only I

432
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
survived to this day.

433
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,120
If not for this,

434
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
you would've never remembered
you had a daughter.

435
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,400
Hou Zhao is cold and heartless.

436
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,120
How could I not hate him?

437
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,360
He's done nothing but evil all his life.

438
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,480
Even so,

439
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,880
your word alone might not be enough.

440
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,720
There must be proof.

441
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,600
Your Majesty, besides myself,

442
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,040
I also have a witness.

443
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,680
Fairy Ming Yi.

444
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,240
When I worked at Moonlit Blossoms,

445
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,040
I never spoke to Fairy Ming Yi,

446
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,840
but I knew

447
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,560
her parents were herb gatherers
and lived in the Freezing Hot Waters.

448
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,360
Ming Yi,
did you see how your parents died?

449
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,400
My Lord,

450
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,520
my family lived in the Freezing Hot Waters
for generations.

451
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,080
We survived by gathering herbs.

452
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,360
This room will be yours from now on.

453
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
Five days from now,

454
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,960
Shouhua Academy will hold its selection
for the next Qingyun Tournament.

455
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,440
His Lordship wants you to attend with him.

456
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,360
She's my amulet too.

457
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,280
<i>What a grand scheme you've played.</i>

458
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,480
<i>Even I turned out to be just a pawn</i>
<i>in your game.</i>

459
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,040
<i>I borrowed the identity</i>
<i>of the Ming family's daughter.</i>

460
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,200
<i>Today, I must seek justice for them.</i>

461
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,040
When my parents died,

462
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,320
<i>their faces turned purple,</i>

463
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,680
and veins like spider webs spread
across their bodies.

464
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,440
They suffered terribly.

465
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,960
Ming Yi,

466
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,320
why didn't you tell me about your parents?

467
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,920
<i>You've used me anyway.</i>

468
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
<i>Why pretend now?</i>

469
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,600
Physicians,

470
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,440
what kind of symptoms
did Ming Yi's parents show?

471
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,280
Physician Yan Xiao,

472
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,480
can you tell us what caused it?

473
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,320
From what you described,

474
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,360
they must have been exposed
to Blood Pearl Bloom

475
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,120
- for a long time.
- Blood Pearl Bloom?

476
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,560
That's deadly poison!

477
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
As far as I know,

478
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,080
the herb gatherers
at the Freezing Hot Waters

479
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
often died mysteriously
near the Sunken Abyss

480
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,320
after drinking from its spring.

481
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,840
The source of the poison

482
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,160
was the highly toxic Blood Pearl Bloom.

483
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,280
I know that bringing such accusations
will subject me

484
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,560
to punishment.

485
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,520
I, Ming Yi,

486
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,520
am also accusing someone above me.

487
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,320
I was powerless

488
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,720
and only today did I learn my parents
were wrongfully killed.

489
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,160
In the Freezing Hot Waters,

490
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,320
there could be many others like my parents

491
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,040
who were forced by hardship

492
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,400
to work near the polluted waters
of the Sunken Abyss

493
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
and lost their lives unjustly.

494
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,520
So today, I stand before you

495
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,120
to seek justice for
all the fallen herb gatherers.

496
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,280
Your Majesty,

497
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,440
I came from the Sunken Abyss myself.

498
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,320
Other than the daily beatings,

499
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,120
I transported Blood Pearl Blooms.

500
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,000
I can testify to this.

501
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,960
Ming Yi, don't worry.

502
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll be your witness.

503
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Your parents' death won't be in vain.

504
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,400
Trust me.

505
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,440
Ji Bozai,

506
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,440
this is a serious matter.

507
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600
Choose your words carefully.

508
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,680
Answer truthfully.

509
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,680
Are you saying you were blameless,

510
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,240
that an innocent man like you

511
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,600
was thrown into the Sunken Abyss
as a prisoner?

512
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
You all gossiped about
my past for so long.

513
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,320
Haven't you ever wondered one thing?

514
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,560
<i>For as long as I can remember,</i>

515
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
<i>I've always been in the Sunken Abyss.</i>

516
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,520
YOUNG JI BOZAI

517
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,680
<i>Tell me,</i>

518
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,080
what crime did I commit?

519
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
So that means

520
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,200
Immortal Ji has always known
he was innocent.

521
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,400
Did you ever think of taking revenge
on Hou Zhao?

522
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,120
This fairy Ruo Shui,

523
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,680
has lived in the Jixing Abyss
for quite some time.

524
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,680
She never thought of accusing someone
above her rank.

525
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,360
Could it be that someone put her up to it,

526
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
giving her the courage to stand up today?

527
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,720
Lord Han Feng,
it seems you have missed the point.

528
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,240
Why are you focusing on
why Ruo Shui spoke up in court?

529
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
We should get the priority right.

530
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,720
Is it more important to know
why she exposed Hou Zhao

531
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,840
or to uncover the truth
behind the Sunken Abyss?

532
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,840
Uncle,

533
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,120
I think Immortal Ji is right.

534
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,840
By the way,

535
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,200
there still seems to be something
suspicious about this matter.

536
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
If Hou Zhao operated alone,

537
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,120
how could he have pulled off
something this big?

538
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,400
- Yeah, that's true.
- That makes sense.

539
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,280
Exactly.

540
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,120
There's no way he did it alone.

541
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
Hou Zhao,

542
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,840
raise your head.

543
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,800
Was someone giving you orders?

544
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
You can speak up today.

545
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,120
I promise to spare your life.

546
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,680
- Tell us! Come on, speak!
- Tell us!

547
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,320
- Speak up!
- Tell us!

548
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,360
We want the truth!

549
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
- Tell us!
- Who is it?

550
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,400
- Tell us!
- Come on!

551
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,360
Tell us now!

552
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,520
Tell us!

553
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,880
What are you hiding?

554
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,679
- Say it!
- Come on!

555
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,920
Just say it already!

556
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,679
- Say something!
- You're hiding something!

557
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,320
- Tell us!
- Hurry up!

558
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Why won't you talk?

559
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,239
- Come on!
- Tell us now!

560
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,960
- Speak up!
- What's the truth?

561
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,280
- Tell us!
- Come on!

562
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,840
Tell us!

563
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,000
- Speak!
- Tell us!

564
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,960
Speak up!

565
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Tell us!

566
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,159
- Actually…
- Go on, tell us!

567
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,560
If you don't talk, you'll die.

568
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,840
- Come on!
- Your Majesty!

569
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,320
Father!

570
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,520
Yan Xiao, check what's wrong
with my brother.

571
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,639
His Majesty is…

572
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,639
How is he?

573
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,400
He has been overexerting.

574
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,240
He just needs to rest in the palace.

575
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,680
Escort my brother back.

576
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Father.

577
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,560
That was all too sudden.

578
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Tianji, if you're worried,

579
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,000
you can go with him.

580
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,200
That won't be necessary, Uncle.

581
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,680
Thank you for saving him in time.

582
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
Now that everything's been made clear,

583
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,080
and my brother is unwell,

584
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,720
I will take his place for now
and deliver the verdict

585
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,160
on Hou Zhao.

586
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,000
I am Situ Ling, Chief of Judgment Hall.

587
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,200
Strip Hou Zhao of his immortal title,

588
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,120
brand him a sinner,

589
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,640
and sentence him to heavenly lightning.

590
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,800
Crush his primordial spirit,
scatter his soul

591
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,720
across the Six Realms.

592
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,200
- Good!
- Well said!

593
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
- Justice served!
- He deserves it!

594
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,160
That's the right call.

595
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,640
People like him should have no peace.

596
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,600
Exactly.

597
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,640
- Indeed.
- Agreed!

598
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,000
- Serves him right!
- A just verdict!

599
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,840
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng,

600
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,240
for standing up for me.

601
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,600
No need. Don't worry.

602
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,520
I will make sure Hou Zhao pays
for his crimes

603
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,920
and that you have justice.

604
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Fairy Ruo Shui.

605
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,360
Tell me, who sent you here today?

606
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,360
Don't be afraid.

607
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,120
I am only asking

608
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,640
so I can protect you better

609
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,320
and whoever stands behind you.

610
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,600
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng,

611
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,640
but…

612
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
No one sent me.

613
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,960
I chose to reveal the truth myself.

614
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,960
Is that so?

615
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,880
Immortal Ji, you have spent a lot of time
at Moonlit Blossoms.

616
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,280
Have you ever seen
Fairy Ruo Shui with anyone before?

617
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
Moonlit Blossoms?

618
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,680
It's too crowded
for me to see the same one twice.

619
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,680
Fairy Ruo Shui

620
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,360
does look a little unfamiliar.

621
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
Besides, I haven't gone there
in a long time.

622
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,200
Now that I have Ming Yi,

623
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,400
why would I need to go there again?

624
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
Right?

625
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,840
Lord Hanfeng,

626
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,320
if Lord Ji ever goes back

627
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,480
and flirts with some fairy there,

628
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,080
you must tell me.

629
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,240
I'll make him pay for it.

630
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,000
Fairy Ming Yi, you misunderstand.

631
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,280
Immortal Ji and I

632
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,640
were only discussing official matters.

633
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,600
You two have shown great courage,

634
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,000
but rules must still be followed.

635
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,240
For defying authority,
you must still face punishment.

636
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,040
<i>I understand.</i>

637
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,800
Immortal Ji,

638
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,920
there is something important
I must discuss with you.

639
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,840
Will you spare me some time?

640
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,080
Something important?

641
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,240
Sure.

642
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,520
You scoundrel, Ji Bozai!

643
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,280
May you trip the moment
you step out the door,

644
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,840
lose the soles of your shoes on the road,

645
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,720
and chip your teeth while eating!

646
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,560
- One more thing…
- Fairy Ming Yi.

647
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,200
Immortal Ji is a good man.

648
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,560
Stop cursing him already.

649
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,160
You think he is a good man?

650
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,240
Haven't you seen him

651
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,840
surrounded by fairies at Moonlit Blossoms?

652
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,960
Don't be so naive.

653
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,880
But it's the truth.

654
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,960
You have to believe me.

655
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,920
At Moonlit Blossoms,

656
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,240
he was always proper with them.

657
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,760
Nothing ever happened.

658
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,840
He really is a good, kind man.

659
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Nothing ever happened.

660
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,760
He really is a good, kind man.

661
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,360
Please don't misunderstand him.

662
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,480
I didn't misunderstand.

663
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,120
You're the one he fooled.

664
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,840
You think he is being kind,

665
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,520
but he is only using you.

666
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,680
Don't think he actually cares about you.

667
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,320
Qibai, you've refilled this teacup
so many times,

668
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,240
but what exactly is this important matter?

669
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,120
Perhaps I caught a chill.

670
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,720
Let me head back and rest a while.
We talk another day.

671
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,880
Wait.

672
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,080
The physician is right here.

673
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,320
I can have someone bring you medicine.

674
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,600
It should cure that chill of yours.

675
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,840
The matter with Hou Zhao

676
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,120
was truly shocking and lurid.

677
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,640
I blame myself

678
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,800
for neglecting the Freezing Hot Waters.

679
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,840
I failed His Majesty.

680
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,640
Today is a good opportunity.

681
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,040
I just wanted
to have a deeper talk with you, Bozai.

682
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,680
So that we can all prevent such tragedies.

683
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,160
Well said, Lord Hanfeng.

684
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,160
However…

685
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,600
I've barely left my little fairy behind,

686
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,000
and I'm already missing her.

687
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,920
Wait.

688
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,720
Bozai.

689
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,240
Being Chief of Judgment Hall is tiring.

690
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,320
I have to double-check
the witnesses of every case.

691
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,280
He was pure with all those fairies
at Moonlit Blossoms?

692
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,200
No way. It's not like he is insane.

693
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,400
No, maybe he isn't.

694
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,080
Is he, though?

695
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,040
Forget it, you're still young.

696
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,400
Just remember this.

697
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,600
Ji Bozai treats everyone

698
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,960
like pieces on his chessboard.

699
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,960
He calculates every move around them.

700
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,960
Watch out!

701
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,480
<i>A netherbeast! Impossible!</i>

702
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
Guards! A netherbeast!

703
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,360
<i>No. My spiritual power alone</i>
<i>won't kill it.</i>

704
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,280
<i>I'll have to borrow strength.</i>

705
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,440
What's going on there?

706
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,360
Go and check!

707
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,520
Yes, sir!
