1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,440
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,520
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
"LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,720
Ji Bozai?

4
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,600
Sunken Abyss seems so buzzing today.

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,880
Know your place!

6
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,320
-Ji…
-Ming Yi.

7
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,800
You okay?

8
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,080
We have to leave now.

9
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,440
Zhushui Spiritual State has a backup plan.

10
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,880
How do you know?

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,640
Word from the Situ clan.

12
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,880
Ming Yi, come with me, quick!

13
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
The Emperor of Zhushui
wants Jixing Abyss as his grave.

14
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,040
Sunken Abyss can collapse at any moment.

15
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,360
Miasma will blanket the divine capital.

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,920
Miasma?

17
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Look!

18
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,920
Tianji, look!

19
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,960
What… What is it?

20
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,480
ZIWEI HALL

21
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,440
The day has come after all.

22
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,600
All in Jixing Abyss with spiritual veins,

23
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,280
assemble now to resist the poison!

24
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,360
I can die

25
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,959
but you're coming with me!

26
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,920
-Ji Bozai, watch out!
-No!

27
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,240
Ming Yi.

28
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,640
Why are you here?

29
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,480
The air here is toxic.

30
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,400
She can't die here with you.

31
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Ji Bozai, she's told me clearly.

32
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,760
What you had was just a deal.

33
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
You never held the Golden Millet Dream.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
She doesn't need you anymore.

35
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Hand her to me.

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,080
How… how can you?

37
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,440
The miasma is spreading this fast!

38
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,080
Father!

39
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,800
Your uncle and I were weak before.

40
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Different paths, same end.

41
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
Father, what are you doing?

42
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,760
Emperors of Jixing Abyss forged a rite.

43
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
As the Emperor,

44
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
one must yield bone and blood,

45
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
turn his primordial spirit into a barrier.

46
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,280
This is the Aranya Array.

47
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Once it's activated,

48
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,960
no divine, demonic, or netherbeast arts

49
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,880
can trouble
Jixing Abyss for a hundred years.

50
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Such is an Emperor's fate.

51
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
My body, my flesh,

52
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,640
my spirit, my mind…

53
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
-Father, no!
-My intent…

54
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
Father!

55
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
All become the barrier's five aspects.

56
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,920
Father! Father, stop!

57
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,400
With one's fall,

58
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
let all things live!

59
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,480
No, Father!

60
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Sunken Abyss is about to collapse.

61
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,800
Get Ming Yi out first.

62
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
I can make it out myself.

63
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
With such an uproar in Sunken Abyss,

64
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,600
Father will sense it for sure.

65
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,159
I can't let him find Ming Yi.

66
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,360
Father!

67
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Father!

68
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,120
Father…

69
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,760
You have grown up.

70
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,800
You make your own calls now.

71
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
But promise me:

72
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,560
Don't let hatred blind you.

73
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't drag the Six Realms into war.

74
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,280
Restore the Qingyun Tournament

75
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
to what it once was, fair and just.

76
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
I will, Father.

77
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,560
I won't fail.

78
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,800
I believe you.

79
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,280
This path is hard,

80
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,320
but don't be afraid.

81
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,680
I will turn to starlight

82
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
and stay by your side forever.

83
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,160
Father.

84
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,640
Father.

85
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,600
My good girl.

86
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
Father.

87
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,520
No tears.

88
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,480
Father.

89
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
My good girl.

90
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,560
Don't leave me, Father.

91
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,560
Father.

92
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
No tears.

93
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,520
Father!

94
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
I will turn to starlight,

95
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,040
and stay by your side forever.

96
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,360
May stars be eternal.
Farewell to Your Majesty!

97
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,280
Father,

98
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,160
you forged
the Aranya Array with your life.

99
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,400
I swear

100
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,720
to guard Jixing Abyss to the death!

101
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,680
Why were you in Sunken Abyss?

102
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,760
That should be my question for you.

103
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,880
What were you doing there?

104
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
Looking for the missing
recipe for Golden Millet Dream.

105
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,400
I stake my life on it:

106
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
the recipe will never leak.

107
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,040
For a recipe,

108
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,640
you got yourself hurt this badly.

109
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm fine.

110
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,240
Where was Ming Xian?

111
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
Did one Heavenly Grief strike

112
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
and the severing of
spiritual veins already ruin him?

113
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,280
He couldn't care less about you!

114
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,840
Is he even a man?

115
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,840
He isn't. Happy now?

116
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
What are you doing?

117
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Meddling.

118
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm much better now.

119
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,120
Your Highness, by the Emperor's order,

120
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
we're to take you to him.

121
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,880
Father knows everything?

122
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,040
The Emperor of Jixing

123
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
has fallen.

124
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,080
BENEVOLENCE, KINDNESS, WISDOM, PROPRIETY

125
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,800
Father wouldn't want
to see me like this, right?

126
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,360
Tianji, look.

127
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,320
Yan Xiao,

128
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,120
you'll get this after I'm gone.

129
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
Zhushui Spiritual State has invaded.

130
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,320
Guarding Jixing Abyss
is an Emperor's duty.

131
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,520
But being with Tianji is a father's duty.

132
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,120
I can't do both anymore.

133
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,920
I'm grateful you can stay by her side
as her family.

134
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,880
I know my daughter.

135
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,840
She'll grieve,

136
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
but not for long.

137
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,400
She still bears an Emperor's charge.

138
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
And she'll do it well.

139
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
She will pull through.

140
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,520
Until then,

141
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,360
I ask you

142
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,880
to stay with her through the worst.

143
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,000
WATER PRISON, ZHUSHUI SPIRITUAL STATE

144
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,319
Your Lordship!

145
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,319
Your Lordship.

146
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,480
Why did His Majesty beat you like this?

147
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,040
How is it?

148
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,119
Can you hold out?

149
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,360
I'll beg His Majesty.

150
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
He can't keep you locked like this.

151
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,600
You have no spiritual veins.

152
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,200
You can't withstand this prison.

153
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Keep this up and you'll die!

154
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,840
He locked me here.

155
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,560
I can't do anything.

156
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,400
But you can still move.

157
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,280
That's why I sent you to scout.

158
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,400
How is Ming Yi?

159
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,600
-Answer me!
-She's dead!

160
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,240
She didn't find the Golden Millet Dream.

161
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,120
Heavenly Grief flared.

162
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,560
She's already gone.

163
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,800
No.

164
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,200
Your Lordship.

165
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,560
-I'm getting out.
-Your Lordship.

166
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
Your Lordship!

167
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,960
Are you mad?

168
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,840
His Majesty is only disciplining you.

169
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,880
If you break out yourself,

170
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,840
do you know the consequences?

171
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,600
-Let go of me!
-Your Lordship.

172
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
-Your Lordship!
-I'm going to save Ming Yi!

173
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,040
Your Lordship.

174
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm going to save Ming Yi.

175
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,680
She isn't dead!

176
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,800
I lied to you. She's still alive.

177
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,360
Your Lordship.

178
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,200
Is that true?

179
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,160
Yes.

180
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,760
She Tianlin already
gave her the Medical Classics.

181
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,960
Really?

182
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,040
Yes.

183
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,080
I confirmed it myself.

184
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,040
Whatever you assigned me,

185
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,440
I'll see it done.

186
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,880
Your Lordship.

187
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Think about yourself for once.

188
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,520
Don't worry about me.

189
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,760
Father has already lost three sons.

190
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
He won't let me die.

191
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Survival of the fittest.

192
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,840
He'll choose me.

193
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
He has no choice but me.

194
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,520
Compared to other bow artifacts,

195
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,240
this one aims with higher precision,

196
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,960
hits harder and pierces deeper.

197
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,920
It can store spiritual power for the user.

198
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,640
And its arrows can shift forms

199
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
to fit different situations.

200
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,400
This is a warrior's weapon.

201
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
I may dislike artifacts,

202
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,360
but I'm not clueless.

203
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,160
They carry the forger's mind and intent.

204
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,040
When Ming Yi fought the netherbeast army,

205
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,520
her forging approach

206
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,160
matched this one exactly.

207
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,880
Clearly this is her handiwork.

208
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
She has spiritual veins,

209
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
but she isn't a warrior.

210
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,480
Did Ming Xian teach her?

211
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,440
Such forging skill takes

212
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,840
talent, combat, experience, and training,

213
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
all essential.

214
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Only a battle-tested warrior

215
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,400
can master it.

216
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,840
DEMON-REPELLING PARASOL BLUEPRINT

217
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,360
Ming Xian's iron-fan
artifact is called Embers.

218
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,080
Too bad I already destroyed it.

219
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,760
It is my…

220
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,040
It's Ming Xian's most important artifact!

221
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,640
Do you know how many
netherbeasts it can handle at a crisis?

222
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,400
How did we get out?

223
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,600
Thanks to you blasting the exit.

224
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,400
It took everything we had.

225
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
Ji Bozai!

226
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,600
You actually have spiritual veins!

227
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,200
Tell me, who are you really?

228
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,240
If I have that name list,

229
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
I'll have proof

230
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,720
to drag out the villain who used
Heavenly Grief to poison Ming Xian.

231
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,160
Instead of waiting here.

232
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,280
Ming Xian

233
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
was hit by Heavenly Grief?

234
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,960
No wonder… At the Qingyun Tournament,

235
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,520
his power clearly faded.

236
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm fine.

237
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,480
Ming Yi's reacting…

238
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Even with backlash from the Graft Spell,

239
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,800
your body shouldn't be this weak.

240
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
So cold.

241
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,640
She's just like me
back when I was struck by Heavenly Grief.

242
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,600
She was the one poisoned.

243
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,560
I am Ming Xian…

244
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,880
Ming Xian's fiancée.

245
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,040
Where was Ming Xian?

246
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,840
Did one Heavenly Grief strike

247
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,800
and the severing of
spiritual veins already ruin him?

248
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,520
He couldn't care less about you!

249
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Is he even a man?

250
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,760
He isn't. Happy now?

251
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Could it be…

252
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
Stop, Fuyue.

253
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Stop!

254
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,160
Fuyue.

255
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Why?

256
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,880
Why burn your cultivation to save me?

257
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,040
Don't worry.

258
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,520
I won't die.

259
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,800
Yousu Fox Tribe can hide their inner cores

260
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
in illusions.

261
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,600
Even if cultivation drains,

262
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
they won't die like the Immortals.

263
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,880
But once it's gone,

264
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,000
you'll revert to your true form.

265
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,560
If that day really comes,

266
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,320
if I become

267
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,440
just another wild fox among thousands,

268
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,800
no different from the rest,

269
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,600
will you still know me?

270
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Like you always know Ming Yi?

271
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,720
Your Highness, His Majesty calls.

272
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
You've been practicing
the Thousand Insect Spell!

273
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,720
So you could kill your two brothers.

274
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,520
How dare you covet
the Bo's Medical Classics

275
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,760
and work right under my nose?

276
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,840
You hid in Jixing Abyss for so long.

277
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,160
You still didn't find
the Golden Millet Dream?

278
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,280
I've verified the rumor is false.

279
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
Ji Bozai never had
the Golden Millet Dream.

280
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,760
What use is that?

281
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,480
You stole the Bo's Medical Classics

282
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,240
to brew the Golden Millet Dream yourself?

283
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,120
If I say

284
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,120
I've learned in Jixing Abyss

285
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800
how to breach the Zhulong Barrier,

286
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,920
what will you think of that?

287
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,400
Go on.

288
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
I know.

289
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,400
You've long sought
the Bo clan's ancestral home

290
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,720
to take what you missed back then,
Part 2 of the Bo's Medical Classics.

291
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
But Zhulong revived

292
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,040
and cast a barrier.

293
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
No outsider can find
the Bo clan's ancestral home.

294
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,760
But do not worry.

295
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,600
I can do this for you.

296
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,640
So you'd rather keep from me

297
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,200
how to break the Zhulong Barrier.

298
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,040
I want to be strong.

299
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,400
I won't live under another's heel.

300
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,600
Across the Six Realms,

301
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,440
you alone stand supreme.

302
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,240
Serving you

303
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,920
and aligning with you

304
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,080
keeps me from being carved up.

305
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,160
If you get what you want

306
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,400
and grant me trust and backing,

307
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,200
I'll be a power of
Zhushui Spiritual State.

308
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,240
A few days apart,

309
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,200
I hardly recognize you.

310
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,120
Chao Yuan,

311
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,600
you are bold.

312
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,800
Father,

313
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,520
I seek the Golden Millet Dream

314
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,880
to awaken spiritual veins

315
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,280
and vie at the Qingyun Tournament.

316
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,280
But it's only to help you

317
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,560
to defend Zhushui's honor.

318
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,400
I dare not covet more.

319
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This is my intent.

320
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,560
And it will not change.

321
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,600
Go for it, my son.

322
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,440
Bring that Bo's Medical Classics

323
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,480
back to me.

324
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,120
This Medical Classics is sealed.

325
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
It's a Bo clan's secret art.

326
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,760
Seems we must find
Part 2 of the Medical Classics

327
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,480
and join the two
before we can read it through.

328
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,920
I came with two matters.

329
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,760
First is about Situ Ling.

330
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,000
His identity is suspect.

331
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,960
It is in doubt.

332
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,760
But I owe him.

333
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,600
Some things I can't tell you.

334
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
By the way,

335
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,040
I've found Part 1 of the Medical Classics.

336
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,040
Across the Six Realms,
many eyes are on it.

337
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,160
But I promise I won't leak a word.

338
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
And that is my second matter.

339
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,640
Why are you fixed on
the Bo's Medical Classics?

340
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,840
Of course for Ming Xian.

341
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,960
Why stop me from
checking your spiritual veins?

342
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,200
What are you hiding?

343
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,080
-What do you want to check?
-We're no longer involved.

344
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,320
I decide whether we are.

345
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,680
That day in Sunken Abyss,

346
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,680
your crossbow was
built for offense not defense.

347
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,200
And it could pre-store spiritual power.

348
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,560
Only a battle-hardened warrior

349
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
could make that.

350
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,880
Has he sensed something?

351
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,360
What are you suspecting me of now?

352
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,680
You still care about me?

353
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,400
Ji Bozai,

354
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,280
you played the rake for so long.

355
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,880
Now you can't let go of
a woman who fooled you.

356
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,400
I've been lying to you.

357
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,200
I meant to steal
your master's Golden Millet Dream!

358
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,560
Ming Xian's busted fan is with me.

359
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Don't you want it back?

360
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
If you do,

361
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,480
trade me something.

362
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
-What do you want?
-An artifact.

363
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,080
Forge one that's one of a kind,

364
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,480
one only you can make.

365
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,240
Fine, I'll give you the artifact.

366
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,960
But besides returning me Embers,

367
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
you'll erase
our names on the Marriage Stone

368
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
and we're square after that.

369
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,240
You don't get to decide now.

370
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,480
Buxiu,

371
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,159
Situ Ling showed up in Sunken Abyss.

372
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,320
Something's off.

373
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,440
Either the Situ clan ties
to the Emperor of Zhushui,

374
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,760
or his identity hides more.

375
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,199
Find a chance to ask around.

376
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,440
Yes, I'll see to it.

377
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,120
But about Ming Yi,

378
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,480
what's your plan?

379
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,520
She lies by habit.

380
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,320
Getting the truth won't be easy.

381
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,480
If she really is the one in your heart,

382
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,400
she'll side with Yaoguang Mountain

383
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,199
and be your destined foe.

384
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,320
What do we do then?

385
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,360
Most things come as dilemmas.

386
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,320
But

387
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,600
I will find a way through.

388
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,080
Thanks to you for
infusing it with spiritual power.

389
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,720
Look, how's the sword?

390
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,320
What's that face?

391
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,480
What do you think?

392
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,960
I know.

393
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,320
This sword was reborn from Embers.

394
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,520
But I remade it as a longsword.
No one else will notice.

395
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,120
The Embers artifact's
my finest artifact, after all.

396
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,160
It senses danger in time

397
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,160
and shields its master by instinct.

398
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,800
I can't understand.
What spell did that guy put on you?

399
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,040
He's hurt you this badly.

400
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,880
He ruined the Golden Millet Dream.

401
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,600
He killed your only hope to live!

402
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,600
From where he stood, he wasn't wrong.

403
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,280
And I'm heading to Zhangwei Mountain.

404
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,200
It's deadly there.

405
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,320
I mean, if something really happens,

406
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,520
or we still can't make
the Golden Millet Dream,

407
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,280
Ji Bozai still has to face
that Zhushui lot.

408
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,760
I just want this sword
to be there when it counts

409
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,160
to save his life,
like Embers once shielded me.

410
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
Try it.

411
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,560
It's razor sharp!

412
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,560
Don't mess around.

413
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,040
A shame for our sect…

414
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,640
Hear that sound!

415
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,360
Your Lordship.

416
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,160
I'll take my leave.

417
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,160
This is the artifact I promised.

418
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,760
It's named Nirvana.

419
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,800
In exchange,

420
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,320
please return Embers to me.

421
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,320
And erase our names on the Marriage Stone.

422
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,080
Take this artifact

423
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,280
and we're square.

424
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,160
Please return Embers soon.

425
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,400
This artifact you made…

426
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,080
I'm not satisfied. It doesn't count.

427
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,160
You're playing me?

428
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
A sword's cry should be dragon song.

429
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,000
Your Nirvana doesn't qualify.

430
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,840
-That still isn't dragon song?
-It isn't.

431
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,000
Because I decide.

432
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
So it doesn't count.

433
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,400
Look closely.

434
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,960
This artifact crowns the Six Realms.

435
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,120
It's my proudest work!

436
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,520
So cut the nonsense.

437
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,480
Liar.

438
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,080
Ji Bozai! Have you no shame?

439
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,440
Ming Yi.

440
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,640
Between us,

441
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
is Ming Xian still in the way?

442
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,600
Even without him,

443
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
there's too much mess between us.

444
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,960
Per your order,

445
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,720
on Mu Qibai's name list,

446
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,960
there's finally progress.

447
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,320
I traced
the fairy whom Sun Liao once loved.

448
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,040
From her I learned

449
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,840
Mu Qibai's name list is not a jade slip.

450
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,200
-It's inside a Recording Mirror.
-A Recording Mirror?

451
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,520
So those shards under
the Soul-Consuming Tree

452
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,320
are from the Recording Mirror?

453
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,840
We need a way to read it.

454
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,800
Earlier I probed the Situ clan.

455
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,640
They always aligned with Mu Qibai.

456
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,080
After he died,
they petitioned to cut ties.

457
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,440
But in the end,

458
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
they're tangled with
Zhushui Spiritual State.

459
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,000
Situ Ling is said
to be a bastard sent away,

460
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,040
later taken back and acknowledged.

461
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,840
Yet the registry never notes

462
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,760
who his birth parents are.

463
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,760
Maybe

464
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,600
his identity is just a shell.

465
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,320
Master, any progress?

466
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,160
I still can't break the seal on it.

467
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,720
We'll have to wait for
Part 2 of the Medical Classics.

468
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,200
How's your health? Can you hold on?

469
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,160
Let's leave for
Zhangwei Mountain tomorrow.

470
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,040
Your Lordship.

471
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,880
You're awake.

472
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,720
Here.

473
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,400
-Feeling better?
-Your Lordship,

474
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,960
we finally made it back to Jixing Abyss.

475
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,840
What's our move?

476
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,080
Father told me to find
the Bo clan's ancestral home

477
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,360
and fetch Part 2 of the Medical Classics.

478
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,080
Ming Yi sets out for
Zhangwei Mountain at dawn.

479
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,240
The Zhulong Barrier
admits Bo clan's blood only.

480
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,720
I'll lead Ji Bozai there

481
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
to help her enter
the Bo clan's ancestral home.

482
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,200
If she gets the recipe,

483
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,960
brews Golden Millet Dream and lives,

484
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,920
she won't hand you the recipe.

485
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,760
How will you answer then?

486
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,200
What will His Majesty do?

487
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,520
Kill or cut me, I'm not afraid.

488
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,880
As long as Ming Yi is safe,
nothing else matters.

489
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,200
Tomorrow send Ji Bozai a flying letter.
