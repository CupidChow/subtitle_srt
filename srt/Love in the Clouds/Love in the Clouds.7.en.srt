1
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
<i>LOVE IN THE CLOUDS</i>

2
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,640
Spirit of the Divine Tree.

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,040
Spirit of the Divine Tree.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,720
I, Hou Zhao, the clan
leader, beg the Divine Tree for mercy.

5
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,960
Tell me why the Hou Clan

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
suffers from the Withered-Branch Disease.

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,400
All the descendants of
the Hou Clan died gruesome deaths.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Is the family lineage
going to end like this?

9
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,200
Spirit of the Divine Tree, please tell me

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,560
how to save the bloodline

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,240
and ensure the prosperity of the Hou Clan!

12
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,840
I, Hou Zhao, am willing to
give everything I have in exchange!

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
Hou Zhao.

14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,440
I can fulfill your wish.

15
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,680
However, you must first do one thing.

16
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,080
EPISODE 7

17
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Ming Yi!

18
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Ming Yi.

19
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
Your Lordship, they are all dead.

20
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
What's going on?

21
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,800
- What happened?
- My Lord, I…

22
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Lord Hanfeng.

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,320
There was a netherbeast just now.

24
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,800
That… All of them are dead.

25
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
Netherbeast?

26
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,960
A cloud of dark mist rushed towards us
and…

27
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,200
That's impossible.
The bloodthirsty netherbeasts

28
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
have been extinct since the incident
with the Spiritual Veins Fairy

29
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,720
from a century ago.

30
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Besides,

31
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,640
if there was really a netherbeast,
how come you're still alive?

32
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm sure you made a mistake.

33
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,840
I saw it myself! It wasn't a mistake.

34
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
That was a netherbeast! If…

35
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,520
If Immortal Situ hadn't saved me,

36
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,040
I would've been dead.

37
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,080
Lord Hanfeng,

38
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
it seems like

39
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
there was a mastermind
behind Hou Zhao after all.

40
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,760
This person

41
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,720
must be the one
who wanted Ming Yi and Ruo Shui dead.

42
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
Since you were there,
why don't you tell us

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,080
if it was you who saved them?

44
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,520
Also,

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,840
did you see any netherbeasts?

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,680
<i>Sorry, Immortal Situ.</i>

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,200
<i>I have no choice but to make you pass out.</i>

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
Yes.

49
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,960
After I escorted Hou Zhao back,
I was on my way back

50
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,200
and saw one, two, three, four…

51
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,160
many netherbeasts. Young ones.

52
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,600
They were attacking the fairies

53
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,560
so I couldn't ignore them.

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,240
You

55
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
defeating netherbeasts?

56
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Are you still the chief I know

57
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,360
who shirks off all responsibilities
when it comes to official duties?

58
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,200
I was lazy in the past,

59
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,240
but I was

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,840
considering what I should

61
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,320
and shouldn't do as a chief.

62
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
Saving someone is
also the duty of a chief.

63
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm sure you have misunderstood me.

64
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,840
In that case, tell me

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,800
how you killed the netherbeasts
when you have no spiritual veins.

66
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,240
Since I grew up without spiritual veins,

67
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,600
I learned some
martial arts to protect myself.

68
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
I suppose

69
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
it was all for this day

70
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,560
when I risked my life and used
my skill to protect those two fairies.

71
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,360
I could barely defeat the netherbeasts

72
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,200
because they were not fully grown.

73
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,840
With the chief's testimony,

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,880
do you have any more doubts, Lord Hanfeng?

75
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,320
This is weird.

76
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,480
Why are you concerned
with the veracity of his statement?

77
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,720
The appearance of netherbeasts
will endanger the Six Realms.

78
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,200
We should believe it
instead of doubting it.

79
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Lord Hanfeng,

80
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,040
this must be investigated thoroughly.

81
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,840
Immortal Ji, you are right.

82
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,880
This must be investigated thoroughly.

83
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,640
It was fine if you meddled in
other people's business in the past

84
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,760
but you can't do it now with your body.

85
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,320
You should know what's best for you.

86
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,080
A petal of the Grief Blossom has withered.
How do you feel now?

87
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm fine after the negative effect.

88
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,600
Saving Ruo Shui was important.

89
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,720
Besides me, no one else could've
saved her in that moment.

90
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,280
However, what happened today
was too complicated.

91
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,760
First, Hou Zhao was found to have
refined medicine in the Sunken Abyss.

92
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,280
Then, netherbeasts that had
been extinct for a century appeared.

93
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
Thankfully, this incident
has turned into a big mess.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Judgment Hall will surely investigate it.

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,520
The Blood Pearl Bloom trade
will end because of this.

96
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,080
The people of Freezing Hot Waters

97
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,600
will no longer be harmed by
the gathering of Blood Pearl Bloom.

98
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,679
Have you delivered the jewelry
I asked you to deliver?

99
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,360
Ji Bozai isn't trying to uphold justice,
but to achieve his own goals.

100
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,280
Giving them what Ji Bozai gave me

101
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
counts as robbing
the rich and helping the poor, right?

102
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
They do need money

103
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,360
but are you going to
flatter yourself because of that?

104
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,520
My Lord.

105
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
Did the netherbeasts hurt you?

106
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm fine.
There's no need to worry about me.

107
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,120
How's Fairy Ruo Shui doing?

108
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,760
She's fine.

109
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Let me see your wound.

110
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,880
My Lord, when I said I'm fine, I mean it.

111
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,520
What? Do you feel sorry for what you did?

112
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,600
You were shocked. Rest early.

113
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,320
<i>What is he trying to do today?</i>

114
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

115
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Your Lordship,
it's almost time for the execution.

116
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,360
<i>- Something's wrong.</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

117
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,480
Hou Zhao, former chief of
the Judgment Hall in Jixing Abyss,

118
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,600
used the Sunken Abyss
to harm innocent people.

119
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
With undeniable evidence,
your crime is beyond pardon.

120
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,840
On behalf of His Majesty,
Lord Hanfeng is sentencing you

121
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
to the destruction of
your primordial spirit immediately

122
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,760
to appease those who died innocently.

123
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,360
Carry out the execution.

124
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,360
Let's go. Go back and tell Lord Hanfeng

125
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,920
that the execution has concluded.

126
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,360
His primordial spirit has been destroyed.

127
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,800
He will vanish soon.

128
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,960
Ji Bozai.

129
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,960
Ji Bozai.

130
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,760
I promised you

131
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
I would sacrifice myself sacrifice myself

132
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,960
in exchange for my daughter's safety.

133
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
Right now, I've confessed to my sins.

134
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,960
When Lord Hanfeng was interrogating me,

135
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,280
I never mentioned a thing about you.

136
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,120
You've promised me.

137
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,680
You mustn't go back on your promise.

138
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,920
You must give
the Moonshade Grass to Ruo Shui

139
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,960
and treat her.

140
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,320
She is the only person I care about

141
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,400
in this world.

142
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,680
I beg you. I beg you.

143
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,160
Why are you smiling?

144
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,840
Why are you smiling?

145
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,480
Do you think

146
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,680
I will keep my word to an enemy?

147
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,760
Ji Bozai!

148
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,200
Did you destroy the Moonshade Grass?

149
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,160
Where's Ruo Shui?

150
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,640
Is Ruo Shui still alive?

151
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,040
She is the only
remaining child of the Hou Clan.

152
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
Ji Bozai!

153
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,520
Hou Zhao.

154
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,960
Have you been acting
as a kind father for so long

155
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,400
that you've truly believed you're one?

156
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,120
How can you be so shameless

157
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,720
as to say these things?

158
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,400
Yes.

159
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,440
She is indeed
the last child of the Hou Clan.

160
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,040
This is the only truth you speak, right?

161
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,960
What…

162
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,440
What do you know?

163
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Hou Zhao.

164
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,320
How can you not know this?

165
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,280
I took away all your memories.

166
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course, it includes this part.

167
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Hou Zhao.

168
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I can fulfill your wish.

169
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,480
However, you must do one thing for me.

170
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,440
You need to offer me a healthy descendant.

171
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,520
But every member of the Hou Clan

172
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
died from the Withered-Branch Disease.

173
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
How…

174
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,880
How can I find you a healthy descendant?

175
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
Hou Zhao.

176
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,440
Don't you still have a daughter?

177
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,760
If the Withered-Branch Disease
is not that serious,

178
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,480
she can be cured with the Moonshade Grass.

179
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,920
You cast a bewitching spell on Ruo Shui.

180
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,720
Once she recovers from
ingesting the Moonshade Grass,

181
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,560
she will lose control of herself,

182
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,000
commit suicide,

183
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,400
and offer her blood

184
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,120
to your family's Divine Tree

185
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,640
so your family can continue to thrive.

186
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
Have you hypnotized yourself

187
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,360
until you've forgotten
that Ruo Shui is just an offering to you?

188
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What?

189
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,360
Do you really think you are a good father?

190
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,480
No.

191
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
You got it wrong.

192
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Hou Zhao.

193
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
I want you to witness

194
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,240
the end

195
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,160
of the Hou Clan.

196
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,760
Ji Bozai!

197
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,440
You!

198
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,920
- Why are you doing this?
- Why?

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,640
I still remember vividly
how my master, Bo Yulan,

200
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
died in your hands.

201
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,640
I will return all the pain
she suffered before her death

202
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,360
in multiple folds on all of you.

203
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,040
You…

204
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Your Lordship, congratulations on
getting rid of the first culprit.

205
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,040
However, I don't understand one thing.

206
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
Why don't you kill him immediately

207
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,360
right after obtaining his memories?

208
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
If I killed him immediately,

209
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,560
he would still die with a noble identity.

210
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,320
I want everyone to know

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,480
that he is the real criminal.

212
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,840
I want all of them to die as criminals.

213
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
Let's go back.

214
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Don't let them notice us.

215
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
That should be Ji Bozai's companion beast.

216
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,520
It has gained a human form too.

217
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,560
Just like you, he has probably
reached the Transcendent Stage.

218
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,200
He survived the Spirit Well.

219
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,360
It's not strange for his companion
beast to assume a human form too.

220
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,840
Ji Bozai also mentioned just now
that he wanted to avenge his master.

221
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,080
He is not a descendant of the Bo Clan,

222
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,880
but Bo Yulan's disciple.

223
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
Bo Yulan was killed by Hou Zhao

224
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,360
but there seems to be
more than one murderer.

225
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,080
In that case,

226
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,880
Lord Hanfeng probably has secrets too.

227
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,520
Everything Ji Bozai has been
doing in Jixing Abyss is just a cover.

228
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,040
His real objective
is to avenge his master.

229
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,960
If Hou Zhao can
concoct the Heavenly Grief,

230
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,240
it'll be common in the world.

231
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,760
Many people

232
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
in the Six Realms
probably possess the Heavenly Grief.

233
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Is it possible that it was someone else
who poisoned me?

234
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,360
So…

235
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,040
So you see him as a loyal person

236
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,680
who overturns the whole Sunken Abyss

237
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,040
to avenge his master
and now, you've wavered?

238
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,920
Yes. Heavenly Grief might be
in many people's possession, but

239
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
the situation back then

240
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,440
still makes Ji Bozai
the most likely culprit.

241
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,960
However, he keeps Embers safe

242
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,560
and said he'd return it to
Ming Xian once he came back.

243
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,920
In Hou Zhao's case,

244
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,720
everything he did had a righteous purpose.

245
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,720
I admit that I'm wavering.

246
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,640
I think he might not be
the person who poisoned me.

247
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,640
However, you are right.

248
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,440
He is suspicious.
Moreover, I need the Golden Millet Dream.

249
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm destined to be his enemy.

250
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,600
He still needs to eliminate those people

251
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,840
and I'm still useful to him.

252
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,560
Between us,

253
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,840
let's see who's more ruthless

254
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,360
and can survive until the end.

255
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,800
Buxiu,

256
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,240
have you arranged
for Ruo Shui's departure?

257
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,800
Your Lordship,

258
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,800
at noon tomorrow,

259
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
I will escort Fairy Ruo Shui personally
out of Jixing Abyss.

260
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
I will go with you.

261
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,560
The appearance of young netherbeasts
must be because of Mu Qibai.

262
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,040
I thought

263
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
he only wanted to
become the ruler of Jixing Abyss.

264
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,280
However, I didn't expect him

265
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
to be so depraved.

266
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,280
He actually raised netherbeasts
to endanger the Six Realms.

267
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,880
He failed to kill Ruo Shui this time.

268
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,840
I'm sure he is planning something else.

269
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,520
We must act before him
to find out what he's planning.

270
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,000
What else did you find
in Hou Zhao's memory?

271
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,720
The other person

272
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,160
who killed my master.

273
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I'll go and kill him.

274
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,840
Where are you going? Come back. Sit down.

275
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,760
That's right.

276
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
I will send Ming Yi away too.

277
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,120
Her?

278
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,800
I'll see.

279
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,280
Buxiu,

280
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
I have a friend…

281
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,320
Your Lordship, I can't hear you.

282
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,480
It's like this.

283
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,200
I have a friend

284
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,120
who used a fairy

285
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
to achieve his own goals.

286
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,760
And she was injured because of that.

287
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,640
He wants to make up to her

288
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,640
but he doesn't know what to do.

289
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,560
What will you do in this situation?

290
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
A friend? When do you have a friend?

291
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
Who is it? How come I don't know about it?

292
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,960
Did you make a new friend? When was it?

293
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,360
I shouldn't have asked you.

294
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,600
Your Lordship, you're back.

295
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,520
Granny Xun. His Lordship said
he had a friend to achieve his goals…

296
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,920
Buxiu.

297
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,960
Your Lordship, can't I speak about this?

298
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,800
You can.

299
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
His Lordship said his friend

300
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
used a fairy to achieve his goal,
and she was injured because of that.

301
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,320
He wants to make up to
her but doesn't know what to do.

302
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,840
Granny Xun,
do you know who this friend is?

303
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,720
When did he make a new friend?

304
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,480
This fairy friend of your friend…

305
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,960
What kind of person is she?

306
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,440
Her?

307
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,080
She…

308
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,960
She is

309
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,280
usually a carefree person

310
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,360
who likes to play tricks.

311
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,680
In truth,

312
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
she is loyal

313
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,480
and doesn't back away from trouble.

314
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,200
I think

315
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,600
she's a tough person.

316
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,240
Maybe your friend
can apologize to the fairy first.

317
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,720
He doesn't have a mouth.

318
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,760
It's better to give her more benefits
than to waste time talking nonsense.

319
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,000
Indeed.

320
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
I will talk to this friend of mine.

321
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,440
Your Lordship,

322
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,280
you haven't told me who this friend is.

323
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Let's go.

324
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,080
The Sunken Abyss case has been solved.

325
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,800
Hou Zhao did everything alone.

326
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,160
He admitted to his crimes and
his primordial spirit was destroyed.

327
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,720
There will be eternal sins upon him

328
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,640
and his soul has
vanished in the Six Realms.

329
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
The criminal, Hou Zhao, stated

330
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,200
that he used the Sunken Abyss
to make medicine for personal gain.

331
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,480
But he lacked
a portion of Bo's Medical Classics,

332
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,760
so he only made
the long-lost poison, Heavenly Grief.

333
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,280
However, he failed to make
the antidote, Golden Millet Dream.

334
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,520
According to the law, Hou Zhao's
primordial spirit has been destroyed.

335
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
All Heavenly Griefs are destroyed

336
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
to cleanse the Sunken Abyss.

337
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,200
- Well done!
- Something as evil as Heavenly Grief

338
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,320
should not be
allowed to exist in this world.

339
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,320
Yesterday, in the hall,
Hou Zhao wanted to reveal the mastermind.

340
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,920
Suddenly, he confessed to his crimes,

341
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,600
and said he was the only one involved.

342
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,120
It wasn't convincing.

343
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
He is dead, anyway.

344
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,440
It's best for the case to end

345
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,680
with a dead criminal.

346
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,720
Immortal Ji, do you not trust the result?

347
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,680
I do.

348
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,720
Lord Hanfeng, if you believe it, so do I.

349
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
I believe it.

350
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,600
The chief is
absolutely fair in judging a case.

351
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,040
Immortal Ji, if
you are interested in the truth,

352
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,880
you may investigate it yourself.

353
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,720
I dare not.
I don't know how to investigate cases.

354
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,080
I only know where
pretty fairies can be found.

355
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
I wouldn't have even asked about it

356
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,800
if it weren't for Ming Yi.

357
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,680
We searched Sunken Abyss
and found 326 doses of Heavenly Grief.

358
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,200
There were also poisonous substances
like Blood Pearl Bloom left behind.

359
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,520
All of them have been destroyed.

360
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
How are the innocent people

361
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,040
who were wrongly
brought to the Sunken Abyss

362
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,280
as criminals?

363
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,760
Lord Hanfeng,
all of them have been safely released.

364
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,840
This is all thanks to you, Immortal Ji.

365
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,280
Forgive my oversight.

366
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Immortal Ji, why don't you come with me?

367
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
My boat is very comfortable.

368
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
We can sit and chat.
It's true. Listen to me.

369
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,120
Immortal Ji, get on my boat.

370
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,520
Let me send you back.

371
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,080
I've always wanted to visit Wugui Sea.

372
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,640
Sun Liao, everyone knows

373
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,520
that you are always
talking behind Immortal Ji's back.

374
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,520
- He will never get on your boat.
- I'm sure Immortal Ji will take my boat.

375
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,640
I'm good at Divine Craft.

376
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
The boat I built is very comfortable.

377
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,080
How is your Divine Craft better than mine?

378
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,720
Immortal Ji, come with me.

379
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,560
We can talk about
your past in the Sunken Abyss.

380
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,640
All of you are trying to flatter me.

381
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,080
Are you trying to make friends with me

382
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,600
or find out if I used Golden Millet Dream
to grow my spiritual veins?

383
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,480
Or are you

384
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,960
curious about

385
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,440
whether I possess the Golden Millet Dream?

386
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,440
Does he have it?

387
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,360
Ji,

388
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,240
if you won't make it clear,

389
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
all of us will be curious
and discuss it behind your back.

390
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,280
Hou Zhao said he failed to
make the Golden Millet Dream.

391
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,240
Why don't you just tell us honestly

392
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,520
and not leave us hanging?

393
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Do you have the Golden Millet Dream?

394
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,040
- That's right.
- Do you have it?

395
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,160
Do you have it?

396
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,320
To be honest,

397
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,280
I…

398
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
Crooked.

399
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,400
My Lord!

400
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,040
That's… I can't stand him.

401
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,400
This…

402
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,280
This is inappropriate.

403
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,840
They are doing this in public?

404
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,000
Why is he carrying her?

405
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,400
Why are you here?

406
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,360
I brewed a lot of Golden Millet Dream
and brought a jar for you.

407
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,880
This is brewed from Fortuniana Rose.

408
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,120
You'll drift into
a cozy dream after a whiff.

409
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,000
It fits the name of Golden Millet Dream.

410
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
So this is
the Golden Millet Dream you speak of?

411
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,160
Of course.

412
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,080
What else do you think it is?

413
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,200
You think you can take
the Golden Millet Dream before me?

414
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,840
Immortal Sun Liao,

415
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,880
you usually call my lord a criminal.

416
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,280
You were so vocal behind his back.

417
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,040
To my surprise, you are also very
vocal when flattering him.

418
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,680
Immortal Tai.

419
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,920
Your Divine Craft is good.

420
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,480
However, you are even better at hypocrisy.

421
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,560
- Lun…
- Lun'an.

422
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,200
Immortal Lun'an.

423
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Your boat is good.

424
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,200
However, you used to say
that my lord could only walk

425
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
as he didn't deserve a boat.

426
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,760
Why have you changed your opinion today?

427
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,880
Even now you still won't leave.

428
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,680
Are you all cultivating to be shameless?

429
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,680
You…

430
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,080
Let's go.

431
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,480
There's no point in staying here.

432
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,000
Let's go.

433
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,480
Let's go.

434
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,240
No wonder you want
Fairy Ming Yi by your side.

435
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,480
She is smart

436
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,080
and knows how to get you out of trouble.

437
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,440
Get me out of trouble?

438
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,680
Was someone trying to give me a hard time?

439
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Are you sure it's not you, Yan?

440
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,120
I dare not.

441
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,920
Don't pull me away. I want to try it.

442
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,480
Why are you dragging me?

443
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,680
Take your Golden Millet Dream.

444
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,360
Who is that?

445
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,400
I don't recognize him.

446
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,080
And that

447
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,560
is also why I know who he is.

448
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,600
My Lord, did you only
leave after I fell asleep last night?

449
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,720
Are you still going to
sleep with me in the future?

450
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,520
Why do you call this
wine Golden Millet Dream?

451
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,800
Are you also curious
about whether I possess it or not?

452
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,760
Are you a fool, My Lord?
Who wants that thing?

453
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,000
I heard them annoying you

454
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,280
and trying to coddle you.

455
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,000
It was as if they all wanted a share
of that Golden Millet Dream.

456
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,480
Therefore, I called this
wine Golden Millet Dream.

457
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
Otherwise, no one
would use that as a name.

458
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,160
It sounds terrible.

459
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,400
What is the name of this wine then?

460
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,840
It's called My Heart's Delight.

461
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,880
It's for you, My Lord.

462
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,320
I only drink the wine I brew.

463
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,960
I appreciate your goodwill.

464
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,800
I'll accept it then. Thanks.

465
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,880
Ji Bozai is very cautious.

466
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,239
I'm sure he won't
drink the wine you give him.

467
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,239
It's all right. He might not drink it now

468
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,400
but he might in the future.

469
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,600
<i>Sorry, Ji Bozai. You used me once,</i>

470
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,679
<i>so I'll return the favor too.</i>

471
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,600
What's wrong?

472
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
It's nothing.

473
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,840
Your smile is beautiful.
It's like you have no trouble at all.

474
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,000
Is that so?

475
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,240
My Lord, are these for me?

476
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,480
Isn't this everything you won
from the tournaments?

477
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,480
There's more than that. Just take them.

478
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,720
Why?

479
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,120
You were tortured yesterday.

480
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,800
These are your reward.

481
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,000
It seems like you still
care about me, My Lord.

482
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
<i>He's truly feeling sorry about that.</i>

483
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>Indeed. I wouldn't have to suffer that</i>
<i>if it weren't for you.</i>

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,840
Who are you?

485
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,520
Why are you so afraid?

486
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,680
Didn't you summon me here?

487
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Are you new here? You don't recognize me.

488
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,880
That's enough.

489
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,800
Shao Qun has never seen you in this form.
Spare him.

490
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,600
XUN MING, GENERAL OF JIXING ABYSS

491
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,280
General Xun Ming.

492
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,480
- Leave us alone.
- Yes.

493
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,920
You still look the same.

494
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,920
I'm not using my former appearance.

495
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,960
I wouldn't have summoned you
if it weren't for an emergency.

496
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Is there still nothing you can
do about Ji Bozai, Lord Hanfeng?

497
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,120
That day, in the hall,
I controlled the emperor forcefully

498
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,520
and suppressed Hou Zhao's case.

499
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,480
That's why
he couldn't reveal the mastermind.

500
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,320
However, there were many loose ends.

501
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,600
Are you worried

502
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,480
that the emperor might
connect you to the Sunken Abyss case?

503
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,160
The most important thing now
is to get rid of Ji Bozai.

504
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm sure he's the one behind everything.

505
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Perhaps he is trying to avenge Bo Yulan.

506
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,320
<i>Don't forget.</i>
<i>You were involved in this as well.</i>

507
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,840
Ji Bozai has never told us

508
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
whether he possesses
the Golden Millet Dream or not.

509
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,280
Silence amounts

510
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,680
to an admission.

511
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,160
If Ji Bozai was
the one who planned all this,

512
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,360
he would surely think of
something to get rid of us later

513
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,360
since he failed to get
Hou Zhao to reveal our identities.

514
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,080
You must be careful.

515
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
I'm from the Yousu Fox Tribe.

516
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,800
No one in the Six Realms
can find my primordial spirit.

517
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,000
Trying to kill me?

518
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Let's see if he has the means to do it.

519
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,320
<i>I'll go and take Ji Bozai's life instead.</i>

520
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,320
Ji Bozai didn't drink
the wine you brewed for him.

521
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
You helped him steal
the painting back then.

522
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,360
He treated you

523
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,520
and bought you scallion pancakes.

524
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,360
I thought he fell in love with you.

525
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,560
In the end, he did something so incredible
during the warrior selection.

526
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,240
Do your ways of charming him
actually work?

527
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,160
It might work on others

528
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,160
but for Ji Bozai…

529
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,000
He is too cunning.
It's difficult to judge.

530
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,160
At least, we know
that he went to Moonlit Blossoms

531
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,960
to cover his true
objective of meeting Ruo Shui.

532
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,480
His persona as a philanderer
might also be a ruse, then.

533
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
He tricks other people

534
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,560
to find out the real murderer
of his master, Bo Yulan,

535
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,720
before he can avenge her.

536
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,920
If I want to marry a man like him,

537
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,640
I need to be smart, considerate,

538
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,080
and a good bit of silliness.

539
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,000
The most important
thing is understanding him.

540
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
I've achieved all of that.

541
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,640
Based on what you said,

542
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,400
isn't Princess Tianji the best candidate?

543
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,960
She is even in charge of Shouhua Academy
which helps Ji Bozai more.

544
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,160
She is not a suitable candidate.

545
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,520
That place is complicated.

546
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
Who knows how many dangers lurk there?

547
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,840
You are right.

548
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,080
We've finally

549
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,200
moved a step closer
towards the Golden Millet Dream.

550
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,200
Twenty-Seven,

551
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,320
we've had a tough journey.

552
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,640
Master and Mother
are waiting for us to go back.

553
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,320
Especially Old Man She.
He believes that I will return.

554
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,920
We escaped from Yaoguang Mountain

555
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,760
and fell into the depths of the valley.

556
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,680
Do you still remember?

557
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,680
When we first arrived at Jixing Abyss,
we couldn't even afford any food

558
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,080
so we had to gather fruits to survive.

559
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,560
You had no idea that I was so hungry

560
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,520
that I planned to make a stew out of you.

561
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,800
After leaving Freezing Hot Waters,

562
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,160
we tried everything
to approach Ji Bozai and failed.

563
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,360
You found out
that he often visited Moonlit Blossoms

564
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
so I sold myself to the place

565
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,520
to approach Ji Bozai

566
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,200
while helping
the people of Freezing Hot Waters.

567
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,680
Can we talk about how you were going
to make a stew out of me?

568
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,600
To my surprise, Lady Fuyue was evil.

569
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,800
She hit me when I danced badly
and wouldn't give me food.

570
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,040
I used to be a Warrior God,
but I ended up being so miserable.

571
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,720
That's enough. I still have things to do.

572
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,080
Help me investigate Xun Ming.

573
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,680
He is probably Ji Bozai's next target.

574
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,920
I must assist him

575
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,520
to capture his heart.

576
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,040
You haven't given me an explanation!

577
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,200
Were you really going
to make stew out of me?

578
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,760
Ming Yi!

579
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,880
Authorized personnel only.

580
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,520
Please wait here.
