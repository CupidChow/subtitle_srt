1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,440
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG
SHUANG'S "LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
Add two more hours.

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,080
There's no one watching us.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,560
Why are you extending your punishment?

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
I was wrong today.

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,720
Mother was right to punish me.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,880
You only ran out to buy scallion pancakes.

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
Mother was right.

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,040
I cannot slack off.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,840
As the Crown Prince,

12
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,440
I should behave like one.

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
Do your best!

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,320
I'll buy scallion pancakes for you later.

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll buy two for you.

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
Do your best!

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,960
Twenty-Seven.

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,880
-Someone recognized me today.
-That's impossible.

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,360
With the Veil of Illusion,

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,920
everyone will see you as a boy.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
How could they recognize you?

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,600
Moreover, you'd look like a boy
who looks completely different.

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,640
You won't be discovered no matter what.

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
You are right.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
How could anyone recognize me?

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,160
No one knows who I am at all.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
Ming Xian.

28
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,120
Ming Xian?

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Is this my name?

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,920
What else?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,960
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Warrior God Ming Xian.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
They are all your names.

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,600
You win every battle you've fought

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,840
and have a mighty
companion beast, Twenty-Seven.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,680
You sound amazing no matter what.

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,960
Here you go. Dried fish.

38
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,000
You shouldn't look so gloomy.

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,880
The most important
thing is to be happy every day.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
I'm here for you no matter what.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,040
Understand?

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,920
EPISODE 13

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,240
Twenty-Seven.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,760
Do you think
the name list mentioned by Xinliu

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,840
was hidden by
Mu Qibai in the Sunken Abyss?

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
Why don't I go to the Sunken Abyss?

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,640
The earlier we know who from
Yaoguang Mountain is related to Mu Qibai,

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,600
the earlier
we can find the person who poisoned you.

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
Don't.

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,200
Ji Bozai used Ruo Shui

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,760
to uncover a dark side of the Sunken Abyss

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
and made it seem like order
has returned to the Sunken Abyss now.

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,960
But
I think Mu Qibai won't give up so easily.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm afraid it's still dangerous.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
What are you afraid of?

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,200
I walk silently. No one will discover me.

57
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,520
No. Let me think about it. I…

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,519
This child…

59
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,840
Caught you.

60
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
Ming Xian's kitty.

61
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
Talk.

62
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,200
Is your master in Jixing Abyss as well?

63
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,160
You are quite stubborn.

64
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
Stop playing dead.

65
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
Is he dead for real?

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,800
Something's not right. This feeling…

67
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Did something happen to Twenty-Seven?

68
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Twenty-Seven!

69
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Twenty-Seven!

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,920
Twenty-Seven!

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,560
Twenty-Seven!

72
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,080
It's all right. I'm here.

73
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm here.

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,480
-Don't be afraid. Who did this to you?
-Sorry.

75
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
Ming Yi, sorry.

76
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,360
-I was caught.
-Stop apologizing.

77
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,320
Twenty-Seven, stop talking.
Let me heal you.

78
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,720
You'll be fine.

79
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
You can't use your spiritual power.

80
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm fine.

81
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Cats have nine lives.

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,640
As if!

83
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
Let go of me.

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,840
Twenty-Seven.

85
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,320
You're fine. I'll bring you back.

86
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,880
Great. All of you are here.

87
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,280
Are you the ones who hurt Twenty-Seven?

88
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,680
I won't let any of you leave.

89
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,640
Lord Hanfeng.

90
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Do you plan to raid Wugui Sea

91
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,160
because His Lordship is
still at Shouhua Academy?

92
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,040
Ming Yi.

93
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
With me around,

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
none of you may enter.

95
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,440
Granny Xun, you have misunderstood.

96
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
I've received news

97
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,880
that Yaoguang Mountain's Ming Xian

98
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,440
has trespassed into Jixing Abyss.

99
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
We've been searching
everywhere in Jixing Abyss

100
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,400
and caught Ming Xian's companion beast.

101
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,280
He was very sly
and escaped by playing dead.

102
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Little did he know, with how weak he is,

103
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,440
he only escaped from Dragon Carp Terrace

104
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,760
because Lord Hanfeng willed it so.

105
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,120
Lord Hanfeng wanted to see

106
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,960
where he was hiding in Jixing Abyss.

107
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,800
Do you think it's a coincidence

108
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,200
that the companion
beast ran back to Wugui Sea?

109
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,400
Granny Xun, take a look.

110
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,440
This is the Search Mirror
that will react to Ming Xian.

111
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
Granny Xun,

112
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,240
why does the Search Mirror

113
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,560
point to Fairy Ming Yi directly?

114
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,680
Does it mean Fairy Ming Yi

115
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,160
is actually
Yaoguang Mountain's Ming Xian in disguise?

116
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,840
This is impossible.

117
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,400
This is never-ending.

118
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,840
Why are there so many pointless

119
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,600
and useless tasks

120
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
that are just for show in Judgment Hall?

121
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,280
I won't have time to find the medicine.

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Guards!

123
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,880
You there.

124
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,800
Please get a few guards on duty

125
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
to help me mark these documents as read.

126
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
I know everyone is busy,

127
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,480
but it's different for guards on duty.

128
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,000
Even if they're on duty,
they are just standing there.

129
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,240
Come inside, have some tea,
and take a break

130
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,160
while helping me out.

131
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,960
But there's no one else in Judgment Hall.

132
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
No way.

133
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,720
They are better at slacking off than I am.

134
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,960
Not at all.

135
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,480
Actually, all of
them are very responsible.

136
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,360
However, Ji Bozai was harboring Ming Xian

137
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,640
so Lord Hanfeng took them away

138
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,120
to capture Ming Xian at Wugui Sea.

139
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
Ji Bozai is harboring Ming Xian?

140
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,040
When did that happen?

141
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,000
Ming Yi, what's going on?

142
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,240
How surprising.

143
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Immortal Ji
married Fairy Ming Yi not long ago.

144
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
Right now,

145
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,960
not only did Ming Xian's companion beast
escape to Wugui Sea,

146
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,640
but the Search Mirror points at you too.

147
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm sure you're upset.

148
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,400
He's your companion beast after all.

149
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
Unfortunately,

150
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,000
the proof is irrefutable.

151
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
I have no choice but to believe

152
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,800
that our proud warrior, Ji Bozai,

153
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
is colluding with Yaoguang Mountain

154
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,840
to harbor the enemy
of Jixing Abyss, Ming Xian.

155
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,720
Sun Liao, capture them.

156
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,280
Try me.

157
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,920
The contraption and the key are here.

158
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
This is the full layout of Zhuojin Tower.

159
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
In every Qingyun Tournament,

160
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,240
there will be a Gudiao beast in the arena.

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,520
Many warriors died to it.

162
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
This is…

163
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,200
A way to defeat the Gudiao beast?

164
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
Get all of them to learn it.

165
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,920
I'm sure it's possible even for a fool.

166
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,000
-Your Highness.
-What are you doing?

167
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,480
We are here on Lord Hanfeng's order

168
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
to capture the criminal, Ji Bozai.

169
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
Coming at me again?

170
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,000
What is Lord Hanfeng
accusing me of this time?

171
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,640
Lord Hanfeng has found

172
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,240
that Ji Bozai is harboring

173
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
Ming Xian of
Yaoguang Mountain at Wugui Sea

174
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,840
by disguising him as a woman

175
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
under the identity of Ming Yi.

176
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,520
Ming Yi is Ming Xian?

177
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,520
When did Lord Hanfeng make this story up?

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,640
Even then, do you believe in that story?

179
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,360
Have all of you gone senile?

180
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,880
How could you say something so absurd?

181
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Everyone in the Six Realms

182
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,080
knows that Ming Xian's
companion beast is a white cat.

183
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,000
That cat was captured in Wugui Sea.

184
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,560
Moreover, Lord Hanfeng has a Search Mirror

185
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,240
that only reacts to Ming Xian.

186
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,960
-Search Mirror?
-Take a guess on who the Search Mirror

187
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,280
pointed to?

188
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,920
This fairy is suspicious.

189
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
She triggered
a reaction from our Search Mirror.

190
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,000
Please move.

191
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,080
Lord Hanfeng will take
Ming Yi away for questioning.

192
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,680
Once she confesses, we'll know

193
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,360
if you ever harbored Ming Xian.

194
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,080
However, the current situation

195
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,840
indicates that you are an accomplice.

196
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,080
You cannot stay in Shouhua Academy

197
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,800
and be the exemplar for warriors.

198
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,720
Immortal Ji, please cooperate.

199
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
Everyone,

200
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,240
Ming Xian and
his companion beast are resisting capture.

201
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,760
I have no choice but to kill them all.

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,520
As for Ji Bozai,

203
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,400
we have irrefutable proof
of his collusion with the enemy.

204
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,080
His identity as a warrior will be stripped
and be demoted to a criminal.

205
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
Ming Yi is just a weak fairy.

206
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
It is easy for you to get a confession
out of her through torture.

207
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,240
All of you are just trying
to slander Ji Bozai.

208
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,200
Lord Hanfeng, you are
trying to slander His Lordship.

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,720
But you have to go through me first.

210
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,920
Granny Xun, do you have a death wish

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,960
and hope Ji Bozai will
join you in the underworld later?

212
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,000
Your loyalty moves me.

213
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
In that case, I will grant your wish.

214
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,280
Where is he?

215
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,040
Wugui Sea.

216
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
Ji Bozai.

217
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,880
I sent my men to
bring you in for questioning.

218
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Did you resist and escape?

219
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,960
In that case,
my allegation of your collusion

220
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,040
and treason isn't a false accusation.

221
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,800
I have no time to talk to you.

222
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,560
Wait.

223
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,240
Uncle.

224
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,400
What's going on?

225
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,040
Ming Yi is obviously a normal fairy.

226
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
How can she be Ming Xian?

227
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
It's just nice that
the people of Shouhua Academy are here.

228
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,120
I will make things clear right here.

229
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,760
Today, a young man
trespassed into the Sunken Abyss

230
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,960
and was captured alive by Sun Liao.

231
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,520
He is over there.

232
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,640
Do all of you know
that he is a companion beast?

233
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
-A companion beast?
-Companion beast?

234
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,160
-He's indeed a white cat.
-He's a white cat.

235
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
Why is this
companion beast in Ming Yi's arms?

236
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,840
Why is Ming Xian's
companion beast in Wugui Sea?

237
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Right.

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,920
-Ming Xian's companion beast.
-Does it mean…

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sure all of you know clearly

240
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,040
what the companion beast of Ming Xian is.

241
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Within the Six Realms,

242
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,600
the only one who has
a white cat companion beast

243
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,320
that can turn into a human is Ming Xian.

244
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,560
This is indeed
Ming Xian's companion beast.

245
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,880
How come his companion beast
appears in Jixing Abyss?

246
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,040
Ji Bozai,

247
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,840
I told Sun Liao

248
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
to deliberately let
this companion beast go.

249
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,840
He saw it run back to
Wugui Sea immediately.

250
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
Your new wife is even more interesting.

251
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,400
She's hugging
Ming Xian's companion beast tightly.

252
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,520
Sun Liao.

253
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
You are a joke!

254
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,640
You were a warrior in
the last Qingyun Tournament.

255
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,560
However, Ji Bozai defeated you easily

256
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
so you had a grudge against him.

257
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
That was why you spread
false information to my uncle.

258
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,800
I…

259
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,040
Uncle, I think there's a misunderstanding.

260
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
Ji Bozai has nothing to do with Ming Xian.

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,160
In my opinion,

262
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,880
this companion beast must
have escaped to Wugui Sea by accident

263
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
when it was in a panic.

264
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,400
Sun Liao wanted to use this

265
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,360
to frame Ming Yi, a fairy, as Ming Xian?

266
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,080
How ridiculous.

267
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,560
Besides, you don't
care about Ming Yi at all.

268
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,960
You only want to incriminate Immortal Ji.

269
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Your Highness, I…

270
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,320
Uncle, what do you think?

271
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,440
It fled in a panic and it chose Wugui Sea?

272
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,400
This is too much of a coincidence.

273
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,960
Besides, how do you explain this?

274
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,680
This is an artifact made by Ming Xian,
the Search Mirror.

275
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,560
If Ming Xian appears nearby,

276
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,720
the mirror will react

277
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,080
and point to his position.

278
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
-It does point at her.
-Yes.

279
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,960
She really is Ming Xian.

280
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,880
This is impossible.

281
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,680
-But she's a girl.
-That's right.

282
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,280
Ji Bozai's new wife
is not a fairy at Moonlit Blossoms at all.

283
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,160
Perhaps Ji Bozai
learned some evil spell from somewhere

284
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,360
and turned Ming Xian into a girl

285
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,520
to hide his identity so
he could be by his side.

286
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,680
Ji Bozai,

287
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,920
this is irrefutable proof of
your collusion with the enemy.

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,600
Surrender now.

289
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,200
Lord Hanfeng,
you went through all the hassle

290
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
just to incriminate yourself?

291
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,760
Ji Bozai, have you gone mad?

292
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,760
You dare manipulate the Search Mirror

293
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,880
in front of everyone?

294
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes. I did it.

295
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,680
Since the Search Mirror
can be manipulated so easily,

296
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
it means you can also manipulate it.

297
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,520
Besides, it's just a stupid mirror.

298
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,920
Can it really point to Ming Xian
because you said so?

299
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,600
You're trying to slander me
by using such a broken artifact?

300
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,040
Lord Hanfeng,

301
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
I think you are the one who has gone mad.

302
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,400
This mirror was made by Ming Xian indeed.

303
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,200
When Ming Xian was 16,

304
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
he made this artifact

305
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,320
after winning the Qingyun Tournament
for the fourth time.

306
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
If a criminal escapes,

307
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,480
this mirror can connect with that person's
belongings

308
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,720
and pinpoint the criminal.

309
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,560
That is how it gained
the name, Search Mirror.

310
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,400
The criminal, Hou Zhao, was the one

311
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,560
who offered it as
tribute to Yaoguang Mountain.

312
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,640
Lord Chengyun of
Yaoguang Mountain, Ming Xin,

313
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,920
used this mirror to
make fun of Jixing Abyss,

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,840
saying they loved crafting artifacts
yet they couldn't even make

315
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,760
a decent artifact for locating criminals.

316
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
Hou Zhao was angry

317
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
and recorded this
with the Recording Mirror.

318
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,520
I've seen the Search Mirror
through the Recording Mirror.

319
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,040
It is indeed this mirror before us.

320
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,360
Hou Zhao did commit a grave crime

321
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
but he did one good thing after all.

322
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,480
Otherwise,

323
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,520
Lord Hanfeng
would've been wrongly accused.

324
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,200
Ji Bozai,
do you have anything else to say?

325
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,960
However, I don't understand one thing.

326
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,280
The Search Mirror has always
been kept in the Yaoguang Palace.

327
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,960
How did you get it, Lord Hanfeng?

328
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,200
You accused Ji Bozai of collusion

329
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,560
but you, the one who has
the Search Mirror of Yaoguang Mountain,

330
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
are even more suspicious.

331
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,240
Situ Ling.

332
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,680
Why are you questioning me instead?

333
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,600
As expected. Ming Xian created this
for fun when he was young.

334
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,360
Even someone like me,
who has no spiritual veins,

335
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,600
can control this mirror
and manipulate it as I wish.

336
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,800
This is too easy.

337
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,840
Immortal Situ.

338
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,080
What are you doing?

339
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,680
To uncover the truth, obviously.

340
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,200
Today, you redeployed all my
guards at Judgment Hall

341
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,840
without my approval.

342
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,840
How odd.

343
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,560
Judgment Hall ought to
investigate cases independently,

344
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,720
yet you can order my men as you wish.

345
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,040
With your support,

346
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,080
they even captured

347
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,600
the only warrior who defeated
Ming Xian in the past seven years.

348
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,880
My title as the chief

349
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,680
feels toothless.

350
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,800
How interesting.

351
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
Out of nowhere,

352
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,320
you accused a girl

353
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
of being the Crown Prince
of Yaoguang Mountain

354
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,400
and even framed me
for harboring Ming Xian.

355
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,360
All right. I'll admit it.

356
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,600
Ming Xian begged me to collude with him

357
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
and wanted to serve me

358
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,120
so that Yaoguang Mountain
would lose its Blessed Rain.

359
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,880
He even turned into a girl to marry me.

360
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,360
This is such an elaborate ruse.

361
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
-Right?
-Uncle, please tell us

362
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,520
who gave you the Search Mirror.

363
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
That person must be the mastermind

364
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,040
who colluded with Yaoguang Mountain.

365
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,360
Uncle, you must not
be tricked by evil people.

366
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,040
Worry not.

367
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,120
No traitors or suspicious people

368
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
can get away under my nose.

369
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,120
However, isn't our priority now

370
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,000
to confirm Fairy Ming Yi's identity?

371
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,600
Perhaps Ming Xian used
some evil spells to transform himself.

372
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,040
Besides, it's also strange
that Fairy Ming Yi insists on

373
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,320
protecting this young man.

374
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,200
I must take her back for questioning.

375
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,080
Sure.

376
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,520
Twenty-Seven.

377
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,640
Ji Bozai, what are you doing?

378
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,080
After I defeated Ming Xian that day,

379
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,520
I took his companion beast as a trophy.

380
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
The owner of this white cat now

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,040
is me.

382
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,360
That was why he returned to
Wugui Sea after he was seriously injured.

383
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,920
Lord Hanfeng,

384
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,440
you falsely accused my wife

385
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,640
of being the Crown Prince
of Yaoguang Mountain

386
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
without any evidence.

387
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,480
If I also let you take my pet away,

388
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,280
I will no longer

389
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,200
have a place in
Jixing Abyss in the future.

390
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,840
What a joke.

391
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,920
I've never seen
you capture Ming Xian's companion beast

392
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,800
at the Qingyun Tournament.

393
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,320
You're now trying to
protect a companion beast.

394
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,560
Ji Bozai,
how dare you call yourself innocent?

395
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,200
Ji Bozai came from the Sunken Abyss.

396
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,760
Before I use him,

397
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
I've checked his background.

398
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,960
Uncle, if you don't believe him,

399
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,040
I can vouch for his innocence.

400
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,440
If you find Ming Yi and
the companion beast suspicious,

401
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
you may capture them.

402
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,640
Why must you

403
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
slander the person I chose?

404
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,760
Fine. I have ways to make her speak

405
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,640
and find out who she really is anyway.

406
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,080
Ming Yi is my wife.

407
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,680
I know who she is more than anyone else.

408
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,440
If you harm her today,

409
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,120
I won't let you live to see tomorrow.

410
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Since she is your wife, Immortal Ji,

411
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,520
I still have another way

412
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,760
to verify her true identity.

413
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,760
Marriage Stone.

414
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,160
Marriage Stone?

415
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,720
That is a good way indeed.

416
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,360
The Marriage Stone is an ancient stone.

417
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
It can be used to
verify one's true identity.

418
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,520
Every soul has a name.

419
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,320
The name must match the body

420
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,480
before the name can
be carved on the stone.

421
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
Ji Bozai is a warrior.

422
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,600
He is not supposed to form a heart imprint

423
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
and share divine consciousness.

424
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,400
However, since Immortal Ji
trusts Fairy Ming Yi so much,

425
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
I do think

426
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,840
that this method of verification

427
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,120
is worth a try.

428
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,320
Fine.

429
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
I will prove it to all of you.

430
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,080
I will make up

431
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,160
for what I owe you previously.

432
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,840
If the visitors are lovers,

433
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,040
the Love Bridge will be connected.

434
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Please get on the bridge.

435
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
They passed through
Mengyuan Pond's barrier.

436
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
How is that possible?

437
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,080
Outsiders are not
allowed in the Lovers' Domain.

438
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,360
Stay back.

439
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,760
Shao Qun.

440
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,680
Uncle, you know very well

441
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,040
that this barrier is impenetrable to all

442
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,560
except for two people in love.

443
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm sure they've passed
the Magpie Bridge Domain

444
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,600
and entered the depths of Mengyuan Pond.

445
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,520
JI BOZAI

446
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,920
If I am not Ming Yi,

447
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,800
what are the consequences?

448
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,200
The Lovers' Domain only accepts true love.

449
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,840
If there is any deceit,
divine punishment will follow.

450
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,640
At best, the primordial
spirit will be shattered.

451
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
At worst, one will be reduced to ashes.

452
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,760
Do you want to die?

453
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,120
Are you stopping me

454
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
because you're
worried that I might kill you

455
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,640
after I know the truth?

456
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,800
No matter who you are,

457
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
everything has gone your way.

458
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,760
We are now on the same boat.

459
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,360
If I cannot ascertain your identity,

460
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,160
I will also be in trouble.

461
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,440
No one can stop me
from doing the things I want,

462
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,800
not even you.

463
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
JI BOZAI, MING YI

464
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,080
Wrong.

465
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,800
I knew it.

466
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,200
When it comes to weddings in Jixing Abyss,

467
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,120
according to tradition,

468
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,360
lovers must first pick
an auspicious day and a blessed land.

469
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,520
They then make a wish to
the starlight, to stay together for life.

470
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,159
If the Radiant Spirit
scatters starlight upon them,

471
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,239
that's the greatest blessing of all.

472
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
After that,

473
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,159
under the witness of the mandarin ducks,

474
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,040
they carve their names
upon the Marriage Stone.

475
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,440
How tedious.

476
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,560
This is the Radiant Spirit from
the Radiant Galaxy in Jixing Abyss.

477
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,400
Lovers will make a wish upon
the scattering Radiant Spirit

478
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,080
so they can be with each other forever.

479
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,120
He has been struck by
Divine Lightning many times

480
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,920
yet he still won't give up.

481
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,240
We are tired.

482
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,040
Whatever. Let him carve it.

483
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
JI BOZAI, MING YI

484
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
Ji Bozai!

485
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Ji Bozai!

486
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,240
Ji Bozai!

487
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,840
Both of you,
congratulations on tying the knot.

488
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,440
You now share a heart
imprint and divine consciousness.

489
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,200
Let's go out first.

490
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,760
After I left the Sunken Abyss,

491
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,120
this is my first time

492
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,160
wanting to trust someone.

493
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,280
I'm an idiot.

494
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,600
Since the beginning,

495
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,120
you've been lying to me.

496
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
And now,

497
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,080
I can't abandon you anymore.

498
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,320
You got your wish.

499
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,320
Are you content now?

500
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,200
Every day, you watch

501
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,440
as you toy with my feelings.

502
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,000
Does it bring you happiness?

503
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,800
-No.
-In your eyes,

504
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,680
I'm

505
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,960
just a fool.

506
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,120
Sorry.

507
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,080
Sorry.

508
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Sorry.

509
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,360
-Ji Bozai, I…
-Enough.

510
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,880
No matter what it is that you want,

511
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,840
I've made it up to you

512
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
with this ritual.

513
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,440
I don't owe you anymore.

514
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,960
Ji Bozai, actually I… I…

515
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,040
Ming Yi,

516
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,960
whenever I feel pain,

517
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
I will make you feel it too.

518
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,400
JI BOZAI, MING YI

519
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,920
Congratulations! The newlyweds
have carved their names.

520
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,360
Ji Bozai and Ming Yi

521
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,080
are a match made in heaven
who will have lasting happiness.

522
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,920
It seems like the ancient stone

523
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,000
has verified Ming Yi's identity.

524
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,200
You see it yourself, Lord Hanfeng.

525
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,200
I'm sure you can
cast your worry aside now.

526
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,560
If any despicable individual

527
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,000
tries to slander
Fairy Ming Yi in the future,

528
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,960
the Judgment Hall will
never forgive them easily.

529
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
Great.

530
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,560
Situ Ling, you're quite something.

531
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Lord Hanfeng,

532
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,560
are you happy now?

533
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
Remember.

534
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,680
From now on,

535
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,000
no one else
can question my wife's identity.

536
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,840
Naturally.

537
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,080
Immortal Ji and
Fairy Ming Yi, congratulations

538
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,280
on verifying your identities.

539
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,800
Immortal Situ,

540
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,280
today's event must be
recorded in the books at Judgment Hall.

541
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,360
Why don't I return to
Judgment Hall with you?
