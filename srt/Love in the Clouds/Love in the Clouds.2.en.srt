1
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
<i>LOVE IN THE CLOUDS</i>

2
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,120
I wouldn't have taken in a jinx like you,

3
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
if you hadn't insisted on
joining Moonlit Blossoms.

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,800
You're a jinx!

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,440
You made Immortal He drunk two days ago

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
and he passed out for three days.

7
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
Yesterday, you gave
Immortal Zhang a massage

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,920
and gave him a fracture!

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
Today,

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160
I asked you to praise Immortal Li

11
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,960
and you said he had
the biggest head in the Six Realms!

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,080
You're quite something!

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
I have a headache now because of you!

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Tell me.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Can you do a better job?

16
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
I can.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,320
Leave if you can't!

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,400
EPISODE 2

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,720
Your Lordship, she's not inside.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,880
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
- Wait for me here.
- Yes.

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,400
You're back, My Lord. Are you hungry?

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
I made scallion pancakes.

24
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,360
It's nice.

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,600
The owner of
Moonlit Blossoms, Fuyue, told me

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,440
I must be hardworking and virtuous

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,720
to capture the heart of a man.

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
So, I figured

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,480
I would find a kitchen
to make you breakfast.

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,640
Scallion pancakes?

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
Were you making this?

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,280
Scallion pancakes
are my favorite food in this world.

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,040
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Why didn't you come to find me?

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,520
You are worried about my safety

36
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
and don't allow me to leave.

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,880
So, I must do something for you, at least.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
My Lord, do you

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,200
miss me?

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Of course, I miss you.

41
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
What are you doing, My Lord?

42
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
You just woke up.

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,200
I feel like

44
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,200
doing some stretching.

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,960
My Lord, are you trying to…

46
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,680
It's not right.

47
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
You seem like…

48
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Did you bite me?

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not an auspicious day.

50
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
Doing this will affect your cultivation.

51
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
You have the spiritual root
so you must take care of your body.

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,680
You said your feelings for me were sincere

53
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
but you are actually a spoilsport.

54
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
In that case,

55
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,280
you may return.

56
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Boring fairies like
you are not welcome here.

57
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
- My Lord.
- Granny Xun.

58
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
My Lord.

59
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,840
- My Lordship.
- Send her back to Moonlit Blossoms.

60
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,880
- Yes.
- My Lord, I was wrong.

61
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,000
Please don't send me
back to Moonlit Blossoms.

62
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,960
If I go back,

63
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
the owner of
Moonlit Blossoms will think I'm useless

64
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
and torture me to death.

65
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,920
My lunch…

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,840
That's none of my business.

67
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
My Lord.

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
My Lord. I was born in a poor family.

69
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
My parents have passed away.

70
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,000
I spent my days in
Moonlit Blossoms suffering.

71
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,120
I only beg you to give me a place to stay.

72
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm begging you.

73
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,760
Are you done?

74
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,720
Your story is also ordinary.

75
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
That makes you even more boring.

76
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,040
My Lord! My Lord!

77
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,960
You are saving a life
by letting me stay here!

78
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,640
- Why do you have so many things to say?
- I'll do anything and everything

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
to repay you.

80
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,440
You must believe me, My Lord!

81
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
- Just leave.
- I'm useful to you, My Lord.

82
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,840
My Lord, I'm willing to
do everything you tell me!

83
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,240
My Lord, let me stay!

84
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,600
Granny Xun.

85
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,560
Lord Ji misunderstood.

86
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,200
I… I wanted to do it

87
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
but I wasn't ready.

88
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
Is Lord Ji that impatient
and wants to send me back?

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,680
Is he that heartless?
If he sends me back to Moonlit Blossoms,

90
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll be in trouble, Granny Xun!

91
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,320
I beg you, Granny Xun.
Please persuade him.

92
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,080
If he's sick of me,
I can stay as a servant.

93
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,520
- I'll be your servant, Granny Xun.
- Can you be quiet for a while?

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Fine.

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
Just send me back.

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,480
With no one by Lord Ji's side,

97
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm sure someone will arrange
another fairy to serve him.

98
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Granny Xun, you must
screen everyone thoroughly.

99
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,200
I really care about Lord Ji.

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,120
You…

101
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,160
Twenty-Seven, I'm relying on you.

102
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Tell Mu Qibai's men

103
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,160
that Ji Bozai has sent
me back to Moonlit Blossoms.

104
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
JIXING ABYSS, HUANSHA MARKET

105
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
Wait for me!

106
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,600
- Slow down.
- Hurry!

107
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,840
- Let's go!
- Drink up.

108
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,600
All of you are so early. I'm late.

109
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,600
It's my fault.

110
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,960
I went to Moonlit Blossoms
to see what was going on.

111
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm sure you don't know this.

112
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Immortal Ji Bozai brought a fairy back

113
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,840
from Moonlit Blossoms last night.
Do you remember her?

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,360
- Of course.
- Talk.

115
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,080
For some reason,

116
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
she offended this upstart of Jixing Abyss.

117
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,440
She was sent back this morning.

118
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
She was sent back?

119
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,880
Immortal Ji is already bored with her
after one day.

120
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,800
He sent her back after one day?

121
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,080
Isn't he lacking in energy?

122
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,160
Seriously?

123
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
Ji Bozai sent her back?

124
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
The owner of Moonlit Blossoms
is asking her to wipe the floor now.

126
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
How pitiful.

127
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,600
Wiping every corner of the place

128
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,560
back and forth without stopping.

129
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,440
Seriously, why is the owner
of Moonlit Blossoms so cruel?

130
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,040
- Did that really happen?
- Yes.

131
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,240
Since the fairy has been
sent back to Moonlit Blossoms,

132
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,840
now is a good time
for us to send someone to him again.

133
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,640
After the Qingyun Tournament,

134
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,960
I tried to curry favor
with Ji Bozai a few times

135
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
but he never replied to me.

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,880
I want to see

137
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
if he has another excuse to refuse again.

138
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,040
If we can send someone into Wugui Sea,

139
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
the alliance

140
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,160
between Ji Bozai and
my niece won't look as strong

141
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
to outsiders.

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,880
I understand.

143
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,760
My Lordship.

144
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,920
BUXIU, JI BOZAI'S COMPANION BEAST

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Ming Yi has been sent back.

146
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,040
She is being punished by Fuyue now.

147
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,560
Regarding the destruction of the barrier…

148
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,560
Sending her back is good enough.

149
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,920
There are spies all over Wugui Sea.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,160
She is not the only one who is suspicious.

151
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,960
It was a good excuse to send her away.

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
The most important thing right now

153
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,840
is to obtain the Moonshade Grass.

154
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
Zhushui Spiritual State
won the Qingyun Tournament.

155
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,640
Mangfu Swamp lost

156
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,680
and the grass can be
found among their tributes.

157
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,640
- You may head there tomorrow.
- Yes.

158
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,920
Buxiu,

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,040
Zhushui Spiritual State's
techniques are sinister.

160
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,680
Remember to protect yourself.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,680
It's fine.

162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,760
I'll kill every single one of them.

163
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,120
- If they come in pairs, I…
- Your Lordship.

164
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,440
Two women are here.

165
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,840
They were brought
here by Immortal Yan Xiao.

166
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,160
- Let me handle them.
- Keep them alive first.

167
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
- Immortal Ji.
- Immortal Ji.

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
I was ordered by Lord Hanfeng

169
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
to send two more fairies to your place.

170
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,600
You have a huge place
yet you have no servants.

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,200
That's not right.

172
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,760
Who told you I have
no one to accompany me?

173
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,960
Didn't I bring one back last night?

174
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,000
But I heard you sent

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,000
the fairy back to Moonlit Blossoms.

176
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Since the fairy failed
to serve you well last night,

177
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
you were right to send her back.

178
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
However, these two fairies

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,360
were specifically
chosen by Lord Hanfeng for you.

180
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
Ji, you are an esteemed warrior.

181
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,840
- You should have…
- Yan, are you sure

182
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,840
you heard Ming Yi has
returned to Moonlit Blossoms?

183
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,800
Yes.

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,880
I'll be honest with you.

185
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,960
Ming Yi had a spat with me this morning
and ran away.

186
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,520
I wanted to pretend
as if nothing had happened

187
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,480
and not be in a mess like a child

188
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,480
because of a mere fairy.

189
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,840
However, I actually
caused such a misunderstanding.

190
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm embarrassed.

191
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,760
However,

192
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,120
I feel upset because I care about her.

193
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm in a hurry to find her now.

194
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,720
Excuse me.

195
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,560
MADAM MENG'S BEDCHAMBER,
YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

196
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Xin.

197
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,400
I made this chestnut cake for you.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,040
Try it.

199
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,880
Is it delicious?

200
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,400
MING XIN,
LORD CHENGYUN OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

201
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
Not bad.

202
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,920
Ming Xian lost the competition

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,800
and fled Yaoguang Mountain,

204
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,560
His Majesty will no
longer tolerate the Empress.

205
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,800
Xin.

206
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,080
As your mother,

207
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,520
I can finally help you clear a path.

208
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,760
I've sent some people
to search the Six Realms

209
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,680
with a Search Mirror.

210
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,040
Once they find Ming Xian's whereabouts,

211
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,760
they will kill him immediately.

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,600
If Ming Xian dies out there,

213
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
there will be no one to lead the others.

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,400
Then, Father will surely

215
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,920
elect another crown prince
before the next Qingyun Tournament.

216
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,480
Be more thorough and work faster.

217
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,400
FUYUE, OWNER OF MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

218
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Your spiritual power is so weak.

219
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,840
People got it done in a flash
and you've been doing it for so long.

220
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,960
You even had
the audacity to offend Immortal Ji.

221
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,560
Moonlit Blossoms' reputation
was almost ruined because of you.

222
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm not sure why I had to be soft-hearted

223
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
and bring in someone as useless as you.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
I…

225
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,280
Because you are soft-hearted.

226
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
You are the best.

227
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Where is Young Master He? Has he left?

228
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,760
Don't mention him.

229
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
We should stop wiping the floor.

230
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,960
He has uneven legs
and slipped a few times.

231
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
He is very unhappy.

232
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,120
I had to sing a few more
songs for him because of that.

233
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,800
Don't you feel bad for me?

234
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,160
Of course, I do.

235
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,000
Why would you ask
them to scrub the floor then?

236
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,960
That's enough. Stop scrubbing.

237
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,360
Twenty-Seven.

238
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,960
Have you caught any fish?

239
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,360
Let me tell you.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Ming Xian was defeated by
a warrior from Jixing Abyss.

241
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,640
He couldn't have fled to
this place no matter what.

242
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
I think Lord Chengyun must be so anxious

243
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,880
that he sent both of us to find him here.

244
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
Whether we find him or not,

245
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,280
we should still obey
our orders and come here.

246
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,880
However, we must ask for compensation

247
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,280
for our hard work.

248
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,000
Jixing Abyss' Moonlit Blossoms

249
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
is true to its reputation.

250
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Come and relax over here.

251
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,000
That person gave me this Search Mirror.

252
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,040
If Ming Xian appears around here,

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
it will alert us.

254
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,200
Once it is activated,

255
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
a compass will appear on the mirror.

256
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,400
There's a reaction?

257
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,760
Is Ming Xian really hiding here?

258
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,960
After her!

259
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,640
- Stop!
- Stop!

260
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,920
Move!

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
Move!

262
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,600
Make way.

263
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
That's…

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,240
The compass keeps spinning.

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Why can't we see her?

266
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,640
Sorry.

267
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,080
That's…

268
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
- Make way.
- My bad.

269
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,800
- She's upstairs.
- Let me pass.

270
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,280
Where is she?

271
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,040
Who is it?

272
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,760
It's her!

273
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Stop running!

274
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
What are they doing?

275
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,280
<i>They actually found me.</i>

276
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,400
Freeze!

277
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Trying to escape? Turn around.

278
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
<i>Why isn't Ji Bozai here yet?</i>

279
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,840
<i>If everything else fails,</i>
<i>I'll have to do it myself.</i>

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
This…

281
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,240
She's mine.

282
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,080
Why are you chasing after her?

283
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
Immortal Ji,
are you going to interfere with everything

284
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
after you rose to power?

285
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,160
- This fairy is suspicious.
- Don't be afraid.

286
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,040
It triggers our Search Mirror.

287
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
Please step away.

288
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,040
You lot from Yaoguang Mountain.

289
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,160
You lost in the Qingyun Tournament
and have dropped to the Lower Realms.

290
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
Now, you're trying to use a silly mirror

291
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,440
to capture someone at Jixing Abyss?

292
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
You should leave now.

293
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Immortal Ji.

294
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,960
We are only obeying orders.

295
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
This fairy was behaving strangely.

296
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,280
She ran as soon as she saw us.

297
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,319
- We have to…
- Do you not understand me?

298
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,839
I said

299
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,800
leave.

300
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,640
She is a fairy of Moonlit Blossoms.

301
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,880
It's impossible for her to be Ming Xian.

302
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,760
I'm sure something's
wrong with Lord Chengyun's item.

303
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,000
We should leave immediately.

304
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,720
- Let's not offend Ji Bozai.
- Sure.

305
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,480
They left.

306
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,079
Why are you running away?

307
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,400
Quick. Get changed
and come back to Wugui Sea with me.

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,720
Granny Xun, you are firm.

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,440
You are rejecting Lord Hanfeng's goodwill.

310
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
However, what good will it be

311
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
if you offend Lord Hanfeng for real?

312
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,440
Granny Xun, you stayed here willingly

313
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
because Ji saved your life.

314
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,160
You should consider it for his sake.

315
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,560
Since you know my background so well,

316
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm sure you also know

317
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,800
that everyone in Wugui Sea
only obeys His Lordship.

318
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,760
All of you, please leave.

319
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,600
Your Lordship.

320
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
How long has it been?

321
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,280
You're already finding
someone else to replace me?

322
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,560
Calm down.

323
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,400
Yan,

324
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,440
help me clear this misunderstanding.

325
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,360
Fairy Ming Yi,

326
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,920
Lord Hanfeng
specifically chose these two fairies.

327
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,800
They will never steal your spotlight.

328
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,360
My Lord.

329
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
When you brought me
back from Moonlit Blossoms,

330
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,360
didn't you promise me
to treat each other sincerely

331
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,440
so I can stay at Wugui Sea in peace?

332
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,080
I guess.

333
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,800
In that case,

334
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
how am I not
the lady-in-command of Wugui Sea?

335
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,520
Let's do it your way for now.

336
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,120
For now?

337
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Does it count?

338
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Yes.

339
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,680
All right. You said so.

340
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,720
If both of you insist
on staying at Wugui Sea,

341
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,240
I'd destroy my own primordial spirit.

342
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,160
You must not.

343
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,880
Ask them to leave then.

344
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,440
Meanwhile, you should also tell everyone

345
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,320
that I am the lady in charge here
so they can give up.

346
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Stop sending anyone here.

347
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,680
Otherwise, I'll kill myself!

348
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Yan.

349
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
See?

350
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,960
What should I do?

351
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,880
My house is a mess
because of your goodwill.

352
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,040
I'm sure you don't want to see me
become a widower.

353
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,160
Right?

354
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
A widower, you say?

355
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,360
Since you've made your message clear,

356
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,120
what else can I do?

357
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,800
Please leave.

358
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,320
Carry on. I'm leaving.

359
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,040
Why are you staring at me, My Lord?

360
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,240
It turns out I accidentally brought back

361
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,960
the lady in charge of Wugui Sea.

362
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,600
You're welcome.

363
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,520
My Lord.

364
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,760
Who exactly are you?

365
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,560
You only went back to
Moonlit Blossoms for an hour

366
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,560
before Yan Xiao brought his men here.

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
What does it have to do with me?

368
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,840
Are you suspecting me
of spreading the news?

369
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,120
Even Yaoguang Mountain's stupid mirror

370
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,360
reacted to you.

371
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,520
Who exactly are you?

372
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,480
My Lord, let go of me.

373
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,800
It hurts.

374
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,320
Are you trying to verify

375
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
if I had used the Transfiguration Spell?

376
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,880
Sure.

377
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,920
Go ahead.

378
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,640
Do you still think I'm not innocent?

379
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,560
How do I know
why the stupid mirror is related to me?

380
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,320
You gave away the tributes
from Yaoguang Mountain recently

381
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,840
to the other fairies.

382
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,680
Perhaps those were the things

383
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,200
that the Search Mirror reacted to.

384
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,160
It's too much of a coincidence.

385
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,280
Did you find anything
by verifying my body?

386
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
No.

387
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,440
You searched and interrogated me.

388
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,520
You did so much without getting anything.

389
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,560
I feel sorry for you.

390
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,960
Not really.

391
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,000
When I was asking you questions just now,

392
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,440
your breathing was a mess.

393
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
You are the one

394
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,600
who's in a mess.

395
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,040
My Lord, if you don't believe me,

396
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,640
I'll leave.

397
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,280
Tell me.

398
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,960
Where do these things come from?

399
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,160
Spare me, My Lord.

400
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,040
Why are you stealing?

401
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
Because

402
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,400
I am broke.

403
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,240
My family has been
living in Freezing Hot Waters.

404
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,760
They can only make
a living by gathering herbs.

405
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,560
All my relatives and friends

406
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
are struggling to put food on the table.

407
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,000
- So, I…
- You still shouldn't do this.

408
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
Yes! I am ashamed.

409
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Please punish me severely.

410
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,000
No, not a severe punishment.

411
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,880
I'm willing to fast for three meals.

412
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,080
I'll do all of Granny Xun's chores.

413
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,080
If you need me, I can still…

414
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,680
If you need anything, just tell me.

415
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,240
I told Yan Xiao

416
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,000
that you are the lady of Wugui Sea.

417
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,440
If you need anything in the future,

418
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
just ask.

419
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,400
Also,

420
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,280
this room is yours from now on.

421
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,360
This room…

422
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
That's…

423
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,280
Thank you, My Lord!

424
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,560
Thank you, My Lord!

425
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200
I…

426
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,200
Ji Bozai is very cautious.

427
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,760
We must be well-prepared.

428
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,320
Where's the thing I asked you to prepare?

429
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,000
<i>If I pretend to be greedy,</i>

430
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,120
<i>I can get rid of his suspicion instead.</i>

431
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
<i>As long as I can get the antidote,</i>

432
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,800
<i>I don't mind letting</i>
<i>you get your way for a few days.</i>

433
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,800
My Lordship.

434
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,480
I've told you many times

435
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,960
- not to bow when you meet me in private.
- Yes.

436
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,760
Before you head to
Zhushui Spiritual State,

437
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,040
- go to Freezing Hot Waters.
- Why?

438
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
Ming Yi was born there.

439
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
Check her background thoroughly.

440
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,880
Your Lordship,
are you going to let her stay?

441
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm letting her stay temporarily.

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
She used me to acknowledge her position

443
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,880
in front of Yan Xiao.

444
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,160
I couldn't send her away so soon.

445
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,360
People outside are also trying
to plant their men here.

446
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,960
If there's nothing wrong with her,

447
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,200
I can just use her as cover to stop them.

448
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,880
You are too cautious, Your Lordship.

449
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,520
Actually, killing her is easier.

450
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,880
If she's indeed a child
born in a herb-gathering family

451
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,800
from Freezing Hot Waters,

452
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,400
she is still useful

453
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,600
to my plan.

454
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,960
Did Lord Hanfeng summon you as well?

455
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,120
No. I'm just here to play.

456
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Here you go.

457
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,080
Thank you.

458
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
It's nice.

459
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,800
Forgive me.

460
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
Ji Bozai brought back
the fairy from Moonlit Blossoms

461
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,000
and used her as a shield
to refuse any newcomers.

462
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,040
If the easy way doesn't work,

463
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,240
let's do it the hard way.

464
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
Hard ones are bad.

465
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,120
They hurt the teeth.

466
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,200
Lord Hanfeng, do you want me to frame her?

467
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,520
But we have nothing to hold over her.

468
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
This pot is hard to
hold even with a handle.

469
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,040
I should go and feel out

470
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,800
what kind of place the Wugui Sea is.

471
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,720
You are right, Lord Hanfeng.

472
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Outsiders can't see or hear us now.

473
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
You are quite something.

474
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,560
After what you did,

475
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,560
you successfully reassured Ji Bozai

476
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,080
and even convinced him to let you stay.

477
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,160
Jixing Abyss' current situation

478
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
is the emperor has fallen sick

479
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,200
and he is often in a deep slumber.

480
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,480
He only has one daughter

481
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,160
who can't inherit the throne.

482
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,600
His younger brother,
Mu Qibai, Lord Hanfeng,

483
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,840
will most probably be the next emperor.

484
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
However, no one expected

485
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
<i>Princess Tianji</i>

486
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,760
<i>to find Ji Bozai</i>
<i>who was in the Sunken Abyss</i>

487
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,120
<i>and helped Jixing Abyss</i>
<i>rise to the Upper Realms.</i>

488
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,640
I was right indeed.

489
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,920
After the end of Qingyun Tournament,

490
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
Princess Tianji

491
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,080
was also willing to marry
Ji Bozai in a marriage alliance.

492
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,920
Lord Hanfeng won't be pleased
to see things turning out that way.

493
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
So,

494
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,920
he is trying to win
over Ji Bozai on the surface

495
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,880
<i>but in truth,</i>

496
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,320
<i>he is wary of Ji Bozai's</i>
<i>marriage alliance with Princess Tianji.</i>

497
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,840
So, Ji Bozai needs a shield

498
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,200
just like how I need a scratching board.

499
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,960
So, Wugui Sea is not a place

500
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,320
where Ji Bozai can hide
the Golden Millet Dream without worries.

501
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,240
Have you searched his body?

502
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,880
Me?

503
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
Why?

504
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,680
Think about it.

505
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,400
He might be carrying
the most precious thing on him.

506
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,760
It won't be so obvious.

507
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,080
You are the one

508
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,960
who's in a mess.

509
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,640
Don't tell me that it's really on him?

510
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,040
Can you search his body though?

511
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,520
I might not be able to do that

512
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,960
but I can achieve the same effect.

513
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
You are sullying my ears.

514
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,120
What are you talking about?

515
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Don't you know that I'm still young?

516
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,600
Turn it back.

517
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,520
I'll give you a dried fish later.

518
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Look at you. You're collecting junk.

519
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
Found it.

520
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,480
Why are you bringing
leisure books for your escape?

521
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,760
I spent a lot of effort to find them

522
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,600
after I found out he had
been treating Moonlit Blossoms

523
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,120
as his home.

524
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,400
I, your master, learn things quickly.

525
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,560
Things like these are…

526
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,480
What…

527
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,160
What are these?

528
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,920
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

529
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,880
It sullies my eyes!

530
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,400
I see Moonlit Blossoms as my second home.

531
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,600
I did

532
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,040
make many promises here

533
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
and left many memories.

534
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
I thank all of you for your love

535
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,520
because I can leave
the mundane world behind

536
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,760
and attain ultimate joy.

537
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,680
Here's a humble gift.

538
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,720
I hope everything goes well
for all of you in the future.

539
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,800
You will soon get

540
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,880
what I promised you.

541
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,360
You won't renege
on what you promised earlier, right?

542
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,000
Don't worry, Immortal Ji.

543
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,360
You saved my life.

544
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,719
I will surely repay you.

545
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I won't go back on my promise.

546
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,199
You owe me nothing.

547
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,239
The person must be killed
regardless of your existence.

548
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,480
He might be my father,

549
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
but he treated me and my mother cruelly.

550
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,760
RUO SHUI, A SERVANT OF MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

551
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,159
I won't forgive him.

552
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,719
I will do according to your plan

553
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
and definitely

554
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,480
make him pay the price.

555
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,159
Of course.

556
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,960
Those who committed crimes

557
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,120
should not end well.

558
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,159
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

559
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm well-versed in
the Dual Cultivation Manual.

560
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
I am not the person I was yesterday.

561
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,560
Tonight, I will find out
everything about Ji Bozai

562
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,360
and bring back
the Golden Millet Dream on him.

563
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,320
Just wait.

564
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,880
Help me get an outfit.

565
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
What kind of outfit?

566
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
It sullies my ear!

567
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,440
Hurry!

568
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,080
Hurry!

569
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,480
You are using my weakness against me.

570
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,040
Don't you think that's too much?

571
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,840
- Not at all.
- Who is the most obedient kitty?

572
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,880
I am.

573
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,400
His room is so well-ventilated.

574
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,160
It's really cold

575
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,760
and doesn't contain any warmth.

576
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,960
This Ji Bozai is a non-issue.

577
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,600
This is too ordinary.

578
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,960
Too dull.

579
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,520
All right.

580
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,720
You're back?

581
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
Will this work?

582
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,400
Your Lordship.

583
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,920
Lord Hanfeng has been
waiting inside for a long time.

584
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,920
<i>Embers?</i>

585
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,280
<i>Embers.</i>

586
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,200
<i>Without you,</i>

587
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,720
<i>I would've died in</i>
<i>Ji Bozai's hands back then.</i>

588
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,400
<i>It fell into his Spirit Well back then.</i>

589
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,600
<i>Is he treating it as a trophy</i>

590
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,000
<i>to be viewed every day?</i>

591
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,960
- Bozai.
- Ji Bozai.

592
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
Outsiders seldom come to Wugui Sea.

593
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,440
I hope I'm not interrupting anything
with my sudden visit today.

594
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,400
Not at all.

595
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,680
My place is empty

596
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,840
and it must look silly to you.

597
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,280
Bozai,

598
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,800
is this where you usually live?

599
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,760
This is…

600
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
Lord Hanfeng, please come inside.

601
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,320
Bozai,

602
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,360
your residence

603
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,280
LET THE MIND SOAR TO GREAT HEIGHTS

604
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,280
is bright and well-ventilated.

605
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,520
Yes.

606
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,200
The abyss in the past
was cramped and suffocating.

607
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,320
A place that's too dark
hides a lot of filth.

608
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,680
Right now,

609
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,200
I like how spacious it is.

610
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,600
You are really different indeed.

611
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,320
However, your Wugui Sea
only has an old servant.

612
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,480
It feels empty after all.

613
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,000
Why don't I arrange
two more servants for you

614
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,600
so you have more people here.

615
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,360
Lord Hanfeng, please don't do that.

616
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm afraid that fairy of mine

617
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,400
will cause trouble again.

618
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,800
How did you find someone so possessive?

619
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,600
Granny Xun, bring the wine.

620
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,600
This wine

621
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,680
was brewed under Meng Yangqiu's guidance.

622
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,520
A recipe from the wine immortal's family.

623
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,440
Try it, quick.

624
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,640
It's fine wine.

625
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,920
I'll be honest.

626
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,280
I've always wanted to be friends with you.

627
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,840
My niece, Tianji, knew you before me.

628
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,000
She has a good eye for talent

629
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,760
and promoted you to be a warrior.

630
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,040
You competed and made Jixing Abyss proud.

631
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,240
I came to know you later,

632
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,520
but my admiration for you

633
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,760
surpasses everyone else's.

634
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,600
I am honored

635
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,640
to be appreciated by you, Lord Hanfeng.

636
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,240
Since you've agreed to be my friend,

637
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,600
can you

638
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,480
enlighten me on something?

639
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,240
I'll tell you everything I know.

640
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,040
There has been a rumor in Jixing Palace

641
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,880
saying that your spiritual veins

642
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,360
were obtained through Heavenly Grief.

643
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,960
You used Heavenly Grief
yet you still survive.

644
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,040
Do you actually possess

645
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,960
the Golden Millet Dream?
