1
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,880
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,480
Ming Yi.

3
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Ming Yi.

4
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
Ming Yi.

5
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,040
Do you still
remember the name of this wine?

6
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,160
My Heart's Delight.

7
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,360
Then tell me,

8
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,160
when you gave me this jar of wine,

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,920
were you sincere,

10
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,200
or did you do it

11
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
to make me trust you more?

12
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
All right,

13
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,880
I know you were sincere.

14
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,560
At this moment, I am sincere.

15
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
Say my name.

16
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,120
Ji Bozai.

17
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Ji Bozai…

18
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,480
Ji Bozai, I adore you.

19
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Did you get the Golden Millet Dream?

20
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
What's wrong?

21
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,880
You couldn't bring
yourself to ask for it, could you?

22
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,160
Before Fairy Bo Yulan passed away,

23
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,480
she made him swear

24
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,880
never to let the Golden Millet Dream
appear in this world.

25
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
If he gives the elixir to me,

26
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,880
he'll be defying his master's dying wish.

27
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Maybe he's willing to defy it for you.

28
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,640
I'm the one who wants
the Golden Millet Dream.

29
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm the one who wants to live.

30
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
I can't force him to choose.

31
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
If someone must bear the sin, it'll be me.

32
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,520
But if you do this,

33
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,560
he'll surely hate you.

34
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
I know.

35
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,880
Then let him hate me.

36
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
Whoever does wrong

37
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
must bear the consequences themselves.

38
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
This golden millet dream
is coming to an end after all.

39
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,120
Ming Yi, should we go in now?

40
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
I'll go with you.

41
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
Everything

42
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
is over now.

43
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,760
Lord Ji!

44
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
I made so much Golden Millet Dream.
Come on. Have a taste.

45
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,640
The Golden Millet Dream…

46
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,040
He turned the Golden Millet Dream

47
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,320
into the likeness of My Heart's Delight.

48
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,040
Ming Yi, you can't afford to…

49
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,520
Ming Yi.

50
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Ming Yi!

51
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,560
Kill me if you must.

52
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,240
I have nothing to say.

53
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,960
But please, Immortal Ji,

54
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,920
spare Twenty-Seven.

55
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,880
Don't hurt him.

56
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
I beg you.

57
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,000
So,

58
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,560
you're just like everyone else.

59
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
You only wanted the Golden Millet Dream.

60
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,160
Yes.

61
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,800
From the very beginning,

62
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,560
you have been lying to me.

63
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,440
Yes.

64
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,440
All because of the Golden Millet Dream?

65
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,480
Yes.

66
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,320
Ming Yi,

67
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,960
you truly are heartless.

68
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,320
At this point, I have
nothing to say for myself.

69
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
The Golden Millet Dream!

70
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
Get out.

71
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Don't ever

72
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,320
show yourselves before me again.

73
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,560
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

74
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,120
Ji Bozai!

75
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Ji Bozai!

76
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,840
You're awake.

77
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,440
Finally!

78
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

79
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,280
Please don't go.

80
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,080
Please don't go.

81
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,840
We don't know how this
battle with Mu Qibai will end,

82
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,960
but I will keep you safe.

83
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
However,

84
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
think carefully.

85
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,280
If I survive,

86
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,800
you'll be stuck with me forever.

87
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,520
When you gave me this jar of wine,

88
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,120
were you sincere,

89
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
or did you do it

90
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,520
to make me trust you more?

91
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,760
At this moment, I am sincere.

92
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,440
Ming Yi.

93
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,680
Oh, no…

94
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,319
Why?

95
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,079
Why did you use
your spiritual veins to save me

96
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,920
when you knew it would come to this?

97
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,440
Heaven and earth,
bear witness. Bound by our spiritpact,

98
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,960
I grant you peace

99
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
with my divine consciousness.

100
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
Twenty-Seven.

101
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,720
Twenty-Seven, what are you doing?

102
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Stop.

103
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,200
Twenty-Seven!

104
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
Twenty-Seven!

105
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,560
What are you doing?

106
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,560
Twenty-Seven.

107
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,640
The spell is already taking effect.

108
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,080
It's too late to stop it now.

109
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,240
-Ming Yi!
-Twenty-Seven!

110
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,720
Twenty-Seven!

111
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,840
I must…

112
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Twenty-Seven.

113
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,800
…save your life today.

114
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
Please stop, Twenty-Seven.

115
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,120
Listen to me.

116
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Don't trade your life for mine!

117
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,720
Please, Twenty-Seven.

118
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,840
Listen to me.

119
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,120
You'll only make me live a few more days.

120
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,840
It's meaningless, Twenty-Seven!

121
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,880
Please stop, Twenty-Seven.

122
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
Twenty-Seven.

123
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,760
This is pointless, Twenty-Seven.

124
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Please, Twenty-Seven, stop.

125
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,520
Don't sacrifice yourself to save me.
Please.

126
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,920
I'll only live a few more days.

127
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,480
It's meaningless.

128
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,960
Please stop, Twenty-Seven.

129
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,040
Twenty-Seven.

130
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,680
Twenty-Seven.

131
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
Twenty-Seven.

132
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,400
Twenty-Seven.

133
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,760
Twenty-Seven.

134
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,440
Twenty-Seven.

135
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
Twenty-Seven.

136
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
Twenty-Seven.

137
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
Twenty-Seven.

138
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
-I'm so sorry.
-Ming Yi,

139
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,600
do you remember

140
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,520
what you were like when
you first won the Qingyun Tournament?

141
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,440
You were incredible back then,

142
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
-invincible across all Six Realms.
-Stop it.

143
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,040
It's my fault.

144
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,040
I dragged you into this,

145
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
Twenty-Seven.

146
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,200
Ming Yi,

147
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,080
if only I could see you

148
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,960
-live a good life with my own eyes.
-Twenty-Seven.

149
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
Don't go.

150
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
Ming Yi,

151
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,040
don't cry.

152
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,240
If you ever miss me,

153
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
bring me some dried fish.

154
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,480
But remember, I don't eat spicy ones.

155
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,560
Twenty-Seven, I can't live without you.

156
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,560
-Let me take you home.
-Ming Yi,

157
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,560
it's all right.

158
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm so sorry.

159
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,160
Twenty-Seven.

160
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
Let's go home.

161
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,000
Twenty-Seven.

162
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
Twenty-Seven.

163
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,800
Twenty-Seven.

164
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,880
Twenty-Seven,

165
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,440
come back!

166
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,360
Come back.

167
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,000
Twenty-Seven.

168
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,680
Let's go home.

169
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,320
Let's go back to Yaoguang Mountain.

170
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,800
Please, come back.

171
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,440
I was wrong.

172
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,680
I'm sorry.

173
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,160
I can't live without you.

174
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

175
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,920
Twenty-Seven, I'm so sorry.

176
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,160
Ming Yi, I won't let you die.

177
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,680
ZHANG TAI'S RESIDENCE

178
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
Twenty-Seven. Twenty-Seven.

179
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
Twenty-Seven.

180
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,480
Twenty-Seven.

181
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,280
Twenty-Seven.

182
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Immortal Situ,

183
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,600
what happened to Ming Yi?

184
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,960
-Ming Yi.
-Twenty-Seven.

185
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,520
Ming Yi,

186
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,960
don't be afraid.

187
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,880
I will find a way to save you.

188
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,200
I was wrong.

189
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,680
-The Messenger Bell.
-I'll take you home.

190
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,960
Ming Yi's Messenger Bell.

191
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,800
Twenty-Seven.

192
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,360
Here.

193
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
I was wrong.

194
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,720
"To Master She, with respect…"

195
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,880
I was wrong.

196
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Twenty-Seven, come back.

197
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,760
Come back.

198
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,960
Ming Yi.

199
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,240
Twenty-Seven.

200
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,360
His Lordship still refused to eat.

201
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,320
I know a way to make
His Lordship forget Ming Yi!

202
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,560
Your Lordship,
this scroll that Ming Yi gave you

203
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,320
was indeed altered by a Yaoguang spell,

204
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
but I don't have the skill

205
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,600
to restore the original text.

206
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,760
"Yaoguang Mountain, Zhushui
Spiritual State, and Flowing Wave Gorge,

207
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,760
the entire
Upper Third Realm was part of that.

208
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,000
Lord Hanfeng kept a list of names

209
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,200
to control them."

210
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,720
Your Lordship,

211
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,720
she's from Yaoguang Mountain.

212
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,200
At the end of
the day, she's on their side.

213
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,520
Before Fairy Bo died, she made you promise

214
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,800
never to let the Golden Millet Dream
appear in the world.

215
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
It seems she foresaw

216
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,800
how far human greed would go

217
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,440
for the medicine.

218
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,640
It can't be helped.

219
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,520
Be it Mu Qibai

220
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,600
or those from
Yaoguang Mountain who took part,

221
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,240
none of them was the true culprit.

222
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,880
The Emperor of Zhushui
was the first to strike at the Bo clan,

223
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,200
and he's been secretly
controlling Mu Qibai ever since.

224
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,560
I must not let the tragedy

225
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,280
that befell my master and the innocent

226
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,760
happen again.

227
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,360
Your Lordship, if you intend to
go after the Emperor of Zhushui,

228
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,040
I'll be right by your side.

229
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,960
But…

230
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
your health matters most.

231
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Please, have something to eat first.

232
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,800
Master She, that's what happened.

233
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,120
I've told you everything
about my past with Ming Yi.

234
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,520
You can trust me.

235
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,520
Silly child,

236
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,800
how could you use
your spiritual veins like that?

237
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,840
Master She, I heard
you once fought as a warrior

238
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,400
and later became a physician.

239
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
You must understand
Ming Yi's condition better than anyone.

240
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,640
Ming Yi once suspected

241
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,080
that Zhushui Spiritual
State's Soul-seizing Technique

242
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,560
might suppress the Heavenly Grief.

243
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,440
I searched the old texts and found

244
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,800
that it wasn't the technique
alone that restrained the aftereffects.

245
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
When those of Zhushui Spiritual State

246
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,000
used the technique,

247
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,280
they channeled their spiritual
power directly into her spiritual veins.

248
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,160
That was what
suppressed Heavenly Grief's aftereffects.

249
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,120
But only

250
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,360
people from
Zhushui Spiritual State know this method.

251
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,000
Very well.

252
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll storm the Zhushui Palace,

253
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,040
catch a few men there, and force them to
cast the spell to save her.

254
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
So all it takes is to
inject spiritual power

255
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,800
into her spiritual veins
using Zhushui's secret art?

256
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
Yes.

257
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,000
A CLOUD OF PEAR
BLOSSOMS AND A FORLORN DREAM

258
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,360
Who are you, really?

259
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,080
Tell me, who are you?

260
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,680
-Master.
-Ming Yi.

261
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,600
Ming Yi.

262
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
-Ming Yi.
-Master.

263
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,400
How do you feel?

264
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,080
Immortal Situ would
never harm me. Don't hurt him.

265
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,560
Do you know
he is from Zhushui Spiritual State?

266
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,280
You didn't tell me the truth?

267
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,920
No.

268
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,680
But if you'd cared about me a little more,

269
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
you would've remembered

270
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,400
which realm's robe I wore

271
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,640
the day we first met.

272
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,720
You never asked me,

273
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,920
so I supposed

274
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,400
my background

275
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,240
didn't matter to you.

276
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Ming Yi,

277
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,040
you really don't remember.

278
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,639
Otherwise, you would've known

279
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,920
that I wore a robe
common across the Six Realms that day.

280
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,800
I guessed right.

281
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Why did you

282
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,560
come to Jixing Abyss?

283
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,480
The Golden Millet Dream.

284
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,120
The Golden Millet Dream?

285
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,080
In Zhushui Spiritual State,
might makes right.

286
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
Without spiritual veins,

287
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,120
I could only

288
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,600
live like a servant there.

289
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,120
So I escaped to seek
the Golden Millet Dream.

290
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,120
That is all.

291
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,199
But Ming Yi,

292
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,520
after we met again,

293
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,920
I gave up any thought

294
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,639
of taking
the Golden Millet Dream for myself.

295
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,160
I'll go to Ji Bozai now

296
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,080
and bring the Golden Millet Dream to you.

297
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,320
Don't go!

298
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,520
You must not go. Don't go.

299
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,480
-Ming Yi.
-Ming Yi.

300
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,400
Ming Yi.

301
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,800
Don't go to him.

302
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,720
Even now, you're still
acting in his interest?

303
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,160
The Golden Millet Dream
is the only cure for you.

304
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,080
If he refuses to give it,

305
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,280
I will kill him and take it!

306
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,720
Ji Bozai doesn't have
the Golden Millet Dream.

307
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
He spread false news

308
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
to lure those who covet it.

309
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,520
He never had the antidote.

310
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,680
He doesn't have it?

311
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,320
Then what should we do?

312
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,400
What else can I do?

313
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,080
How can I save you?

314
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,680
-Your Highness.
-Why are you here?

315
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,960
I came to report on the recovery

316
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,720
of those injured in
the battle with the netherbeasts.

317
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,400
Everyone within
the Jixing Palace has recovered.

318
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,000
The prescriptions

319
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,240
sent to Huansha Market for
the common folk have also taken effect.

320
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,160
The warriors at Shouhua Academy

321
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,600
are nearly all healed

322
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,600
and can resume training tomorrow.

323
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,360
Is there anything else?

324
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,120
No, Your Highness.

325
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,600
I'll take my leave.

326
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Yan Xiao.

327
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,800
You're always like this.

328
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
You feared my father would be in danger,

329
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,560
so you chose to lie to me.

330
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,200
You feared my uncle would harm me,

331
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,920
so you allied with Ji Bozai
while keeping me in the dark.

332
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,200
You always do what
you think is best for me,

333
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,880
but you've never once asked me

334
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,120
if that's what I truly want.

335
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,440
I just…

336
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,960
I just wanted to protect you.

337
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,560
Protect me?

338
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,920
Your Highness.

339
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,120
Your Highness, why are you crying?

340
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
Did someone hurt you?

341
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,160
Tell me. I'll go teach them a lesson.

342
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,720
Jixing Abyss lost at
the Qingyun Tournament again.

343
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,960
Once again, we get no Blessed Rain.

344
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,000
Look,

345
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,280
my Blessing Flowers are withering.

346
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,040
Back when the Empress was alive,

347
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
she planted these with the Emperor.

348
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,800
I promise I'll heal them for you.

349
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,160
Xiao!

350
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,720
The Blessing Flowers have bloomed!

351
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
How did you do it?

352
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,080
Without the Blessed Rain's nourishment,

353
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,080
how could they bloom?

354
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,360
The ways of healing are universal.

355
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,000
Curing plants isn't much
different from curing people.

356
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,560
But isn't it difficult

357
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,560
to make them bloom
without the Blessed Rain?

358
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,600
No,

359
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,240
not at all.

360
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
This isn't protection.

361
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
It's just you doing
what you think is right.

362
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
Just like this.

363
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,440
Blessing Flowers wither

364
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,240
after the Prayer Night

365
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,160
and bloom again the following year.

366
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,320
But this pot, the one my mother left me,

367
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,960
has bloomed all year round.

368
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,560
I once thought

369
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,440
you'd found some
special herb or artifact to sustain it.

370
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,160
Only today did I find out

371
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,720
you'd been feeding it with your own blood.

372
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,680
Your Highness, you're back.

373
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,920
It's the only thing the Empress left you.

374
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,040
I didn't want you to feel
sad watching the flowers wither.

375
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,080
But if this is the price,

376
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,800
do you really think I'd still want that?

377
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm sorry.

378
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,600
I never once asked you.

379
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,440
All these years…

380
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,520
I've only thought about
what I believed was right.

381
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,520
I'm such a coward.

382
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,320
Tianji,

383
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,360
I'm sorry.

384
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,240
I've owed you

385
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,200
an apology for a long time.

386
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,920
Does it hurt?

387
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,680
No,

388
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,080
not at all.

389
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,640
From now on,

390
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,280
no matter what happens,

391
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,440
don't hide anything from me again.

392
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,800
I've grown up now.

393
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,880
Let's face everything together.

394
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,480
All right, Xiao?

395
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,120
All right.
