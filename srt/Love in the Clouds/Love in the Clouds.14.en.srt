00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,360
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 14

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,600
Ji Bozai!

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The ancient divine stone's rebound effect,

5
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
what can your meager cultivation

6
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,120
do against it?

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
If we do nothing, your primordial spirit
will be damaged.

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,960
I can't stand by and watch.

9
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
You have spiritual veins.

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
What else have you been hiding from me?

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
Speak!

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,480
Who are you?

13
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,720
I did come from Yaoguang Mountain,

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
and I have ties to Ming Xian.

15
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,480
I am Ming Xian…

16
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,880
Ming Xian's betrothed.

17
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,160
I can't tell you the whole truth yet.

19
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,840
The woman who bound a heart
imprint with me

20
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,200
was betrothed to Ming Xian.

21
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,000
After everything that's happened,

22
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,120
do you think I'd still believe you?

23
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,960
Give me Twenty-Seven back.

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
I'll prove it to you.

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,720
He was badly wounded at Mu Qibai's place.

26
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,280
If he doesn't get treatment, he'll die.

27
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Please.

28
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Twenty-Seven!

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
It's all right.

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,840
You're going to be just fine.

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
Ming Xian's companion beast

32
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,880
responds to me

33
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,960
because Ming Xian and I

34
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,280
grew up together.

35
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,920
We were like twins from the same womb,

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,079
inseparable.

37
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,600
That's why Ming Xian's companion beast
answers to me

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
and resonates with me.

39
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
Twenty-Seven!

40
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,760
What was your purpose from the start

41
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
in approaching me?

42
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,840
I…

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,880
Ming Xian lost to you

44
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,760
at the Qingyun Tournament

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,840
because someone sabotaged him.

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
Siblings at Yaoguang Mountain

47
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,520
were scheming against each other.

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
Ming Xian has a half-brother, Ming Xin.

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,200
He framed Ming Xian
as a traitor of his realm.

50
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,560
After that, Ming Xian went missing.

51
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,480
I suspected someone in the Jixing Abyss
colluded with forces in Yaoguang Mountain

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
to take him down.

53
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,040
Now, it looks like
that person could be Mu Qibai.

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,600
To survive

55
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
and to get revenge,

56
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,800
I had to conceal my spiritual veins

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
and leave Yaoguang Mountain.

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Then, I joined Moonlit Blossoms

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
to get close to you.

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,680
Admittedly, I had ulterior motives,

61
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
but

62
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,520
our objectives align.

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Mu Qibai is suspicious.

64
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,600
I wanted to start from him

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,160
and find out

66
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,040
who in Yaoguang Mountain harmed Ming Xian.

67
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
I never once meant to harm you.

68
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,280
I want to take down Mu Qibai

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
as much as you do.

70
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,160
I understand.

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,960
You want to stay in Wugui Sea

72
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
and go after Mu Qibai.

73
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Yes.

74
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
I see.

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Allow me to guess what you'll say next.

76
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,920
You'll claim

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,960
Mu Qibai has ties to Yaoguang Mountain.

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,520
If I keep you as my aide,

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
we might uncover
who's behind Mu Qibai sooner.

80
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
Or maybe you're saying

81
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
that to outsiders,

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
we're already of one heart and one mind.

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
If I kill you,

84
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,920
your sudden disappearance
would raise suspicion

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,280
and tie my hands.

86
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
So it's better to keep you around

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
as cover

88
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
while I keep probing the netherbeasts,

89
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,760
right?

90
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,760
I see that you do know

91
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,600
keeping me around is the wiser choice.

92
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Ming Yi,

93
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,080
I'd rather kill you

94
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,200
than Mu Qibai right now.

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,280
Immortal Ji, I'm sorry I lied to you.

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,040
But the bigger problem right now
is the netherbeast forces and Mu Qibai.

97
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Immortal Ji!

98
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,960
Are you going to keep pretending?

99
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm not.

100
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,240
My…

101
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
My spiritual veins aren't hidden
with Soul-hiding Nails.

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,680
I used another method,

103
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,560
which is why I overexerted myself earlier.

104
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,880
Why put on that weak,
helpless act anymore?

105
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
Even if you die,

106
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
what's it to me?

107
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Twenty-Seven!

108
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
Ming Yi, are you all right?

109
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
Ming Yi.

110
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,640
Twenty-Seven,

111
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,440
we really are partners in misery.

112
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
I just healed your wound.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
You just got a bit better

114
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
and now you're protecting my life.

115
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,000
I never thought the repercussions
would intensify with each occurrence.

116
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,600
Ming Yi, it's my fault. I'm to blame.

117
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,920
I was too careless
and I fell into their trap.

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,360
If I caused your death…

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't say those depressing things.

121
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,280
I'm still alive, aren't I?

122
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,120
See?

123
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm fine. You're fine.

124
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
We're both here.

125
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,720
This is the best outcome.

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
And how could it be your fault?

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,120
Our enemies were just too cunning.

128
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,680
Right now,

129
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
we need to convince Ji Bozai

130
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
to collaborate with us.

131
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,600
He defied the divine stone,

132
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,920
carved the inscription for your sake,

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,720
and was badly hurt,

134
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,600
forming a heart imprint with you.

135
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,080
You're a huge threat to him,

136
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,360
yet he can't bring himself to kill you.

137
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,520
Ming Yi,

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
our plan worked.

139
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,400
He's fallen for you.

140
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
Yes.

141
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm the heartless one.

142
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,880
But what could you have done?

143
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,120
Love won't save your life.

144
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,800
You two finally formed a heart imprint.

145
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,160
We have to get to the Spirit Well

146
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
and seize the Golden Millet Dream, right?

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
We wait until he calms down

148
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
and agrees to join forces with us.

149
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,120
I think we still have a shot.

150
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,760
For now, we've got to find a way

151
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,160
out of here first.

152
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,000
Ming Yi has formed a heart imprint
with Your Lordship.

153
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Once she finds out
where the Golden Millet Dream is,

154
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
she can use that connection

155
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
to enter Your Lordship's Spirit Well
anytime she wants.

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,280
We should kill her.

157
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I have a way to stop her from
taking the Golden Millet Dream.

158
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
As expected of Your Lordship.

159
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
But we still have to deal with her, right?

160
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,880
She's still useful.

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
Then, I'll get rid of the cat first.

162
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,960
What good will that do?

163
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,800
The cat doesn't have a heart imprint.

164
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,160
Then, we should kill her first?

165
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
Buxiu,

166
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,200
you can't solve every problem by killing.

167
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Even if killing her

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
might solve some of them.

169
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
-Understood.
-Come back.

170
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,920
I do understand.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,560
You don't.

172
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Go to Yaoguang Mountain

173
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
and find out what happened to Ming Xian.

174
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Understood.

175
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,840
And here I was, talking about Ji Bozai

176
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
like he was madly in love with you,
saying how much he cared.

177
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,760
After all this time,
he hasn't even shown his face once!

178
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
Master She was right.

179
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,840
He's a scoundrel!

180
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,240
Immortal Ji! Immortal Ji, please,
hear me out.

181
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
Mu Qibai controls the netherbeast army.

182
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Do you even know how to deal with them?

183
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,280
I do.

184
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm willing to offer you the method
to suppress them

185
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,400
as a sign of good faith.

186
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,240
Good faith?

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,400
How can I trust someone whose history

188
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,080
I don't even know?

189
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,320
When you're ready to tell me the truth,

190
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,080
we can talk about cooperation.

191
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,080
Immortal Ji!

192
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,080
Immortal Ji!

193
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,920
Immortal Ji, just hear me out.

194
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,920
Immortal Ji…

195
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,840
My love, please wait!

196
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
I can leave Ming Xian behind. ̀I…

197
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,760
It's freezing. How can anyone survive
in a place like this?

198
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Immortal Ji,

199
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,440
this cell is freezing.

200
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,040
Ming Yi overexerted herself last night.

201
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,280
I think she's fallen ill.

202
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,760
Please, let us out.

203
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,440
Immortal Ji,

204
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,120
it's too cold in here.

205
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,080
Why don't you come in
and see for yourself?

206
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Talk properly.

207
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,840
Immortal Ji,

208
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm telling the truth.

209
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Ming Xian is my betrothed. He and I…

210
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,520
Immortal Ji?

211
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,000
-Immortal Ji. Immortal Ji!
-Oh, woe is me…

212
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
Immortal Ji! Ming Yi fainted!

213
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,280
Ming Yi fainted!

214
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,640
Ming Yi fainted!

215
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,040
Drop the act. He's gone.

216
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,400
How stubborn can he be?

217
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,040
At least he's not completely heartless.

218
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Your Lordship,

219
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,000
after the Qingyun Tournament,

220
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,440
Ming Xian vanished from Yaoguang Mountain.

221
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,920
No one knows where he went.

222
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,720
There's no record of him
having a betrothed,

223
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,280
but he did have plenty of romantic rumors

224
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,280
back in the divine capital.

225
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,920
It wouldn't be unexpected

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
if he were involved with someone.

227
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
Ming Yi appeared in Moonlit Blossoms

228
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,600
right after the tournament.

229
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,360
She and Ming Xian

230
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
must be connected.

231
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,680
For now, Ming Yi's still useful to us.

232
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Things are complicated,
so we'll have to keep her.

233
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,400
Your Lordship, are you concerned
about her relationship with Ming Xian?

234
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,800
What's that got to do with me?

235
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,040
Whatever their relationship is,

236
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,240
Ming Xian

237
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,320
won't be reappearing anytime soon.

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,480
I used to think he was an upright man.

239
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
If he's in hiding,

240
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,960
it's clear something's amiss.

241
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Xiuyun, let's go.

242
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,600
Your Highness.

243
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,640
Is your Highness heading to Wugui Sea?

244
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Xiuyun, wait outside.

245
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,000
You should worry more about yourself.

246
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,440
You've failed several tasks my uncle
gave you recently, haven't you?

247
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,680
Can a dog like that still be trusted
by its master?

248
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,800
How unlike Immortal Ji.

249
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,640
The more capable someone is,

250
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,120
the less they'll submit to control.

251
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,280
No form of control compares

252
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,080
to the virtue of tolerance.

253
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,320
Is it tolerance, or merely endurance?

254
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,400
You'd do better to summon Ji Bozai
for an audience.

255
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,520
That would be much more appropriate.

256
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,720
If you came just to say that,

257
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,640
you can leave.

258
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,200
Your Highness may use Ji Bozai,

259
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,079
but don't defend him,

260
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,640
and certainly don't turn

261
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,720
against Lord Hanfeng for his sake.

262
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,400
Thanks for the reminder.

263
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,599
There's something

264
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
I should've cleared up long ago.

265
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,480
It was my decision

266
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,280
to include you in the warrior selection.

267
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
I thought

268
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,600
maybe one day I could turn you to my side.

269
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,600
You had my uncle's trust,

270
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,240
and he placed you with my father
to watch over his health.

271
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
I figured if you helped me,

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
I could keep my father safe.

273
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,520
But I was wrong.

274
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,320
It's understandable

275
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,280
that you'd ally with my uncle
to secure your future.

276
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,000
I shouldn't have expected anything else.

277
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I won't anymore.

278
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh,

279
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,960
and if you don't wish to join
the warrior selection,

280
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
feel free to withdraw anytime.

281
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
Tianji,

282
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I…

283
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Let go of me.

284
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
You could've warned me

285
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,680
about Ming Yi.

286
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,760
Instead, you led people into
Shouhua Academy

287
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,960
and left me to humiliate myself

288
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,240
in the only place I could control.

289
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,880
I know

290
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,520
it was foolish of me to expect
anything from you.

291
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,120
I never should've.

292
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,200
But it's you.

293
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,280
You know

294
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
how I've always felt since we were little.

295
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,040
It's time we put a stop to this.

296
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,120
It's meaningless to me now.

297
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,920
He really won't show up.

298
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,240
-It's Ji Bozai. He's here.
-Cut it out.

299
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,480
Ji Bozai. Ji Bozai's here.

300
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
My Lord, I've decided. I…

301
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Princess Tianji has summoned us.

302
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,080
Come with me.

303
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,760
Of course.

304
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,720
As long as I'm useful to you.

305
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,440
Say one more word
and you'll be back in that cell.

306
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
But…

307
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,160
What about me? Ming… Ming… Ming Yi!

308
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,120
You're just going to leave me here?

309
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,440
This is abuse!

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,080
Ming Yi!

311
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,000
Is there a reason Your Highness wished

312
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
to see us?

313
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,240
After everything that happened,

314
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,720
I must look into it.

315
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,240
What else do you want to know?

316
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,120
Mu Qibai

317
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
set my wife up

318
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,040
to strip me of my status as warrior.

319
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,480
Isn't that obvious?

320
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,720
What more is there to ask?

321
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,040
Of course, there is.

322
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,760
For example,

323
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,640
when did you take in Ming Xian's
companion beast?

324
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,200
Ji Bozai,

325
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,880
we're allies,

326
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,240
but you hide too much from me.

327
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,040
You worry for nothing, Your Highness.

328
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,040
Lord Hanfeng's been trying
to move against my husband,

329
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,960
planting spies across Wugui Sea.

330
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
When they found out

331
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,560
my husband sheltered Ming Xian's
companion beast,

332
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,120
they used that to slander us.

333
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,560
Fortunately, Your Highness stepped in.

334
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,040
If not, we'd never wash that stain away.

335
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
Is that so?

336
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,520
I've been regretting it these past days.

337
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
I should've

338
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,720
let Lord Hanfeng take you away then

339
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,040
and be rid of the trouble.

340
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Your Highness should know

341
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,520
Lord Hanfeng targeted me

342
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,480
because he thinks
I'm Immortal Ji's weakness.

343
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,480
But please rest assured.

344
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,120
Despite its scale,

345
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,840
the matter's been handled properly.

346
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,200
I doubt anyone will dare exploit it again.

347
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,240
Therefore, my presence
will not pose an issue.

348
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,400
Keeping me around

349
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,680
will make Immortal Ji more willing

350
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
to serve the Jixing Abyss in future.

351
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,400
You're not as foolish as you look.

352
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,160
Your Highness must
have more to your position

353
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,560
as Venerable of Shouhua Academy

354
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,560
than people claim.

355
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Claims? About me?

356
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,840
What do they say?

357
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,120
They say you're good-natured,
naive, and without guile.

358
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
How offensive! How dare you…

359
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
Being described that way by others

360
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,360
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

361
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,200
The idea that Ming Yi is Ming Xian
is ridiculous.

362
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,560
My uncle didn't believe it either.

363
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,640
He merely needed a reason
to provoke action.

364
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
Now that it's escalated this far,

365
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,120
all eyes at Shouhua Academy are on us.

366
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,200
Ming Xian's companion beast

367
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,680
can't stay.

368
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,720
Let it stay.

369
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,720
I'll look after it.

370
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,320
I thought that if Ming Xian ever returned,

371
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
I'd use it to bait him.

372
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Will that explanation be enough

373
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,640
to satisfy everyone at Shouhua Academy?

374
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,400
Very well.

375
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
But remember, Ji Bozai,

376
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,280
to outsiders, you are of my faction.

377
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
From now on,

378
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,560
run things by me first.

379
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,560
Of course.

380
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,320
Your Highness.

381
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,960
Thank you for saving Twenty-Seven.

382
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,240
You were the one who got
Princess Tianji to summon us.

383
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,760
If she wanted to see you,

384
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,560
I had to let you out.

385
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,560
You wanted her to remind me

386
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,680
we're on the same side.

387
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,760
I thought she'd want to meet us
sooner or later,

388
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,960
but I didn't make her do this.

389
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,640
There was no need.

390
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
A while ago,

391
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,440
I sent you back to Moonlit Blossoms.

392
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,760
You left and Yan Xiao arrived right after.

393
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Pure coincidence?

394
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,160
I'm sorry.

395
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Everything from the past,

396
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,760
I owe you an apology for.

397
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,760
Please don't hold it against me.

398
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,240
For the sake of what I can do for you,

399
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,320
work with me.

400
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,000
You're clever.

401
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
But Ming Yi,

402
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,120
being clever isn't enough to ally with me.

403
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,000
I need to see your skill
and your sincerity.

404
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,280
All right.

405
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,360
To purge the unrefined netherbeasts,

406
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,800
one must use
the Netherbeast Refining Skill.

407
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,880
This skill requires using one's own body
as a netherbeast vessel

408
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,840
to absorb the netherbeast core
from the netherbeast,

409
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,280
drawing it in with your body
before refining it.

410
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,320
But it risks damaging one's
spiritual veins.

411
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,400
You…

412
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,960
If you'll join me,

413
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,240
I shall serve as the netherbeast vessel

414
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
and bear that burden.

415
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,320
Get up.

416
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,760
We'll set three rules.

417
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,360
One, while you stay in Wugui Sea,

418
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,040
you can't contact…

419
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,640
you can't contact anyone
from other realms.

420
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,600
Two, whenever

421
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,280
I summon you, you must answer.

422
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,360
Three,

423
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,480
you only need to tell me

424
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,640
how the Netherbeast Refining Skill works.

425
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,480
The rest isn't for you to meddle in.

426
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
All right.

427
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,680
Mu Qibai and I were in conflict,
both publicly and behind the scenes.

428
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,040
He'll scheme again

429
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,680
now that that his plot has failed.

430
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,000
Finding proof he raises the netherbeasts

431
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,040
won't be easy.

432
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,720
However,

433
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,440
that cat has been to Dragon Carp Terrace.

434
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,360
Got it.

435
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,720
He's been attempting to infiltrate
Wugui Sea with his people.

436
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,680
We'll do likewise with
his Dragon Carp Terrace.

437
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
I leave it to you, then.

438
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
I'll figure it out.

439
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,760
I won't let you down!

440
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
After the recent selection trials,

441
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,280
Ji Bozai,

442
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,520
Chen Xi,

443
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,640
Meng Yangqiu,

444
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,040
Sun Liao,

445
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,120
and Yan Xiao

446
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,880
are confirmed as the official warriors for
the next Qingyun Tournament.

447
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,920
We have our team.

448
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll ask one more time.

449
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,040
Are you all joining Shouhua Academy
of your own will?

450
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,880
Anyone wishing to withdraw?

451
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,680
Excellent.

452
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,480
From today onward,

453
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I expect diligence and unity

454
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,000
as you prepare
for the next Qingyun Tournament.

455
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,560
Your Highness.

456
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
During the last tournament representing
the Jixing Abyss,

457
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,920
I noticed Immortal Ji prefers
to act alone,

458
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,840
which makes teamwork difficult.

459
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,320
I suggest we live

460
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,160
and train together to build rapport

461
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,080
to guarantee another victory

462
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
at the next Qingyun Tournament.

463
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,040
That's a fine idea.

464
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Bozai's temper

465
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,280
could use some softening.

466
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,080
The four warriors ought to stay with Bozai

467
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,400
in Wugui Sea,

468
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,200
where they can eat and train as a group.

469
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,760
Are you still trying to insert your people
into my Wugui Sea?

470
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,760
What's this?
Another scheme since the first failed?

471
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,200
Bozai,

472
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,960
if you still hold that against me,

473
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,000
I'll apologize.

474
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,360
I only proposed it

475
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,120
for Princess Tianji's sake.

476
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,200
Don't you want

477
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,440
the team to bond sooner

478
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,600
and fight better?

479
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,360
I appreciate your concern, Uncle.

480
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,000
But since this is preparation
for the Qingyun Tournament,

481
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,080
having so many people stay at Wugui Sea
isn't practical.

482
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,280
Perhaps

483
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,000
the five warriors should stay at
Shouhua Academy instead.

484
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,840
That would allow them

485
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,680
to train without trouble

486
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,240
and I can supervise every day.

487
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,880
How does that sound?

488
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,560
Are you kidding me?

489
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,560
We're all lodging together
in one large room?

490
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
A bunch of grown men sharing beds.

491
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,640
Disgusting.

492
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,000
Chen Xi, you take that bed.

493
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,560
I'll sleep next to you.

494
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
All right.

495
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,760
Yan Xiao,

496
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,840
you take this bed.

497
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
I can't stand Sun Liao.

498
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm not sharing with him.

499
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
It's comfortable, though.

500
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,600
Ming Yi, watch your step.

501
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
My Lord,

502
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,680
Her Highness said you're supposed to live
and train with the other warriors.

503
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
Why'd you bring me along too?

504
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,640
Because I can't bear to be away
from you for even a moment.

505
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,440
Won't Her Highness be upset
if she finds out?

506
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,600
My silly girl.

507
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,680
What are you worried about?

508
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,160
As long as you're happy,

509
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,000
I couldn't care less about anyone else.

510
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,280
What?

511
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,960
Why does Ji Bozai get a private room?

512
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,000
Because he's married.

513
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,800
Then, I'll get married too.

514
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,600
You?

515
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,360
More like dazed than married.

516
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,960
Chen Xi, you don't snore, do you?

517
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,160
Of course not!

518
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,400
You dare hit me?

519
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,800
Come here!

520
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,680
My niece acts on a whim,
just doing as she pleases.

521
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,480
She even made you
and Meng Yangqiu warriors.

522
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,840
What? Instead of healing,

523
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,160
a physician shall now kill?

524
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
Does everyone think

525
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
they can rise like Ji Bozai

526
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,920
through the Qingyun Tournament?

527
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,760
Lord Hanfeng, you overestimate me.

528
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,680
I'm not that capable.

529
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,240
No, you're really not.

530
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,040
Yan Xiao,

531
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,840
you once betrayed Tianji.

532
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,200
You think she'll take you back
just because you changed your mind?

533
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,840
Know your place and do your job.

534
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,240
When the time comes,

535
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,520
I'll wipe her memory

536
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,920
and give her to you unharmed.

537
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,080
Her Highness isn't an object

538
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,320
to be given.

539
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,280
Moreover, I'm unworthy of her.

540
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,120
Whether you're worthy or not

541
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,120
is for me to decide.

542
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,480
Keep watching Ji Bozai

543
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,920
at Shouhua Academy.

544
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Yes, Lord Hanfeng.

545
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
My Lord,

546
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,680
you mentioned investigating
Dragon Carp Terrace.

547
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,120
I already sent Twenty-Seven
to look into it.

548
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,840
The place is indeed sealed tight.

549
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,840
The only way in is to lure someone away.

550
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,280
We're confined within the cage

551
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,200
known as the Shouhua Academy.

552
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,200
How will we do that?

553
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,560
I have an idea.

554
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Ji Bozai!

555
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,600
We're married!

556
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,600
Can't you have a little more faith in me?

557
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,719
I've been loyal to you!
You think I've been hiding something?

558
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,080
You…

559
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,400
You're being unreasonable!

560
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,080
And why can't I doubt you?

561
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,480
You married me while
still holding someone else

562
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,680
in your heart, didn't you?

563
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
Let me tell you something.

564
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,000
Cracks can't be mended.

565
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,240
We're like this teacup.

566
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
Once it's broken, it's broken.

567
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,040
There's no going back.

568
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,120
Ji Bozai!

569
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
You've got no right

570
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,360
to say that.

571
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,840
Yes, I had someone in the past.

572
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,000
But what about you? Are you so pure?

573
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
I'm going to become the strongest warrior

574
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
in the Six Realms.

575
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,760
Answer me!

576
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,280
-Chen Xi, what are you…
-What do you have to say for yourself?

577
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,360
I did it for you. It was all for you.

578
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,680
For your sake.

579
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,040
Are you so sure about that?

580
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,680
Of course! What other reason is there?

581
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,440
What… What gives you the
right to bring up the past?

582
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,680
If anything, I'm the one
who should be questioning you.

583
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
All the times you've doubted me,

584
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,760
yet I've never asked about your secrets!

585
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,800
Give that back!

586
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,840
You…

587
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,320
The things you did. Ji Bozai.

588
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
-The things I did?
-I've never asked about your secrets.

589
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,920
-What secrets?
-Who are you to demand answers?

590
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,520
-Out with it, then!
-As you wish!

591
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,000
Where's all the rewards you won, huh?

592
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,760
-Where is it?
-They just got married too.

593
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
-Prove your love!
-Men.

594
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,240
Prove it to me!

595
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,440
-Yan Xiao.
-Got anything else to say?

596
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,600
What are you doing?
Eavesdropping on a marital spat

597
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,520
-in the middle of the night?
-Ji Bozai!

598
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,280
If you won't explain yourself today,

599
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,800
get out!

600
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,200
You think I've changed?

601
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,800
You think those ladies are better?
Then, go!

602
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
Go find them!

603
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't return until you've assembled
all 28 constellations!

604
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,880
Fine, I'll go!

605
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,080
That was terrifying.

606
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,680
Better not marry, after all.

607
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,400
I'll be a warrior for life.

608
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
-What a wonderful performance!
-Indeed.

609
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,720
Look.

610
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,440
I've never seen Immortal Ji
like this before.

611
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,880
-Neither have I.
-How much has he had to drink?

612
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,240
Did Immortal Ji and Ming Yi have a fight?

613
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,400
Looks like it.

614
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
So men really change that much

615
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,080
after marriage.

616
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,640
The Mistress is here.

617
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,040
Immortal Ji,

618
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,240
why don't I send a message to Ming Yi
to come get you?

619
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
You do that.

620
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,760
I didn't bring any money anyway.

621
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,320
Madam, Ming Yi just sent a message too.

622
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,480
Now you remember me?

623
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,360
Ladies, ignore him!

624
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,880
Let him die out there!

625
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,480
Don't come back!

626
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,920
Let him die! Die!

627
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Die! Die!

628
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,040
Die!

629
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,360
Die!

630
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,080
Die!

631
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,760
Immortal Ji,

632
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,240
even if you brought your own liquor,

633
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
you spilled all the fruit and pastries

634
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,200
on the floor.

635
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,000
You know the rules of Moonlit Blossoms.

636
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,640
We don't do tabs.

637
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,920
Then,

638
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,400
send a message to my best friend

639
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,120
and ask him to come.

640
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
Your best friend?

641
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,200
May I ask who that is?

642
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,960
Your Lordship,

643
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
the Mistress of Moonlit Blossoms
sent a message.

644
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,000
Ji Bozai wants to see you.

645
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,880
What's Ji Bozai up to now?

646
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,480
Could it be he got wind of our plan

647
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,800
and set up a trap at Moonlit Blossoms

648
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,160
waiting for Your Lordship
to walk right in?

649
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,080
He wants me to step into his snare.

650
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,520
It's risky.

651
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,000
We can't lower our guard.

652
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,520
Then, let's give him what he wants.
We'll go.

653
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,120
Bring all our men.

654
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,920
Understood.

655
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,520
Make way! Move!

656
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,080
Make way!

657
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,080
Bai…

658
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,240
I made way.

659
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,320
Your Lordship, thank goodness you're here.

660
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,360
-Immortal Ji insisted I call for you.
-Lord Hanfeng.

661
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,120
He said you're his best friend.

662
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,040
That's news to me.

663
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,360
Bai…

664
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,680
-Stop.
-Bai…

665
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm here.

666
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,840
Qibai…

667
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,920
You made me wait so long!

668
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,040
Oh, Qibai.

669
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,600
Listen to me.

670
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,760
Men should never get married.

671
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,640
Before marriage,
they lift you to the heavens.

672
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,280
After marriage,
they trample you into the ground.

673
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,640
Qibai.

674
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,160
She didn't give me a single coin,

675
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
then kicked me out of the house!

676
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,800
I… I'd rather be a prisoner
of the Sunken Abyss

677
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,440
than a prisoner of love!

678
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,080
Qibai.

679
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,880
Let… Let go of me!

680
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,320
Ji Bozai, if you're playing games again,

681
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,080
this place could be your grave!

682
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,240
Brat.

683
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Do you know what the real grave is?

684
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,640
It's marriage.

685
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,880
Qibai!

686
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,280
Qibai!

687
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,760
I've suffered too much, Qibai.

688
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,680
Ji Bozai!

689
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,080
Qibai.

690
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,160
My life's miserable.

691
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,880
-Qibai…
-Let go!
