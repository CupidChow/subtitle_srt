1
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,280
Look at those slender and fair fingers.

3
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,680
That's why she plays well.

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,600
How lovely.

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
Do you know anything about music?

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
Not at all, but I can see
how beautiful she plays.

7
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,880
Just look at her.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,160
Those delicate hands of hers.

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,520
That's truly brilliant.

10
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,040
Well, she's just stolen a glance at me.

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,840
You're certainly a skilled qin player.

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
Immortal Lin has sent us an invitation,

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,400
and he'd like to watch you play.

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
He's the key to my power grab.

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,320
You should know what to do, no?

16
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,200
Qibai. I…

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,920
Are you refusing to share my burden?

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,680
Naturally, I'll help you with that.

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm glad to hear that.

20
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,640
Go ahead, then.

21
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,680
Did you know?

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,440
Xinliu died trying to save you.

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,600
Please grant me death.

24
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,120
What's the use of taking your life?

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
Xinliu is gone.

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Would killing you bring her back to life?

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,400
Xun Ming.

28
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
Bear this in mind.

29
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,400
This wretched life of yours
doesn't belong to you.

30
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,920
It belongs to Xinliu and the Mu clan!

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,200
For the rest of your life,
all you need to do

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,120
is turn netherbeasts into an army.

33
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Otherwise, Xinliu's death
would be in vain!

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,120
EPISODE 10

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,040
LUOSHENG FOREST, HANXING MOUNTAIN

36
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,800
What a beautiful day.

37
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,280
It is.

38
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
The auspicious hour is approaching.

39
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
Since we've made this spot the venue,
Xun Ming will come, no?

40
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,760
He will.

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
He knows this wedding is for him.

42
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,600
Foxes are curious in nature.

43
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,320
Even at the cost of his life,
he will want to know

44
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,040
what trap we've got him.

45
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,080
We shall play it by ear.

46
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,400
Open his Illusory Realm
and Zhang Tai will be saved.

47
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,280
Why does that sound like a crowd?

48
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
-Immortal Ji!
-Immortal Ji!

49
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,320
That's great!

50
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,760
-Immortal Ji!
-Immortal Ji!

51
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,680
Congratulations, Immortal Ji!

52
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,040
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

53
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
Congratulations!

54
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Immortal Ji!

55
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
Congratulations! Congratulations!

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,840
Congratulations, Immortal Ji!

57
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,200
Congratulations, Immortal Ji!

58
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Immortal Ji!

59
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,440
It's your big day!

60
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,480
It's your wedding day!

61
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,600
Immortal Ji.

62
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
That was unfair of you.

63
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,000
How could you keep your wedding from us?

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,800
Exactly.

65
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,240
Your wedding day has been a quiet one.

66
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,440
I only see a few tables here.

67
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,520
And look at this fox hole-like decoration.

68
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,320
Luckily, we found out about this soon.

69
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,720
That's why we managed

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,160
to make it here in no time
and liven things up for you.

71
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,440
How did you all figure it out?

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
Don't worry about it.

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Come on!

74
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,440
Congratulations!

75
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
Immortal Ji!

76
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
Both of you are getting married?

77
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
At first, I didn't believe it.

78
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,120
Now I can see that it's true.

79
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
You even lied to us

80
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,840
and promised to spend the rest
of your life with us.

81
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,400
In the end, you're marrying Ming Yi.

82
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
-Indeed.
-I know, right?

83
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,600
It's fine if you're marrying her.

84
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,040
Yet you should've informed us
of this wedding.

85
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
-That's right.
-Exactly.

86
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,800
Why didn't you tell us about it?

87
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,040
That's it.

88
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,400
Anyway, we wish you a lifetime
of happiness together.

89
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
Here are your gifts.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
-This is from me.
-And this is from me.

91
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
Thank you.

92
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Thank you.

93
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
Why did you keep this from me,
Immortal Ji?

94
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
Why are you here?

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,520
Ming Yi, why are you suddenly

96
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,520
having this wedding with Immortal Ji?

97
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Have you figured out a way
to save Zhang Tai?

98
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
You've always been close to Zhang Tai.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,640
I bet you won't stand by and do nothing,
right?

100
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Or this is part of your plan?

101
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
Rest assured, I've planned it all out.
Well…

102
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,120
How did you find out about our wedding?

103
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,040
Hold on, everyone.

104
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,320
I've indeed made a mistake
by not telling you all about it.

105
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,480
But I have a question.

106
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,920
How did you find out
about my wedding with Ming Yi?

107
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,560
Well, I informed them of it.

108
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,880
Immortal Meng?

109
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi.

110
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
Seriously, that wasn't fair of you.

111
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
No matter how hasty your wedding has been,

112
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,600
you should've sent
each of us an invitation.

113
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Indeed!

114
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,559
Good thing I've got my sources.

115
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,120
I visited everyone here

116
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
and told them about it.

117
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,720
If not, your wedding would be a quiet one.

118
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
But how did you find out about it?

119
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
Of course I learned that
from Lord Hanfeng.

120
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,960
Here's my wedding gift for you.

121
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,760
I thought

122
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
I couldn't keep

123
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,000
such good news from others.

124
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,280
Thus, I shared it with everyone at once.
Right, Yan Xiao?

125
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
Immortal Meng.

126
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,800
We appreciate your thoughtfulness.

127
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,120
However, due to how urgent things
have been,

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,280
we decided not to have a grand wedding.

129
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,920
-We never thought…
-I can see that.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There are only a few banquet tables here.

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,880
I understand that you'd like
to keep a low profile.

132
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,080
Yet a wedding is no small matter.

133
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
-Wait here.
-Yes, it should not be taken lightly.

134
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
I'll get you more tables.

135
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,600
Never mind.

136
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Don't stand on ceremony.

137
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
I'm serious.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,080
I was born into a family
of wine immortals,

139
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,040
so I'm very good at this.

140
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,160
Just wait here.

141
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
Princess Tianji has arrived.

142
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Tianji is here?

143
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,080
-Greetings, Your Highness.
-Greetings, Your Highness.

144
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Both of you, come with me.

145
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Leave these to me.

146
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,960
If it hadn't been for
Immortal Meng's heads-up,

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
I wouldn't have known

148
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,040
about the warrior of Jixing Abyss
getting married today.

149
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,040
I don't think
I need your permission to get married.

150
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Father is bedridden.

151
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,280
Naturally, nobody takes me seriously.

152
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
But don't you forget this.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
If I could make you who you are,

154
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
I can make you fall from grace too.

155
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,800
Many covet the legendary
Golden Millet Dream.

156
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,160
However, since you're the one who turned
the Jixing Abyss into an Upper Realm,

157
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,120
they wouldn't dare to make a move.

158
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,400
If I were to tell the Outer Realm

159
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,000
that you've been cast out of the
Jixing Abyss,

160
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
do you think

161
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,640
the other five realms would denounce you?

162
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
Give it a try, then.

163
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,520
Well,

164
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,680
I guess I've figured it out.

165
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,800
Your Highness.

166
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,160
You don't love Lord Ji at all.

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
You just need him.

168
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
With His Majesty being bedridden,

169
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,840
no one in the palace cares about you.

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,760
However, a marriage alliance is not
the best option for forming an alliance.

171
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
Profits are.

172
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,480
Lord Ji.

173
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,080
As a warrior,
you've certainly had your slice of cake.

174
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,480
And it's true that you have your backer
here in the Jixing Abyss.

175
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,200
Since we've gotten what we wanted,

176
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
and we need one another,

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,600
why don't we all take a step back?

178
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
How wise of you, darling.

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,400
This wedding must go on.

180
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,520
Since we're on the same boat,

181
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,280
Your Highness,
why don't you name your condition?

182
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,680
Don't make things awkward between us.

183
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,120
Since you insist on marrying
Fairy Ming Yi,

184
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
I'm fine with that.

185
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
You can have a wedding as you like.

186
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Yet here's my decree.

187
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
The warrior, Ji Bozai,

188
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,720
must not form a heart imprint
with another,

189
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,880
nor share his divine consciousness.

190
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
That is to make sure

191
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
the next Qingyun Tournament
proceeds smoothly.

192
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,200
Your Highness, here's the thing.

193
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
-The heart imprint…
-Sure.

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,160
We'll each make some concessions.

195
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,840
Say thank you to Princess Tianji.

196
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,240
Well… Thank you…

197
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,880
Deal.

198
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,280
Xiuyun.

199
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Present the gift to Immortal Ji.

200
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,880
May you have a wonderful wedding.

201
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm not joining it.

202
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,040
Are you happy now? Let's go.

203
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,400
Come on, check these out.

204
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,400
Fairy. Take a look at these outfits.

205
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
They come in all kinds of models.

206
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Have a look at this.

207
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
It really suits you perfectly.

208
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,720
I'm sure Ming Yi will love it.

209
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,560
You must be the new
Chief of Judgment Hall,

210
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,120
Immortal Situ.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,240
Are these the presents

212
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,640
for Immortal Ji and his wife?

213
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,280
Immortal Ji and his wife?

214
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,680
Didn't you know?

215
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
Today, Immortal Ji is marrying

216
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,200
the fairy he found at Moonlit Blossoms.

217
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,840
Having seen all these purchases
you've made,

218
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,000
I thought you'd like to buy more.

219
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,960
Are you telling the truth?

220
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Where is their wedding?

221
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,960
I guess it's true.

222
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,600
I learned that from someone.

223
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,400
The wedding is in the Luosheng Forest.

224
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,120
Immortal Situ. You're not buying it?

225
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,920
Now that everyone's found out about it,

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,560
how do we put an end to it?

227
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,360
Of course

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
we shall make the most out of it.

229
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
Darling.

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,080
Here comes the auspicious hour.

231
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,600
Look at that.

232
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
What a lovely flower!

233
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,520
You're right.

234
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,920
This is such a unique wedding aisle.

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,600
As expected of Immortal Ji.

236
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
This wedding is unlike those I've seen.

237
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,200
-No doubt it is.
-How beautiful!

238
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,320
It's my first time hearing
this processional.

239
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
Indeed.

240
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,280
Check that out.

241
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,720
-So lovely.
-They're a match made in heaven.

242
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,720
-How grand this has been.
-A beauty in such a gorgeous setting.

243
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
I envy him.

244
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,760
And that nice aroma.

245
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,000
Indeed.

246
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Look.

247
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
Their encounter has been a fated one.

248
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
May the newlyweds forever find
one another.

249
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
In the face of endless change, their
feelings for each other remain unshaken.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,280
May the newlyweds live
in harmony and happiness.

251
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,920
-Great!
-Nice!

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,920
They make a perfect match.

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
-That's great!
-Amazing!

254
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,240
Congratulations!

255
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Have a lifetime of happiness together.

256
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,720
May you love each other till
the end of your days.

257
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,720
Thank you for your presence here.

258
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,320
This place means a lot to me and Ming Yi.

259
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,200
However, it's a rural area
lacking hospitality.

260
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Why don't we make a move to
Moonlit Blossoms for the banquet?

261
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Moonlit Blossoms?

262
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,800
Sure!

263
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,520
This looks fine to me.

264
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,960
I haven't had enough fun here.

265
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
Congratulations on your wedding, Ji.

266
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,400
We shall make our way to
Moonlit Blossoms now.

267
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,600
I haven't had a drink.

268
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,800
Immortal Ji, are you paying
for what we're having at Moonlit Blossoms?

269
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,160
It's far from here.

270
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,599
How do we travel there?

271
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,720
-Indeed.
-You're right.

272
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
Since it'll be a long journey,

273
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,520
of course we don't expect you
to walk there.

274
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,040
We'll see to that.

275
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,960
Follow me.

276
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
-Come, let's go.
-Let's go.

277
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,400
-Let's go.
-Here.

278
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,680
-Come on.
-Let's join the rest.

279
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Together.

280
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,400
Come on.

281
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,480
Why isn't he responding to all this?

282
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,440
Could it be his most cherished memories

283
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,360
have nothing to do with his wedding
with Xinliu?

284
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,920
Today is the best time.

285
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,360
We have to save Zhang Tai no matter what.

286
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
We can't let them get away with it.

287
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
Let's go.

288
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,360
Hold on.

289
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,880
I didn't expect your presence here,
General Xun Ming.

290
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Why don't you join me and Ming Yi

291
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,800
for a boat ride there?

292
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,560
You sure know how to amuse yourself.

293
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,000
You chose this spot

294
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,640
to have your wedding according
to the Yousu Fox Tribe's rites.

295
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,000
And now you're trying to make me stay.

296
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,680
I bet you're after something.

297
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you even hear yourself?

298
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm just inviting you

299
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,080
to join me for our wedding banquet.
Don't read too much into it.

300
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,600
Is that so?

301
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
It's a shame that all of your efforts
will go down the drain.

302
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,040
There was the wedding aisle.

303
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,080
As words of blessing were recited,
both the qin and flute were played.

304
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,480
It was all a fox banquet.

305
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,120
You managed to enter my fox hole

306
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,880
to figure out Zhang Tai's whereabouts

307
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,680
because I allowed it.

308
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,640
Of course Zhang Tai would tell you
how we had our wedding.

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
Immortal Ji, did you think

310
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,480
my most treasured memories

311
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,320
have anything to do with my wedding?

312
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,160
Did you truly think

313
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,440
you'd enter my Illusory Realm so easily?

314
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,720
Are you saying you made us think
so on purpose?

315
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,040
Go ahead if that's what you want.

316
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,240
I'm not going to stop you.

317
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,640
But you must bear this in mind.

318
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,480
Remain steadfast.

319
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,280
Don't you worry.

320
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,480
I'm too good for that.

321
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,680
I learned from the
Mistress of Moonlit Blossoms

322
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
that Ji Bozai ever asked her

323
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,000
about the way to get rid
of the Yousu Fox Tribe.

324
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
Thus, I intentionally let Ji Bozai
and Ming Yi

325
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
enter the Dengxian Cave
and meet Zhang Tai.

326
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
I wanted to make them believe

327
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,840
that my most precious memories
are related to my wedding with Xinliu.

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,280
Unfortunately, they failed to find out

329
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,400
that the Yousu Fox Tribe is best

330
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
at killing someone

331
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
by tricking them into one's
Illusory Realm.

332
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,120
When Ji Bozai
insists on entering my Illusory Realm,

333
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,960
I'll seize the chance to deceive him
into revealing the whereabouts

334
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,080
of Golden Millet Dream.

335
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,880
Then I will kill him.

336
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,560
It's time for you

337
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,160
to enter my labyrinthine Illusory Realm.

338
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,800
Ji Bozai.

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,280
Ji Bozai!

340
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,560
Where are you, Ji Bozai?

341
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,160
Zhang Tai!

342
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,800
Are you there, Zhang Tai?

343
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,440
Where exactly are you? Answer me!

344
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,080
Ming Yi.

345
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
Master.

346
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,040
Master.

347
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
Master.

348
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,520
Great! You're still alive!

349
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Come, I'll get you out of here.

350
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,960
Ji Bozai.

351
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,680
You're doing all this

352
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,080
to avenge me, aren't you?

353
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,800
As long as you're still alive.

354
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Come, Master. Let's tend to your wounds.

355
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,760
How will you avenge me?

356
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
I…

357
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,400
Avenging me

358
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,720
doesn't matter

359
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,840
as much as all this.

360
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,680
Tell me.

361
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,600
Have you kept the Golden Millet Dream

362
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,480
somewhere safe?

363
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,560
Tell me.

364
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,520
Where is it now?

365
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Ji Bozai!

366
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ji Bozai!

367
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,760
Where exactly are you, Ji Bozai?

368
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,120
Where are you? Where are you?

369
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,200
That rogue with his same old trick.

370
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,360
Bozai.

371
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,200
Tell me.

372
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,440
Where is the Golden Millet Dream?

373
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,040
Did you know?

374
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,480
I ended up in this state because of you.

375
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,920
Yet Master…

376
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,800
I've promised you

377
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,760
not to reveal the Golden Millet Dream.

378
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,160
It's all because of you.

379
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
It's all because of you!

380
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
I died from saving you!

381
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,200
Hand the Golden Millet Dream over to me!

382
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,200
I…

383
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,440
Hand it over to me! Hand it over to me!

384
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,240
Master…

385
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,680
Master…

386
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,040
I'm sorry, Master.

387
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
Master…

388
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm sorry…

389
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,000
You're not my master.

390
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
And you shouldn't have pretended
to be her.

391
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,320
Since you don't like me to pretend
to be her,

392
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
how about this same old face?

393
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,640
Tell me.

394
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,760
Where is the Golden Millet Dream?

395
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,840
Show yourself or I'll annihilate
every single clone of yours!

396
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Both you and I will be trapped here.

397
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
You can't kill me even if I show myself.

398
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,160
If you can't find my original form,

399
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,920
there's nothing you can do about me.

400
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,640
Because you will never be able

401
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,840
to tell truth from fiction.

402
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,840
Perhaps everything is nothing but fake.

403
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,520
Nothing has been real.

404
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,280
Stop struggling, Ji Bozai.

405
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,120
You're not getting out of here!

406
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,880
Hand the Golden Millet Dream over to me!

407
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,680
Stop struggling, Ji Bozai.

408
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,040
You're not getting out of here!

409
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,440
It's fake. Everything is fake!

410
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,600
It's fake. Everything is fake!

411
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,520
What do I do? I…

412
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,120
Are you all right, Ji Bozai?

413
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,080
Hand the Golden Millet Dream over to me.

414
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,200
Hand the Golden Millet Dream over to me!

415
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,000
-Hand the Golden Millet Dream over to me.
-Hand the Golden Millet Dream over to me.

416
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,560
Ji Bozai!

417
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,120
This is bad. If this goes on,
he'll be trapped by his inner demon.

418
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,680
He got drunk and kept saying,

419
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,000
"Whether you have true feelings
for me or not,

420
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,760
you're the only one I love."

421
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,440
Whether you have true feelings
for me or not,

422
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,600
you're the only one I love.

423
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,960
You managed to figure out
my most precious memories.

424
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,000
Since you're eager to know what happened,

425
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,480
you shall experience
everything I've been through.

426
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,320
This tune

427
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
was supposed to sound
as carefree as flying birds.

428
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,040
Yet your piece was nothing but sorrowful.

429
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,080
Mister.

430
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,080
You could read the emotions in my piece?

431
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
You need not be sad.

432
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,240
A broken qin string can be fixed.

433
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,280
And the bluebird

434
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,760
will fly again.

435
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,080
General.

436
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,440
Whether you have true feelings
for me or not,

437
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,920
you're the only one I love.

438
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,480
General.

439
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,560
I'm back.

440
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
General.

441
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,920
Why have you had injuries lately?

442
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,600
And they appear strange.

443
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,320
What have you been up to?

444
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,800
Xinliu.

445
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,160
You no longer want
to be part of the Mu clan,

446
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,080
don't you?

447
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,920
I'm marrying you

448
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,280
to give you your most desired freedom.

449
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
General.

450
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,120
Here's the prescription
I got from the Jixing Palace.

451
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,560
It helps heal the wounds inflicted
by the miasma.

452
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,400
Thank you for that.

453
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,760
What's happened to your hand?

454
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,320
I… I accidentally cut it.

455
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,120
Tell me. What have you done?

456
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,480
Did you bleed yourself

457
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,840
to come out with a cure for me?

458
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,320
I did that of my own accord, General.

459
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,680
As long as it helps General.

460
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,400
General! General!

461
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,760
-General!
-Xinliu.

462
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,240
I've told you a thousand times.

463
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,800
Don't ever hurt yourself
to save my life again.

464
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,640
For my sake, take a sip of it.

465
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,840
General.

466
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,040
Just a sip will do.

467
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,960
I can't live without you.

468
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,720
General.

469
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,080
It's the netherbeasts.

470
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm going to lose it.

471
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,120
-Go. Go!
-No!

472
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,280
General!

473
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,800
I won't let them hurt you.

474
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,920
No…

475
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,720
Xinliu…

476
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,840
Xinliu…

477
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,320
Xinliu…

478
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,680
Xinliu…

479
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,440
Xinliu…

480
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Xinliu…

481
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,520
Xinliu…

482
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,640
It's all my fault.

483
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,360
I brought this upon you.

484
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,840
You did all this to save my life.

485
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Xinliu…

486
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,000
Whether you have true feelings
for me or not,

487
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,360
you're

488
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
the only one I love.

489
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,440
TOMB OF BELOVED WIFE XINLIU

490
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,400
To our surprise,

491
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,520
despite the fact that he's helped
Mu Qibai raise netherbeasts,

492
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,720
he's had such a tragedy as well.

493
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,720
That should be his real Illusory Realm.

494
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,360
It's said that the Yousu Fox Tribe
is powerful enough

495
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,480
to blur the line between truth
and illusion.

496
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,880
Looks like this is Xun Ming's
real hideout.

497
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,360
-What was that…
-It was me.

498
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,560
I haven't finished my sentence.

499
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,680
Didn't you see that?

500
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
I did. I did.

501
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,800
Poor Xinliu.

502
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,240
She was unfortunate enough to
have such an older cousin

503
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,200
and a lover like Xun Ming.

504
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,520
Ji Bozai!

505
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,000
You're something else.

506
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,920
You actually managed to find me here.

507
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,680
However, do you think you can defeat me?

508
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,200
In my most cherished memories,

509
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,520
you found my original form.

510
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,200
Yet in my Illusory Realm,
your spiritual power will be weakened.

511
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,000
This is the Illusory Realm
I created for her.

512
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,800
-And you can't escape it!
-Xun Ming.

513
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,000
Look what I have here.

514
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,080
In those most treasured memories of yours,

515
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,800
Xinliu couldn't stop talking about
how much she loves you.

516
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,640
But I have a question.

517
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
In your memories,

518
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,160
why was she always in the Dengxian Cave?

519
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,640
She had no freedom.

520
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,360
Why did I feel
that Xinliu wasn't happy at all?

521
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760
She even wounded her own hand.

522
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,440
-Are you hiding something from us?
-That's not it…

523
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,560
Shut your mouth!

524
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,640
Xun Ming.

525
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,520
Why are you reluctant to answer
my question?

526
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,920
Xinliu wasn't happy at all!

527
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
Yes.

528
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,280
She was once used by Mu Qibai.

529
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,520
She was sick of socializing
and playing a good host.

530
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,480
Therefore…

531
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,560
I married her.

532
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,880
I agreed to raise netherbeasts

533
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,720
in exchange for Xinliu's freedom.

534
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
I'd do anything for her.

535
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,280
BELOVED WIFE, XINLIU

536
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,680
Anything.

537
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,640
I simply can't take it anymore.

538
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,040
What did you say?

539
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,360
If you had been sincere
in buying back Xinliu's freedom,

540
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
why did you even marry her?

541
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
You should've let her go.

542
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,280
Instead, you kept her
in the Dengxian Cave.

543
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,480
Is this what you call freedom, huh?

544
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,280
-That was because I…
-Xun Ming.

545
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Those days she spent with you

546
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,840
had been nothing but suffering.

547
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,560
I'm afraid you've been living in a lie

548
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,760
by assuming that yours is true love.

549
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,560
No…

550
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
That's not it.

551
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,560
It's you.

552
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,720
It's you!

553
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,400
Why must you doubt Xinliu's love for you?

554
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,160
Ji Bozai.

555
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,240
Ji Bozai?
