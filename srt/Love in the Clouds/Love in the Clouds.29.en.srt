00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,440
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,960
ADAPTED FROM
BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S "LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,880
EPISODE 29

4
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
Congratulations on soon
obtaining the Golden Millet Dream

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,240
and ruling the Six Realms, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
Save the flattery.

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,880
I called you here because I have
an important task for you.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,920
You have been obsessively searching

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,360
for your missing brother, Ming Xian.

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,600
Do you know where he is now?

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Does Your Majesty know where he is?

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
It's no wonder you couldn't find him.

13
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,080
Who would have imagined that Ming Xian,

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,759
Yaoguang Mountain's Warrior God,
the winner seven years running,

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,600
would actually be a fairy?

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
She fled into enemy
territory, Jixing Abyss,

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,400
and even degraded herself
by marrying Ji Bozai.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
Ming Xian

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,400
is the little fairy beside Ji Bozai?

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,840
Ming Xian went to Zhangwei Mountain,

21
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
broke through the Zhulong Barrier,

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
and took "Bo's Medical Classics."

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,320
So, the blood flowing through her

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,720
must be from the Bo clan.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,680
How can that be?

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
I didn't summon you here

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,600
to have you foolishly
ask how that is possible.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,520
I have managed to
manipulate the outcome of the drawing

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,800
so that the tea gathering will
be held at Yaoguang Mountain.

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,520
That is your territory.
You know what to do.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Ming Xian will attend the tea gathering
together with Ji Bozai.

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,680
You will investigate her background,

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,600
capture her alive,

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,440
and bring her to me.

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
Understood.

36
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,320
You know how to use
the Soul-seizing Technique, right?

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,440
I will not fail you, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,920
So Father has suspected
Ming Xian's background all along.

39
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,360
Chao Yuan, do you wish to protect her?

40
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,640
Then grow stronger.

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,040
Make yourself
the only one by Ming Yi's side.

42
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,520
That way, you can protect her,

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,440
possess her,

44
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
and make her yours.

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,040
Let me teach you how to truly be powerful.

46
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Your Highness.

47
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,040
Or should I call you Chief Situ?

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,040
To what do I owe the honor
of your summons?

49
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,640
Just call me Your Highness.

50
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,360
I can bear the title.

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
Lord Chengyun,

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,280
you were the one who forcefully
broke the array at Jixing Abyss

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,880
and tried to enter my Judgment Hall,
weren't you?

54
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,840
You've been chasing
after Ming Xian relentlessly,

55
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,840
and even now, you still won't give up.

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
Your Highness,

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,960
what is it you really want from me?

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
You were present when my father and I

59
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,520
spoke that day.

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,320
You must have heard everything.

61
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Now, in all Six Realms,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,440
I am the only one who knows
the recipe for the Golden Millet Dream.

63
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
To make it,

64
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,760
I first need more vagrants.

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,000
If you can lend me a hand in this,

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,000
then once I've refined
the Golden Millet Dream,

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,840
I could consider sharing
more of both the Golden Millet Dream

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,720
and the Heavenly Grief with you.

69
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,800
Your Highness,

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
sounds like you have big ambitions.

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
Let's not beat around the bush.

72
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,600
You want to become
the ruler of Yaoguang Mountain,

73
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
and I

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
want the throne of Zhushui.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,480
When the time comes,

76
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,280
we can form an alliance

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
and get

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,320
all Six Realms under our control.

79
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,320
Your father still lives.
For Your Highness to say so…

80
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
My father is old.

81
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Besides,

82
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,200
how do you view your own father?

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
We're not that different.

84
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,840
With power and titles at stake,

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
who wouldn't make plans?

86
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,560
Would you rather believe
in an old ruler nearing his end

87
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,640
or choose to side with
someone who promises you a future?

88
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,960
Since you're offering
the Golden Millet Dream,

89
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,360
there must be
something else you want, right?

90
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,640
At the tea gathering,

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
if you manage to catch Ming Xian

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
and figure out her true identity,

93
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,640
I'd like you to bring her to me first.

94
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,480
Trying to earn some credit
in front of your father, are you?

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
This is my gift for you, Lord Chengyun.

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Such power…

97
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,120
Your Highness, you've truly changed.

98
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
If you are happy with
this gift, Lord Chengyun,

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
about what I just said…

100
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
It's a deal.

101
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,320
Come and take a look!

102
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,640
-We have all kinds of styles available.
-Come on.

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
-This way, please.
-All right.

104
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,960
After Mu Qibai tricked me

105
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
into handing Ji Bozai
the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

106
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
Tianji assigned me a task.

107
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,200
We're heading to Yaoguang Mountain soon.

108
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,680
I need to complete it first.

109
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,440
Otherwise,
I might cause trouble for others again.

110
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
What task?

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,680
To practice discernment.

112
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
Learn how to handle situations.

113
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,640
Scenario one: You're
late to the tea gathering,

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,280
and a Yaoguang Mountain warrior says,

115
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
"How nice of you.

116
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
You didn't show up for the meal,

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,000
but you came to pay the bill."

118
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,240
What do you say?

119
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
"So you came early

120
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
just to avoid paying the bill?"

121
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
What a brilliant, sarcastic remark.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Was I being sarcastic?

123
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,800
I didn't mean to.

124
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,120
Scenario two:
Tianji buys tea and snacks for everyone

125
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
but leaves you out.

126
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,080
What do you do?

127
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Tianji would never do that.

128
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,360
You're that confident?

129
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,960
Scenario three:

130
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
The Emperor of Zhushui sees you

131
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
at the tea gathering and says,

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,560
"The youth are impressive.

133
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,600
Looks like I'm really getting old."

134
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,760
How do you respond?

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,880
The Emperor of
Zhushui is over 100 years old.

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
He really is old.

137
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,040
JADE RABBIT HALL

138
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,000
Can you two stop laughing now?

139
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
Even your poses are the same.

140
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
I didn't want to keep bothering you,

141
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
so I asked someone else to
help me practice discernment.

142
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,320
Is that really so funny?

143
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,680
Yes, it is.

144
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,000
All right, come on, sit down.

145
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,360
Sit down.

146
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,240
Listen to me. If you keep practicing,

147
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,000
you'll definitely improve over time.

148
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,120
I believe in you.

149
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,000
But I'm so worried.

150
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,840
I caused so much
trouble for Ji Bozai last time.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,560
At the tea gathering,

152
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
if someone from Yaoguang Mountain

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,360
asks you to pass
something to Ji Bozai like last time,

154
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
will you still do it without hesitation?

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
Of course not.

156
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,800
I'll check it at least
eight or ten times first.

157
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,040
That's the spirit!

158
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,480
See? You've made great progress.

159
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,680
Right.

160
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,200
It seems my recent efforts have paid off.

161
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,400
I'll go find Chen Xi to
help me practice more.

162
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
See you.

163
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,600
By the way, this is for you.

164
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,360
It's just a habit of mine.
I wanted to make you happy.

165
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
Of course I'm happy.

166
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Silly.

167
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,760
Thanks.

168
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,560
We three will
always be the best of friends,

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
right?

170
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
Of course.

171
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Of course.

172
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,520
Here.

173
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
One candy for each of my good friends.

174
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,240
PURE AND NOBLE SPIRIT

175
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
On the way, quiz me some more.

176
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
No problem.

177
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
Can the boat
carriage carry all this stuff?

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,960
No matter how much, it'll fit.

179
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
Be careful, Chen Xi.

180
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,920
I've read about so many places

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
in Yaoguang Mountain
to eat good food and have fun.

182
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,760
There's even a market

183
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,440
that only opens around the
Sunlight Festival at Yaoguang Mountain.

184
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,600
It's said to be a must-visit
spot for the immortal couples there.

185
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,880
Let's share a boat carriage together,

186
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,040
and I'll tell you all about it.

187
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Are you sure I need
you to tell me about it?

188
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,400
Right, I forgot you were
from Yaoguang Mountain.

189
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
She's taking my boat carriage.

190
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Immortal Ji, I know

191
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,640
you don't want to be apart
from her for a single moment,

192
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,520
but you should still
ask her what she wants.

193
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,120
Of course. But Fairy Zhang Tai,

194
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
I want to ask Ming Yi about…

195
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,760
some matters regarding artifacts.

196
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,480
That's right.

197
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,360
I've always been
very interested in artifacts.

198
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
And since, to the outside world,

199
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,640
she's still my wife,

200
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,120
traveling with me

201
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,840
will prevent anyone
from suspecting her identity, right?

202
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,640
That's hard to refute.

203
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,640
But I've seen through you.

204
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
I still want to share
a boat carriage with you.

205
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,560
-We'll get there in no time.
-Master,

206
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,760
we've finished moving the luggage.

207
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,360
Well done, Chen Xi.

208
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,360
At this tea gathering,
I count on you to fight for Jixing Abyss.

209
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,640
It will be fraught with danger,

210
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,400
so be careful, everyone.

211
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,320
I will pray for you in Jixing Abyss.

212
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,240
May stars and
blessings forever grace the Abyss.

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,320
YAOGUANG PALACE, YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
The first event of the tea gathering

215
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,920
is tomorrow's spiritual power test.

216
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,720
The spiritual power stone will assess

217
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,280
each warrior's spiritual power level

218
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,840
so the others can adjust
their strategies accordingly.

219
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
I heard the test would be
followed by a travelers' competition.

220
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,960
Warriors can't participate.

221
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
This year's prize is
a black lingzhi mushroom,

222
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
which is especially rare.

223
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
I really want to check it out.

224
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,800
You only think about having fun.

225
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,200
-We're here for business.
-I know.

226
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
Immortal Ji, what should we do next?

227
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Yan Xiao, Meng Yangqiu,

228
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
go to the warriors' base

229
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,600
and report the list
of warriors for the test.

230
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
Chen Xi,

231
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,720
come help me check
the artifacts we brought.

232
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,240
Yes, Immortal Ji.

233
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,200
Ming Yi.

234
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,200
No tasks for you for now. Get some rest.

235
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,920
Your Lordship, aren't
you worried you'll end up with nothing?

236
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
I gave her the Golden Millet Dream

237
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,800
to keep her alive,

238
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
not for anything else.

239
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,520
Hesitation suggests fear.

240
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,280
What I want is for her to choose me

241
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,120
despite the many difficulties.

242
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,280
But what if she doesn't dare?

243
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,120
She is Ming Xian.

244
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,640
What is there to fear?

245
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,000
She just needs time to understand.

246
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,520
-Then…
-Enough.

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,400
The competition begins tomorrow.

248
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,440
Don't you have somewhere to be?

249
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
Understood.

250
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,840
BORDER OF ZHUSHUI SPIRITUAL STATE

251
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,560
This man used to
be a warrior of our realm.

252
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,040
He made a mistake at
the Qingyun Two-Realm Tournament.

253
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,960
The Emperor of Zhushui

254
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,400
sentenced him to be bitten
by a fish monster in the stomach

255
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,400
and stripped him of his warrior status.

256
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,560
After that, he went completely mad.

257
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,880
How many more vagrants like this
are there?

258
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,200
A hundred and thirty-two.

259
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,160
That's still not enough
to make me more powerful.

260
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I'll think of another way.

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,840
Your Lordship…

262
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
Freshly baked pastries and buns!

263
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,520
Make way!

264
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,120
I don't know how
strong the other warriors are

265
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,240
at this tea gathering,

266
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,920
but we must not take things lightly.

267
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,640
What are you doing sneaking around?

268
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,800
I took the wrong path.

269
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
Stop right there!

270
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,080
It's all a misunderstanding!

271
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,000
They're fighting.

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,160
She's my friend.

273
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,640
I asked her to come find me.

274
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Why…

275
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
why are you here?

276
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Of course I came.

277
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,120
I wrote you so many letters,

278
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,160
but every time,
you replied so perfunctorily

279
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,760
with phrases like "got it" or "I see."

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,880
I…

281
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,280
I…

282
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
Don't tell me

283
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,520
you're married!

284
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,520
If you are, I'll definitely expose you.

285
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,760
It's not like that. Really.

286
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm just not good with words,

287
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,160
so I've been focusing on training,

288
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,600
hoping to win the Blessed Rain first

289
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,000
so I can give you a stable life.

290
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,760
That's the only reason?

291
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
Yes.

292
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,800
I knew it!

293
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,760
You like me!

294
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
Of course.

295
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,600
Preparing for the test
won't take too much time.

296
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,480
We rarely get
a chance to leave Jixing Abyss.

297
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,480
We should take this
opportunity to look around.

298
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,320
Come take a look, young immortal.

299
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,040
These artifacts are finely crafted.

300
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,120
Pick one you like. I'll buy it for you.

301
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
No merit, no reward.

302
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
Just choose one.

303
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,080
You helped Yangqiu
practice discernment earlier,

304
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,400
so you're half his master.

305
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Think of this as his tuition fee.
What do you say?

306
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,800
But…

307
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
No buts.

308
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,400
Pick whichever you like.

309
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,880
-All right, then I'll pick one.
-Go ahead.

310
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
The night market at
Yaoguang Mountain is always bustling.

311
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
I remember there was
a scallion pancake stall there.

312
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,840
I used to go every day.

313
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,920
Even the owner
remembered how I liked my pancake.

314
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
It's all thanks to
your seven consecutive victories

315
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,680
that Yaoguang Mountain is so prosperous.

316
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,880
I didn't realize until
I came to Jixing Abyss

317
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,040
that when some are laughing,

318
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
others are crying.

319
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,080
This one's really easy to keep alive.

320
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Sir, we'll leave these here.

321
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,440
Yaoguang Mountain truly is wonderful.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,720
When will Mangfu Swamp and Cangwu Hill
ever be this prosperous?

323
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,800
Even the artifacts at
the market are top-notch.

324
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,960
Yeah.
Once we finish our work and get paid,

325
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,560
we can buy new artifacts.

326
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,880
Let's take a look there.

327
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,480
Are you the younger brother of
Immortal Xu Yun from Jixing Abyss,

328
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,480
Chen Xi?

329
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
Chen Xi?

330
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,920
Wow,

331
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,440
you've grown so much in just two years!

332
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,640
Exactly!

333
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,840
Uncle Xiao, Uncle Tai!

334
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,520
You came to the tea
gathering this year too?

335
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

336
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,040
If you like this dagger,

337
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,720
I'll give it to you.

338
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,200
To be honest, we…

339
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,320
we can't afford it.

340
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,080
Our realms keep losing
at the Qingyun Tournament,

341
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,240
and we've been living in hardship.

342
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,680
If your brother hadn't
gifted us artifacts two years ago,

343
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,720
we probably wouldn't have
even qualified for the warrior selection.

344
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,240
That's true.

345
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,280
Since you're Chen Xi's friends,

346
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,720
you're my friends too.

347
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
I'll buy this dagger for you.

348
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,560
Thank you for your kindness,
but that won't be necessary.

349
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,800
Once we finish our work and get paid,

350
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,320
we'll buy one ourselves.

351
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,480
Then let me help you.

352
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
-No…
-No need.

353
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,640
That won't do.

354
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,880
You'll dirty your clothes.

355
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't worry about that.

356
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,240
With the Blessed Rain
unevenly distributed,

357
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,160
it's hard for the Lower Realms to rise up.

358
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,520
The Six Realms should help each other out.

359
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,320
We'll get the work done in no time.

360
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
Once we're done, food's on me.

361
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,720
Still thinking

362
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
about the warriors from
Mangfu Swamp and Cangwu Hill?

363
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,120
Yes.

364
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,520
When I was at Yaoguang Mountain,

365
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,440
I had no idea

366
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,640
that in the Lower Realms,

367
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,800
even the warriors struggled so much.

368
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,200
How hard life must be for ordinary people.

369
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,840
Where there are
victors, there must also be losers.

370
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
The Qingyun Tournament may seem fair,

371
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,840
but in reality,
it creates a vicious cycle.

372
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
The Lower Three Realms lack Blessed Rain

373
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,640
and suffer from a loss of talent.

374
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,840
As time goes on,

375
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,240
the gap just keeps growing wider,

376
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
and the beings in those realms

377
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,200
sink deeper into hardship.

378
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,320
The strong keep getting stronger.

379
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Whether Jixing Abyss or Yaoguang Mountain
takes first place,

380
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,280
it won't change the situation.

381
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,640
If only the rules of
the Qingyun Tournament

382
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,880
could be changed someday,

383
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,200
and the Blessed Rain
could be shared equally

384
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,120
among all Six Realms.

385
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,360
Why are you smiling?

386
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
I know, human nature is fickle.

387
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,480
Maybe I'll change my mind one day.

388
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm being too idealistic.

389
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm smiling because we,

390
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
who once fought against each
other at the Qingyun Tournament,

391
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,160
are now having this conversation.

392
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
But you're right.

393
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
If we don't dream,

394
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,600
that day will never come.

395
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,440
In truth, the beings of
the Lower Three Realms

396
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,280
don't care who wins first place at all.

397
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,480
All they want is the Blessed Rain,

398
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,200
enough to eat, and clothes

399
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
to keep warm.

400
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,360
When I was in the Sunken Abyss,

401
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I saw countless people who wanted to live

402
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
but had to twist
their own will to survive.

403
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,680
It wasn't their fault.

404
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,680
They just wanted

405
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,120
to live too badly.

406
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
You've gone through so much in the past.

407
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,840
Thank you

408
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,280
for holding on and surviving,

409
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,840
or I wouldn't have met you now.

410
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,280
You once said you had
a mark on your forehead.

411
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,640
I think

412
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,480
my mother planted it there

413
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
when I was still an infant.

414
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,280
It holds some vague memories of her.

415
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,960
I can't see her face clearly,

416
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,080
but she told me

417
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,000
this mark

418
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,600
was formed from her blood and mine.

419
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,640
Haven't you ever
thought about looking for her?

420
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,320
Of course I have.

421
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,680
When I was in the Sunken Abyss,

422
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,120
I imagined countless times

423
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,800
that they'd come looking for me.

424
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,120
But perhaps

425
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,520
they are no longer alive.

426
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,800
It doesn't matter anymore.

427
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,920
What matters is

428
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,480
that I had my master
who saved me and guided me.

429
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,040
I have Buxiu who respects me

430
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,440
and Granny Xun who cares for me.

431
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,920
And then there is you.

432
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,680
What about me?

433
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,880
You lied to me.

434
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,360
Ji Bozai, I…

435
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,040
I'll give you one more chance to say it.

436
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,080
You love me.

437
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,600
TEA GATHERING OF QINGYUN TOURNAMENT

438
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
-Yes.
-Right.

439
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,920
-Rest assured.
-All right.

440
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
Do you have faith in yourself?

441
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,960
The first event of the tea gathering

442
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,720
is tomorrow's spiritual power test.

443
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,400
The spiritual power stone will assess

444
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,800
each warrior's spiritual power level

445
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
so the others can adjust
their strategies accordingly.

446
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,000
But doesn't that mean
exposing one's own strength?

447
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,120
Yes, and no.

448
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,120
First up,

449
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,200
a warrior from Flowing Wave Gorge.

450
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,840
The Qingyun Tournament is fought in teams.

451
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,280
Within each team, there are
naturally warriors of varying strength.

452
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,400
Those with greater
power can choose to conceal it

453
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,760
and act

454
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
as hidden trump
cards during the actual match.

455
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,560
What if

456
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,080
everyone hides their strength?

457
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,240
Those who do are usually evenly
matched and rely on surprise tactics

458
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,560
to win.

459
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,160
But like Yaoguang Mountain
in the past, Zhushui Spiritual State

460
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
doesn't bother with that.

461
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
They send out their strongest warriors

462
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,640
to display their power

463
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,560
and crush the opponents'
will before the fight even begins.

464
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Next, a fighter from
Zhushui Spiritual State.

465
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
CHAO YAN, FOURTH PRINCE OF ZHUSHUI

466
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,200
Impressive.

467
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Indeed.

468
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,120
When Jixing Abyss was
still one of the Lower Realms,

469
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,960
our warriors, after seeing the strength
of Yaoguang Mountain's warriors

470
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,200
at the tea gathering, would expect defeat

471
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,560
before the fight even began.

472
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,360
Now, a warrior from Jixing Abyss.

473
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,680
He looks like a fool,

474
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
but his spiritual
power is surprisingly strong.

475
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,280
-Exactly.
-Right.

476
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,280
That's the warrior
without spiritual veins, right?

477
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,800
What's so special about him…

478
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,600
That he gets
to join the Qingyun Tournament?

479
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
I wonder.

480
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,720
I heard he had exceptional healing skills.

481
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,800
The Empress of Jixing
really does have an eye for talent.

482
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,520
True,
or she never would've discovered Ji Bozai.

483
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,160
That kid's impressive.

484
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,280
Yes.

485
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,520
-He's got real potential.
-He reminds me of Ming Xian

486
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,560
back in the day.

487
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,520
Indeed.

488
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm confident.

489
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
We've got Immortal Ji

490
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,480
and Master Ming Yi,
who can forge all kinds of artifacts.

491
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,760
Even so, don't get cocky.

492
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,520
Overconfidence leads to defeat.
Remember that.

493
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,280
Oh my.

494
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,800
He's incredible.

495
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
-Remarkable indeed.
-Impressive!

496
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,360
-Amazing!
-Wonderful!

497
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,800
-Excellent!
-Impressive!

498
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,600
So impressive.

499
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,600
As expected of Immortal Ji!

500
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,360
-Impressive!
-Indeed.

501
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,480
Whoever faces him is doomed.

502
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,640
The Crown Prince of
Yaoguang Mountain is here!

503
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

504
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,320
Now that Ming Xin is the Crown Prince,

505
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,520
he sure makes quite an entrance.

506
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,120
Yeah, no kidding.

507
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,040
What's he showing off for?

508
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,560
He lost miserably last year.

509
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,160
He's been competing for years,
but his strength is just average.

510
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
Exactly.

511
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,520
-Amazing, Your Highness!
-Truly incredible.

512
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
-That was impressive.
-Yes.

513
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,600
Such power!

514
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,160
What kind of elixir did
he take to get that strong?

515
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,840
-Right.
-Oh my.

516
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,200
Unbelievable!

517
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,360
Ming Xin is about to
reach the Transcendent Stage?

518
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
How is that possible?

519
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,240
Even his mother, Lady Meng, once said

520
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,560
he didn't have the talent
to reach such a level.

521
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Perhaps

522
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,360
someone's helping him.

523
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,199
Ming Xin acted
strangely at the tea gathering.

524
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,920
It seems he has
already realized who you are.

525
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,920
From the way
he looked at me, I think he has.

526
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,840
But right now, what matters most

527
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,719
is the travelers' competition tonight.

528
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,600
I must win the black lingzhi mushroom
to bring Twenty-Seven back.

529
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,679
Due to the rules,

530
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,800
as a warrior, I can't compete,

531
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,360
and you shouldn't show yourself either,

532
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,159
or Ming Xin might get suspicious.

533
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,520
So, I want to ask Buxiu to help.

534
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,960
So the great
Warrior Goddess already has a plan?

535
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,960
In that case,

536
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
let's restore our heart imprints first.

537
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,920
If Ming Xin makes a move
and you're in danger,

538
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,840
I'll be able to reach you in time.

539
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,760
You drive a hard bargain, don't you?

540
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,080
Ming Yi, what happened to your hand?

541
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,920
Nothing.

542
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,760
Either way, we should
restore our heart imprints.

543
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,200
You're just taking advantage
of the fact that our names are still

544
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,840
on the Marriage Stone.
Did I agree to do this?

545
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
So what if you didn't?
I got what I wanted.

546
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,800
Smarty-pants.

547
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,920
-Incredible!
-How many has he beaten now?

548
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,560
This immortal has already defeated

549
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,760
725 opponents

550
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,440
without a single loss.

551
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,360
That many?

552
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Does anyone else want to challenge him?

553
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,720
Anyone?

554
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
If no one can defeat him,

555
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,680
the prize will go to this immortal.

556
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,560
I'll be taking it, then.

557
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,480
Please.

558
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,240
-Where did they go?
-They vanished!

559
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
The black lingzhi mushroom is gone too!

560
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,920
-It's really gone!
-The black lingzhi mushroom is gone too!

561
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah, what happened?

562
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
Just as Your Lordship
and Fairy Ming Yi predicted,

563
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,240
the lingzhi mushroom disappeared.

564
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,000
Someone attacked, and Ming Yi was taken.

565
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120
It must have been Ming Xin.

566
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,840
Your Lordship,
aren't you going to do anything?

567
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,720
She can handle it.

568
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,440
I have faith in her.

569
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,360
Ming Xian.

570
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,680
For your cat to come back to life,

571
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,080
you'll need a black lingzhi mushroom.

572
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,640
I knew you'd bite the hook

573
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,520
with this as the bait.

574
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,240
Let's see

575
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,960
if you have what
it takes to snatch it from me.

576
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,880
Back then, you were
obsessed with forbidden arts

577
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,760
and drew countless
designs for magical artifacts.

578
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,360
When the Empress
found out, she confiscated them.

579
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,120
Now that I've gone through them,

580
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,080
I must say, they're quite useful.

581
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,120
Perfect for dealing with you,

582
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,320
Ming Xian.

583
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,160
What's that supposed to mean?

584
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,200
Trying to make me think
my mother is behind all this?

585
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,400
You think such cheap tricks
would work on me?

586
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,640
Of course the Empress wouldn't harm you.

587
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,680
You're her most useful pawn.

588
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,680
What dark spell did she use back then

589
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,280
to turn you into a man?

590
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,840
Even your face

591
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,280
looked completely different.

592
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,880
The Crown Prince of
Yaoguang, whom I hated for so many years,

593
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,760
turns out to be a woman.

594
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,480
How revolting.

595
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,960
It's a pity you don't know

596
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,320
how I gave you the Heavenly Grief.

597
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,920
I slipped it into the scallion pancake

598
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,120
the Empress herself made for
you before the Qingyun Tournament.

599
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,880
You're insane!

600
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,320
How dare you show up at the tea gathering

601
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,080
with people from Jixing Abyss, our enemy?

602
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,720
Once I bring you to that person…

603
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,120
Spiritual power from
Zhushui Spiritual State?

604
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,200
Did the Emperor of Zhushui give it to you?

605
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,360
No wonder your power
surged at the tea gathering.

606
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,440
Who are you taking me to?

607
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,400
The Emperor of Zhushui?

608
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,440
So you were faking it all along!
