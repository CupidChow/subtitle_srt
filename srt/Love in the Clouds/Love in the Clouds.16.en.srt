1
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,000
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
You don't need to spend
any spiritual power on me.

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
It's not worth it.

4
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
I used Ruo Shui.

5
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
I used her

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,199
to free myself from my own hatred.

7
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Next, I only thought
about getting rid of her.

8
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
I thought

9
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
I had shown enough goodwill

10
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
as long as I sent her away.

11
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
I never cared about her life at all.

12
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,160
That's not it.

13
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
It's not like that.

14
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,680
Ji Bozai.

15
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,440
The people

16
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Mu Qibai used to
nurture the netherbeast army

17
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,280
were captured and
thrown into the Sunken Abyss alongside me.

18
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,440
Most of them were old
people, women, and children.

19
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,720
There…

20
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,760
There were even people younger than me.

21
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
They did not stand a chance.

22
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,240
All of them were also innocent.

23
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,440
However, they were
branded as criminals wrongfully.

24
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
Then,

25
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,000
they even became
food for the netherbeast army.

26
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
If…

27
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,440
If I had not exposed Mu Qibai,

28
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
would they and Ruo Shui

29
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,840
still be alive?

30
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,640
But…

31
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,079
But…

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
But they are dead.

33
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,680
It's all my fault.

34
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,760
-It's all my fault.
-That's not it.

35
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,080
You can't blame yourself for their deaths.

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,760
This isn't your fault.

37
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,640
I found the Golden Millet Dream.

38
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,560
However, he put a blood seal on it.

39
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
I couldn't get it.

40
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,280
A blood seal?

41
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,320
Then, he's the only one who can undo it.

42
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,000
It seems like
Ji Bozai is still wary of you.

43
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,240
Then, we…

44
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Ming Yi, why are you crying?

45
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
Twenty-Seven.

46
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,120
I thought I would be happy

47
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,640
when I found the Golden Millet Dream.

48
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
I should feel lucky

49
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,000
that I am able to find it here.

50
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
But…

51
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,680
That's enough from me. Twenty-Seven.

52
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,640
Right now, there's one thing we must do.

53
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,240
Destroy the netherbeast army
and deal with Mu Qibai, right?

54
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,200
What about you?

55
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,560
We can steal the Golden Millet Dream
and cure you first.

56
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,440
Then, we'll have a greater chance
of winning. Am I right?

57
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
Twenty-Seven,

58
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
if you were in my shoes,

59
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,600
who would you choose?

60
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,320
A bad person who is alive
or a good person who is dead?

61
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Ming Yi,

62
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,160
I've always wanted you
to become a good person who's immortal.

63
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
What do you mean by that?
You are a good cat who's immortal.

64
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,640
When all your teeth fall off,
you won't be able to eat any anchovies.

65
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,280
Are you going to help me?

66
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,560
Think about it carefully.

67
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,960
You said yes so easily.

68
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,520
You lost control of the Sunken Abyss.

69
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,000
It is only temporary.

70
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,040
On the surface, Sunken Abyss
has been sealed off by Judgment Hall,

71
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
but no one knows

72
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,560
that the Soul-Consuming Tree
is connected to it.

73
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,040
I've been staying in
my place to feed the netherbeasts

74
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,680
for a few days.

75
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,520
So, there's no need to be anxious.

76
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,960
We will surely succeed in ten more days.

77
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,400
Lord Hanfeng, you must be mistaken.

78
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,240
You should feel anxious, not us.

79
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
If the Sunken Abyss
isn't suitable for hatching netherbeasts,

80
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,920
there is no opportunity.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,640
I was careless.

82
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,840
All of this happened because of Ji Bozai.

83
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
I came here this time
for Ji Bozai as well.

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,440
He does possess the Golden Millet Dream?

85
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,120
Ji Bozai eliminated two
of my subordinates with his clever tricks.

86
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,040
He did everything to avenge Bo Yulan.

87
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,520
He must have
a close relationship with the Bo clan.

88
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,960
You didn't answer my question directly.

89
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
It seems like you really don't know
where the Golden Millet Dream is.

90
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,120
I have reasons to suspect

91
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,080
that you are also trying
to protect Ji Bozai

92
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,280
so he can win
the Qingyun Tournament one day

93
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
and become the best
warrior of the Six Realms.

94
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
That way, the Jixing Abyss can leave
Zhushui Spiritual State for good.

95
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm loyal to Zhushui Spiritual State.

96
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,640
Even if you're not,
your efforts are futile.

97
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
No one

98
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,160
can alter the results
of the Qingyun Tournament.

99
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,240
Does Ji Bozai know
about the netherbeast army?

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Not yet.

101
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,520
Jixing Abyss is such a terrible place.

102
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,320
Even the boat
carriage can't move smoothly.

103
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Shao Qun.

104
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,440
Maybe Lord Hanfeng can show us
how to pilot it properly.

105
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
Sure.

106
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,200
In less than ten days,
the netherbeast army will be ready.

107
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,840
We don't have much time left.

108
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,480
Everyone else thinks
the Sunken Abyss guarded by Judgment Hall

109
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,280
is where criminal immortals
who did something atrocious get punished.

110
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,080
However, this place
is full of poisonous miasma.

111
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,080
No one can set foot in it.

112
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,920
Mu Qibai wanted to use
this place to make medicine,

113
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,640
but because
he lacked the required formula,

114
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,040
he only made Heavenly Grief instead.

115
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,440
By using the Soul-Consuming Tree,
he opened a shortcut to the Sunken Abyss

116
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,040
and turned it into his own medicine mill.

117
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,280
A place full of miasma
is not just suitable for making medicine,

118
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,520
but also for raising netherbeasts.

119
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,880
That was why Mu Qibai
chose this place to hatch netherbeasts

120
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,880
and captured all you innocent people
to work for him.

121
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,600
Their operational method
has never changed.

122
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,720
They capture orphans,
widows, old people, and disabled people

123
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,720
and send them to the Sunken Abyss.

124
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,040
If they die, they die.

125
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
No one will fight for them.

126
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,800
Therefore, they have been searching
for people who are the same as me.

127
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,120
People who have no one to
care about whether they live or die

128
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,960
because people like us

129
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,200
are the most suitable to be used

130
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,120
in their opinion.

131
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,280
Ming Yi, you said
if we wanted to eliminate

132
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,320
the nascent netherbeast army,

133
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,680
we could offer
ourselves as netherbeast vessels

134
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,520
to absorb the netherbeast core
and refine them.

135
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Tell me.

136
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,600
How do I do this?

137
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,280
To use this skill,

138
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,240
you need a powerful person
to serve as a netherbeast vessel.

139
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,280
Leave this to me.
You are the warrior of Jixing Abyss.

140
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
Nothing can go wrong.

141
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,280
Since I've promised you,
I'm willing to become the vessel.

142
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,400
You said it'd only be successful
with someone powerful.

143
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,960
-I…
-I've seen you use a spell.

144
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,320
You have limited spiritual power.

145
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,280
Even if you have spiritual veins,
you still won't succeed.

146
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,520
That is the reason
why I must become the vessel

147
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,120
so our strongest fighter can be available.

148
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,880
If something happens to you,
Mu Qibai will act immediately.

149
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,680
If we lose you, how can we defeat
him and the person behind?

150
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,600
How can I be hurt from being a vessel?

151
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,760
-But you…
-It's decided.

152
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,480
There are three steps
before you become a netherbeast vessel.

153
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,120
The further you get,
the more dangerous it is.

154
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,080
Step one, cultivate your spiritual
powers to strengthen your own core.

155
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,440
Step two, absorb the netherbeasts
to your core remotely

156
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,440
and you'll have
a netherbeast core inside you.

157
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,280
Step three, use yourself as a vessel

158
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,240
to contain the netherbeast core
and refine it.

159
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,800
This is the first stage.

160
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,840
You will exhaust all your spiritual power
and feel extremely weak.

161
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,360
Remember not to leave Wugui Sea.

162
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,040
Is Ji Bozai really
using himself as a vessel?

163
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,320
Does he not trust you
or not want you to be hurt?

164
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,800
He is currently cultivating
in seclusion in the Spirit Well.

165
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
However, he has never said anything to me.

166
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,400
Instead of not trusting me,

167
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,400
it's more probable to say
that he doesn't want to see me hurt.

168
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
What he thinks of me now isn't important.

169
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,640
He must first pass the first stage.

170
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,720
This medicinal powder
can treat the wound on his hand.

171
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,080
I still need to make
some nourishing medicine

172
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,600
to maintain
his spiritual power at its strongest.

173
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
That's what we can do now.

174
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
Chief, you're still not going back?
It's late.

175
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,880
Everyone else has left.

176
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,360
You may go back.
I'll leave after I review this.

177
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
Yes.

178
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,200
It has been a long time,
my dear younger brother.

179
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,000
You've been doing very well,
and things have been getting better.

180
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,280
It's not worth it to come here…

181
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
SITU LING,
CHIEF OF JUDGMENT HALL IN JIXING ABYSS

182
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,160
…especially for me.

183
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,280
CHAO YUAN,
THIRD PRINCE OF ZHUSHUI SPIRITUAL STATE

184
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,840
There must be
a more important reason, right?

185
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,120
It seems like
you'll never ever have spiritual veins.

186
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,240
You've been hiding
in Jixing Abyss for so long

187
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,599
yet you still haven't found
the Golden Millet Dream.

188
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,200
You're destined to be mediocre.

189
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,920
Since I'm here,
you can forget about searching for it.

190
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,680
You've not changed at all.

191
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,880
You only target people weaker than you.

192
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,520
Exactly. You are the weaker one.

193
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,960
When it comes to this,
you've not changed as well.

194
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,440
CLARITY OF MIND, RIGHTEOUSNESS OF SPIRIT

195
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,880
You're still the same.

196
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,920
So boring.

197
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,680
Fuyue. I'm fine now.

198
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,560
When Your Lordship
finds the Golden Millet Dream

199
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,000
and gets your spiritual veins,

200
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,200
you will no longer be
humiliated in such a way.

201
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,040
Fuyue, like I said,

202
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,720
I don't want
the Golden Millet Dream anymore.

203
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,440
Your Lordship,
can you prioritize yourself?

204
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
Is love so important?

205
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,720
Are you going to give up what you want
and what you hate in life

206
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,320
for a woman?

207
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,640
I've been keeping an eye
on Mu Qibai for you for so long

208
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
and we finally have some progress now.

209
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,520
Are you really going to give
the Golden Millet Dream to someone else?

210
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,560
What progress? Do you have news
of the Golden Millet Dream?

211
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,920
Mu Qibai searched the whole Wugui Sea
and couldn't find the Golden Millet Dream.

212
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
I'm guessing

213
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,240
that perhaps Ji Bozai
can create a real Spirit Well

214
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,880
that only he can enter.

215
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,720
He then hid it in the well.

216
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,760
Spirit Well?

217
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
Your Lordship wants to
use the Golden Millet Dream

218
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
to save Ming Yi,

219
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,560
but you've been exposed
in the divine capital.

220
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,040
Without spiritual veins,
do you think they will let you live?

221
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,800
Your Lordship, what about the things
you've always wanted to do?

222
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,760
I can't bear to see you do this
for someone else.

223
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,880
But

224
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,320
there's only one Golden Millet Dream.

225
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,280
I can live without spiritual veins.

226
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,800
But Ming Yi will die without a cure.

227
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,600
Then…

228
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,080
can you do it for me?

229
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
It takes a lot of effort to capture you.

230
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,800
I heard the more scared a fox is,

231
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,000
the shinier its pelt.

232
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,320
If I want to make a pelt out of you,

233
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,640
I must make you nervous
to sharpen the color.

234
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Let's play a game.

235
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,000
This game will put me in danger?

236
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
How thrilling.

237
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,000
Your shamelessness

238
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,480
always reminds me of someone I hate.

239
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,640
Chao Yu.

240
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,120
Your whip is not that good.

241
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,520
I've healed in less than three days.

242
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,280
Thanks to me, even a useless person
like you with no spiritual veins

243
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,800
has gotten cocky.

244
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,960
You're more resistant to whips now.

245
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,120
You have no spiritual veins
yet you learned something new.

246
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
Isn't that good?

247
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,160
Are you hurt?

248
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,520
Why didn't you run?

249
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
Dumb fox.

250
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,360
If you are doing this to pity me,
stop crying.

251
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,640
When I can change all of this

252
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,600
and celebrate my victory one day,

253
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,920
you may cry.

254
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,240
But…

255
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,720
Are you trying to say that I'm weak now?

256
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,520
I know that.

257
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm still far too weak now,
but someone once told me

258
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,040
that if I could think about it,

259
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,960
I could make it happen.

260
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,240
It's the same.

261
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,400
Think about it first and live on.

262
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,640
Nothing can stop us in the future.

263
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,160
Even if you're just a little fox.

264
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,560
You are fond of Ming Yi,

265
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,200
but Your Lordship's life is more important
than anything else to me.

266
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,040
In the past, I'd do anything you asked.

267
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,840
But this time,
for the first time in my life,

268
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,200
I hope you won't get what you want.

269
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Your Lordship, do you know?

270
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,240
I've never had any precious memories.

271
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,320
I was just a wild fox who
only wanted to survive to the next day.

272
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,920
Then, that day came.

273
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,720
I have someone I cherish.

274
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,760
I have important memories.

275
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,400
Because of you, I finally realized
the purpose of living a long life.

276
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
Can you do it for me?

277
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,960
Sorry, I…

278
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
Your Lordship,
if you insist on doing this,

279
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,480
hide your tracks at least
and do not let them discover you again.

280
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,800
I will also think of a way
to verify if Ji Bozai

281
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
has created a real Spirit Well.

282
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,280
I shouldn't disturb his rest.

283
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Are you looking for me?

284
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
It's nothing important.

285
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,440
I figured you should be weak
after strengthening your core.

286
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
So, I brewed some medicine.

287
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,880
But it's okay. Aren't you…

288
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,520
So, can I appreciate your goodwill or not?

289
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,840
Didn't you say
you don't take food from outsiders?

290
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,880
You're still talking about this?

291
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,120
If I were someone else,

292
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,680
he would think
that you were trying to poison him,

293
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,240
but you changed your mind
because you had a moment of kindness.

294
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
And right now,

295
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,280
you are trying to talk your way out.

296
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,240
Great. You shouldn't drink this.

297
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
It's time to begin the second step.

298
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,440
You need to use a Teleportation Array
to send your core to the Sunken Abyss

299
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
and absorb the primordial
spirits of all netherbeasts.

300
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
However, this step will
expose the presence of the spellcaster.

301
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,280
Please teleport your core back
as quickly as possible.

302
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,280
Otherwise, everything will be in vain.

303
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,960
I sacrifice myself
to summon the righteous aura.

304
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,920
Demons and evil spirits,

305
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,320
seal.

306
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,440
This way.

307
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
Lord Jingxi, please take a look.

308
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,640
In three more days,
the netherbeast army will be created.

309
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,200
The number and power of the netherbeasts

310
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,520
are on par with those
raised by the Spiritual Veins Fairies.

311
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,960
I've been complaining

312
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,240
that Jixing Abyss is a harsh
and run-down place.

313
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,760
However, this terrible place
actually has its use.

314
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
What?

315
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
How come all
the netherbeast cores have been absorbed?

316
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,520
This is…

317
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
Ji Bozai.

318
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,640
Yes.

319
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,000
Ji Bozai. It must be him.

320
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,880
-It must be Ji Bozai.
-Useless!

321
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,760
I didn't know Ji Bozai knew
the Netherbeast Refining Skill.

322
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,640
Otherwise, I would've taken precautions.

323
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,240
Lord Jingxi.

324
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,480
I shouldn't expect
anything out of this place at all.

325
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,880
A barren place that only produces trash!

326
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,000
Search everywhere and get me Ji Bozai!

327
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,120
JADE RABBIT HALL

328
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,480
GUDIAO

329
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,080
Your Highness, you should rest.

330
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,080
The Venerable of Shouhua Academy
is not just a pretty trophy.

331
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,160
I must remember everything
about the Qingyun Tournament.

332
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,400
You have grown up, Your Highness.

333
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,600
I'm just afraid of losing again.

334
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,040
Without the Blessed Rain,
the plants of Jixing Abyss will look dull.

335
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,680
Xiuyun.

336
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,000
I feel anxious often.

337
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,160
Do you think
the Blessing Flower Mother left behind

338
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,880
will wilt again?

339
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
Don't worry, Your Highness.

340
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,840
Immortal Yanxian's method is useful.

341
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,360
For so many years in the past,

342
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,920
we've not had Blessed Rain
yet it still blooms just fine.

343
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
Gentlemen.

344
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,960
We've been training day and night,
yet the most important warrior,

345
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,520
Ji Bozai, has not appeared for days
and abandoned Shouhua Academy.

346
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
Why should we train anymore?

347
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,680
What are we giving our lives for?

348
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,160
-Yes.
-That's right.

349
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
For what?

350
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
Qingyun Tournament is a team battle.

351
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,800
We need a leader
who can lead the whole situation.

352
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,120
Right now,

353
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,280
someone like Ji Bozai
has been chosen as a warrior

354
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,800
and is cherished by Her Highness.

355
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Why should we still care?

356
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,120
All of us should stop training!

357
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,679
Sun Liao is right.

358
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,600
If Ji Bozai doesn't show himself,
he should not become a warrior.

359
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,880
That's right. If he's not here,
there's no need for us to train anymore.

360
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,520
-Yes. Why are we still training?
-Don't say that.

361
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Your Highness, Sun Liao
is causing trouble at Shouhua Academy.

362
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,719
Who said you can skip training
if Immortal Ji isn't here?

363
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,760
Immortal Ji is a warrior

364
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,600
but he is not the only one
in Shouhua Academy.

365
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,719
If he alone can decide

366
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
if we win or lose
in the Qingyun Tournament,

367
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,280
that means Jixing Abyss
hasn't really become stronger.

368
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,360
Gentlemen, who's right?

369
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,960
Who's right?

370
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,480
Being loud doesn't mean you're right.

371
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,639
I think Immortal Sun Liao is right.

372
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,520
As a warrior, Ji Bozai is indifferent
about Shouhua Academy.

373
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,360
He doesn't care about Jixing Abyss at all.

374
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,720
-Yes. Her Highness is spoiling him.
-He's right.

375
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,560
If Lord Hanfeng manages Shouhua Academy,
this will never happen.

376
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,560
Exactly.

377
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,720
To Ji Bozai, fighting in
the Qingyun Tournament as a warrior

378
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,560
is just a way for him
to get rid of his criminal status.

379
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,800
Is that Ji Bozai's aim?

380
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,560
No wonder.

381
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,040
I've not been able to understand
why Ji Bozai won't come to train.

382
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,520
What you said
has enlightened me, Immortal Sun Liao.

383
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,480
Someone like him is not fit to become
a warrior of Shouhua Academy.

384
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
-Yes.
-Exactly.

385
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,480
-That's right.
-He's not worthy.

386
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,480
Why don't we elect another warrior?

387
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,680
-What?
-Another warrior?

388
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,640
But who?

389
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,920
It is an important position.

390
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,040
-We must choose the right person.
-Yes.

391
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,480
I think Immortal Sun Liao
is a good choice.

392
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
-Me?
-Your Highness.

393
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,080
You must be joking.

394
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,000
As the Venerable of Shouhua Academy,
I don't joke about this.

395
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,680
Immortal Sun Liao participated
in the last Qingyun Tournament.

396
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,720
He has more experience
compared to other people.

397
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
Moreover,

398
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,520
whether it's the warrior selection

399
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
or the training in Shouhua Academy,

400
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
Immortal Sun Liao has been very proactive
and has an excellent attitude.

401
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,640
I hereby declare that Ji Bozai
is stripped of his title of a warrior.

402
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,040
Just like that?

403
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,480
-We'll lose for sure.
-Exactly.

404
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,600
-She won't show mercy at all.
-His title is stripped?

405
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,680
-I'll elect Immortal Sun Liao
-Her Highness has her reasons.

406
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,600
-as Shouhua Academy's warrior.
-Yes.

407
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Really?

408
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,040
-Great! I support Immortal Sun!
-I support Immortal Sun too!

409
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,920
-I…
-Sun Liao?

410
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,800
-Right. Is he capable?
-Can he do it?

411
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
What's going on?

412
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,280
Why do I think he's unreliable?

413
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

414
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Thank you.

415
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,200
I was being short-sighted
and only had eyes for Ji Bozai.

416
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,400
Right now,

417
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,920
you are the more heroic one

418
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,720
who should carry the mantle of a warrior.

419
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Ji Bozai isn't the best choice
but Sun Liao…

420
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,920
So we caused this ruckus
just to help Sun Liao instead.

421
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,080
-Yes.
-He's unworthy.

422
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,520
Immortal Sun Liao,
please lead others in their training.

423
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,920
If you do well,

424
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,040
I will tell Father.

425
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,600
Of course.

426
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,760
Your Highness.

427
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,840
I made you the warrior

428
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,080
and you're still
addressing me as Your Highness?

429
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,000
Shouldn't you call me the Venerable?

430
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,800
Why did Tianji do this?

431
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,720
No.

432
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,880
This is the best

433
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,680
and the most efficient solution.

434
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,320
Yes, Venerable.

435
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,400
Sun Liao is so arrogant
yet Tianji still promoted him.

436
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,040
How humiliating.

437
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
Is your pride that important?

438
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,920
It's fine as long as
her goal can be achieved.

439
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,960
Deceit, lies, and empty promises.

440
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,520
Instead of protecting Ji Bozai,

441
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,440
it's better to make Sun Liao
the new target.

442
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,760
Lord Hanfeng, why are you looking for me?

443
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,560
What's wrong with this tree?

444
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,200
It was healthy at first.

445
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,640
It was surprisingly fragile.

446
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,080
I took my eyes off it for a while
and it wilted in one night.

447
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,320
Lord Hanfeng, you've
been taking care of it meticulously.

448
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,800
I was careless.

449
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Lord Hanfeng, don't be upset.

450
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,520
Lord Hanfeng,
I can bring you some of the best wine.

451
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,440
It has Zhaocui Dew added to it,
which is endemic to Jixing Abyss.

452
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,280
It tastes completely different.

453
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,320
Endemic to Jixing Abyss?

454
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,720
Yes. Jixing Abyss is the only place
among the Six Realms that has it.

455
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,120
The flower looks identical to a weed

456
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,280
but on the full moon's night,

457
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,880
the world's purest dew
will be condensed on the flower.

458
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,120
I shouldn't expect
anything out of this place at all.

459
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,800
A barren place that only produces trash!

460
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,640
These are the items cleared
from the warehouse next door.

461
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,640
There's not much use to them.

462
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,080
How do you want to
deal with them, Your Lordship?

463
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,640
Lord Hanfeng, this is…

464
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,080
I almost forgot.

465
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,480
-Tianji gave this to me.
-Tianji?

466
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,720
That was a long time ago.

467
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,440
During those few years,

468
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,720
we still had a close relationship.

469
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,360
Tianji loved sweet food.

470
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,920
She wouldn't even throw away a candy box.

471
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,040
She didn't want the emperor to find out
so she asked me to keep it for her.

472
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,280
That is because Tianji
saw you as her support.

473
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,920
So, when I saw her working with Ji Bozai,
don't you think that'd make me upset?

474
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,240
Not at all. She was just all talk.

475
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,360
She only thought
Ji Bozai looked mighty as a warrior.

476
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
Tianji's feeling for Ji Bozai…

477
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,720
That's impossible. She doesn't like him.

478
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,920
That makes me even more upset.

479
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,640
The little girl
who came to me for protection

480
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,200
is nowhere to be seen now.

481
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,760
What will happen to her in the future?

482
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,320
I will protect Tianji.

483
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,280
I won't let her get hurt at all.

484
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,560
Even I can't say that confidently.

485
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,120
Why would you not be confident?

486
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,040
Ji Bozai.

487
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,280
Who in Jixing Abyss
knows about Ji Bozai's past?

488
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,280
How come a criminal like him
has spiritual veins?

489
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,320
This alone is concerning,

490
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,880
let alone the changes
that were brought to Jixing Abyss

491
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,040
after he defeated
Yaoguang Mountain and rose to fame.

492
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,680
Is that so?

493
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,640
Do you know?

494
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,360
There were netherbeasts
in Jixing Abyss not too long ago.

495
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,120
I thought someone was making up rumors.

496
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,080
It was actually true?

497
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,080
I am investigating the truth.

498
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,120
So, can you

499
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
help me and Tianji
clear all the dangerous obstacles?
