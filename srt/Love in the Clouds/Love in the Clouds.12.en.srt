1
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,920
TWO MONTHS AGO, JIXING ABYSS

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,520
Your Lordship.

4
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,720
Your Lordship, you're finally here.

5
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,920
Has it been a smooth journey?

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
Fuyue. Are you here to pick me up?

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
Why?

8
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,160
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,120
And you can no longer recognize me?

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,120
Fuyue.

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,039
You look different now after all this time
being a mole here.

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,920
Do I look like an ordinary fairy now?

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,280
Well, I'm from the Yousu Fox Tribe.

14
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
If I turned myself into some other form,

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,960
you would fail to recognize me at all.

16
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
You're nothing but brilliant.

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,800
No one would be able to recognize you.

18
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,560
Oh, right.

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,120
The identity you're using
has caused you much inconvenience.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
So I've found you a spot

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,400
where you can cultivate
the Thousand Insect Spell.

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,000
For real?

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Take me there at once.

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
There are many blue butterflies there.

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm sure it will boost your skills.

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,280
Sometimes I truly envy
those carefree butterflies.

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,240
They fly wherever they like.

28
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,360
Wherever you are, I'll be there.

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,520
Where have you been, Your Lordship?

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
What took you so long?

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
I was sending Ming Yi the medicine.

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
I knew it.

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
Yesterday, all
the fairies from Moonlit Blossoms

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,600
attended Ming Yi and Ji Bozai's wedding.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,600
I bet you knew about that too.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Why did you keep it from me?

37
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,000
I wouldn't want to upset you.

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
Ming Yi has had the Heavenly Grief.

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Heavenly Grief?

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,680
So I have to save her.

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
I must save her.

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,800
Lend me a hand, Fuyue.

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Don't you get it, Your Lordship?

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,160
You have no spiritual veins.

45
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,560
That's why your father has despised you.

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,520
That's why
you're bullied by your brothers.

47
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,640
All this while, it's your dream
to join the Qingyun Tournament

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
and become a warrior.

49
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,160
Yet you need spiritual veins
to make that happen.

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,480
Therefore, I came
all the way here with you

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
to find the Golden Millet Dream.

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,880
Now you're telling me
that you want to save a woman.

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,480
That means you're giving up
on the Golden Millet Dream to help her.

54
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,400
However,

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,320
I wanted to become a warrior

56
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
because of her.

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,760
I was born without spiritual veins.

58
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
And I've suffered
all kinds of humiliation.

59
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,480
It wasn't until her appearance

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,320
that I saw the only light

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
in my life.

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
Why is Ming Xian's sleeve badge with you?

63
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,240
Don't even think about joining
the Qingyun Tournament like he does.

64
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,000
Did you know?

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Ming Xian is
the Warrior God with spiritual veins.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Want to be like him?

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,040
Dream on!

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
I've had enough of hitting him. Let's go.

69
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
-Come on.
-Let's go.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,960
She made me look forward to the future.

71
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,040
That gave birth to
my thought of becoming a warrior.

72
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
A warrior like her.

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,680
Sadly, fate played its cruel hand.

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,560
She's had the Heavenly Grief
and ended up here.

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,520
To me, I've had that unattainable dream
because of her.

76
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I can give up on it for her.

77
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,400
Her life… is above mine.

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
Also, did you know, Fuyue?

79
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm sure Ming Yi has been with Ji Bozai
because of the Golden Millet Dream.

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,680
That wedding of theirs
was nothing but a show.

81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,920
There's certainly nothing between them.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
But we're talking about Ming Xian.

83
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,800
Would she mind
having a relationship with Ji Bozai?

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,800
In order to achieve her goal,
I bet she wouldn't.

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
You should leave.

86
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,680
Your Lordship, you ever claimed

87
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,800
that you admire Ming Yi,
and you'd like to repay her kindness.

88
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Now that things have come to this point,

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
do you still see it that way?

90
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
-Your Lordship.
-Your Lordship.

91
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Why were you looking for me?

92
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
You've just had your wedding.

93
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,520
The loving
newlyweds rise late in the morning.

94
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,960
Yesterday, you even…

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
You were injured.

96
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
-Eat something to nourish yourself.
-Morning?

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
It's already evening.

98
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
The stars are showing soon.

99
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
Your Lordship.

100
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,160
When it comes to weddings in Jixing Abyss,
according to tradition,

101
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,120
lovers must first pick
an auspicious day and a blessed land.

102
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,320
They then make a wish to the starlight,
to stay together for life.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,040
If the Radiant Spirit
scatters starlight upon them,

104
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,640
that's the greatest blessing of all.

105
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,799
After that,
under the witness of the mandarin ducks,

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,400
they carve their names
upon the Marriage Stone.

107
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,200
Theirs is a fake marriage.

108
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,320
His Lordship will
definitely divorce Ming Yi. Right?

109
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,720
What's with all those inauspicious words?

110
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,480
Your Lordship, it's easy to divorce one.

111
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,800
Yet a failed relationship
is deemed regrettable

112
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,200
in the Seven Heavens.

113
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,880
I can see that Ming Yi is sincere to you.

114
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,040
Sincerity is rare these days.

115
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
Those out there
seem to be respectful to you.

116
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,480
They're either after your money,
or they're trying to use you.

117
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,520
Some don't mean well
and covet the Golden Millet Dream.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Neither of us has never coveted that.

119
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,080
Besides, what's with sincerity?

120
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,840
What's the big deal with sincerity?

121
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,040
Of course it's rare to come by.

122
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
In the entire Six Realms,

123
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,960
only you, me, and Ming Yi
are sincere to His Lordship.

124
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,320
Do you think you can be with him forever?

125
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,440
Why not? Of course I want to
be with His Lordship forever.

126
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,640
You silly dragon. You just can't stop
spouting nonsense, huh?

127
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,360
Your Lordship, you've wasted 21 years

128
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,600
after being harmed
by those baddies of Sunken Abyss.

129
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,880
Yes, you want to avenge your master.

130
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,720
But life is more than taking revenge.

131
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Ming Yi is someone with whom
you can stand by through weal and woe.

132
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,120
So you must not let her go.

133
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
Granny Xun.

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,520
Can't three of us
stand by each other through weal and woe?

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
It's not the same.

136
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
In what way is it different?

137
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
Aren't we happy together?

138
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
This happiness isn't the same as that.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
Are you dull?

140
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
That's still happiness.

141
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,960
I think we're happy together.

142
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Have you noticed this?

143
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,840
Ever since Ming Yi's appearance,
you seem to have changed.

144
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
Enough about us.
Make up your mind, Your Lordship.

145
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,160
Does this marriage still count?

146
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,720
I think…

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
Look.

148
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,800
That's the Radiant Spirit!

149
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,040
It's a good omen!

150
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,240
That must be
a blessing from the Radiant Spirit.

151
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,240
Your Lordship.
You and Ming Yi should go make a wish now.

152
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,520
Granny Xun. Making a wish
is such a childish thing to do.

153
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
Do you think
His Lordship will do it? Right?

154
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,680
Of course. That's too childish.

155
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
In what way is that childish?

156
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,160
-Making a wish is nothing but childish.
-You're the childish one here.

157
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,080
A childish boy like
you should eat more chives.

158
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm not having them
because I'm not childish.

159
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm getting you some chives
because you're childish.

160
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
I don't eat chives. I'm telling you.

161
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,520
Chives are only for childish people.
I eat oysters only.

162
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
-So you should eat more chives.
-Granny Xun.

163
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
You're getting old.

164
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,120
-Why are you being so childish?
-I…

165
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,040
Why did you decide
to bring me to the Huansha Market?

166
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,960
Since we're married,
we should act like a married couple.

167
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,600
And I need to get you some gifts.

168
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
Check these out.

169
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
I'll take them all.

170
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,920
It's alright.

171
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
I insist. All of them.

172
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,440
Sure.

173
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,960
Finest rouge and powder.
Have a look, Fairy.

174
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,000
Never before have I seen
rouge prepared in such a way.

175
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,360
I have no need for them.

176
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
-I'll take one of every color.
-Sure.

177
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,520
-There's no need for that.
-You need them.

178
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,600
Well…

179
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,760
Fresh flowers for sale.

180
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,640
-Take care.
-We sell all kinds of flowers.

181
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,200
-Well…
-Check them out.

182
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,520
I'll take them all.

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,720
There's no need for that.

184
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,840
There's no need for that.

185
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,080
Of course you need them.

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
You're Fairy Ming Yi, aren't you?

187
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,280
You came from the Moonlit Blossoms,
and you're married to a warrior.

188
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,320
Immortal Ji sure dotes on you

189
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,480
that he's got you everything
at the Huansha Market.

190
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
Your love story is known everywhere.

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,920
Look.

192
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,200
We even honor your portrait

193
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,360
in the hope of finding
a good husband like him.

194
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,760
You flatter us.

195
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
Why?

196
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
Is this not enough?

197
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,320
Let's get more, then.

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,320
There's no need for that.

199
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,280
My Lord.

200
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,720
Are you feeling guilty
because you've used me

201
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,640
to stage this fake marriage?

202
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,760
Is that why you've been so nice to me?

203
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,920
Do you think I treat you well simply
due to my sense of guilt?

204
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,200
I bet that was
your first time going on a date.

205
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,080
You didn't even offer
to carry the stuff for me.

206
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,640
It's time to have you
make me some artifacts.

208
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,600
Here's an idea.

209
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
We've just got this pouch.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,640
If we put
all these things inside one by one

211
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,160
using our spiritual power,

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,800
we need not carry them.

213
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,800
I guess that's doable.

214
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Let's give it a try.

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,200
How brilliant of you, My Lord!

216
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,680
Now that this pouch is full of goodies,
we shall name it Qiankun Pouch.

217
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,240
Let me see. They're really in it.

218
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
Here's a hairpin.

219
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
This is a dagger.

220
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,680
Do you think we can make
the hairpin and the dagger one?

221
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,480
Well, I'll make it a hairpin.

222
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,080
When I'm in danger, I can use it
as a dagger to protect myself.

223
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
Do you think I can't protect you?

224
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,520
I don't mean it that way.

225
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,480
What if I'm in danger
when you're not around?

226
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Help me. I really want one.

227
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,800
-Make me one.
-Fine. All right.

228
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
You're the best, My Lord!

229
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,120
Thanks.

230
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,720
Well…

231
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,840
We shall name
it The Thorned Maiden's Hairpin.

232
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,160
I'll always wear it.

233
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, make me one more artifact. Show me.

234
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
-Come on. One more.
-There's no need for that.

235
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,400
I really want to see it.

236
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,880
Make me one more…

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
No.

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,960
Qiankun Pouch.
The Thorned Maiden's Hairpin.

239
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
I learned to make them when I was young.

240
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm begging to make these artifacts,

241
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,040
so I can wield them.

242
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
Fine…

243
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,400
This is a lot!

244
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
You're something else, My Lord.

245
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,200
You've managed to turn
this scallion pancake into an artifact.

246
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,320
That's a pancake shield,
and it's unbreakable.

247
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,240
I have no need for this.
Thank you, My Lord.

248
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,240
I've made up my mind.

249
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
After this, there are many things
that we need to look into

250
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
and face together.

251
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,400
If…

252
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
If you're up for it,

253
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,680
someday this wedding
will become a reality.

254
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
What… What does that mean?

255
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,880
I have something else to attend to,
so I'm leaving now.

256
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,800
Hold…

257
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,200
Twenty-Seven.

258
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm visiting Zhang…

259
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,560
Yaoguang Mountain?

260
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,160
Ming Xian.
What's with your marriage to Ji Bozai?

261
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,520
You're here to look for Ming Xian?

262
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,760
There's no way he's here in my room.

263
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Aren't you Ming Xian?

264
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,000
Take a good look, old mister.

265
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,520
I'm a fairy.

266
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,440
How could I possibly be Ming Xian?

267
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,160
If you're not Ming Xian, then who is? Me?

268
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,840
Do you think I can't tell it's you?

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,280
-Why are you…
-All these years,

270
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,400
you've been using
that darned Veil of Illusion

271
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,320
-No, I'm not.
-to conceal your gender.

272
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,640
-You thought I had no idea about that?
-You promised not to hit my head.

273
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,040
Did I?

274
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm hitting your head.

275
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
Stop right there! Well.

276
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
-We haven't seen each other in some time.
-Get up.

277
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,720
-Get up.
-How dare you refuse to acknowledge me?

278
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
How could you not acknowledge me?

279
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
How could you not acknowledge me?

280
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,800
How dare you!

281
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,840
Master.

282
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,520
-You darned brat. I'm going to hit you.
-Stop it.

283
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,760
I'm not hitting you,
so why are you asking me to stop?

284
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,520
Kneel properly.

285
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,920
You knew it all along, Master.

286
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,760
As your master,
I'm like a father figure to you.

287
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm like your…

288
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm like your father, not a fool.

289
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,080
Let's get back to business.

290
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Last month,

291
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,600
Ming Xin came back
to Yaoguang Mountain badly injured.

292
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,400
No idea what happened to him.

293
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,360
He was holding the Search Mirror you made.

294
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,360
He insisted you had
crossed into enemy territory.

295
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,120
Then Madam Meng
tried to influence His Majesty.

296
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,000
His Majesty is now
suspecting you've betrayed him.

297
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,000
But fortunately, His Majesty
doesn't want to make a big scene,

298
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,600
worried that he might push you
too hard if he comes after you.

299
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,040
Father would rather
believe Ming Xin than me.

300
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,240
Yaoguang Mountain needs a crown prince.

301
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,280
Now that you're gone,

302
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,200
His Majesty has to make his decision.

303
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,880
A missing son who lost the duel

304
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,160
is indeed the perfect one to discard.

305
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,040
His Majesty has his reasons.

306
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
You brat!

307
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,640
Do you know how worried I've been?

308
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,920
I had to feign sickness

309
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
just to get away from
the warrior group and come find you.

310
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,680
Along the way,
I had dealt with plenty of Ming Xin's men.

311
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,640
They tried to track me?

312
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,760
Not a chance.

313
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,320
But as soon as I arrived in Jixing Abyss,
I heard Ji Bozai was getting married.

314
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,640
I'd sooner eat my hat than believe
it was you who married him!

315
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,320
What on earth happened?

316
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,640
Can I stay quiet?

317
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,760
Well, Ji Bozai has Golden Millet Dream.

318
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,040
I suspect
it's hidden inside his Spirit Well.

319
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,320
But to enter the Spirit Well,

320
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,280
I have to connect
with his divine consciousness.

321
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
So I came up with an idea.

322
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,160
Marry him
and form a heart imprint with him.

323
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,680
You brat!

324
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,040
Only you could
think of something like that.

325
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,920
You've been a witty
one since you were a kid.

326
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,120
Always coming up with the strangest ideas.

327
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Remember?

328
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,040
Yaoguang Mountain
looks down on using artifacts,

329
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,640
but you thought differently.

330
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,640
To teach you,
I went to great lengths to learn them.

331
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,280
Besides, you always
created weird techniques

332
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,280
while cultivating on your own.

333
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,520
Even I had to admire you.

334
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,120
Steal his Golden Millet Dream?

335
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,560
Only you would think of a fake marriage.

336
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,240
How is it? Did you get it?

337
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,480
Get it?

338
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,080
Ji Bozai is very cautious.

339
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Even though he married me,

340
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,200
he didn't form a heart imprint with me.

341
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
So I couldn't get into his Spirit Well.

342
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,000
What was that?

343
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm getting old.

344
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,600
Speak louder.

345
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
When did you enter his Spirit Well?

346
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,360
Ji Bozai is too cautious.

347
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,520
Even though he married her,

348
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,320
-he didn't form a heart imprint.
-Twenty-Seven.

349
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,480
She hasn't entered the Spirit Well yet.

350
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,280
Why kick me?

351
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,120
You got backfired by your silly plan.

352
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,480
You're at a disadvantage
through and through!

353
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,480
Did you use your spiritual veins?

354
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,040
How many Grief Blossom petals
are left in your palm?

355
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
Master.

356
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,880
You… You've used five?

357
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,680
No. There are five left. Five petals left.

358
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
Even two petals are lethal! You!

359
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,880
You really are my good disciple.

360
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,080
Don't worry, Master She.

361
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,560
Ming Yi has never lost
since she was a kid.

362
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
She'll definitely obtain
the Golden Millet Dream

363
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,320
-to fix her spiritual veins
-Yes.

364
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
-and get her pride back.
-Definitely.

365
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,320
I don't care about all that.

366
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,800
Ming Yi, you…

367
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
I just want you to be safe.

368
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,880
Even if everyone else in the world dies,
you must live on.

369
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,720
Don't gamble with your life.

370
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,760
Understand?

371
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,480
Just passing by.
I brought you some scallion pancakes.

372
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,480
Oh, I forgot she went to visit Zhang Tai.

373
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,520
Didn't Ming Yi say she only married

374
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,160
that scoundrel to enter his Spirit Well?

375
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,360
But judging from how he acted just now,
their marriage doesn't seem fake.

376
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,040
Master She,

377
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
you've got all the skills,
and you're using them for gossip?

378
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,240
Oh my.

379
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,760
Well.

380
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,400
Do you think
something's going on between them?

381
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,480
This scoundrel.

382
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,800
He poisoned her,
and now he's laying his finger on her!

383
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,720
I'm going to kill him!

384
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,640
Please don't, Master She. You mustn't.

385
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,520
What if he wasn't
the one who poisoned her?

386
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,280
And if you kill him
and something happens to you,

387
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,520
I won't be able to avenge you.

388
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,760
If Ji Bozai gets mad
and destroys the Golden Millet Dream,

389
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,880
what about Ming Yi?

390
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,040
You're right.
I can't beat that pretty boy.

391
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,400
Master She,

392
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,400
if you really need to vent your anger,
then curse him.

393
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,720
Curse him however you please.

394
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,360
Little brat! Scoundrel! Mutt!

395
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,680
Curse him all you want.
I'll curse with you.

396
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
You think I'm like you?

397
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,240
How can I say such things
from my mouth? Right.

398
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,080
Do you think Ming Yi has fallen for him?

399
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
No way.

400
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,760
Does she have bad taste?

401
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,400
Why doesn't she have fine taste like me?

402
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,160
TOMB OF BELOVED WIFE XINLIU

403
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,000
Ming Yi, I owe you so much.

404
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,600
Thank you for
risking everything to save me.

405
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,720
My primordial spirit is trapped,
so I don't remember much.

406
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,600
But I do know without you and Immortal Ji,

407
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,360
I'd be dead by now.

408
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,640
Why are you drinking first?

409
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,200
The so-called "love" Xun Ming claimed
didn't just kill Xinliu,

410
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,000
it also brought harm
to the other fairies he captured.

411
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,440
Too bad I'm just a little Jingwei bird
without spiritual veins.

412
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,400
Otherwise, I'd whip
his corpse to avenge them.

413
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,920
BELOVED WIFE

414
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,120
If she knew this, she'd be happy.

415
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,280
When she was alive,

416
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,200
she couldn't live as freely as she wanted.

417
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,680
She wouldn't want to be used by Xun Ming

418
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,200
to prove his fake love
devotion after her death.

419
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,040
I feel sorry for her
and those innocent fairies.

420
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,800
Fortunately, I have you.

421
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,800
But Xinliu didn't.

422
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,600
She lost her life in despair,
with no one to turn to,

423
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,160
and never got to take revenge.

424
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,800
Xun Ming claimed he loved Xinliu,

425
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,360
but he didn't even clear
the weeds around her grave.

426
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,040
Jeez, that self-satisfied scoundrel!

427
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,720
I'll go find some more flowers over there.

428
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
Xinliu would be glad to see them.

429
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,720
When Xun Ming carved your tombstone,
he didn't even engrave your surname.

430
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,480
I suppose he wanted
to strip away your identity

431
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,600
so you'd only belong to him.

432
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,640
But who cares what he wanted?

433
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,600
Since…

434
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,640
you never wanted this surname,
we'll just keep your own name.

435
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,200
Thank you for
everything you've done for me.

436
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,160
This is the testimony from
the last trace of my divine consciousness.

437
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,320
I hope it helps you.

438
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,800
Ever since Lord Hanfeng took power,

439
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
he has committed two major crimes.

440
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,240
First, he secretly raised
an ancient netherbeast, Heju,

441
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,000
and used a forbidden technique
from Hou Zhao

442
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,600
to feed it with
the primordial spirits of innocent people.

443
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,120
The technique is unknown.

444
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,880
All I know is he hid it
at Dragon Carp Terrace.

445
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,160
Second, he captured innocent people,
condemned them as criminals,

446
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,960
and threw them into the Sunken Abyss
to refine Heavenly Grief.

447
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,360
Yaoguang Mountain,

448
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,240
Zhushui Spiritual State,
and Flowing Wave Gorge,

449
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,960
the entire Upper Third Realm
was part of that.

450
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Lord Hanfeng kept
a list of names to control them.

451
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,400
Mu Qibai actually raised a netherbeast?

452
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,480
It seems what happened in
the Sunken Abyss was far more complicated.

453
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,600
And he colluded
with the Upper Third Realm.

454
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,920
But why is Yaoguang Mountain involved?

455
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,560
It's no surprise someone
from Yaoguang Mountain is involved.

456
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,600
If Mu Qibai had secretly sold
Heavenly Grief to Yaoguang Mountain,

457
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,360
then the person
who poisoned you must be there.

458
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,640
Ji Bozai once told me
he didn't poison Ming Xian,

459
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,560
and I believe him.

460
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,640
Out of everyone on Yaoguang Mountain,

461
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,480
the ones who most want me dead
are Ming Xin and Madam Meng.

462
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,040
That vile mother and son.

463
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,720
If Ming Xin's involved, would Father…

464
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,520
Don't overthink.

465
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,040
His Majesty would never lose sight
of right and wrong.

466
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,880
Ming Yi,
your spiritual veins are shattered.

467
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
It's inconvenient for you. How about this?

468
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,640
I'll return to Yaoguang Mountain
tomorrow to find out

469
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,040
what Madam Meng and Ming Xin are up to.

470
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,840
Sorry to trouble you, Master.
Please be careful.

471
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,400
Also, I need your help.

472
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,920
I'll send this testimony to Ji Bozai,
so he can investigate the truth.

473
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,640
But he mustn't know
about the Upper Third Realms' involvement.

474
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,800
Point taken.

475
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
Ji Bozai is from Jixing Abyss.

476
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,240
He won't care
about Yaoguang Mountain's innocence.

477
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,200
We have to uncover the truth ourselves.

478
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,320
When Zhang Tai and I
went to visit Xinliu's grave,

479
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,880
I found this in her tomb.

480
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,720
I had investigated
Mu Qibai's Dragon Carp Terrace,

481
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,560
but didn't find anything suspicious.

482
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,160
Now it seems
he hid things much deeper than I thought.

483
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,040
I'll find another chance
to investigate again.

484
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,520
What was your plan to deal with Mu Qibai?

485
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,160
Anyone with eyes
can tell there's something wrong

486
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
with His Majesty's Deep Slumber Sickness.

487
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
I was planning to start from there

488
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,800
to expose what Mu Qibai did
in the Sunken Abyss.

489
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,880
But now it seems
that he raised a netherbeast army

490
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,160
with the intention to rebel.

491
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,840
This crime
is enough to crush him completely.

492
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,760
Take a look and see
if there's anything you like.

493
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,040
Remember to bring your friends next time.

494
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,239
Sure.

495
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,199
Don't miss out on

496
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,600
the most fashionable
hairpins and accessories.

497
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,320
Fairy, come take a look.

498
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,040
Do you like this one?

499
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
-I'll take this.
-Alright.

500
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,159
These hairpins are all quite unique.

501
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,360
Exactly.

502
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,280
I've never seen designs
like this anywhere else.

503
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,239
They're all handmade.

504
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,360
Only one of each style.

505
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,800
Here.

506
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,679
This suits you beautifully.

507
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,040
-Which of these two looks nicer?
-Really?

508
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,360
-Let me help you try it on.
-This one.

509
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,880
-Wrap this one up for me.
-Sure thing.

510
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,880
-I'll take this.
-Alright.

511
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,400
Thank you.

512
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,640
Please come again.

513
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,280
Ming Yi.

514
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,640
Let me try this one.

515
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,480
It really feels like
you're running a proper business.

516
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,440
It's all thanks to you.

517
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,320
Are you really quitting?

518
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
How will Fuyue keep
Moonlit Blossoms running without you?

519
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,880
I have to make a living somehow.

520
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,240
At first, I thought

521
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,720
even if I couldn't find true love
in Moonlit Blossoms,

522
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,560
at least I could make some money.

523
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,400
But look at it now.
All this mess and farce here and there.

524
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,720
How could I still carry that thought?

525
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,600
Good thing you came up
with another way for me.

526
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,240
This is your own doing.
You're good at business.

527
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,120
Why give me the credit?

528
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,600
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

529
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Please come again.

530
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,440
-Don't flash money around. Keep it.
-Yes. Close up.

531
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,520
Believe it or not,
we'll have a big customer soon.

532
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,640
-Right.
-Fairy.

533
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,520
It should be this stall.

534
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,000
The accessories here are
even finer than those in the palace.

535
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
Ming Yi?

536
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,920
Your Highness.

537
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,600
Your… Your Highness.

538
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,760
Fairy, are you here for the accessories?

539
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,720
You're a warrior's wife,

540
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,520
yet you're selling accessories here?

541
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,400
This is Zhang Tai.
My best friend from Moonlit Blossoms.

542
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,600
This is her stall.

543
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,000
Your…

544
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,800
No, fairy.

545
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,600
Ming Yi only came here to help me out.

546
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,600
You must've heard about
the captive Xun Ming.

547
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,800
I lost my support,
so I have to make a living on my own.

548
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,840
That's why Ming Yi's helping me.

549
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,840
Your Highness,
these are all handmade by Zhang Tai.

550
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,840
If you like them, please support her.

551
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,400
If you wear them, everyone in Jixing Abyss

552
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,160
will know Zhang Tai
makes beautiful accessories.

553
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,280
There's no need.

554
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
You can take anything you like.

555
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,520
I didn't know

556
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,640
you still keep in touch
with people from Moonlit Blossoms.

557
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,880
I thought Princess Tianji,

558
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,240
who shoulders
the entire Shouhua Academy on her own,

559
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,560
would be above such prejudice.

560
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,160
Yet it sounds like

561
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,480
you still value one's birth
more than their character.

562
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
You!

563
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,520
Fairy Ming Yi is right.

564
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
I was being narrow-minded.

565
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
Xiuyun.

566
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,160
-I'll take all these pieces.
-Yes.

567
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,520
You don't have to do that.

568
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,680
-That's too kind of you.
-That's so kind of you.

569
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,680
It's not kindness.

570
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,640
If I like them, they're worth it.

571
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,960
You…

572
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,680
I was saying
I like these hairpins, not you.

573
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,440
-Lovely.
-Lovely.

574
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,840
Pack them all up for me.

575
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,200
I'll send them over tomorrow.

576
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
-We're making a fortune.
-Alright.

577
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,600
Keep them safe.

578
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,120
Your Highness.

579
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,160
His Majesty didn't sleep well last night.
It's not advisable to disturb His Majesty.

580
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
You won't let me see my father.

581
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,080
Are you afraid
that I might leave some clue behind,

582
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,960
so that when Father awakes,

583
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,080
he'll realize
someone's plotting against him?

584
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,480
Don't worry about it. I won't act rashly.

585
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,680
Father is only unconscious right now.

586
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,360
If I were really that foolish,

587
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
he'd be more than just asleep.

588
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,160
Sometimes I wonder,

589
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,320
if Uncle ever decides
to kill me and my father,

590
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,960
would you hand us
over yourself, Immortal Yan?

591
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,760
You still like Blessing Flowers.

592
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,160
You have the nerve to bring up the past.

593
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,800
It's not that. I'm just curious.

594
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,720
I've never seen you
wear this hairpin before.

595
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,000
You sound like
you remember all my hairpins.

596
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,320
Well, this Blessing Flower hairpin

597
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,000
was a gift from Immortal Ji.

598
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,120
Of course you haven't seen it.

599
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,000
You never cared about him.

600
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,240
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have let him marry.

601
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,480
That just proves you never really cared.

602
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,240
Immortal Yan, maybe
you should ask yourself first.

603
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,760
Why do you keep checking how I feel?

604
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,760
You're nothing but a stupid idiot!

605
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,200
What a fool.

606
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,680
I just don't understand.

607
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,440
How can anyone be this dumb?

608
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,080
Why did you spread the news
about Ji Bozai's wedding?

609
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,800
It's a happy occasion, after all.

610
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,760
Everyone should celebrate together.

611
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,040
How can that be wrong?

612
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,680
I used to think I was
the most unhelpful one here.

613
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
But turns out

614
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,440
there's someone even worse than
me. A steamed bun made from dead dough.

615
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,840
Completely hopeless.

616
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,880
Why would a dough be dead, though?

617
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,840
You!

618
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,400
Get out, all of you!

619
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,320
-A bunch of useless trash.
-Me too?

620
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,200
Especially you.

621
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,840
Get out of my sight.
Don't let me see you again.

622
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,000
Alright.

623
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,200
I don't have to attend
tomorrow's morning assembly, do I?

624
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,080
I wouldn't want to upset you again.

625
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,000
If it weren't for the Wine Immortal's clan

626
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,880
being blood-related
to the Mu imperial clan,

627
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,400
someone as stupid as Meng Yangqiu
would've been killed long ago.

628
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,560
Meng Yangqiu is easy to read.

629
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,480
Isn't someone like him easier to control
than me or Immortal Sun Liao?

630
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,880
Immortal Yan,

631
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,520
you'd rather insult yourself
just to protect him.

632
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,120
Are you saying
that when Lord Hanfeng needs help,

633
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,320
he must keep your foolish friend around
before earning your support?

634
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
I wouldn't dare.

635
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,880
Considering my base birth,
without Lord Hanfeng's favor,

636
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,880
I wouldn't even be standing here
today to serve him.

637
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,000
My honor or disgrace
all depend on his will.

638
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,160
Enough. Quiet.

639
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,600
A flying letter from
Lord Chengyun from Yaoguang Mountain.

640
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,920
White Cat, Ming Xian's companion beast,
had me bedridden for over a month!

641
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,880
He's in Jixing Abyss. You must catch him.

642
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,120
This is indeed wonderful news
from Yaoguang Mountain.

643
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,120
Please allow me to help you

644
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,400
capture Ming Xian's companion beast.
