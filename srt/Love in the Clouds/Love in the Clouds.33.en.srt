1
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
"LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
Who's that?

3
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,560
Ming Xin.

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,160
Who's this?

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
It really is him.

6
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
Why is he with Ming Yi and Ji Bozai?

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,120
Where did they go?

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,360
Yeah.

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,040
I don't need your pity!

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,200
I never thought that after
a lifetime of being jealous of you,

11
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,920
I wouldn't even die
by your hand in the end.

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
What's going on?

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,479
-Ming Xin.
-He's injured.

14
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,640
Isn't that Ming Xian's companion beast?

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
-Yes.
-Yes.

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,000
I,

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,880
Ming Xin,
Lord Chengyun of Yaoguang Mountain

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,560
and Ming Xian's younger brother,

19
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,760
can testify before you all.

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
This woman

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,080
is none other than Ming Xian of
Yaoguang Mountain, the one who caused

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,480
your seven consecutive defeats!

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,760
-What?
-What?

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
-How could she be Ming Xian?
-Impossible!

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
She's clearly a fairy!

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,480
-Nonsense!
-Exactly. Yes.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,480
How can he say such
nonsense with a straight face?

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't believe him.

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,160
For the past 21 years,

30
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,480
she had used the Veil
of Illusion to disguise herself

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,880
as a male immortal,

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,960
taking the title of
Crown Prince for herself.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
The artifact in her hand, the Embers,

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
was forged by Ming Xian

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
and answers only to her.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,960
She also wears the spiritpact
bell of Ming Xian's companion beast,

37
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,760
the White Cat.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Is Fairy Ming Yi really Ming Xian?

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,320
No, it's impossible.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
She's a fairy. How could she be Ming Xian?

41
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,840
But even Ming Xian's
own brother identifies her.

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,760
And the companion beast

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,360
we just saw was indeed Ming Xian's cat.

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,680
It can't be faked.

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Ming Xian, do you dare deny it?

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,520
Your identity will be
exposed sooner or later.

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,120
I don't believe

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,400
that after all this,

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,040
the Six Realms will
still have a place for you.

50
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,200
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
should have been me.

52
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
It should have

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
been me.

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,680
Could what he said be true?

55
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,680
Is it true?

56
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,120
It sounds true to me.

57
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,440
There's no reason to make this up.

58
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,360
-Get out!
-Get out!

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,200
What are you doing?

60
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,520
What are you doing?

61
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Calm down, everyone!

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,600
Step back!

63
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
Calm down, everyone!

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
Back up!

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,200
Do not come closer!

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Stop!

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
Calm down!

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,160
Step back!

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,320
Stay calm! Step back!

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,240
Get out!

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,280
Back up!

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Calm down, everyone!

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Get out of Shouhua Academy!

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
-Get out!
-Get out!

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,880
Ming Yi is one of us
here in Shouhua Academy.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
You cannot drive
her out just because you want to!

77
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,440
Ming Yi?

78
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,560
She's Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain!

79
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,040
-Right!
-Right!

80
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,160
-Everyone, please calm down.
-Yes, she is Ming Xian,

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,880
but she's saved
Jixing Abyss from disaster more than once.

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,840
Have you all forgotten that?

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,960
And every artifact
used in this Qingyun Tournament

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
was forged by her.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
She has stood with us through every trial.

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
-Why are you defending her?
-Why shouldn't I?

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,040
When the netherbeast army struck,

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
it was Master Ming Yi
who protected the lives of Jixing Abyss!

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,160
She was once
the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,560
If you let her stay in Shouhua Academy,

91
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,000
aren't you afraid
she'll collude with the enemy

92
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,200
and bring ruin upon Jixing Abyss?

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,400
That's nonsense! She would never do that!

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,800
Enough talk!

95
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,760
Let's rush in

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
and drive
that traitor out of Jixing Abyss!

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,360
Drive her out of Jixing Abyss!

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,080
Calm down!

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
Get lost!

100
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,680
Master.

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,040
Calm down!

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,080
Stop it!

103
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
I am Ming Xian.

104
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,920
If anyone has grievances,

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
come at me.

106
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,440
Ming Xian, you traitor!

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,880
Get out of Jixing Abyss!
Get out of Shouhua Academy!

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,240
-Get out!
-Get out of Jixing Abyss!

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,000
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

110
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,800
Your Majesty, the news has
already spread across all Six Realms.

111
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,720
Fairy Ming Yi

112
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,680
is none other than Ming Xian,
the one who caused Jixing Abyss

113
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,960
seven years of defeat and
the loss of the Blessed Rain.

114
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,480
Has Your Majesty
been blinded by her deceit

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
to have allowed her to
join Shouhua Academy?

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,320
Your Majesty, please seize
that traitor Ming Xian at once!

117
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,200
Yaoguang Mountain once
hailed that wretch as their Warrior God.

118
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,200
She built her own glory

119
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,320
on the blood and
tears Jixing Abyss offered

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,480
to Yaoguang Mountain.

121
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,760
And now, she's even infiltrated our realm.

122
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,280
She must have ulterior motives!

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,400
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-That's right, Your Majesty.

124
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,160
Your Majesty, we must
not let her go unpunished!

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Nor should we allow her to
remain in Shouhua Academy!

126
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
We can't let her stay in Shouhua Academy!

127
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,760
-Your Majesty, you owe us an answer!
-You owe us an answer!

128
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,920
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,880
-She must not be forgiven!
-Stop hesitating, Your Majesty.

130
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
-Your Majesty, make your decision now!
-Your Majesty!

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
Give us justice!

132
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,000
I am indeed Ming Xian,

133
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
and it's true that I caused Jixing Abyss

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
to lose for seven years.

135
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
But back then,
I belonged to Yaoguang Mountain.

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
There was nothing wrong
with fighting for them.

137
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,400
Still,
the hardships Jixing Abyss faces today

138
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
are partly my doing,

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,400
and I cannot just stand by.

140
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
So now,

141
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,720
I wish to join

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,920
the warrior ranks of
Shouhua Academy to fight

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,120
for the Blessed Rain
that should rightfully be shared with you.

144
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Who would believe you?

145
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,080
What right do
you have to be in Jixing Abyss?

146
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,640
Ming Xian would fight for Jixing Abyss?

147
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,480
You traitor, you lying wretch!
No one will believe you!

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,400
You made us lose seven years in a row,

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,680
and you dare to give this speech here?
Get out of Jixing Abyss!

150
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,720
-Get out of Jixing Abyss!
-Get out of Jixing Abyss!

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,360
-Get out of Jixing Abyss!
-Get out of Jixing Abyss!

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,880
Everyone,

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000
I know you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

154
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,080
But there's one thing
you know as well as I do:

155
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,920
right now, in Jixing Abyss,

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,880
no one else can rival
the warriors of Yaoguang Mountain.

157
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,240
Only I can.

158
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,440
Without me,

159
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,160
you will lose again,
just as you did in those seven years.

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,200
With me, you might still have a chance.

161
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,280
If I truly mean to fight for Jixing Abyss,

162
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,600
then you'll have a chance to win,
and it will be your only chance to win.

163
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
So today,

164
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,600
I set up this arena.

165
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,559
If anyone can defeat me,

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
I will never again ask
to join Shouhua Academy.

167
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,880
You have so many powerful artifacts.

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,080
How could we possibly beat you?

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,000
-Exactly!
-Exactly!

170
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
Right.

171
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,680
-It's impossible!
-Right!

172
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,280
I won't use any artifacts.

173
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,280
Everyone,

174
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
you've all seen what Ming Xian can do.

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,800
She's just trying to humiliate us.

176
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,320
That's right. She's
trying to humiliate us.

177
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,760
This is unfair!

178
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
Then I'll even fight
without using my hands.

179
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
-What is she trying to do?
-What now?

180
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,280
Even so,
no one dares to fight Master Ming Yi?

181
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
Then what are you all complaining about?

182
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,720
You clearly need her,

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,120
yet you still refuse to trust her.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
I'll give it a try.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,160
I'll fight too!

186
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Master, you are unbeatable!

187
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Anyone else? Come at me together.

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,480
How could we ever win?

189
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,600
-There's no way we can win.
-Exactly.

190
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,520
We all know how strong you are,

191
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
but you fought for
Yaoguang Mountain for so many years.

192
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,280
How can we trust you to fight for us now?

193
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,400
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

194
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
I will vouch for her.

195
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

196
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
I will stake everything I have on this.

197
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,080
Ming Yi will win back
the Blessed Rain for Jixing Abyss.

198
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,400
-But…
-If she ever betrays us,

199
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,800
then it means I've
made the wrong decision.

200
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
I will have her executed at once

201
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,560
and then abdicate the throne.

202
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,280
What?

203
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,440
You are just worried

204
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,480
that I might collude
with Yaoguang Mountain.

205
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,560
So I will tell you the whole truth today.

206
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,440
Though I was once Ming Xian,

207
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,640
my real father isn't
the Emperor of Yaoguang.

208
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,480
Nor is my birth mother
the Empress of Yaoguang.

209
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
My real mother was a descendant
of the Bo clan of Jixing Abyss.

210
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,160
So how am I not qualified

211
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
to fight for Jixing Abyss?

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
Give me this one chance,

213
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,800
and I will protect Jixing Abyss

214
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,960
so it will never again be oppressed.

215
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,640
Now we can trust her.

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,000
Jixing Abyss!

217
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,680
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

218
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,520
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,760
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

220
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,120
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

221
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,240
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

222
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,560
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

223
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,040
-Jixing Abyss!
-Jixing Abyss!

224
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,000
Get out.

225
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,400
Your Lordship, you must have heard by now.

226
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
Ming Yi has
renounced the Ming Xian identity

227
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,960
and formally joined

228
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,920
Jixing Abyss's Shouhua Academy.

229
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,440
Give her up, Your Lordship!

230
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,920
She will be an enemy
of Zhushui Spiritual State.

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,040
She already knows your true identity.

232
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,040
And she knows of all the innocent lives
you have taken.

233
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,160
You and she can never be together!

234
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,040
Chao Yuan, forget her.

235
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Forget her,

236
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,080
and you will be the one

237
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,760
most likely to rule
Zhushui Spiritual State.

238
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,960
If you insist on choosing her,

239
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,680
you will lower yourself forever,

240
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,560
beneath even the dirt.

241
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
Back then in Jixing Abyss,

242
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
you killed

243
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,560
your own brothers for her.

244
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Now you use living
beings as sacrifices to train

245
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,320
in the art of illusory assassination.

246
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,200
How much blood is on your hands?

247
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,960
Can it ever be washed clean?

248
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,520
She never loved you.

249
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,880
Now that she knows
what you are truly like,

250
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,680
-she could never…
-Shut up!

251
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,000
I won't!

252
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,120
At first, you hesitated to kill.

253
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,440
But now,

254
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,280
even when they tremble in fear,
kneel before you, and beg for mercy,

255
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,160
even when they die
with their eyes wide open,

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,880
you don't even flinch.

257
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,720
This is who you truly are!

258
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,080
Shut up!

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
Fuyue, shut up.

260
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,600
Shut up!

261
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,000
I won't shut up!

262
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,440
Only I know this side of you.

263
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,520
Only I grew up suffering by your side.

264
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
When you had no
spiritual veins and were bullied,

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,960
I was the one who endured it with you.

266
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,960
So why do you choose Ming Yi?

267
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
Because you are not her!

268
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,560
Leave.

269
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Soon, I will have my own spiritual veins,

270
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,280
and I will no longer need you.

271
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
Congratulations, Your Lordship!

272
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,600
Don't move.

273
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Fuyue,

274
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,599
you once took me to your Illusory Realm.

275
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,200
Your most precious memory

276
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,000
was the day I saved you from Chao Yu.

277
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,680
But mine was the day Ming Yi saved me.

278
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,600
I will never be able to move on.

279
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,240
But Fuyue,

280
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,120
you still have a chance

281
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,240
to live for yourself.

282
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,000
My training has no set routine.

283
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
If any of you can land
even half a move on me,

284
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
that will be enough.

285
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Here in Yaoguang Mountain,

286
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,800
we have never
relied on artifacts in battle.

287
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
As an Honorary Warrior,
shouldn't you lead by example?

288
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,960
We used none before and still won.

289
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,800
-Exactly.
-Why do you have to use artifacts?

290
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,200
Yeah, we've never used any.

291
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,760
Exactly. Why do you use them?

292
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,920
That kind of thinking is far too narrow.

293
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,240
I'll show you the truth through action.

294
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,640
If you can't overcome
an artifact with your spiritual power,

295
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,720
how will you defeat your opponents
in the Qingyun Tournament?

296
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,960
Ji Bozai,

297
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,520
you're doing this just to humiliate us.

298
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
The former Honorary Warrior
never trained us like this.

299
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,560
Which Honorary Warrior
are you referring to?

300
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,840
Don't tell me you mean Ming Xin.

301
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,200
He couldn't even train himself properly.

302
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,160
How could he ever train you?

303
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,600
Why pretend not to know, Immortal Ji?

304
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,440
The one who trained us before

305
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
was that wretched Ming Xian.

306
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,960
When Ming Xian
brought you seven years of victory,

307
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
you hailed her as the Warrior God.

308
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
Then, after a single defeat,

309
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,320
you turned to support Ming Xin instead,

310
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,760
not even sparing her a word in defense.

311
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,880
And now, when you speak of her,

312
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,840
you even sound full of contempt.

313
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,320
How laughable.

314
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,160
What,

315
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
are you standing up for her now?

316
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
I bet he's doing this
because they were once married,

317
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,920
and he came here today just to lecture us.

318
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,760
Did Ming Xian truly train you?

319
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,600
-How could you all be so narrow-minded?
-You…!

320
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,160
I took Ming Xian's place

321
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,480
to lead you in the Qingyun Tournament.

322
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
Everything I've said and done today

323
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
is as the Honorary Warrior.

324
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,040
But you?

325
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
Think about what you just said.

326
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,760
Do you still remember you are warriors?

327
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,600
Our time is running short.

328
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,720
If you want to be worthy
of the armor you wear,

329
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,760
stop behaving like that.

330
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,800
In this Qingyun Tournament,

331
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,680
whether you win
with spiritual power or artifacts,

332
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,000
a victory is a victory.

333
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,680
What you should do now

334
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
is focus on getting stronger

335
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
for Yaoguang Mountain.

336
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
You and Immortal Zheng Tiao
are about to get married.

337
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Why are you still staying in Jixing Abyss?

338
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,600
I get to make battle attire
for Shouhua Academy's warriors here.

339
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
I know what matters more,

340
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,920
and so does Zheng Tiao.
He won't stand in my way.

341
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
Besides,

342
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,000
if we saw each other
every day, I might get tired of him.

343
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
It seems Zheng Tiao and you

344
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
are quite the match.

345
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,040
Our wedding is set for next month.

346
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,000
But Zheng Tiao

347
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,120
is a warrior from another realm.

348
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
Your Majesty, could you…?

349
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,240
All right.
A union between realms is a joyous event.

350
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,840
I will issue a pass
for Immortal Zheng Tiao.

351
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,440
Thank you, Your Majesty!

352
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,000
Looks like I'd better prepare more
spirit stones as your wedding gift.

353
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,920
Ming Yi,

354
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,520
actually, I've invited someone else too.

355
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,960
The bride and groom have arrived!

356
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,640
-Here they come!
-Here they come!

357
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
She's so beautiful.

358
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600
First, petals for an everlasting bond!

359
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,240
Second, petals for love in full bloom!

360
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,760
Third, petals for
peace through all seasons!

361
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,280
Fourth, petals for
reunion beneath the full moon!

362
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,080
Fifth, petals for joy and
children to bless your home!

363
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
-Yes!
-Yes!

364
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,440
Now, the three bows.

365
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,360
First,

366
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,400
bow to heaven and earth for
witnessing your blessed union.

367
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,640
Bow!

368
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
Second,

369
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,160
bow to your families for
lasting harmony and generations of joy.

370
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
Bow!

371
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,360
-Wonderful!
-Wonderful!

372
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
Bow!

373
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,920
-Yes!
-Yes!

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,080
Third,

375
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,320
bow to each other,
united in heart and soul.

376
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
-Wonderful!
-Wonderful!

377
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,680
-How lovely!
-Beautiful!

378
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,960
Lovely!

379
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,720
The ceremony is complete!

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,280
Zhang Tai, marrying you

381
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,360
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

382
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,560
From now on, we can
watch the stars together every night.

383
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,160
So sweet!

384
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

385
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,240
What a perfect match!

386
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,960
-Step aside.
-By His Majesty's order,

387
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,720
before the Diwu
tree's core is fully refined,

388
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,120
Your Highness cannot leave the realm.

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
Tell Father I hurt you.

390
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,440
That way, Father will not blame you

391
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,160
for letting me escape.

392
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,440
You truly disappoint me!

393
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,920
Father.

394
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,320
Only now do I learn

395
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,040
of your relationship with Ming Xian

396
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,360
and your dealings with Ming Xin.

397
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,760
There are plenty of
things you still don't know.

398
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,640
Such insolence!

399
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,680
Are you really going to kill me, Father?

400
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,680
If you do,

401
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,960
I cannot say what will happen

402
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,120
to the Diwu tree's core.

403
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
You lowborn brat.

404
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,120
You even dare to threaten me now?

405
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,680
Lowborn brat?

406
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,640
I carry your blood, Father.

407
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,840
I've learned everything

408
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,000
from you, the father I deeply admire.

409
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,960
If you stay here
today, I will let this slide.

410
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,360
But if you defy my order
and dare to leave the realm,

411
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,800
this spell, though not deadly,

412
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,320
will make you suffer as if thousands
of ants were gnawing at your heart.

413
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,520
The Diwu tree's core
may be your bargaining chip,

414
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,000
but I have my own ways to make you behave!

415
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,600
Think carefully about what you should do.

416
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,120
Congratulations, Fairy Zhang Tai.

417
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,560
Isn't that Immortal Ji's companion beast?

418
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,760
Why is he here?

419
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,160
Isn't that Immortal Ji's companion beast?

420
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,200
What is he doing here?

421
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,480
Why is he here?

422
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,120
Yeah.

423
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,720
Why is he here?

424
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,640
My lord sends this gift

425
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,800
to congratulate you on your wedding.

426
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Why didn't your lord come in person?

427
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
He has already severed ties with the past.

428
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,360
Still, on hearing
that an old friend is marrying,

429
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
he asked me to
deliver this gift on his behalf.

430
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,120
Please accept it.

431
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,080
Thank you.

432
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,000
He's leaving already?

433
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,160
I once overheard them talking

434
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,120
about something inside the Zhuojin Tower,

435
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,760
something called the Sky-Swallowing Array.

436
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,600
Buxiu,

437
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
do you still remember

438
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,880
the portrait that burned that day?

439
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
A hundred years ago,

440
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,080
the Emperor of Zhushui
laid the Sky-Swallowing Array

441
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
inside the Zhuojin Tower.

442
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,360
He planned to seize the moment

443
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,840
when the Nine Heavens
opened during the Qingyun Tournament

444
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
and use the array

445
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,840
to absorb the Blessed Rain
and the primordial spirits of all beings,

446
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,280
claiming dominion over the Six Realms.

447
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
The one who activates the array

448
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,720
must possess unique spiritual veins

449
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,280
infused with both the Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream.

450
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,920
Thus, the Bo clan swore never
to let the two medicines appear again.

451
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Yet now, to save my disciple, Ji Bozai,

452
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,360
I have to refine
the Golden Millet Dream once more.

453
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
I hereby record the method
to undo the Sky-Swallowing Array:

454
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,480
Only one who has
reached the Transcendent Stage

455
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,840
may destroy the array
by sacrificing themselves

456
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,200
at the instant it is activated,

457
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,360
thereby averting catastrophe.

458
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,120
Your Lordship…

459
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,920
Buxiu, there's nothing to be sad about.

460
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,440
In all the Six Realms,

461
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,440
only I can do this.

462
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Besides,

463
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,440
I don't have much time left anyway.

464
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,880
That's a good deal, isn't it?

465
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
It's just a pity

466
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
that what I promised her…

467
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,880
Today is a fine day.

468
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,920
You came.

469
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,080
Since you're here,

470
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,760
why didn't you go
offer your congratulations?

471
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,360
Are you afraid to see me?

472
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,320
Maybe.

473
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,680
Are you afraid

474
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,600
that seeing me would
bring back painful memories

475
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,840
-that cling like a wound to the bone?
-Ming Yi.

476
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,880
I'll go inside now.

477
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I won't disturb your peace.

478
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,720
Don't catch a cold.

479
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,400
The rain hasn't stopped.

480
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,120
What should I do with you?

481
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,679
Let the rain decide when it's over.

482
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,199
As long as it keeps raining,

483
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,280
there are no titles,

484
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,240
no realms, and no Qingyun Tournament.

485
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,240
Only you and me.

486
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,680
When the rain stops,

487
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,080
let everything end with…

488
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,120
The rain has stopped.

489
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,200
If only

490
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,800
there were a spell in this world
that could make the rain last forever.

491
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,360
Ji Bozai,

492
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
take care.

493
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,840
Immortal Ji, please wait.

494
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,880
Fairy Zhang Tai heard you came

495
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,120
and asked me to deliver a gift in return.

496
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,080
That's not necessary.

497
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,200
She said it was something
Fairy Ming Yi wanted you to have.

498
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,800
Incredible, Lord Ji!

499
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,560
Since this pouch can hold everything,

500
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,320
let's call it the Qiankun Pouch.

501
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,400
Come back.

502
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,920
Why am I here?

503
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,840
Your Lordship!

504
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,280
Your Lordship.

505
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,720
Buxiu.

506
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Your Lordship.

507
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,280
I have already channeled my spiritual
power into the Sky-Swallowing Array.

508
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,880
My primordial spirit is now linked to it.

509
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,080
Extract it now.

510
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,280
If Zhushui Spiritual State
activates the array,

511
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,400
remember to use my primordial spirit

512
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,520
to seal it at once.

513
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,320
-No…
-Stop hesitating.

514
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,120
We're out of time.

515
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,720
It's not over yet.

516
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,360
Why must I take
your primordial spirit now?

517
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,200
If I don't make it to the finals,

518
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,800
remember what I've told you.

519
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,520
And do not tell Ming Yi.

520
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,840
You… How dare you?

521
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,760
Your Lordship,

522
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,600
I will never break our spiritpact.

523
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,480
This is the first time I've disobeyed you.

524
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,120
Asking me to
extract your primordial spirit

525
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,360
is like asking me to
kill you with my own hands.

526
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,120
I can't do it.

527
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,520
Even if it costs me my life, I can't!

528
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,640
Buxiu…

529
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,400
We don't have to give up now.

530
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,400
I will find a way to save you.

531
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,080
Wait for me.

532
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,320
Buxiu!

533
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,200
Your lord has treated mine heartlessly!

534
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,800
-Step aside!
-What are you doing here?

535
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,800
Buxiu!

536
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
-What's wrong?
-Tell me…

537
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
-What's wrong, Buxiu?
-why you're here first!

538
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,240
Why are you on your knees?

539
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,360
Fairy Ming Yi,
I beg you, please save my lord!

540
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,360
What happened to Ji Bozai?

541
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,960
The Heavenly Grief in
him has flared up again.

542
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,360
I know you can save him.

543
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,480
Please, Fairy Ming Yi,
go to Yaoguang Mountain and save him!

544
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
Please!

545
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,680
Step aside! I don't wish to fight you.

546
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,760
Ming Yi, I already let you go,

547
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
and yet you dare to return?

548
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,720
Please, Your Majesty,
take me to see Ji Bozai.

549
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,680
My son has nothing to do with you anymore.

550
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,120
With all these people
here, this isn't the place to talk.

551
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,640
Please, Your Majesty,
head to the Chamber of Ease with me.
