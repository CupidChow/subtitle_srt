1
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
Your Lordship!

3
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,640
Your Lordship.

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
What is this?

5
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,120
What happened?

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
I killed him.

7
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
What?

8
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,720
I killed him.

9
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,880
Your Lordship,
even if you wish to help Ming Yi,

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,200
you must look after yourself.

11
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm fine, Fuyue.

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,200
Don't worry. I'm perfectly fine.

13
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
Come on.

14
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,920
Your Lordship,

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,320
you've opposed Mu Qibai time
and again for Ming Yi's sake.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
I fear you've already
become a thorn in his side.

17
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,800
Mu Qibai has more than one enemy.

18
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,040
The enemy of my enemy is a friend.

19
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Since that's the case,

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll lend this friend a hand.

21
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,280
The Judgment Hall reports
that you abducted Fairy Ming Yi

22
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
and even carried out a private punishment.

23
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,200
Is that true?

24
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,640
Through investigation, I discovered
that Ming Yi carried spiritual veins,

25
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
and Ji Bozai concealed and sheltered her,

26
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,720
so naturally,
I had to get to the bottom of it.

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,040
It's true she has spiritual veins,

28
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,240
but the one
who covered up for her wasn't Ji Bozai.

29
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,160
It was me.

30
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,880
I've long intended for her
to serve at Shouhua Academy.

31
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,880
Absurd!

32
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,080
A fairy born
with spiritual veins is a jinx,

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,560
yet you want to bring her
into Shouhua Academy?

34
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,760
Such a foolish rule
should have been broken long ago.

35
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,560
Soon, as the Venerable
of Shouhua Academy, I will decree

36
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,520
that all women within
Jixing Abyss who bear spiritual veins

37
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,040
need not hide any longer

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,720
and may compete to be warriors.

39
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,480
Uncle, instead of worrying
about such a trivial matter,

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
perhaps you should explain

41
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,360
why a charred corpse found in this case

42
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,120
came from Zhushui Spiritual State.

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
He's dead?

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,880
Who

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
was he?

46
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,880
Whoever he was,
it's not your place to question me.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,080
Then never mind… the corpse.

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,800
But think about this, Uncle.

49
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,440
Why did the Judgment Hall
report this matter to me so quickly today?

50
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
Uncle,

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,920
Jixing Abyss
is no longer yours to control alone.

52
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,720
Uncle Qibai is growing ever more brazen,

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,240
even consorting with
people from Zhushui Spiritual State.

54
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,360
Your Highness, what should we do next?

55
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,480
Now that the Judgment Hall
no longer obeys Lord Hanfeng,

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
can we not accuse him directly?

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,440
Though he is no longer what he once was,
it's still not easy to bring him down.

58
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,840
We must awaken my father,

59
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
no matter

60
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,920
what it takes.

61
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,880
You really don't understand your master.

62
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,240
He'd never turn his back on Ming Yi.

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,640
You're so loud.

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,960
Last night, His Lordship
took your master's fiancée

65
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,520
to the hot springs to heal and keep warm.

66
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,520
Instead of gossiping here,
you'd better keep an eye out

67
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,880
before your master
ends up getting cheated on.

68
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,360
I can't be bothered.
It's not me who'll get cheated on.

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,080
Th… thanks.

70
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,280
You may dislike us most of the time,

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,320
but knowing the danger, you went with me
to Dragon Carp Terrace to rescue them.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,280
You're actually a decent person,

73
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,840
loyal when it counts.

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,800
If you had gone alone and been caught,

75
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,200
you might not have withstood the torture
and revealed secrets about Wugui Sea.

76
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,960
That would've brought
real trouble upon His Lordship.

77
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
Besides, when His Lordship was struck
by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

78
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
Fairy Ming Yi helped us.

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,280
So by that reckoning, I owe her one.

80
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,400
Then by your logic,
since you helped me beat Sun Liao,

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,200
I owe you a favor too.

82
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,920
-No need…
-How about this?

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
I'll grant you three wishes.

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,480
No need. Don't make a big deal out of it.

85
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,960
Tell you what, for the first wish,
I'll go fishing with you.

86
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,360
Sounds like you're
the one who wants to fish.

87
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,280
And don't you dare
steal my dried fish again.

88
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,440
Fine. That counts as the second wish.

89
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

90
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,640
Very well.
Then you'll buy the fishing rods.

91
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,080
I just sent a message to Master She,

92
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,680
asking him to study
the Soul-seizing Technique

93
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
to see if it can
suppress the Heavenly Grief,

94
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,280
since you used your spiritual veins

95
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,880
but didn't suffer
any aftereffects this time.

96
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,480
Thank you for worrying about me.

97
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Why are you being so polite? You…

98
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,920
What's wrong?

99
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,280
Ming Yi, no matter how much you like him,

100
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
stay focused on what truly matters.

101
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,240
You have only one life.

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,920
True.

103
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,640
If one dies,

104
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,880
any amount of love won't matter.

105
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,400
When I finally steal
the Golden Millet Dream,

106
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,919
he'll think I've
been lying to him all along

107
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,000
and will hate me for it.

108
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,120
And everything will be over.

109
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,360
He's always been cold and decisive.

110
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,280
It won't take long for him to get over me.

111
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
It won't.

112
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Master.

113
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
After everything that's happened,

114
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,960
I find myself no longer concerned
about her past.

115
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Her true identity no longer matters to me.

116
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,400
As long as I know

117
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
she truly cares about me,

118
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
that is enough.

119
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,760
Whatever the future holds,

120
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,120
I trust her.

121
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,920
Your Lordship, though you've refined
the netherbeast core successfully,

122
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
your body is also weakened by it.

123
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,920
Please take care of yourself.

124
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,480
Don't worry. I know my limits.

125
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,360
Sun Liao, Jixing Abyss
had no chance in the first place.

126
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,240
If not for the miasma of the Sunken Abyss
perfect for breeding netherbeasts,

127
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,000
Father would never have entrusted
such an important task to Lord Hanfeng.

128
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Now, the netherbeast army is gone,

129
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,880
and my elder brother
has died so strangely in Jixing Abyss.

130
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,200
How am I supposed
to explain this to Father?

131
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,560
Your Lordship…

132
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,560
Please, I beg you
to keep this matter secret!

133
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Look, your father has so many sons.

134
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,640
If they all stay alive,
how could he ever value you?

135
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,160
Don't you think so?

136
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,440
In our realm,
brothers and friends respect each other.

137
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
But lowlifes like you
have corrupted our relationship.

138
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,160
Anyway, since the netherbeasts
have already been refined by Ji Bozai,

139
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
it's time for your realm to fall.

140
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,040
Let's start with you.

141
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,960
Your Lordship, spare me!

142
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,960
Please spare me!

143
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,440
In fact, Lord Hanfeng
still has a trick up his sleeve.

144
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,440
He's secretly kept
an unformed netherbeast.

145
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,960
Chao Yu hasn't
returned to Zhushui for so long,

146
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,080
so Father sent me
to check on the situation.

147
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,840
But who would've thought?

148
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,200
Chao Yu actually died.

149
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
What is this awful tea?

150
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,520
Anyway, this is a simple matter.

151
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,960
I can just go back and say
that to form a netherbeast army,

152
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,560
my elder brother unexpectedly
exhausted his spiritual power

153
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,160
and decided to
make the ultimate sacrifice.

154
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Touching, isn't it?

155
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,800
This will make a great story to tell!

156
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,120
It will also solve a big problem for you.

157
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,240
I appreciate your kindness, Your Lordship,
but I'm afraid I don't understand.

158
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,840
The netherbeasts
have been refined by Ji Bozai

159
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,200
and disappeared from the world.

160
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,560
How can we come up

161
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,840
with a satisfying explanation
to your father?

162
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,280
Even now,

163
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
you are still lying.

164
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,080
Sun Liao already confessed.

165
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080
Listen carefully.

166
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
Hand over the netherbeast you've hidden.

167
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Only then can I cover for you
in front of Father.

168
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,640
Your Lordship, you listen carefully.

169
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,600
The beast is in my hands.

170
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
If you want my help,
you should say "please."

171
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
"Please"?

172
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,200
-You…!
-Do you even know how to use

173
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,400
what I have?

174
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
If you cooperate with me

175
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,240
and pin everything on that mute corpse,

176
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,280
once my great cause is accomplished,

177
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,760
everything in Jixing Abyss
will be credited to you.

178
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,120
Then you'd better hurry.
Father doesn't have my patience.

179
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,840
Where's the "please"?

180
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,320
Please hurry.

181
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,080
Ming Yi, how are you feeling now?

182
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,440
I'm fine. Thank you
for your concern, Immortal Situ.

183
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,680
But I'm curious.

184
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,360
How did you know about it so quickly?

185
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
Even Princess Tianji and the others came.

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,520
I just regret I couldn't come sooner.

187
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,760
By the barrier, they found
a body that couldn't be identified.

188
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
The Judgment Hall has examined it,

189
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,840
but we still can't
confirm its identity yet.

190
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,920
Was there a wound
on the wrist of that body?

191
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,600
I didn't see the person's face,

192
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,480
but I saw a cut on his wrist.

193
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,120
Yes, there was indeed.

194
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,360
Right?

195
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,600
But I heard the body was burned
into a charred skeleton by magic.

196
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,280
Immortal Situ, how could you
tell there was a wound on his wrist?

197
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,320
Perhaps…

198
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,400
Ming Yi,

199
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
if I didn't kill him,

200
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,360
he would've killed you.

201
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,440
She cares about me after all.

202
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,920
NOTICE: THE SOUL-HIDING NAIL LAW FOR
WOMEN HAS BEEN ABOLISHED IN JIXING ABYSS

203
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,920
From now on, women
with spiritual veins in Jixing Abyss

204
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
don't need to have
Soul-hiding Nails anymore!

205
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,240
That's great! Does this mean
there will be female warriors?

206
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,720
The Princess did a great thing!

207
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,320
-Madam, I'll take this one.
-All right. Thank you.

208
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,160
Zhang Tai, you were gravely injured.

209
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,880
Are you really okay now?

210
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,120
Don't worry.
Princess Tianji treated my wounds.

211
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
You also had your young friend,
Twenty-Seven, send me medicine,

212
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,720
and I took it.

213
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,480
I've never felt better.

214
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,760
Don't worry about me.

215
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
-Madam, I'll take this too.
-Sure.

216
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,160
-It was all my fault.
-Thank you.

217
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,560
If something serious
had happened to you, I really…

218
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Don't say that.

219
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,400
By the way, did you notice
anything different about me today?

220
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,240
You've applied red blush
and painted your eyebrows dark green.

221
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,640
No, it's not that.

222
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,120
Look, I can use spiritual veins now!

223
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,120
After I got injured,
Princess Tianji's people treated me,

224
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
and they discovered my Soul-hiding Nail.

225
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,960
They asked if I wanted it removed,
and of course, I said yes.

226
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,280
So now, I also have spiritual veins!

227
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,760
Although I can't break
through to a higher stage,

228
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
my cultivation has still improved a lot.

229
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,600
In the future, making hairpins
will be much easier for me.

230
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,800
It must've hurt a lot
to remove the nail, right?

231
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,680
At least now you can do what you love.

232
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,840
All right, you've seen me.

233
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,280
Now hurry back.

234
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,280
Immortal Ji has been waiting
for you for so long.

235
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,240
What's going on between you two?

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,040
Oh, please don't ask.

237
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
I don't want to lie to
you, but I can't tell you either.

238
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I…

239
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,200
Actually, I've known for a long time
that you have many secrets.

240
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,160
I don't want to ask about them,

241
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
but I can tell
Immortal Ji really likes you

242
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,920
and treats you well.

243
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,880
Of course, that doesn't matter.
What matters is how you feel.

244
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,440
You like him too, don't you?

245
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,720
Yes.

246
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,000
Despite everything, I've fallen for him.

247
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,520
But it won't last.

248
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
But Ming Yi, you know what?

249
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,600
In this world,
moments of happiness are rare.

250
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,800
You may part ways in the future,

251
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,080
but you still feel overjoyed
to see him now, don't you?

252
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,920
Madam, please wrap this up for me.

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,880
Sure.

254
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,520
It seems you're unwilling to do it.

255
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,160
No worries. I won't force you.

256
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,480
After all, even if you don't do it,
I have other ways to get it done.

257
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
But once it's done,

258
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,360
I will still tell everyone
that you did it.

259
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,320
You must be joking, Lord Hanfeng.

260
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,720
I am but a humble physician
with little skill.

261
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,480
If you spread such a story,
no one will believe it.

262
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,760
How could that be?

263
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,520
That's exactly what makes it believable.

264
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
You, a humble physician

265
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,720
with little skill,
chose to serve me for your own good.

266
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
Then one day,

267
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,160
you made your move against
the Emperor to pledge your loyalty.

268
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,880
Doesn't that sound reasonable?

269
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,280
Since you'll end up the culprit anyway,

270
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,040
why not just do it
and take full credit for it?

271
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,200
Immortal Yan,
the Princess wants to see you.

272
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,120
Immortal Yan, please go over there.

273
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,920
Your Highness.

274
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,360
Your Highness,
why have you called for me today?

275
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,440
I'm feeling unwell,

276
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,200
so I want you to check on me.

277
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,960
You look fine.

278
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,720
How could you be unwell?

279
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
I had a nightmare.

280
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
I dreamt that you killed my father,

281
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,120
and it left me unsettled.

282
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
Your pulse is rapid and tense.

283
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,160
I don't think the nightmare caused it.

284
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
It's more like you are…

285
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,080
nervous.

286
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Why would I be nervous?

287
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
I think you are the one who's nervous.

288
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,160
Did Your Highness
summon me just to tease me?

289
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,200
You may leave now.

290
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,880
Father!

291
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,480
Your Highness, give it back to me.

292
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,480
What do you mean?

293
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't understand.

294
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,880
You can play dumb now,
but I will report to Lord Hanfeng

295
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,800
and sabotage whatever you plan to do.

296
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,280
Then go ahead and tell my uncle.

297
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,520
I will say

298
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,520
that you gave it to me willingly.

299
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,040
Take a guess.

300
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,920
With you leaving
my Jade Rabbit Hall at midnight

301
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,880
and me

302
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
looking so disheveled,

303
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,560
who will he believe?

304
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,360
Your Highness,

305
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,760
do you know what you're doing?

306
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
Do you think I'm too afraid to act?

307
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,160
I just miss my father too much.

308
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,280
What's wrong with that?

309
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,720
I will return it to you.

310
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,320
No one will know what happened.

311
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,800
Just help me this once.

312
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,080
Just once.

313
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,000
Please, Xiao?

314
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Why?

315
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Why are you doing this? I trusted you!

316
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,360
You know full well

317
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,240
that Uncle Qibai caused
my father's unconsciousness.

318
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,560
He only assigned you
to monitor my father's condition

319
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,120
so you could keep him unconscious!

320
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,600
I know

321
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,960
most of Jixing Abyss
now follows Uncle Qibai's orders

322
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,600
because he can offer them
a path to power and keep them safe.

323
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,800
But that's their choice.

324
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,640
I don't care about what they choose.

325
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
But you can't do this to me.

326
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,280
Why are you doing this?
You can't do this to me!

327
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,120
Fine. I'll only ask one thing of you.

328
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Sooner or later,
Uncle Qibai will take my father's life.

329
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
When that day comes,

330
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,480
please help me keep my father alive.

331
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,960
Will you do it for me?

332
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm begging you, Xiao.

333
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,440
Your Highness, you've overestimated me.

334
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,720
Yes, Lord Hanfeng made me
His Majesty's physician,

335
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
but if he wants His Majesty dead,

336
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,280
what right do I have to oppose his will?

337
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,400
I never thought

338
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
you'd be

339
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,200
so despicable and shameless,

340
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,720
only following the wind to gain favor.

341
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
You're truly pathetic.

342
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,240
I don't know anything.

343
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,840
I never came here.

344
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,400
GRANNY'S EATERY

345
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,320
It's ready. It smells great.

346
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
Here, Wheat,
take it to the table over there.

347
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,160
Sir, here's your scallion pancake.

348
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,400
Please enjoy.

349
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,840
He's all you can see, huh?

350
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,840
Madam.

351
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,600
You've grown taller.

352
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,720
Go on. Go back to work.

353
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,800
Since you refined the netherbeast core,
Mu Qibai has been lying low.

354
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,920
-I suspect he's up to something.
-Be patient.

355
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,320
He's in the shadows,
but we're not necessarily in the light.

356
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,440
I've had Buxiu keep an eye on Mu Qibai.

357
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,760
We'll find out
what he's up to sooner or later.

358
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,680
You said you brought me here
to discuss matters,

359
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,560
but I feel like it's just an excuse.

360
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,600
Really?

361
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,720
In fact,

362
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,520
that night, I was under the influence
of the Soul-seizing Technique.

363
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,760
That's why I said things I shouldn't have.

364
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,400
Shouldn't we talk about serious matters?

365
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,640
Otherwise, it'll seem like
I'm really after something else.

366
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,760
Father, you're awake.

367
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,680
Why have you lost weight?

368
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
In my dreams,

369
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,800
I kept catching you stealing candy.

370
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
That's not true.

371
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,320
Lord Ji, you suffered greatly
refining the netherbeast core.

372
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,320
The netherbeasts must
have undermined your will, right?

373
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,800
They had been trying to tempt me
into accepting their power.

374
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,400
The netherbeasts are indeed tempting.

375
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Whether it's Mu Qibai or the other realms,

376
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,760
none would willingly give up that power.

377
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,800
Without a strong will,

378
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,719
one would surely be corrupted
by the netherbeast core.

379
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,120
Luckily, it was you.

380
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,440
Luckily, it was me?

381
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,880
Do you trust me that much?

382
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,360
Immortal Ji, His Majesty summons you.

383
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

384
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,720
You don't seem surprised
to have been summoned so suddenly.

385
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,400
Of course not.
I've been waiting for this day.

386
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,960
Tianji somehow cured
the illness that afflicted me.

387
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,520
Her Highness must have sensed the danger

388
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,320
and feared Your Majesty might be harmed.

389
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Harmed?

390
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
Are you talking about Lord Hanfeng?

391
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,080
While Your Majesty lay unconscious,

392
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,200
Lord Hanfeng's intentions
became clear to all.

393
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Your Majesty, you must've heard
I refined the netherbeast core

394
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,520
and sensed Lord Hanfeng's moves.

395
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,920
Do you now see how urgent it is

396
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,960
to root out these hidden dangers?

397
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,960
I beg you to be resolute.

398
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Bai is my only brother.

399
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,640
Of course I know what he wants.

400
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,640
He's impatient and often plots against me.

401
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,200
He even sent
a physician to keep watch over me.

402
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,400
I know very well what he's been up to.

403
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
But when I remember

404
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,400
how naive and innocent
this younger brother of mine once was,

405
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
I can't bring myself to be harsh.

406
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,600
But never… never did I expect…

407
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,840
Never did you expect
him to be so driven by greed,

408
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
colluding with Zhushui Spiritual State,

409
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,040
breeding netherbeasts,

410
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,240
and endangering the Six Realms.

411
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,160
You have done much for Jixing Abyss,
and I'm deeply grateful.

412
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,440
But the netherbeast
army was a direct threat

413
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,040
to the Six Realms.

414
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,840
Yet you handled it alone
and did not report it.

415
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,920
Think of the consequences.

416
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Half of Jixing Abyss follows Lord Hanfeng.

417
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,120
Immortal Ji was only trying
to prevent news from leaking.

418
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,360
Besides, it was precisely because
you once let Uncle Qibai grow strong

419
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,920
that we are in this crisis now.

420
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
Under these circumstances,
it was only natural

421
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,000
that Immortal Ji found
Jixing Palace hard to trust.

422
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,360
I swore as a child
to do everything I could

423
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,160
to stop Uncle Qibai
from harming you again.

424
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,120
Now, no one knows what he will do next.

425
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
So,

426
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,680
no matter how reluctant you feel,

427
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,280
I ask you

428
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,840
to put Jixing Abyss first
and seize Uncle Qibai at once.

429
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
Immortal Ji, I'd also like to ask you

430
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,360
to trust us once more
and join us in protecting Jixing Abyss.

431
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,440
Jixing Palace is indeed hard to trust,

432
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,720
but not all who hold power
are slaves to it.

433
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,920
For the sake of the Six Realms,
I'm willing to unite as many as I can.

434
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,240
But Mu Qibai has
Zhushui Spiritual State behind him.

435
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,440
Alone, we can hardly rival them.

436
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,720
Please, Your Majesty,
think about the people of Jixing Abyss

437
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,920
and order Mu Qibai's arrest.

438
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,080
Please, Father, arrest him at once.

439
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,960
Yuanfeng, you haven't fully recovered.
You should be resting.

440
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,560
If there's anything you need,
just have someone send word for you.

441
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,240
I've been hearing
many disturbing rumors lately.

442
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,440
Most of them are about you.

443
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,120
Now that my condition has improved,

444
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,120
I'd like to hear
the truth from you directly.

445
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,160
What rumors?

446
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,560
I'm being subtle
because you are my blood brother.

447
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,560
But if you still won't confess
to forming a netherbeast army,

448
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,280
I will have no choice but to take action.

449
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Who made up these rumors?

450
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,240
They're pure fabrications, nonsense!

451
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,360
Yuanfeng,
are you going to believe outsiders

452
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,760
over your own brother?

453
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,440
Qibai,

454
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,680
when did you become like this?

455
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,400
Like what?

456
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,760
You've been fragile since childhood.

457
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,040
You used to be gentle and considerate.

458
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,600
When we trained together back then,
you were so kind.

459
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,760
You'd rather get hurt yourself
than harm others.

460
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,600
"Rather"?

461
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,080
"I'd rather"?

462
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,360
I couldn't, Yuanfeng!

463
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,560
If I'd been a bit stronger,
I wouldn't have always been defeated.

464
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,760
If my elder brother
had been a bit more decisive,

465
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,600
we wouldn't have been
constantly hindered by those old fools,

466
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,720
unable to clean up the rot!

467
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,240
If you had been a bit more resolute,

468
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,440
Jixing Abyss wouldn't have kept
ending up among the Lower Three Realms!

469
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,680
And even now, you, my incompetent brother,

470
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,880
are still reminiscing about my so-called
kindness, gentleness, and mercy.

471
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,520
You don't deserve
to sit in this chair at all!

472
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,760
Yuanfeng, Jixing Abyss won't fall
because of the netherbeast army.

473
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,920
It will fall because of people like you.

474
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,560
Chao Yu is dead.

475
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,600
The news of the nameless
charred corpse at Dragon Carp Terrace

476
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,160
has already spread far and wide.

477
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,080
The Emperor of Zhushui
will surely investigate thoroughly.

478
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,280
Your Lordship, be careful.

479
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,760
Don't let them find out.

480
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,720
Don't worry. I won't.

481
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,520
To outsiders,
Mu Qibai is the one who last saw Chao Yu.

482
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,000
He is the perfect scapegoat.

483
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,760
Besides, with
the netherbeasts refined by Ji Bozai,

484
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,960
Mu Qibai no longer has value to them.

485
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,080
They won't let him off.

486
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,840
Today, the Emperor
of Jixing detained Mu Qibai.

487
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,320
-Today?
-Yes.

488
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,080
It hasn't been officially announced.

489
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
It seems that Ji Bozai

490
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,600
has gained the upper hand
in this game after all.

491
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,920
How could it have gone so smoothly?
