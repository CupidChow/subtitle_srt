00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,440
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,960
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
"LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 1

4
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
<i>I am</i>

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,840
<i>Ming Xian,</i>
<i>Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.</i>

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,840
<i>Since I was 13,</i>

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
<i>I have fought in the Qingyun Tournament.</i>

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,440
<i>I've brought victory to Yaoguang Mountain</i>
<i>for seven consecutive years.</i>

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,440
<i>Since childhood, I've used</i>
<i>magic to disguise myself as a man.</i>

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,040
<i>In the eyes of others, I am a man.</i>

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,680
<i>They call me</i>
<i>the mightiest Warrior God of Hexu</i>

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>and see me as a hero.</i>

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
<i>But I am no hero.</i>

14
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
MING ZHENGHUI,
EMPEROR OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,760
<i>I simply never dared to relax,</i>

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,400
<i>because winning</i>
<i>the Blessed Rain is my duty.</i>

17
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
<i>Ever since I could remember,</i>

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
<i>I've been told that I could only win,</i>

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>that I must win,</i>
<i>and that I must keep winning.</i>

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,640
- Ming Xian!
- Ming Xian!

21
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,440
JI BOZAI, A WARRIOR OF JIXING ABYSS

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,480
I knew there was a fish
that slipped through the net.

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,160
Why do you not strike?

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Why have they both vanished?

25
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,040
Ming Xian can't
lose to Jixing Abyss, right?

26
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,280
Of course he won.

27
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,560
Your Highness, can we really
defeat Ming Xian this time?

28
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,600
<i>My spiritual power is</i>
<i>restrained in this space.</i>

29
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,360
<i>I can't even maintain my armor.</i>

30
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,840
<i>This man is no ordinary fighter.</i>

31
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,160
A Jixing Abyss warrior
with such spiritual power…

32
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Who are you really?

33
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,840
You are trapped in my Spirit Well,

34
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,680
yet you still speak with such conceit?

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
Even within your Spirit Well,

36
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,800
I can defeat you with weakened strength.

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
Is that so?

38
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,440
Impressive, Warrior God.

39
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,160
You even forged
a weapon with your own blood.

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,920
I will win.

41
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
That is the only thing I know.

42
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
Everyone can lose.

43
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,240
You can too.

44
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,400
JING SHU, EMPRESS OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

45
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,280
- Ming Xian is defeated?
- Look, Father!

46
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
He's severely injured.

47
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,240
- Yes.
- How disappointing.

48
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,320
In this tournament of two realms,

49
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,240
Jixing Abyss wins!

50
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,160
Jixing Abyss rises.

51
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,800
Yaoguang Mountain falls.

52
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,320
Let the Blessed Rain descend!

53
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Your Highness, we have won!

54
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
I knew I did not misjudge him.

55
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,120
- Blessed Rain!
- It's the Blessed Rain!

56
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,400
- It really is the Blessed Rain!
- It really is the Blessed Rain!

57
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Seven years have passed.

58
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,400
The Blessed Rain has
finally descended upon Jixing Abyss!

59
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
How dare this loser show his face?

60
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
- Exactly!
- Right!

61
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,120
- It's all his fault!
- How dare he?

62
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,160
Right!

63
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,280
The Blessed Rain was
within reach, yet he let it slip away!

64
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,320
Without the Blessed Rain,

65
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
Yaoguang Mountain's
spirit light will fade,

66
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
and the land will dry up!

67
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,200
Without the Blessed Rain,

68
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,480
no spirit stones will form.

69
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
How are we going to live?

70
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,400
Exactly.

71
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,760
You don't deserve to be our Warrior God!

72
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
How can we survive?

73
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,400
We are doomed.

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
<i>I am Ming Xian,</i>
<i>Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.</i>

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,480
<i>Since I was 13, I have</i>
<i>fought in the Qingyun Tournament.</i>

76
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,880
<i>I won for seven consecutive years,</i>

77
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,360
<i>yet it feels as though I never won at all.</i>

78
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,480
YAOGUANG PALACE, YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

79
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
CHAMBER OF EASE, YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

80
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,559
Ming Xian!

81
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,240
Ming Xian, what happened to you?

82
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,480
TWENTY-SEVEN,
MING XIAN'S COMPANION BEAST

83
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,400
Twenty-Seven,

84
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,320
my spiritual veins are broken.

85
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,000
How can that be?

86
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
It seems I have been poisoned,

87
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
by something potent.

88
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,200
He did it.

89
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,360
Despicable.

90
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,720
Mother.

91
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,640
I order you to leave.

92
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
Depart Yaoguang Mountain at once.

93
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,520
Mother, are you banishing me?

94
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,880
Your spiritual veins are severed.

95
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,440
If you remain here, you will only die

96
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,480
at the hands of those
coveting the Crown Prince's seat.

97
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
Mother,

98
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,880
I can restore my spiritual veins.

99
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
At the next Qingyun Tournament,

100
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
I will win back a thousandfold

101
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,360
of what Yaoguang Mountain has lost.

102
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,520
I can still be of use to you.

103
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,520
Please, do not send me away.

104
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,560
Ming Xian, listen.

105
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
I am not casting you out.

106
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,920
I just want you to live and be safe.

107
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,720
How laughable my life has been,

108
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,920
ever cautious, walking on thin ice.

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,880
From the moment you were born,

110
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,280
I made you use the Veil of Illusion

111
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,000
to take on the guise of a prince.

112
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,120
You could have
lived as a simple fairy maiden.

113
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,080
This supreme art of deception

114
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,120
has made you appear to all

115
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,760
<i>as a man.</i>

116
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,280
But with your spiritual veins broken,

117
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,080
all we've done is now in vain.

118
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,920
Ming Xian,

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,760
staying in Yaoguang Mountain

120
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
will only bring you danger.

121
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
I am letting you go.

122
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,720
Remove the Veil of Illusion

123
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,680
and return to your true form.

124
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
No one will know who you are.

125
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,320
Live well,

126
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,760
and never come back.

127
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,720
Mother, don't worry.

128
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
I will restore my spiritual veins

129
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,040
and rejoin the tournament one day.

130
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,080
TWO MONTHS LATER

131
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,040
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS, JIXING ABYSS

132
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,440
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

133
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,040
Immortal Ji?

134
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,360
I am going to another immortal then.

135
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
Don't go.

136
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,920
Immortal Ji, you really treat
Moonlit Blossoms as your own home.

137
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
The moment the Qingyun Tournament ended,

138
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
you came here.

139
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,960
You've even stayed here
longer than I have.

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,920
I fought bitterly in the tournament

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,760
for no other reason

142
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,320
than to have whatever I wanted.

143
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
No, you want

144
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
whatever I have.

145
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh?

146
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,360
Then tell me,

147
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,600
what do you have?

148
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
Immortal Ji, have a grape.

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,560
With so many fairies waiting here for me,

150
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,560
I shouldn't favor one over another, right?

151
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,760
Many thanks, Immortal Ji!

152
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,880
Sir, please.

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
MING XIAN,
CROWN PRINCE OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

154
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,400
MING YI,
AN ATTENDANT OF MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

155
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
<i>That Ji Bozai…</i>

156
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,480
<i>Since winning the Qingyun Tournament,</i>

157
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,280
<i>he's spent his days in debauchery.</i>

158
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,640
<i>As expected, he is a shameless scoundrel.</i>

159
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,600
<i>Two months have passed,</i>
<i>yet I still cannot get close to him.</i>

160
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
<i>Today, he's hosting</i>
<i>a grand banquet to celebrate</i>

161
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
<i>being named the Qingyun Warrior.</i>

162
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,840
<i>I must seize this chance to approach him.</i>

163
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,440
I heard from my friends
about the Qingyun Tournament.

164
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,560
You know how it is in places like this.

165
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,880
One tale can turn
into hundreds of versions.

166
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,160
They say you fight valiantly
and are unmatched in battle.

167
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
SUN LIAO, A WARRIOR OF JIXING ABYSS

168
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,720
Surely you couldn't have been

169
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,480
defeated by Ming Xian with a single move.

170
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,960
Who said I was?

171
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,520
Was it Ji Bozai?

172
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,080
No, Immortal Sun.

173
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
Ji Bozai is full of nonsense.

174
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,560
What…

175
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,480
What does this have
to do with Immortal Ji?

176
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,400
Then why did you say such things to me?

177
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
You're mistaken, Immortal Sun.

178
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,000
I only meant…

179
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,360
<i>Now.</i>

180
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,400
<i>First, play the damsel in distress.</i>

181
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>Then I'll get close to him.</i>

182
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,600
Excuse me.

183
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,640
<i>He didn't fall for it?</i>

184
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,000
Did you think
Immortal Ji would take your side?

185
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,200
Immortal Sun, this is a misunderstanding.

186
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,360
Immortal Ji
never said a word about you to me.

187
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,080
Please, don't blame him.

188
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
Ji Bozai,

189
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,960
have you been spreading rumors
about how I fared in the tournament?

190
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,160
You, a former Sunken Abyss prisoner,
only gained spiritual veins by chance

191
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
and became a warrior
through Princess Tianji's favor.

192
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
What,

193
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,520
is gossip behind people's backs
all you're good for?

194
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
Sun Liao,

195
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,600
you are actually quite skilled.

196
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,440
It's just
that Ming Xian struck too quickly.

197
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,360
You…!

198
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,640
What a pity.
You are a step too late again.

199
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,560
You…

200
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, well, once again I see you

201
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,560
fighting for the sake

202
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,240
of a fairy maiden, Immortal Ji.

203
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Sun Liao,

204
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,840
this is Immortal Ji's celebratory banquet.

205
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,040
Don't make a scene.

206
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,440
Consider yourself lucky.

207
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
<i>This man is truly hard to approach.</i>

208
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,960
<i>I must think of another way.</i>

209
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,280
Immortal Ji, the food and wine are ready.

210
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
The banquet may begin.

211
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,680
Congratulations, Immortal Ji,
on winning the Qingyun Tournament.

212
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,720
May I have the honor of toasting you?

213
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,000
Immortal Ji, your valor in the tournament

214
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,920
brought the Blessed Rain to Jixing Abyss.

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,960
It is an honor to see you today.

216
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,360
Allow me to toast you.

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,600
<i>Master said my time was running out.</i>

218
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,720
Ming Xian, let me see your injury
from the Qingyun Tournament.

219
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
Master, I don't know what poison it is,

220
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
but my spiritual veins are broken.

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,520
Listen. The poison in you is called

222
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,720
Heavenly Grief.

223
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,079
For those with spiritual veins,
it destroys them.

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,440
For those without, it grants them.

225
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,440
From now on,
don't use your spiritual veins again,

226
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,240
or the poison will only spread faster.

227
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,440
This mark is called the Grief Blossom.

228
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,000
When all seven petals fall,

229
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,880
your primordial spirit will be burned out.

230
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,360
So, within a year,

231
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,800
you must find
the antidote, Golden Millet Dream,

232
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,200
and take it to
restore your spiritual veins,

233
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,760
or you will die.

234
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,480
Since the poison came from Ji Bozai,

235
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
he may hold the Golden Millet Dream.

236
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,920
Go to Jixing Abyss and find him.

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,560
Once I get rid of the pursuers,
I will come to you.

238
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,440
<i>He refuses food and drink from others</i>
<i>because he fears they might be poisoned.</i>

239
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,000
<i>Truly, an evil man</i>
<i>sees evil in all things.</i>

240
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,800
Lord Hanfeng has arrived!

241
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
No need for formalities.

242
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,360
I cannot stand them.

243
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,760
Hands down, all of you.

244
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,400
From now on, act like Bozai.

245
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,360
Wherever you see me,

246
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,080
greet me as you would an old friend.

247
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Wouldn't that be nice?

248
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
Lord Hanfeng, was that a dig at me?

249
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
I wouldn't dare disrespect you.

250
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
When I was still a prisoner,

251
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,960
I had to kneel even to a noble's pet.

252
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,440
Though I am better off now,

253
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,040
I ask only for a life
where I need not bow.

254
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,680
I've always liked this side of you.

255
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,280
Today is a fine day, Bozai.

256
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,120
You've been named the Qingyun Warrior.

257
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
I've brought a small gift to
express my congratulations.

258
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Your Wugui Sea is far too desolate.

259
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,320
Even the one servant
you have is already old.

260
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,240
That's hardly acceptable.

261
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,160
My niece Tianji is the one to blame.

262
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,200
Though she is in charge of
Jixing Abyss's Shouhua Academy,

263
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,800
she has yet to live up to her station.

264
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,720
She didn't even think
to assign you attendants.

265
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
Today, I've brought you two maids.

266
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,520
From now on, they can handle
your accounts and household tasks.

267
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,800
Bozai, are
you happy with this gift of mine?

268
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,800
Lord Hanfeng, must you keep
such a close eye on Wugui Sea?

269
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,480
<i>Just as I thought,</i>
<i>there are rifts within Jixing Abyss.</i>

270
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,560
It's not that I don't appreciate it.

271
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,800
Tonight's feast
is hosted by Princess Tianji in my honor,

272
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,280
yet you suddenly arrived with two maids.

273
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,440
If I take them back,
won't that upset Princess Tianji?

274
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,320
So you dare not offend Princess Tianji,

275
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,320
but you have no fear of offending me?

276
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,920
Bozai,
are you sure you are turning down my gift?

277
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Is Immortal Ji really
turning down Lord Hanfeng's gift?

278
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,320
He's turning it down?

279
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,760
Won't Lord Hanfeng be offended?

280
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,680
<i>This is my chance.</i>

281
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,760
I object! Lord Ji, you just promised

282
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,560
to take me back to Wugui Sea.

283
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,840
Did I say that?

284
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
You did.

285
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,240
I must have made too many promises
and forgotten.

286
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Then why don't you
take all three back with you?

287
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,760
- Wouldn't that make quite a story?
- Right.

288
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,320
Yes, take all of them back.

289
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
That's a fine idea.

290
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,520
I will have carriages and boats prepared

291
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,640
to send you all back together.

292
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,080
- Great!
- Good idea!

293
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Take them all back!

294
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,960
Yes, take them all!

295
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,760
- Right.
- Yes, take them all back.

296
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,120
- No way!
- Exactly.

297
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,120
There isn't enough room!

298
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,640
Wugui Sea may be remote,

299
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,920
but as Immortal Ji's reward,

300
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,120
it is spacious and tranquil.

301
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm sure it can hold
more than a few people.

302
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
- Yes!
- Naturally!

303
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,080
- Exactly!
- Well said!

304
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,280
- Immortal Ji should take them all back!
- Lord Ji…

305
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,920
That's right!

306
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,360
Hold on.

307
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,760
Everyone, Wugui Sea is not a fish pond.

308
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,680
Besides, my energy is limited.

309
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
Here's what we'll do.

310
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,400
Ladies, I will ask you one question,

311
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,400
and I will take
the one who pleases me most

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,880
with her answer.

313
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,040
How about that?

314
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
- Good idea!
- Great!

315
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,280
Let's do it!

316
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,160
Since you are to serve in my abode,

317
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,280
tell me, what spirit beasts
are kept in Wugui Sea,

318
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
and how would you tend to them?

319
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,080
<i>The water in Wugui Sea is stagnant.</i>
<i>Nothing can survive there.</i>

320
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,960
<i>But if I give the right answer,</i>
<i>I could draw suspicion.</i>

321
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,960
You go first. Yes, you.

322
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Wugui Sea…

323
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,280
Like rivers, lakes, and ponds,

324
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,400
it has… turtles,

325
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,320
fish, and shrimp, right?

326
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,760
Lord Ji, my loyalty to you

327
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,240
surpasses any spirit beast,

328
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
and my devotion is
deeper than the Wugui Sea.

329
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,840
Your turn.

330
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,000
The water in Wugui Sea is stagnant.

331
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
Nothing can survive there.

332
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,360
There isn't a single spirit beast there.

333
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,360
That's right.

334
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
Ignorant fairy,

335
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,840
do you really know Immortal Ji at all?

336
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,320
Do you even know what he likes?

337
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,840
Lord Ji, please give me one more chance.
I'll get it right this time.

338
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,080
She knows nothing.

339
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,920
Even if he gave
her another chance, it would be wasted.

340
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,080
Lord Ji…

341
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
She's asking for a second chance?

342
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,160
This fairy keeps pestering Immortal Ji.

343
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,320
Could it be…?

344
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,040
Immortal Ji would never choose her.

345
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
Those two know Immortal Ji so well.

346
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,200
Surely he'll pick either of them.

347
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,360
Lord Hanfeng's choices are never wrong.

348
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,880
I choose…

349
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,840
her.

350
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,880
What?

351
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,680
- Her?
- I envy her.

352
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,360
- Me too.
- I was once a prisoner,

353
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,600
so I know all things in
this world are meaningless,

354
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,480
and only true
devotion deserves to be valued.

355
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,600
This lady…

356
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
- Your name?
- Ming Yi.

357
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,920
Ming Yi.

358
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
Fairy Ming Yi is so devoted to me,

359
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
laying bare her heart to me.

360
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,360
How could I let her down?

361
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Rest assured.

362
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,680
I will never fail you.

363
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,440
As for you two,

364
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,960
it seems
we are just fated to be strangers.

365
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>He is tough to handle.</i>

366
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,240
<i>Still, I'm one step closer to my goal.</i>

367
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,720
WUGUI SEA, JIXING ABYSS

368
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,200
GRANNY XUN, STEWARD OF WUGUI SEA

369
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,640
Your Lordship, you're back.

370
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
Lord Ji,

371
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,560
why did you cover my eyes

372
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,200
the moment we arrived?

373
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,080
Because I like it.

374
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,080
<i>Lord Hanfeng,</i>

375
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,280
<i>Ji Bozai carried that fairy</i>
<i>into the chamber.</i>

376
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,160
Lord Ji,

377
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,080
it must be nearly dawn.

378
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Why not take this blindfold off me?

379
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,240
Lord Ji…

380
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,280
Tonight, you went to great lengths,

381
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
putting on a show,

382
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,680
just so you could follow
me back to Wugui Sea, right?

383
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
You got what you wanted.

384
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,760
You saw right through me, Lord Ji.

385
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
Well done,

386
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,920
keeping the acts coming one after another.

387
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,480
I dismissed two fairies,
and then you showed up.

388
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,240
And your little scene with Sun Liao?
Truly well-coordinated.

389
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,080
That's unfair, Lord Ji.

390
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,880
Questioning my devotion to you

391
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,120
by bringing up
Sun Liao is just humiliating!

392
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,480
That's true.

393
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Could you remove the blindfold for me?

394
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,800
I don't like this.
It feels like an interrogation.

395
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,280
Answer my question first.

396
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Lord Ji,

397
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
do you enjoy questioning women like this?

398
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,600
I never thought you had such a hobby.

399
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,840
Thank you, Lord…

400
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,000
Lord Ji?

401
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,440
Lord Ji,

402
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,400
is it really so strange that I want

403
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,800
to follow you back to Wugui Sea?

404
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,240
Once a Sunken Abyss prisoner,

405
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,440
you rose to fame in one battle.

406
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,280
You are a living legend in Jixing Abyss,

407
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,960
the man we fairies of
Moonlit Blossoms admire most!

408
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,640
I've given you all my heart,

409
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,680
yet you are so cold to me.

410
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,480
I am heartbroken.

411
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,920
Don't treat me this way again.

412
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,960
Your name

413
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,440
is Ming Yi?

414
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,160
"Ming," as in "bright,"
like the moon in your heart.

415
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,320
and "Yi," as in "feelings,"
like the deep ones I hold for you.

416
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Before you worked at Moonlit Blossoms,

417
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,000
what did you do?

418
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
<i>He's still interrogating me.</i>

419
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,560
<i>The more I say, the more risk I take.</i>

420
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,520
<i>I need to silence him somehow.</i>

421
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,440
My family once lived by gathering herbs.

422
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,440
After my parents died,

423
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,960
I came to Moonlit Blossoms.

424
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,120
- So you…
- Why so many questions?

425
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,080
Do you not trust me?

426
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,280
No, you simply don't like me.

427
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,800
If you dislike me,
why did you bring me back here?

428
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,160
Are you all right?

429
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
I don't like women who come on too strong.

430
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,800
<i>Seriously? How desperate is he?</i>

431
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
Fine then.

432
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,280
<i>What's Twenty-Seven doing?</i>

433
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,640
<i>Why hasn't he acted yet?</i>

434
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,680
There's a fire outside. I'll go check.

435
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,440
Lord… Lord Ji, what happened?

436
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,880
Your Lordship,
the pavilion at the back is on fire.

437
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
Please come and see.

438
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
Let's go and check.

439
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,080
I can't let you come along.

440
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
You don't know your way around Wugui Sea.

441
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,880
What if something happens to you?

442
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,520
I will be fine…

443
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,280
This barrier

444
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,320
can only be passed
through by Granny Xun and me.

445
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,240
No one else can enter,

446
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
and you cannot leave either.

447
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,960
This way, you are completely safe.

448
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,280
Wait for me here.

449
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,520
<i>Ugh, that man.</i>

450
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,640
Ming Yi,

451
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,920
with your spiritual veins broken,

452
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,360
you are like an ordinary person now.

453
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,160
You only have a little power
for simple spells.

454
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,760
Don't push yourself.

455
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,160
- I know.
- Are you all right?

456
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,600
Didn't Master She warn you
not to use your spiritual veins?

457
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,040
What if the Grief Blossom withers?

458
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,520
Using this little power
won't stir my spiritual veins.

459
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,840
This is a complex barrier.

460
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,240
I have to break it myself.

461
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
I only asked you to make some noise

462
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,920
to keep him from staying the night.

463
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Why did you go so far?

464
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,920
I am puzzled too.
I did exactly as you said.

465
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,120
I cast a small spell
on that pavilion over there

466
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,720
to create just a tiny flame.

467
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,360
But somehow, it grew into a blaze.

468
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,120
I don't understand how.

469
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,080
Never mind. Get down
to business while he's out.

470
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,000
Where is the thing?

471
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,440
Trouble arose right after Ming Yi arrived.

472
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,320
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

473
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,080
- I will find the cause of the fire.
- No need.

474
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,800
It is only a natural fire.

475
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,240
No need to alarm an outsider.

476
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,400
<i>I don't like women who come on too strong.</i>

477
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,680
<i>I need to stall a bit longer.</i>

478
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,320
<i>Why are there so few layers to this robe?</i>

479
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,680
<i>Why hasn't Buxiu started the fire?</i>

480
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,200
I will put the fire out myself.

481
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,680
WUGUI SEA, JIXING ABYSS

482
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,560
<i>In these two months in Jixing Abyss,</i>

483
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,760
<i>we've learned</i>
<i>that Ji Bozai's spiritual veins</i>

484
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,720
<i>were formed through Heavenly Grief.</i>

485
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,720
<i>Since he used it,</i>

486
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,840
<i>without the Golden Millet Dream,</i>

487
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,320
<i>he would have died already.</i>

488
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,480
<i>The fact that he's still alive</i>

489
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,199
<i>means he must have the antidote.</i>

490
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,320
<i>It's not here.</i>

491
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,639
<i>And it's not here. Where could it be?</i>

492
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,760
The Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream
respond intensely to one another.

493
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
Using this locator
forged with your poisoned blood,

494
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,199
we should be able to find it.

495
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,560
- I'll check over there.
- Your Lordship, mind the steps.

496
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,120
They are coming back! Hide quickly…

497
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,400
<i>You ran off on your own?</i>

498
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,120
We have been gone so long.

499
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,160
I wonder if that little fairy
waited as she was told.

500
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,720
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW

501
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,080
The Confinement Barrier is broken!

502
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,080
Your Lordship, she's not inside.

503
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW
