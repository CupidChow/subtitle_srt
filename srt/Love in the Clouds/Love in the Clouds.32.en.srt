00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,930
Are you all right?

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,660
Does this ring a bell?

Tumi Pagoda Gaol.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,610
There's no escaping from this artifact

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,610
once you're inside.

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,450
You told me you'd destroy it

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,660
after you took it away.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,010
You said Yaoguang Mountain despised all artifacts.

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,410
And now you're using one to imprison me?

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,540
Some artifacts can be used

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,690
to protect Yaoguang Mountain.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,660
Given that I served you as a child for 20 years

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,780
and that I won you the Qingyun tournament for seven consecutive years,

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,410
please

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,130
spare my father.

39
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,380
I will assume full responsibility.

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,340
Everything I do

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,290
is for Yaoguang Mountain.

42
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,780
It is a difficult decision,

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,610
but it must be made.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,890
You made this artifact.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,610
You know you can't escape from it.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,500
No!

47
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,290
Ji Bozai. Don't come in!

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,100
It's too dangerous.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,010
Why did you come in?

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,820
Your Lordship already has a plan in mind.

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,980
It is not my place to say more.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,610
But please remember this:

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,060
no matter what happens,

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,060
you must not open the Spirit Well

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,100
until your spiritual power is fully restored.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,450
Otherwise,

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,660
you might really suffer a relapse.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,380

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,660

You stopped Ming Xin's conferment ceremony for me.

73
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,540
In a way, you helped me

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,370
get back what is rightfully mine.

75
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,850
We don't owe each other anymore.

76
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,980
I still owe you an apology.

I know

78
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,780
there's no way I can compensate you for what they did.

79
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,340
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

80
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,220
I cannot hold it against you.

81
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,660
It's...

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,290
It's such a cruel joke.

83
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,340
I risked everything

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,490

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,580

91
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,780
that when I see you,

92
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,580
I'll be reminded

93
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,700

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,810

I need to reassure everyone.

174
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,460
Ming Yi, your hand...

175
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,370

176
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,700
tell you all something.

00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,340

Ming Xian was your son for 20 years,

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,850
yet you discarded him

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,460
after he lost the Qingyun Tournament once.

184
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,700
And I'm

185
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,890
a son who just came back.

186
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,370
I came

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,340
to negotiate with you.

188
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,610
I fail as a father.

189
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,490
The two previous crown princes were incompetent,

190
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,130

193

195
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,180
As expected of someone carrying my bloodline.

196
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes.

197

Who Ming Xian is doesn't matter.

198
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,340
What I want

199
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,650
is a warrior who can win in the Qingyun Tournament

200
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,980
and a crown prince who commands the people's respect.

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,580
I'm doing this

202
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,700

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,730

205

to be the crown prince?

206
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,980
One, I will join the warrior ranks.

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,420
I will command all warriors.

208
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,010
Sure. That is rightfully yours anyway.

209
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,610

210
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,820
Granted.

211
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,490
She is my first wife.

212
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,220
I promise that she will be cared for.

213

Are you doing this for Ming Xian?

218
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,060

219

it's time to turn the page.

220

Let it go now, Your Majesty.

221
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,580
So Ji Bozai and I were swapped at birth.

222
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,820
My birth mother

223
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,130
is a descendant of the Bo clan in Zhangwei Mountain of Jixing Abyss.

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,980
In a sense,

225
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,730
you can say I'm from Jixing Abyss too.

226
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,610
Lord Chengyun committed a crime,

227
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,850
so he cannot be the heir apparent.

228
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,130
Yaoguang Mountain now needs

229
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,940
a new crown prince to appease everyone.

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,530
But knowing him,

231
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,850
he won't even bat an eye even if someone

232
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,100
hands him Yaoguang Mountain for free.

233
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,850
I'm guessing

234
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,370
that with us in Jixing Abyss, and him in Yaoguang Mountain,

235
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,300
we have the power of two realms

236
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,530
against Zhushui Spiritual State.

237
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,060
And perhaps he wants to be cautious

238
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,420
so he didn't tell us about his plan.

239
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,730
- Look. - What does it say?

240
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,610
The Emperor of Yaoguang hereby declares to all Six Realms

241
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,340
that Ming Xin, Lord Chengyun,

242
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,730
defied the law

243
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,610
and will be deposedf.

244
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,530

245

246
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,580
- He is the crown prince? Impossible. - I can't believe it.

247
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,890
There's no way Ji Bozai is the emperor's son.

248

Can you believe it?

249
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,370
It's like a joke.

250
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,490
Ming Xin should abdicate.

251

that Ji Bozai was the one who defeated Ming Xian in the tournament

285

and won the Blessed Rain for Jixing Abyss?

If Ji Bozai was working with Yaoguang Mountain,

why would he win in the tournament?

Being a warrior in Jixing Abyss and being a crown prince in Yaoguang Mountain

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,180
She must take care of their feelings.

374
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,050
If she takes my side now,

375
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,980
no one in Shouhua Academy can train in peace.

376
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,050
Your allies

377
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,860
like Yan Xiao and Meng Yangqiu

378
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,380
also did not come to your defense.

379
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,900
So what?

380
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,620
But Ming Yi

381
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,700
went everywhere in Jixing Abyss

382
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,490
to take down banners and portraits hurling insults

383
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,380
at you.

384
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,420
By my calculations,

385
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,620
that cat should return soon.

386
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,620
He will keep Ming Yi company.

387
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,330
Ming Yi!

388
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,330
Ming Yi.

389
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,770
Twenty-Seven.

390
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,900
Twenty-Seven.

391
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,010
You're back.

392
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,530
You're finally back.

393
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,330
And everything...

394
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,940
Everything about you is fine.

395
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,460
Twenty-Seven.

396
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,660
I missed you so much.

397
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,140
I knew it.

398
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,220
I knew you'd return.

399
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm sorry, Twenty-Seven.

400
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,090
I failed to protect you.

401
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,940
I...

402
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,860
It's all right.

403
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,940
It's all right.

404
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,330
Come.

405
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,660
I was waiting for you to come back.

406
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,050
I was waiting and waiting.

407
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,700
And finally, you came back.

408
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,810
Come.

409
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,180
Eat anything you want.

410
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,420
But not in excess.

411
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,940
Even if you shed your fur on the bed,

412
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,860
you're still welcome on it.

413
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,330
Welcome home,

414
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,290
Twenty-Seven.

415
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,700
We have enough.

416
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,900
You can climb anywhere you want.

417
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,620
Is this home?

418
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,940
Home is where your family is.

419
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,700
What fur is this?

420
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,490
It's not white or blond.

421
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,900
How come it's this color?

422
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,980
Ming Yi,

423
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,090
all this time, my divine consciousness

424
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,530
was in the bell.

425
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,530
I could hear everything,

426
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,090
including what happened to you recently

427
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,570
and Ji Bozai.

428
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,770
You...

429
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,570
Twenty-Seven.

430
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,250
Ji Bozai will not betray Jixing Abyss

431
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,770
and side with Yaoguang Mountain.

432
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,090
What do you think? Not spicy, right?

433
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,810
You heard everything?

434
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,940
How long have you kept this dried fish?

435
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,180
What? It's fresh.

436
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,570
- It's stale. - Then don't eat it.

437
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,700
How can you stop me from eating after I've eaten half of it?

438
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,570
Master She is convalescing in Wugui Sea.

439
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,700
Don't worry about him.

440
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,860
No one knows he's here.

441
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,140
Thank you, Granny Xun.

442
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,010
By the way,

443
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,090
His Lordship wrote back

444
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,330
and said he knew what he was doing.

445
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,980
He told me not to worry.

446
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,380
But His Lordship always leaves the bad news out.

447
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,770
How can I not be worried about him?

448
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,940
I overlooked this

449
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,010
and forgot to brief you in advance.

450
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,050
Everyone is saying His Lordship is a traitor outside.

451
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,490
Of course, I don't believe those idiots.

452
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,180
His Lordship risks his life for Jixing Abyss.

453
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,380
We all saw that.

454
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,140
But how can the Empress be so gullible

455
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,660
and trust those fake rumors?

456
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,980
She even put up a notice in the Parade Bureau

457
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,420
to strip His Lordship of his titles as the warrior and the honorary warrior.

458
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,180
Her decision is...

459
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,140
is very disheartening.

460
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,220
Ji Bozai

461
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,620
has now joined the warrior ranks

462
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,730
of Yaoguang Mountain.

463
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,530
As the Empress, Tianji has to reassure

464
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,810
everyone in Jixing Abyss.

465
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,770
If Ji Bozai were in Tianji's shoes,

466
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,700
he would have done the same.

467
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,140
I understand the burden

468
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,290
on Her Majesty's shoulders.

469
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,140
But this is a cruel joke.

470
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,940
I feel bad for you and him, who are supposed to be together.

471
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,620
What will become of you and him?

472
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,220
Who knows what the future holds?

473
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,460
But right now,

474
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,530
exposing what the Emperor of Zhushui did

475
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,700
is what he and I want to do.

476
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,700
We will persevere.

477
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,010
Ji Bozai wants to bring peace to the Six Realms.

478
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,490
He is determined. That won't change.

479
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,330
I believe in him.

480
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,180
I see.

481
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,220
I will look after His Lordship's home

482
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,900
in Wugui Sea.

483
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,810
Thank you, Granny Xun.

484
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,380
It's a new recipe.

485
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,140
You made this?

486
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,620
Let me smell it.

487
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,490
It'll cool you down.

488
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,330
It smells amazing.

489
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,860
Let me take a bite.

490
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,620
Do you like it?

491
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,420
It has six flowers in it.

492
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,140
A minimum of four warriors

493
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,460
is required to take part in the Qingyun Tournament.

494
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,220
Now that Ji Bozai has joined the rival realm,

495
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,420
we won't even have four warriors.

496
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,010
How are we supposed to scout out the tournament arena now?

497
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,460
What about promoting one from the shortlisted candidates?

498
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,220
Worry not.

499
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,980
I've told them

500
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,530
that we would gather enough warriors before the tournament.

501
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,980
Therefore, they won't

502
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,010
disqualify us for now.

503
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,290
Furthermore, Ming Yi also agreed

504
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,860
to scout with us as a Forger

505
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,810
representing the Shouhua Academy.

506
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,900
Great!

507
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,730
If other immortals raise dissenting opinions,

508
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,140
don't worry or be affected

509
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,570
by them.

510
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,530
I'll handle them for you.

511
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,620
Great!

512
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,490
Great!

513
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,620
It's on.

514
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,700
I didn't know

515
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,700
that you could use a fire-igniting artifact for barbecue purposes.

516
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,330
Only a genius like me

517
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,700
can come up with such a great idea.

518
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,620
Right. This is almost burned.

519
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,530
Eat some, Twenty-Seven.

520
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,380
Yan Xiao. Eat with us.

521
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,530
You can train later!

522
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,490
This seems like the right time

523
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,570
to tell you that you should rest.

524
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,050
But?

525
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,490
But

526
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,940
the two-realm tournament is about to begin.

527
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,810
We should all train harder.

528
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,490
Therefore, I brought you an ointment.

529
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,330
Do you feel better now?

530
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,730
Yes.

531
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,050
Meng, you are smiling.

532
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,570
Do not laugh at me.

533
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,700
Truth be told,

534
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,090
I like them this way.

535
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,530
I like Tianji.

536
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,860
I like her a lot.

537
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,090
Even now.

538
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,490
But my feelings toward her

539
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,770
are that I just want her to be happy.

540
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,010
Meng.

541
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,380
I salute you.

542
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,940
Do not steal my sweet potato.

543
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,380
When we were in Yaoguang Mountain,

544
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,010
we had to abide by strict rules.

545
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,770
The juniors had to serve the seniors.

546
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,810
And even among peers, the strong would bully the weak.

547
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,860
Back then, I dreamed

548
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,140
of meeting a trustworthy ally.

549
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,900
And to my surprise,

550
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,290
I found people whom I can fall back on

551
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,700
in Jixing Abyss.

552
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,530
All participants,

553
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,620
following the order set down

554
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,050
by the previous Qingyun Tournament,

555
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,620
you may now enter the Zhuojin Tower to inspect the arena.

556
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,380
Without Ji Bozai, I highly doubt Jixing Abyss

557
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,140
can send in any competent immortal

558
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,140
at all.

559
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,330
So not only do they have an empress,

560
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,900
they also have a female warrior now.

561
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,860
What?

562
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,090
Are you trying to lose again for the next seven years?

563
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,330
Can't expect anything decent from your foul mouth.

564
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,620
I see you spent most of your time

565
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,290
sharpening your tongue, not your blade.

566
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,980
If you have nothing nice to say,

567
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,530
say nothing at all.

568
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,700
Warriors of Yaoguang Mountain, please enter.

569
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,940
Immortal...

570
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,420
Long time no see, Immortal Ji.

571
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,220
Alas, we are now competing

572
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,570
against one another.

573
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,940
Indeed. We now represent different realms.

574
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,860
See you in the arena.

575
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,090
See you.

576
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,570
What?

577
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,810
What is going on?

578
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,460
Where did she go?

579
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,620
- What's going on? - It's so sudden.

580
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,570
I'm in the secret chamber of Dragon Carp Terrace.

581
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,980
Did you truly believe you could kill me

582
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,170
after you kidnapped me here

583
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,570
with your spell?

584
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,940
The Ultimate Punishment hasn't taught you anything, it seems.

585
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,610
You're as foolish as ever.

586
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,490
Oh, really?

587
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,090
Look closely.

588
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,740
Ming Yi, can I keep this hairpin as memorabilia?

589
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,860
It's my...

590
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,420
Situ Ling used his heart's blood

591
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,420
to save you.

592
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,010
Perhaps you ought

593
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,650
to return the favor to your savior.

594
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,130
I don't believe you.

595
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,940
And even if you did capture him,

596
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,130
I can kill you now

597
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,980
before rescuing him.

598
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,820
Ming Xian.

599
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,650
Ming Yi. Run.

600
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,300
Don't worry about me.

601
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,650
Ming Xian,

602
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,820
with one snap of my finger,

603
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,210
I can suffocate him.

604
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,900
Try me if you dare.

605
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,420
And this time,

606
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,340
I will kill him

607
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,420
before you make a move.

608
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,570
Run, Ming Yi.

609
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,170
What do you want?

610
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,780
Put the Embers down.

611
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,610
No, Ming Yi.

612
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,940
Don't drop your weapon.

613
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,460
Ming Xin will kill you.

614
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,420
Quiet!

615
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,490
I will not leave you to die.

616
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,860
Ming Yi,

617
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,210
you still care about me, don't you?

618
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,380
Now, kneel.

619
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,860
No, Ming Yi. Do not kneel!

620
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,380
Ming Xian.

621
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,420
Kneel now.

622
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,130
Ming Xin.

623
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,650
Are you out of your mind?

624
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,980
What makes you think you can make her kneel?

625
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,170
Kneel.

626
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,210
Kneel!

627
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,090
I told you to kneel! Did you hear me?

628
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,170
Ming Xin.

629
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,530
Even until now,

630
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,380
you're still using the power of Yaoguang Mountain.

631
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,530
That means

632
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,460
you still want to fight for Yaoguang Mountain.

633
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,610
You ingratiated yourself

634
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,530
with the Emperor of Zhushui.

635
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,820
Do you feel no shame?

636
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,530
Have you forgotten that every technique you're using

637
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,490
comes from me?

638
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,170
Shut up!

639
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,980
I don't care what your motive is now.

640
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,130
But back then,

641
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,610
I truly viewed you as my younger brother.

642
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,300
We joined the warrior ranks together.

643
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,010
I wanted to guide you to the proper path.

644
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,010
I taught you everything I know.

645
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,940
Now that you have mastered those techniques,

646
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,690
you've forgotten

647
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,610
what it means to be a warrior.

648
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,900
Shut up!

649
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,940
You have no right to patronize me, Ming Xian.

650
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,300
You outdo me in every regard.

651
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,780
Even if I put in ten times or a hundred times more effort,

652
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,090
Father won't even look at me.

653
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,940
But you!

654
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,050
You're just a mongrel!

655
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,050
Why must I suffer?

656
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,050
Why must I let an outsider

657
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,460
steal my thunder?

658
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,690
Today,

659
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,570
I will break your knees

660
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,820
so that you may never stand before me!

661
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,340
Watch out, Ming Yi!

662
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,380
Why would you risk your life

663
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,300
for an informant from Zhushui Spiritual State?

664
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,420
Situ...

665
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,380
Prince Chao Yuan once saved my life.

666
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,820
I cannot leave him to die.

667
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,300
You found out?

668
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,010
Your Highness.

669
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,650
How eager of you to dispose of him.

670
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,300
Why? Is he about to snitch you out?

671
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,860
Ming Yi, I just want to protect you.

672
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,530
Chao Yuan.

673
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,380
Ming Xin said

674
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,820
you once saved me with your heart's blood.

675
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,860
Of course, I'm grateful for you.

676
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,460
But he wouldn't have known about it

677
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,650
if you hadn't told him.

678
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,380
Also,

679
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,900
were you the one who taught him the art

680
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,490
of illusory assassination?

681
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,860
Your Highness.

682
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,610
I see you feel spiteful after receiving

683
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,050
the Ultimate Punishment.

684
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,170
So now, you want to get out of Yaoguang Mountain

685
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,530
to kill Ming Xian?

686
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,210
We had a deal that day.

687
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,900
You wanted me to bring Ming Xian to you,

688
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,010
and I didn't divulge it to your father.

689
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,380
If you truly care so much about that wretched woman,

690
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,210
I suppose

691
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,300
I can leave her cold dead body for you.

692
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,690
I just gave you

693
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,940
Zhushui's secret art of illusory assassination.

694
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,340
While the warriors are scouting the arena,

695
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,690
you can use it to kidnap her from Zhuojin Tower.

696
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,340
She is stronger than you.

697
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,210
And you're weakened by the punishment.

698
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,490
You can't defeat her.

699
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,940
But you can tell her

700
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,380
that you're holding me hostage.

701
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,780
After all, I saved her once.

702
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,650
And show her this keepsake.

703
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,130
That way,

704
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,570
she won't kill you right away.

705
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,650
The records say

706
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,130
that to master the art of

707
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,050
illusory assassination,

708
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,860
the practitioner has to kill at least ten people.

709
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,860
You've decided to be Chao Yuan,

710
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,940
and not Situ Ling.

711
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,090
Is that so?

712
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,740
Ming Yi,

713
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,460
whatever I did,

714
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,940
it's for you.

715
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,420
Why? Why the obsession?

716
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,530
You don't trust me.

717
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,460
No matter what I did,

718
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,460
you still won't trust me.

719
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,170
Yet you trust Ji Bozai wholeheartedly.

720
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,940
Why must it be him?

721
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,090
All I know is that

722
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,090
even if you're no longer the Situ Ling I know,

723
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,940
I

724
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,260
will still do everything I can to stop Chao Yuan

725
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,940
just like how Situ Ling did everything

726
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,490
to save me.

727
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,130
Give up while you still can, Chao Yuan.

728
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,300
You mustn't be like your father.

729
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,300
It's too late.

730
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,980
