[Episode 17]

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
The last step of being the netherbeast vessel

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,040
is to refine the netherbeast core for seven days

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
once you absorb netherbeasts' primordial spirits

26
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,760
into your body

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,070
in order to contain them.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,150
However, this is why it's so dangerous.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
Refining the core

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,400
means suppressing each other

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,680
and fusing with them.

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,920
In the end,

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
you'll either dissolve them

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,710
or be devoured by them.

35
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,070
Ji Bozai!

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,790
By using your body as a vessel

37
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,760
to refine us,

38
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,150
you'll also experience immense pain.

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,560
Is it worth doing all this for the people of Jixing Abyss?

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,190
Is it worth it?

41
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,310
Is it worth it?

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,910
The emperor of Jixing Abyss is weak like a puppet.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,870
There's nothing you can change.

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,080
Shouhua Academy's people used you as their champion,

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,710
but they never cared about the humiliation you endured

46
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,000
in the Sunken Abyss.

47
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,120
Are you going to exhaust yourself for them?

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
You are such a fool.

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,470
You are foolish!

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
Why must Ji Bozai cultivate in seclusion?

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,800
Your Highness,

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,710
Ji Bozai is fine now.

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,080
He will come out of seclusion soon.

Ming Yi.

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Ji Bozai promised to discuss things with me

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,190
if something came up.

57
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,840
Why is he hiding things from me again?

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,430
In that case,

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
I must really doubt his sincerity

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
as our ally.

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,870
Sorry, Your Highness.

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,960
Immortal Ji didn't plan to hide it from you on purpose.

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,400
However, this involves many things.

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,030
Please trust him one more time.

65
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,190
I heard about the incident at Shouhua Academy.

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,590
I didn't expect Your Highness to stabilize the situation

67
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,000
in such a way.

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
This is all thanks to you.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
Sun Liao obviously did that

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,910
because of Uncle's instructions.

71
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,310
He also gave you a hard time before that.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
It was all

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
to strip Ji Bozai of his position as a warrior.

74
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,630
Ji Bozai was promoted to an immortal

75
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,840
because he was fighting for Jixing Abyss.

76
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,150
If he's not in Shouhua Academy,

77
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,630
nothing will stop Uncle

78
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,590
from getting rid of him anymore.

79
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,190
However, Ji Bozai

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,030
has always liked fighting alone.

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,400
He wasn't serious about his work at Shouhua Academy.

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
Once Sun Liao fanned the fire,

83
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,800
everyone in Shouhua Academy

84
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,680
became unsatisfied with Ji Bozai.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
Your Highness, you had no choice but to take action

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,560
and strip Ji Bozai of position temporarily

87
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
to appease everyone.

88
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,000
Next, Your Highness

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
gave the position to Sun Liao.

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,630
He was so excited about being the warrior

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,590
and forgot about Lord Hanfeng's plan.

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
You have no idea

93
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,080
how embarrassing it was for me

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,910
to deal with Sun Liao.

95
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,680
I know.

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,310
I understand.

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,950
I get it.

98
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,070
Can you tell me

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
when he's coming out of seclusion?

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,750
I can only deal with Sun Liao.

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,830
I can't deal with Mu Qibai

102
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,950
if he does something now.

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,830
Moreover, Jixing Abyss has seen a glimmer of hope

104
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,310
because of Ji Bozai's appearance.

105
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,190
The number of warriors who joined training this year

106
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680

107
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
I dare say

108
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,360
that they've come to the academy because they admire Ji Bozai.

110
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,040
How should I take responsibility for the disappointment

111
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,800
of these people toward Ji Bozai?

112
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,600
What's wrong?

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,750

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
You can only lie in bed

191
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
or stand.

192
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,840
But don't walk.

193
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,550
Why...

194
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,600
why didn't you tell me sooner?

195
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,600
It's not an issue.

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
See?

197
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,120
You're smart.

198
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,000
This worm can help you find the Golden Millet Dream, My Lord.

199
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,030
If you release it into Wugui Sea,

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,080
it will head in the Golden Millet Dream's direction.

201
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
If Ji Bozai

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,550
did create a real Spirit Well,

203
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,080
the worm will also lead you

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,550
to the entrance of the Spirit Well.

205
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,750
It's very rare to see this worm.

206
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,320
How did you get it?

207
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,270
What happened?

208
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,030
The Moonlit Blossoms found me some useful intelligence,

209
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,080
so I went to Mangfu Swamp

210
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,600
to retrieve this.

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,390
I'm talking about your hand.

212
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,150
I was discovered by the locals

213
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
and got a small injury.

214
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,440
Look.

215
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,840
It's almost healed.

216
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,600
There's no news of Ji Bozai currently at Shouhua Academy.

217
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,080
Sun Liao is sick.

218
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,270
Apparently,

219
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
he has had a stomachache for three days.

220
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,750
Perhaps he drank too much.

221
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,360
A few days ago,

222
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
Sun Liao was very happy.

223
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,910
Whenever he saw someone, he would say Princess Tianji admired him

224
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,440
and was going to choose him as her consort.

225
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,120
He has been drunk for days

226
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
so he feels weak.

227
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,720
Tianji admires him?

228
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,550
He actually believed her obvious trick?

229
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,390
What an idiot.

230
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
Does he think

231
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,550
Tianji is still the little girl

232
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,150
who can be easily coaxed?

233
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Are you as foolish as Sun Liao as well?

234
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Can't you tell

235
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,240
that Sun Liao went to cause trouble at Shouhua Academy

236
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,000
because I instructed him so?

237
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,910
I thought

238
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
that Sun Liao

239
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
would not forget your instructions

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,360
and would still do his best even if he was duped

241
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
by the princess.

242
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,270
That was why I didn't intervene.

243
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,910
However, I didn't expect him to be so gullible.

244
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,750
Yan Xiao.

245
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you know what your weakness is?

246
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,670
I am ignorant.

247
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,550
Please guide me, Lord Hanfeng.

248
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
Some are evil at heart

249
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,870
and they use righteousness and morality as a cover.

250
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,240
You are the opposite.

251
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,080
You seemed like someone who'd do anything to get promoted

252
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,390
but you're not ruthless at all.

253
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,390
Yan Xiao,

254
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,240
you want too many things.

255
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,320
I'm always loyal.

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
I had to abandon

257
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,240
my conscience

258
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,440
before I could negotiate with them.

259
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,480
If you can't do it,

260
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,750
you are useless to me.

261
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,840
I need to get Ji Bozai to compensate me for these plants.

262
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
This is the fourth day.

263
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,630
Ji Bozai,

264
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,600
are you doing well?

265
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,720
The netherbeasts will bring out your most painful memories

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,550
to bring out your inner demons.

267
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,150
You must stay firm

268
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
without wavering.

269
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,120
If your consciousness is taken over by your inner demons,

270
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,000
you will lose control of yourself

271
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,480
and be taken over by the netherbeasts.

272
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,360
Haven't you thought about the possibility of her

273
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,000
using you and lying to you?

274
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,030
Do you actually still believe in the people around you?

275
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,440
Have you forgotten about your past in the Sunken Abyss?

276
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,430
Do you have water?

277
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,870
I can't take it anymore.

278
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,630
I can't move.

279
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,320
My hands...

280
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,750
My legs hurt.

281
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,030
Rest easy.

282
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,200
You

283
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,630
look similar to my son.

284
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,550
When he was ten,

285
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,840
he was beaten to death

286
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,790
just to fight for a meat bun.

287
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,150
Your hands look like his.

288
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
When he died,

289
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,150
he was still holding onto that meat bun.

290
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,150
His hands

291
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,150
were trampled on.

292
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,600
I used all my strength

293
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,000
but I failed to save his hands.

294
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,840
Tell me.

295
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,600
If he died like that,

296
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,870
he might not be able

297
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,120
to touch his mother's face

298
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,750
in his next life.

299
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,390
Sorry.

300
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
My hands are too dirty.

301
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,750
You must be hungry.

302
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,840
Eat something.

303
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,600
It's fine.

304
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,790
Just eat.

305
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,360
Is it delicious?

306
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,390
Eat it slowly.

307
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
Can you

308
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,790
leave me a handprint?

309
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,910
I want to cherish it as a keepsake.

310
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,360
If you don't want to,

311
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
it's okay.

312
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,630
Wait.

313
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
Don't wipe your hand.

314
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,720
How can you leave your handprint otherwise?

315
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,320
Thank you.

316
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,070
Thank you.

317
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I tried to match everyone's handprint

318
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,400
and only yours is a perfect match.

319
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,030
How dare you beat me?

320
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,480
You have a death wish!

321
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,070
Die!

322
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,400
Look.

323
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,200
You left a handprint.

324
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,590
How arrogant.

325
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,310
Today,

326
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,550
I will beat you to death.

327
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,110
My son,

328
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,310
none of those who went to refine medicine

329
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,830
has come back alive.

330
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,440
I can't see you die.

331
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,440
I have no choice but to find you a scapegoat.

332
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,070
After he offends the supervisor,

333
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,480
he will surely be the one

334
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,440
to be chosen to make the medicine.

335
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
Immortal Hou Zhao.

336
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,480
Where's the new substitute who will be making medicine for me?

337
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,200
He's here.

338
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Sorry.

339
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,310
Sorry, child.

340
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
It was either you or my son.

341
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,550
Don't trust other people anymore.

342
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,590
Ji Bozai,

343
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,750
you are surrounded by lies!

344
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,640
Deceit!

345
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,200
Don't you hate them anymore?

346
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,550
What you've been through...

347
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,270
The worst of humanity...

348
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,750
Have you forgotten?

349
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,680
This world full of evil

350
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,270
has already abandoned you!

351
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,790
Ji Bozai!

352
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,790
How dare you slack off?

353
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,750
How dare you!

354
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,720
Try slacking off again!

355
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,830
What?

356
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,240
Faster!

357
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,240
Faster!

358
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,440
This is

359
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
the last step.

360
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,790
Don't slack off.

361
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,750
Catch him!

362
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't let him escape!
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Amin)

363
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,920
Stop running!

364
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,440
Catch him!

365
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,070
Hurry!

366
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,110
- Don't run! - Don't run!

367
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,880
Where did he run off to?

368
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,550
Run!

369
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,590
Run further!

370
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,550
Why have you stopped running?

371
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,270
Brat!

372
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,480
I'll beat you to death today!

373
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,550
Let go!

374
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,880
Let go!

375
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,920
Yes.

376
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,270
Yes.

377
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,350
That's right!

378
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,270
That's right!

379
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,830
That's right!

380
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,350
See that?

381
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,960
This is the law of survival in this world.

382
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,200
Only by taking revenge

383
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,350
and trampling on them

384
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,000
will you not be bullied.

385
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,310
We have the strongest power in the world.

386
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,960
With us,

387
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,200
you can do anything.

388
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,160
Ji Bozai,

389
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,400
join us.

390
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,310
We can give you everything.

391
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,400
Everything you want!

392
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,830
Let us

393
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,640
stand on the peak of Six Realms!

394
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,380
[Pure and Noble Spirit]

395
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,920
Tianji, you are finally here.

396
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Ji Bozai

397
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,000
has not shown himself in the last few days.

398
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,480
Everyone in Shouhua Academy feels tired and demoralized.

399
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
I figured

400
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,550
it's too difficult

401
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,000
for a fairy like you

402
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,750
to be in this position.

403
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,070
This is great.

404
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,000
I've requested a decree

405
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,880
to relieve you of this responsibility at Shouhua Academy.

406
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,960
Isn't it better to become

407
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,070
an idle princess?

408
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,070
Read it out to everyone.

409
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,880
As per His Majesty's decree,

410
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,550
the Venerable of Shouhua Academy is incapable of leading her warriors...

411
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,830
Father has been sleeping for many days.

412
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,590
Lord Hanfeng, how did you obtain

413
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,790
the Father's decree to dismiss me as the Venerable?

414
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,750
You impress me.

415
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,680
I suppose I must meet my father in the palace

416
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,110
to confirm this.

417
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,640
Tianji, I'm sure you know

418
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,240
that your father is ill.

419
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:15,790
He can't...

420
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,920
Lord Hanfeng, you came here on official business.

421
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,590
Why are you addressing me with my name?

422
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,270
Are you

423
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,270
trying to mix official and private matters into one?

424
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,110
You talk to me

425
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,960
as if I'm just your niece

426
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,110
so all of Shouhua Academy

427
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,750
no longer trusts me as the Venerable.

428
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,550
Lord Hanfeng,

429
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,880
you said Father was ill

430
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,590
and asleep,

431
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,920
yet you could meet him.

432
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,030
Why don't you

433
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,880
lead me to Father?

434
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,920
We will be waiting at Ziwei Hall.

435
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,960
We will decide

436
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,070
when Father is awake. How's that?

437
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,960
Witty, aren't you?

438
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,160
If you are capable

439
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,830
of running the Shouhua Academy,

440
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,960
you ought not to lose sight of Ji Bozai

441
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,440
and let him do whatever he wants,

442
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,200
sinking everyone's morale in the academy.

443
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,480
Do you think

444
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,400
you are still a competent venerable?

445
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,830
In that case,

446
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,240
if I can bring Ji Bozai here,

447
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,270
will you think

448
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,880
that I'm good enough

449
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,790
to be the Venerable of Shouhua Academy?

450
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,830
Of course.

451
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,200
Did someone mention me?

452
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,880
How unexpected.

453
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,440
You've missed me so much, Qibai.

454
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,400
Your Highness,

455
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,000
come on now.

456
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,440
If you had told me sooner,

457
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,070
I would've come sooner.

458
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,350
I was just cultivating in seclusion back home for a few days.

459
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,110
Did you miss me that much, Qibai?

460
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,160
Your Highness,

461
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,550
it takes seven days to refine the netherbeast core.

462
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,750
However, Ji Bozai will do his best.

463
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,400
He'll do it in five days

464
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
and not give Mu Qibai

465
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,790
any chance of taking over the Shouhua Academy.

466
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,030
All right.

467
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,910
All right, now.

468
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,400
With my cultivation,

469
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,830
it doesn't take me long

470
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,550
to refine some netherbeasts.

471
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,820
Who are you to try to stop me?

472
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,200
Reassured now?

473
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,960
With you around,

474
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,830
I'm not worried.

475
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,590
Let's go.

476
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,720
[Pure and Noble Spirit]
In the last five days,

477
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,830
my husband has been living in seclusion

478
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
to improve his cultivation.

479
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,920
As you all know,

480
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,070
it is very difficult

481
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,270
for warriors of the Transcendent Stage

482
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,640
to improve to the next stage.

483
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,000
Within the Six Realms,

484
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,000
no one has broken through the Perfected Stage.

485
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,750
Immortal Ji has been working hard to achieve this.

486
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,750
It's hard to obtain the Perfected Stage.

487
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,030
Immortal Ji only needs a bit more

488
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,070
to ascend further.

489
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,310
You have earned our respect, Immortal Ji.

490
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,750
Yes. As expected of him.

491
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,880
- He's amazing. - Yes.

492
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,350
Immortal Ji has always been cautious.

493
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,480
There was no progress previously

494
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,030
so he asked me to keep it a secret.

495
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,160
After five days of cultivating in seclusion,

496
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,270
he has finally achieved a breakthrough

497
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,960
so he rushed to Shouhua Academy immediately

498
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,720
to share his insights with everyone.

499
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,350
Today,

500
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,000
I will restore Immortal Ji's position as a warrior.

501
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,270
All of you should ask for his guidance.

502
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,200
He will share everything.

503
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,070
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

504
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,720
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

505
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,640
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

506
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,830
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

507
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,440
Immortal Ji.

508
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,120
- Quick, go over there. - I have a question.

509
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,360
- Me too. - Immortal Ji.

510
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,750
- I have a question. - Immortal Ji.

511
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,160
- Immortal Ji, look at mine. - Immortal Ji.

512
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,350
I haven't improved for many days.

513
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,200
Help me take a look.

514
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,000
Me too.

515
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,490
Look at mine.

516
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,170
I don't know

517
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,030
when I can reach the next stage.

518
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,350
Help me take a look, Immortal Ji.

519
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,640
Immortal Ji.

520
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,680
Immortal Ji, my cultivation has been stagnant.

521
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,370
What should I do?

522
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,440
- Help me take a look. - Immortal Ji.

523
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,270
- Help me take a look. - Everyone, make way.

524
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,000
Help me take a look.

525
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,590
Although you have become stronger,

526
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,550
refining the netherbeast core hastily still took a toll on you.

527
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,960
Don't worry, I'm still alive.

528
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,880
Since I'm already here,

529
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,440
I should help Tianji out.

530
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,640
Ji, I've been waiting for you to come back.

531
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,550
You must teach us more in the future.

532
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,030
That's right, Ji.

533
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,440
I have a wonderful artifact.

534
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,830
I hope it can help you out

535
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
after your return.

536
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,110
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

537
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,310
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

538
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,090
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

539
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,760
Meng Yangqiu!

540
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,240
Do you know

541
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,000
that netherbeasts appeared in Jixing Abyss not long ago?

542
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,440
Ji Bozai is that kind of person?

543
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,310
Your Lordship.

544
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,830
This is...

545
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,200
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

546
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,440
It is very sensitive.

547
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,550
You must take good care of it.

548
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
Find a chance and make Ji Bozai open it.

549
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
After that, we will find out

550
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,240
whether he is a blessing

551
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,240
or a misfortune for Tianji.

552
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,790
Ji Bozai.

553
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,830
There's netherbeast energy.

554
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,880
Why is this happening?

555
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,350
Be careful.

556
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,480
What should we do?

557
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,480
Move.

558
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,310
This...

559
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,960
Ji Bozai.

560
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,210
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

561
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,900
I infused netherbeast energy in the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

562
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,060
Even if Ji Bozai can refine the netherbeast core ahead of schedule,

563
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,990
the core's still not stable.

564
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,470
We can use the netherbeast energy to lure out the core.

565
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,660
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop can sense netherbeast energy.

566
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,660
Is Ji Bozai raising netherbeasts?

567
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,140
Netherbeast marks?

568
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,790
No wonder

569
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,710
netherbeasts were killing people in Jixing Palace.

570
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,900
It was all because of Ji Bozai.

571
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,860
There's netherbeast energy. It must be true.

572
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,420
I thought you'd be safe.

573
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,100
I didn't expect

574
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,620
you to raise netherbeasts.

575
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,660
Ji Bozai, you...

576
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,420
Stay away.

577
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,230
That's...

578
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,530
He's gone.

579
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,580
Tianji.

580
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,620
All of us have been lied to by Ji Bozai.

581
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,470
He has been raising netherbeasts.

582
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,710
This must be true.

583
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,030
He has been raising netherbeasts.

584
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,030
We saw it ourselves.

585
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,710
It's him.

586
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,470
He raised netherbeasts.

587
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,270
He raised netherbeasts.

588
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,950
Fools!

589
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,660
If Ji Bozai raised netherbeasts,

590
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,310
he could have found any excuse to avoid you.

591
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,750
Why would he come to the Shouhua Academy today?

592
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,270
But the netherbeast energy proves...

593
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,270
It only proves that someone is trying to frame Ji Bozai.

594
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,190
That's...

595
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,270
Frame him?

596
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,510
Ming Yi, calm down!

597
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,510
If you use the heart imprint to trespass into his Spirit Well now,

598
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,750
you'll reveal to him

599
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,310
that you know its location.

600
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,060
Ji Bozai has strong spiritual powers.

601
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,660
He will be fine.

602
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,510
Ming Yi!

603
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,510
I got in too.

604
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,190
Is it because he's dying?

605
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,860
Ji Bozai.

606
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,510
Ji Bozai.

607
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,140
Be careful.

608
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,510
Buxiu.

609
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,710
- Are you affected by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop too? - Buxiu.

610
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,860
Don't you recognize us?

611
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,060
Calm down.

612
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,470
Be polite.

613
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,270
Sir...

614
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,420
Ji Bozai.

615
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,550
Ji Bozai.

616
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,950
Ji Bozai.

617
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,340
The Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop caused the netherbeast core to leak.

618
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,470
We must dig it out of him.

619
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,550
Otherwise, the Netherbeast Refining Skill will be in vain.

620
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,340
You can't use your spiritual veins right now.

621
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,230
Twenty-Seven.

622
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,150
Help me do this together.

623
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,110
Hurry.

624
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,710
This is bad.

625
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,020
When Ji Bozai was hit by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

626
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,900
he didn't set up any defenses.

627
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,590
It was planted deep inside.

628
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,070
If we remove it from him,

629
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,340
Ji Bozai will be greatly weakened even if he survives.

630
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,900
Has Ji Bozai truly created a Spirit Well

631
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,710
to hide the Golden Millet Dream?

632
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,590
This should be the entrance.

633
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,900
However, besides him,

634
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,590
only the person

635
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,070
who shares a divine consciousness with him can enter.

636
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,670
So, Ming Yi married him

637
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,900
and obtained the heart imprint

638
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,590
for the Golden Millet Dream too.

639
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,900
That's great.

640
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,300
She isn't in love with him after all.

641
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,780
No matter what,

642
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,150
I must do everything I can to help her achieve her goal.

643
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,380
Ji Bozai.

644
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,030
Ji Bozai.

645
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,990
Ji Bozai.

646
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,110
Ji Bozai.

647
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,460
Where is Buxiu going?

648
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
He is going to Dragon Carp Terrace to stall Mu Qibai.

649
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,540
Where are you going?

650
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,460
If you use your spiritual veins again,

651
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,020
you will be injured.

652
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,420
Ji Bozai's condition is stable now.

653
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm going to find Buxiu.

654
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,310
Take care of him.

655
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,110
Your Lordship,

656
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,500
we have gathered all the guards.

657
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,230
We can capture him at Wugui Sea now.

658
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,940
A silver dragon?

659
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,500
That silver dragon

660
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,270
is Ji Bozai's companion beast.

661
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,150
Trying to stall time for Ji Bozai?

662
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,630
He has walked straight into it.

663
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,020
Everyone,

664
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,710
Ji Bozai told his companion beast to show its true form

665
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,710
to stop us from sealing the netherbeasts.

666
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,150
This is all to protect Jixing Abyss.

667
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,540
Kill it!

668
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,230
Get into formation!

669
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,420
Your master is already dying.

670
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,940
Are you still dreaming of the impossible?

671
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,900
These lowlifes.

672
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,980
Such a powerful spiritual power.

673
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,860
Is Ji Bozai so powerful

674
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,380
that he is immune to the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

675
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,710
Ming Yi, let me help you.

676
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,750
Your Lordship!

677
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,150
Ming Yi.

678
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,310
Ming Yi, you spent too much spiritual power.

679
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,590
I'll bring you to seek aid.

680
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,270
Lord Hanfeng accuses Immortal Ji of raising netherbeasts.

681
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,590
You're going against him

682
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,900
just to help me?

683
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,900
You protect Ji Bozai

684
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,900
because you believe he doesn't raise netherbeasts.

685
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,750
If you believe in him,

686
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,420
I'll believe in him

687
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,310
because I know

688
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,500
you are not someone who wants the power of netherbeasts.

689
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,980
If someone commits a crime,

690
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,980
I'm sure you won't forgive him.

691
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,940
Ming Yi, trust me.

692
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,750
Let's get you treated.

693
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,900
Thank you.

694
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,860
I'm fine.

695
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,750
Let me check on Immortal Ji.

696
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,070
