ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 26

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,880
ZHANGWEI MOUNTAIN

4
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,160
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,920
This lousy place has such thick fog.

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,480
If there's such heavy fog,

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,000
the harder it will be to find
the Bo clan's ancestral home.

8
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,320
Ming Yi. Can your body handle it?

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,320
It's alright, Master. I can hold on.

10
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,080
How about we split up?

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,280
If you find anything,
send a flying message right away.

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
Alright. I'll go that way,
you go this way.

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,960
-Alright.
-Be careful.

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,520
Who's there?

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,240
-Master?
-Ming Yi?

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
Didn't we head in opposite directions?

17
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,720
Why are you here?

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,520
I've been walking this way the whole time.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Oh no, we're trapped in a loop.

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
We're back to the same place.

21
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,080
Let's try again.

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,240
Let's go.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS, PART 1

24
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
You're

25
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Ming Xian.

26
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
Though Embers has been destroyed,

27
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,520
it still protects its master.

28
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,400
It resonated with you,

29
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,560
which means you're its master.

30
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,040
You hid well.

31
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,120
But that bow and arrow
artifact reminded me.

32
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
So I used spiritual power to test Nirvana.

33
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,240
If I took a fatal blow,
Nirvana would protect me.

34
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,080
It's the same as Embers.

35
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
You made an artifact just like Embers

36
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
and named it Nirvana.

37
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
You gave it to me.

38
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
If you want to leave,

39
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,720
I won't stop you.

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
But think carefully.

41
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
This is the first time

42
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,760
and also the last time I'll ask you.

43
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,240
Are you Ming Xian?

44
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
Are you poisoned with Heavenly Grief

45
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,800
that you search for Golden Millet Dream?

46
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,440
If you lie to me again,

47
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
it's indeed over

48
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,240
between us.

49
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Yes.

50
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,080
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

51
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
It's an ancient divine beast,

52
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,160
Zhulong.

53
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
Ji Bozai. Ji Bozai.

54
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Ji Bozai.

55
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,840
Ji Bozai.

56
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Ji Bozai.

57
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,760
Your spiritual veins
are completely severed.

58
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,800
You'd risk everything?

59
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,960
I didn't expect the mighty Warrior Goddess
and Crown Prince

60
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,159
to care so much about her nemesis.

61
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,480
Hurry and heal yourself.

62
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,280
Ji Bozai is clearly injured.

63
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Why does Zhulong
have no reaction to his blood at all?

64
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Could it be

65
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
that he's not a descendant of the Bo clan?

66
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
This place is filled with barriers.

67
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,520
There is no exit at all.

68
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,560
The spiritual veins are shattered
and the meridians are cut.

69
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,520
How have you endured such pain until now?

70
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,920
It's all my fault.

71
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Back at Wugui Sea,
I shouldn't have trusted you so much.

72
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,880
I never even found a chance
to test your spiritual veins.

73
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
If I wanted to deceive you,

74
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,960
I have countless ways to hide it.

75
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
This Zhulong guards the Bo clan's
ancestral home at Zhangwei Mountain.

76
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,040
It should have slain all outsiders.

77
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
Why did she just lock us up instead?

78
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
She must have her own plan to imprison us.

79
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,720
Since we're here, we might as well
make ourselves at home.

80
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
We've been wandering around so long.

81
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Aren't you hungry?

82
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,560
At a time like this,
you're still worried about hunger?

83
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,080
Can't you pretend you didn't hear it?

84
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,440
Can't you pretend you didn't hear it?

85
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,520
It's like thunder.

86
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,760
It's hard to pretend I didn't hear, right?

87
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
You even brought scallion pancakes
to Zhangwei Mountain?

88
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,000
Is that weird?
I actually came to find you.

89
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,120
I have already used magic
to heat it up for you.

90
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,080
Eat it while it's hot, Warrior Goddess.

91
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,160
Thank you.

92
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,240
Only now do I realize

93
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,840
you're far more important to me
than I imagined.

94
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,040
Not a single bite should be wasted.

95
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,400
Quick. Finish it.

96
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,200
Hurry and eat. Don't leave a single bite.

97
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,640
No need to tell me.

98
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,240
Why did the fog clear?

99
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,840
Zhulong?

100
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,680
Zhulong. You're here to take me to the
Bo clan's ancestral home, aren't you?

101
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,800
I know.

102
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll always be an outsider.

103
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
I have no right to enter
her former residence.

104
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,760
But that child…

105
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
That child has come.

106
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
She should at least see her once.

107
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,840
Two people? Who is the other one?

108
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,240
Where are they?

109
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,880
Did you lock them inside your barrier?

110
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,240
I know I don't have the right to go in.

111
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,560
Go find that child.

112
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,760
She should at least see her once.

113
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,120
You're done?

114
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,320
I ate it all and didn't save you
a single bite.

115
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
You're poisoned with Heavenly Grief.

116
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
That's why you lost Qingyun Tournament.

117
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,880
At first you thought I had poisoned you,
didn't you?

118
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,880
You already know?

119
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,200
If I waited for you to confess,
how long would that take?

120
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,760
I'd rather guess myself.

121
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,320
Yes, I thought you had poisoned me.

122
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,440
That's why I schemed to get close to you.

123
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,280
So you plotted step by step,

124
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,120
just to gain my trust
and then steal Golden Millet Dream?

125
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
If you had succeeded,

126
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
would you have killed me
to vent your anger?

127
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,680
I didn't think that far.

128
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,680
Think about it now.

129
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Yes. If you had used Heavenly Grief

130
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,280
to defeat me during Qingyun Tournament,

131
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,960
I would have killed you for sure.

132
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,800
But I would've waited
until Qingyun Tournament

133
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,960
and defeated you fair and square
before taking my revenge.

134
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,640
That's exactly
what I thought you would say.

135
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,640
Back then, you even asked me

136
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
if I was the one who poisoned you.

137
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,800
-I denied it, and you believed me?
-Yes.

138
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,720
And when you helped me
steal Master's portrait,

139
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,240
you weren't completely sincere, were you?

140
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,040
But when we reached
Xun Ming's Illusory Realm,

141
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
you were the one who saved me.

142
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,360
At that time,

143
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,640
you already couldn't bear
to leave me behind, right?

144
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,560
Ming Yi.

145
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,200
Being honest isn't actually that hard.

146
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes.

147
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,000
You're also

148
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,240
more important to me than I thought.

149
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,079
What are you doing?

150
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,080
I can feel that she means no harm.

151
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,360
Haven't we been here before?

152
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm afraid something might happen to her.

153
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
I'll go in with her.

154
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Ming Yi!

155
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,080
Will she be in danger?

156
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,480
Why can't I go in?

157
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
Is this the Bo clan's ancestral home?

158
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,760
Ming Xian, I've been waiting
for you for so long.

159
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,280
Fairy Bo Yulan.

160
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,680
How do you know I'm Ming Xian?

161
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,800
What you see now

162
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,560
is the illusion of me and my sister,
Bo Yucen.

163
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,040
For any descendant of the Bo clan,

164
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,200
as long as our portraits
are still worshipped,

165
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,080
our final divine consciousness

166
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,160
will remain within this ancestral home.

167
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,800
Fairy Bo Yulan.

168
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,680
Ji Bozai is still outside.

169
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,080
Why not let him in?

170
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,440
Ming Xian.

171
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,920
I no longer have the face to see Ji Bozai.

172
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,360
Please tell him for me

173
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,640
that I owe him forever.

174
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,360
It's a debt I can never repay,
even in death.

175
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,160
What do you mean by that?

176
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,560
Some truths

177
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
are actually right in front of Ji Bozai.

178
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,080
But those truths are too unbearable.

179
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm afraid if he learns them,

180
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,040
it would shatter his trust
in everyone and everything.

181
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,600
If he insists on facing,

182
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,280
my memories

183
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,480
are right within his reach.

184
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
What do you mean by that?

185
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
What exactly happened between you two?

186
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,000
Child, this matter
has nothing to do with you.

187
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,120
You came here for Golden Millet Dream.

188
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,040
In this world,

189
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,760
there's no one more suitable
to entrust it to than you.

190
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,560
Once you retrieve the recipe,

191
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880
we will finally be able to rest in peace.

192
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,240
Descendants of the Bo clan were never
meant to let Golden Millet Dream reappear.

193
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,800
I once made Ji Bozai swear to me

194
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,040
to guard Golden Millet Dream
with his life.

195
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,720
But times have changed.

196
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,560
If it's to save lives
and save even more people,

197
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,920
perhaps letting Golden Millet Dream
resurface is even more meaningful.

198
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,240
In that case, thank you for being willing
to hand me the recipe.

199
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,680
Once I refine Golden Millet Dream
and cure the poison,

200
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,600
I will return it to the Bo clan's
descendants.

201
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,160
I won't let outsiders take it.

202
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,520
Good girl.

203
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,880
Now, the Bo clan has only one
descendant left in this world.

204
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
And that's my child.

205
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,160
But I hope

206
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
no one will ever know her identity
or whereabouts.

207
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,720
And no one should ever find her.

208
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,360
There's not much time, Ming Xian.

209
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,800
I want you to swear.

210
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,840
Even in the face of the deepest abyss,

211
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,440
you will still protect all living beings,
even at the cost of your life.

212
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,560
If you break this oath,

213
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,120
your primordial spirit shall perish,

214
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,440
and your soul scattered through
Six Realms.

215
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,320
I swear,
even in the face of the deepest abyss,

216
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,680
I will protect all living beings,
even at the cost of my life.

217
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,040
If I break this oath,

218
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,360
my primordial spirit shall perish,
and my soul scattered through Six Realms.

219
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,120
This is the rest of the recipe.

220
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,560
We intentionally made outsiders believe

221
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,240
that Part 2 of the Medical Classics
was just a book.

222
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,920
But the Bo clan actually
has another secret method.

223
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,000
Ming Xian, you now possess the recipe.

224
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
We

225
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,600
have no more regrets.

226
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,800
Good child, go now.

227
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,120
Fairy. ̀Ji Bozai is just outside.

228
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
Go and see him.

229
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,520
-Ming Yi. Are you alright?
-Ji Bozai.

230
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,680
Ji Bozai, I saw your master.

231
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,120
If you go in now, you should
still be able to see her one last time.

232
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
How could this be?

233
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,680
Why…

234
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,280
What just happened?

235
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm sorry. I don't understand either.

236
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,760
After Fairy Bo gave me the recipe,

237
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,240
I begged her to see you.

238
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,800
She said she wronged you.

239
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,280
And she said she hid the truth
right within your reach.

240
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,840
But she feared that once you knew,

241
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,640
it would destroy your faith in people
and in the world.

242
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,840
That's impossible.

243
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,240
Master traded her life for mine.

244
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,520
How could she have wronged me?

245
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
I just don't understand

246
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,840
why Master won't see me.

247
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,640
What's going on?

248
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
Impossible.

249
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,200
The Bo clan's divine consciousness

250
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,880
and the Zhulong Barrier can only recognize

251
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,440
descendants of the Bo clan.

252
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,480
Ji Bozai can't enter the Bo clan's
ancestral home,

253
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,120
but Ming Xian can.

254
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,640
There's another possibility.

255
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,760
Ming Xian's…

256
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,040
She's the descendant.

257
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,560
YAOYUE HALL

258
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,120
Everything went exactly
as Your Majesty foresaw.

259
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,320
His Highness originally believed

260
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,160
that Ji Bozai was the descendant of
the Bo clan,

261
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,440
so he lured him to Zhangwei Mountain.

262
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
But following Your Majesty's orders,

263
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,600
I stayed hidden at Zhangwei Mountain

264
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,960
and actually saw that the Zhulong Barrier
accepted not Ji Bozai,

265
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,080
but his wife, Ming Yi.

266
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
As expected.

267
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,600
The one truly able to inherit
the Bo clan's bloodline

268
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,920
should indeed be
a fairy with spiritual veins.

269
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Go investigate Ming Yi's true identity.

270
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,200
She cannot possibly

271
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,320
be a mere fairy from Jixing Abyss.

272
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,360
Yes.

273
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Judging from Ming Yi's expression

274
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,240
she must have already obtained
the other half of Bo's Medical Classics.

275
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,520
His Highness has lived up
to Your Majesty's trust.

276
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Your Majesty will soon be able to
create Golden Millet Dream.

277
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,160
Yes, it's been 100 years.

278
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,320
A full 100 years.

279
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,360
Once I obtain Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream,

280
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,760
I can finally activate
Sky-Swallowing Array.

281
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,160
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

282
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
After 100 years of patience,
your grand scheme will be complete.

283
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,120
Leaving everything in Chao Yuan's hands

284
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
was truly the right choice.

285
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
Tell him.

286
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Once he has the complete recipe,

287
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,080
he is to return to Zhushui Spiritual State
immediately to refine the medicine.

288
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,640
Yes.

289
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,000
Losing one Sunken Abyss means nothing.

290
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,720
Does Mu Yuanfeng think
his Aranya Barrier can stop me?

291
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,360
Once I possess Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream,

292
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,320
I shall activate Sky-Swallowing Array

293
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
during Qingyun Tournament

294
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,960
and completely rule over Six Realms!

295
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,240
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS

296
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
Longevity Turtle, Luo Fish, Ostrich Rat,

297
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,960
White-Eared Ape and Kunlun Moss Grass.

298
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,960
All are extremely rare ingredients.

299
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,800
It even requires Diwu tree's core
as a catalyst.

300
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,880
According to Wood Classics,
the Diwu tree is an ancient divine tree.

301
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,320
It has long been extinct in Six Realms.

302
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,240
Is there nowhere within Six Realms
that still keeps Diwu tree's core?

303
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,360
It hasn't been gone for 100
or 1,000 years.

304
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,720
It's been extinct for over 10,000 years.

305
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,600
Where on earth could we find it?

306
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,560
It's simply impossible.

307
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,040
If it weren't for that brat

308
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,040
destroying the last Golden Millet Dream
in existence,

309
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,680
we wouldn't be in this mess.

310
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,320
Look at him. Look.

311
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,560
Still pretending he knows nothing.
I'm talking about you!

312
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,800
-Ji Bozai! Ji Bozai.
-What are you doing? Playing dead?

313
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,360
I didn't even hit you hard.

314
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,520
Don't think pretending to be dead
will spare you.

315
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,840
He's poisoned.

316
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,480
Zhulong's claws are venomous.

317
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,840
Not bad. He lasted this long.

318
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,920
What are you doing?
Trying to make me die of anger?

319
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,960
It's poisonous blood.

320
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,880
Let me handle it.

321
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,120
This…

322
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,840
Alright.

323
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
How is he?

324
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,080
To die in a beauty's arms is romantic.

325
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,480
I can't watch this.

326
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,800
-I'm fine.
-You're still injured.

327
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,680
Didn't you see enough already?

328
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
Master.

329
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,920
I was wounded by Zhulong too.
Why am I fine?

330
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,880
And why did she only let me
enter the Bo clan's ancestral home?

331
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,200
Zhulong has a really strange temper.

332
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,000
Maybe she just likes you and hates him.

333
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,600
-Then… Then Fairy Bo…
-Enough.

334
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,840
What matters most right now

335
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,280
is finding Diwu tree's core
to make Golden Millet Dream.

336
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,400
Take me back to Wugui Sea
to heal my wound.

337
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

338
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,080
You can send him there.
Leave me out of this.

339
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Where does it hurt again?

340
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Slow down.

341
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,320
I'll go get Blood-Calming Powder.

342
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,480
Ming Yi!

343
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,480
You're injured.

344
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,240
Has Ming Yi come too?

345
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
-Where is she?
-Buxiu.

346
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,880
I…

347
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,880
No need to close the door.

348
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,280
Ming Yi will be back soon.

349
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,360
What are you doing?

350
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,199
Checking my wound.

351
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,040
Are you trying to murder your husband?

352
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,639
Immortal Ji, mind your words.

353
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,840
Our relationship is fake from the start.

354
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,040
Let alone now.

355
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,280
Go to Marriage Stone and take a look then.

356
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,840
See if our names are still there.

357
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,720
But those are fake names.

358
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,520
Yes.

359
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
But

360
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,120
I carved them there at a real cost.

361
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,080
I once thought you
were a descendant of the Bo clan.

362
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,160
I have my own family too.

363
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
My mother once left a mark
between my brows,

364
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,040
but I no longer wish to look for them.

365
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,560
Do you fear they abandoned you?

366
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,880
But if Fairy Bo's your master,

367
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,160
why won't the Zhulong Barrier
let you through?

368
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,880
Perhaps it's her divine consciousness
that decided so.

369
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,280
Maybe she just doesn't wish to see me.

370
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,400
Master must be hiding something from me.

371
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,360
I still don't understand that line.

372
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,520
"The truth lies before my eyes."

373
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,400
What does it really mean?

374
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,800
Did she leave anything for you?

375
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,320
Only Golden Millet Dream.

376
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,040
But Golden Millet Dream
cannot hold divine consciousness.

377
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,600
You can so naturally mention
Golden Millet Dream in front of me now.

378
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,920
You stopped pretending too.

379
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,840
You clearly know everything
about Wugui Sea,

380
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,760
even where the Blood-Calming Powder is.

381
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,400
What do you plan to do next?

382
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,560
Now that I know the recipe
for Golden Millet Dream,

383
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,720
even if everyone says

384
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,920
Diwu tree's core has vanished
from Six Realms,

385
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,080
I still won't sit here and wait to die.
I'll go find it.

386
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,880
I destroyed

387
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,800
Golden Millet Dream right
before your eyes.

388
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Don't you hate me for that?

389
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,360
It was yours to begin with.

390
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,360
You can do whatever you want with it.

391
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,680
Yes.

392
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,800
That's why I've already
handled it properly.

393
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,880
You…

394
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,840
You suffered, didn't you?

395
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,720
You couldn't even enter the ancestral home

396
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,880
to see Fairy Bo one last time.

397
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Fairy Bo's words…

398
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Master's wronging me is nonsense.

399
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,480
She chose to give you the recipe

400
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,840
for her own reasons.

401
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,600
As for what she hid from me,

402
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,480
I'll find out myself.

403
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,160
-What's wrong? Does the wound hurt again?
-What…

404
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm hungry.

405
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,160
Come eat with me.

406
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,760
Ji Bozai, are you
incapable of taking care of yourself?

407
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
You need company even to eat?

408
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,360
I got hurt because of you.

409
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,120
Slow down.
At least change into clean clothes.

410
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,640
Fine.

411
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,160
You said you were hungry.

412
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,680
I brought the food inside,
yet you wouldn't eat.

413
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,640
You had to come here to eat.
What are you doing?

414
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Why are you covering my eyes? Ji Bozai.

415
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,840
Put your hand down.

416
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,080
You're not in pain anymore, are you?

417
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,720
Why are you covering my eyes?
Eat by yourself then.

418
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,480
Embers.

419
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,520
I return Embers to you today.

420
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,560
From now on,
whether you stay in Jixing Abyss

421
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,640
or return to Yaoguang Mountain,

422
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,360
it will always protect you.

423
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,080
I can only try to restore its appearance,

424
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,680
but only you can truly repair it
completely.

425
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
Thank you.

426
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,240
Diwu tree's core is hard to find.

427
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,800
There's not a single clue.

428
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,200
To save me, Twenty-Seven

429
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,400
left only a trace of divine consciousness
in that bell.

430
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,680
I dare not hope for a future.

431
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,000
I said there will be a future,

432
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,120
then there definitely will be a future.

433
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,080
Diwu tree's core is hard to find.

434
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,600
There's not a single clue.

435
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,040
To save me, Twenty-Seven

436
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,560
left only a trace of divine consciousness
in that bell.

437
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,520
I dare not hope for a future.

438
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,080
Do you want to eat fish?

439
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,960
You dragons all eat fish, right?

440
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,600
I have a name. Eat and hurry back.

441
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,920
-You won't tell me your name.
-Buxiu.

442
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,480
I'm Twenty-Seven.

443
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,160
Buxiu? Nice name.

444
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,520
Honestly, I kind of envy you dragons.

445
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,080
You're all big and powerful.

446
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,400
When you take human form,
you're quite sturdy.

447
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,000
You helped me defeat Sun Liao.

448
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,320
I owe you one.

449
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,520
-No need.
-How about this?

450
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,280
I'll grant you three wishes.

451
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,800
No need, don't act on your own.

452
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
How about this? The first wish
is that I go fishing with you.

453
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,440
Ming Yi, you're finally back.
How did it go?

454
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,120
I found the recipe,
but we can't gather all the herbs.

455
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,400
Tell me what else is still missing.

456
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,800
I'll search the
whole world's heavenly treasures.

457
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,080
As long as I can save you,
I'll do anything.

458
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,280
Immortal Situ, I'm very grateful to you.

459
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,160
But fate runs its course,
and each has their destiny.

460
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,600
-Don't trouble yourself.
-You know your way back?

461
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,600
Why are you still standing there?
Hurry inside.

462
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,760
I still need to check the Heavenly Grief
in your body.

463
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,360
Honestly,

464
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,840
you never let me have a moment's peace.

465
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,480
-I'm not seeing you off.
-Master She.

466
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,160
Ming Yi refuses to reveal Golden
Millet Dream's recipe to me.

467
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,400
But I really just want to help.

468
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,960
Tell me what herbs are needed.

469
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,720
I'll find a way to get them.

470
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,520
Please, Master She. I must save her.

471
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,040
Even if I have to exchange my life
for hers.

472
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,360
The final catalyst herb is

473
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,840
Diwu tree's core.

474
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
Diwu tree's core?

475
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,960
It has been extinct for 13,000 years.

476
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,200
So we can't make Golden Millet Dream
after all.

477
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,440
Wait for me.

478
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,160
I'll find a way.
