1
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
"LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

2
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,400
As long as Your Highness doesn't ask
where I and my spiritual veins came from,

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
I'll fight for you
in the Qingyun Tournament.

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,400
However, I have a condition.

5
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,720
If I defeat Ming Xian
of Yaoguang Mountain,

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,160
I request Your Highness clear my name

7
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,160
and make me an Immortal.

8
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,040
And if you lose?

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,000
If I fail to defeat Ming Xian
in the Qingyun Tournament,

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,240
you may have me executed at once.

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,000
Let my primordial spirit shatter
and my soul scatter across the Six Realms.

12
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,800
BENEVOLENCE, KINDNESS,
WISDOM, AND PROPRIETY

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Tianji…

14
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Father,

15
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,040
everything will get better
once I marry Ji Bozai.

16
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,040
ZIWEI HALL

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,120
Your Highness.

18
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,680
I did not permit you to rise.

19
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,160
Should Your Highness
wish to vent your anger on me,

20
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
I shan't refuse.

21
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
You've had to work hard,
serving my uncle so faithfully

22
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,680
just to earn a physician's title.

23
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,240
Otherwise where would
you be crawling for scraps now?

24
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
Did I give you leave to rise?

25
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,000
Since you became Father's physician,

26
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,760
his periods of
unconsciousness have gotten longer.

27
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,560
Tell me what you're plotting.

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Turn Father into a puppet,

29
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
then kill me?

30
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,120
Your Highness is imagining too much.

31
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,640
His Majesty is chronically ill.
Sleep helps him heal.

32
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
You always wear that false face.

33
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
It's disgusting.

34
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,960
But thanks to you,

35
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
I can see Ji Bozai's worth
all the more clearly.

36
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,400
Making him my consort
couldn't be more fitting.

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,120
If Your Highness has time to
exchange arguments with me here,

38
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,360
you might as well…

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,560
Your Highness would do better
to investigate your consort candidate.

40
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
What do you mean?

41
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,000
It appears Your Highness is unaware

42
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,840
of the new mistress of Wugui Sea.

43
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
Ji Bozai's womanizing isn't something new.

44
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Is this the best you can do to provoke me?

45
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,360
Your Highness has always
had poor judgment in character.

46
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
You once fell for me and got deceived.

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Now you've set your sights on Ji Bozai.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,160
How sure are you
that he's truly trustworthy?

49
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,040
Not everyone's like you,

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,520
clawing your way upward at any cost.

51
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,160
I favor Ji Bozai
and want to make him my consort,

52
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,480
but he insists on
standing on his own strength.

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,520
On that point alone,

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,960
your character's far beneath his.

55
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
Or perhaps he's simply decided
that marrying a fallen princess

56
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,160
isn't worth much after all?

57
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm grateful you won honor
for the Jixing Abyss,

58
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,680
elevating it to the Upper Realms

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,680
and helped secure my seat
as Venerable of Shouhua Academy.

60
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,880
But for you and me,
that's far from enough.

61
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,760
Should we marry, one day,

62
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,400
you might even rule the Jixing Abyss.

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,200
Your Highness,
I'm wagering my life on this deal.

64
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,320
If I lose, my
primordial spirit will cease to burn.

65
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,680
You can't be so greedy
as to demand my freedom too.

66
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,720
I don't want your freedom.

67
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm offering you power.

68
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,760
Freedom, I've already got.

69
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,840
Power, you don't yet have.

70
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Why talk as if it were otherwise?

71
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Immortal Ji, you…

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
Ji Bozai!

73
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,640
Are you angry?

74
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm angry on your behalf.

75
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
And your marriage to him
is still hanging in the balance.

76
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,280
How do you know he won't side with us?

77
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
If he does, you will lose

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
what little hold you still have

79
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
over Shouhua Academy too.

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
Fairy Ming Yi.

81
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
The Venerable of
Shouhua Academy has summoned you.

82
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,920
Who… who are you? How'd you get in here?

83
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,160
Granny Xun!

84
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,440
I've got something to do.
I must get going.

85
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
What…

86
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,200
What is the meaning of this?

87
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,360
Weren't you taking me to the Venerable?
Where is she?

88
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
You're looking at her.

89
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,480
The Venerable of Shouhua Academy.
Princess Tianji…

90
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
Kneel.

91
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,640
Well, I can't exactly kneel right now.

92
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,800
Your Highness,
why did you have me brought here?

93
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,920
Ming Yi, yes?

94
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
Yes.

95
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,720
I order you to leave Ji Bozai.

96
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,960
If you walk away from him,
all these treasures will be yours.

97
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,200
I'll even give
you 1,000 taels of Blessed Rain.

98
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,679
What do you say?

99
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,520
Well…

100
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,360
What reason do you have to hesitate?
Think carefully.

101
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Leave the Jixing Abyss
and you'll get all this at once.

102
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Ji Bozai's tangled web of romantic debts…

103
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,240
Or maybe there's
something else you desire?

104
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,920
I'll arrange it all for you.

105
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,480
I want

106
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
the Golden Millet Dream,
but you can't give me that.

107
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,040
If you insist on staying with Ji Bozai,

108
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,520
then you'll die here today.

109
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not one for bloodshed,

110
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
but Ji Bozai treats you far too specially.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,280
I can't let you live.

112
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
Your Highness, there's no need for this.

113
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm sure we can come to an agreement
on the terms for me to leave Ji Bozai.

114
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,800
That's what you expect me to say, right?

115
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,200
It's true that
a man's worth pales in comparison

116
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,760
to this sea of riches or even my own life.

117
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,480
But ever since Ji Bozai rescued me

118
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,440
from that hellish Moonlit Blossoms,

119
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,600
I've fallen hopelessly in love with him.

120
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm deeply in love with him.
I'd die for him.

121
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
Then so be it.

122
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
You can die for all I care!

123
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,920
That'll save me some trouble too. Xiuyun.

124
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,960
Do it.

125
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,520
First time, huh? Don't tremble.

126
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Go ahead.

127
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,280
Brat, I saw you! Save me!

128
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,720
Ji Bozai!

129
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,880
Your Highness, why scare her?

130
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,560
Lord Ji…

131
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Fear not.

132
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,320
Princess Tianji.

133
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,600
Even you shouldn't
make things difficult for my woman.

134
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,160
I ask Your Highness not to tear us apart.

135
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,800
So you've decided to stand by her?

136
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
Princess Tianji.

137
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,160
What lies between us is only a fair deal,
nothing more.

138
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,640
I've already made that clear.

139
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,120
But if my father insists
on granting you and me in marriage,

140
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,080
will you defy the decree?

141
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
His Majesty's been
in a deep sleep for years.

142
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,960
Lord Hanfeng's influence is at its peak.

143
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,520
These days, the entire Jixing Palace
likely regards him as their true ruler.

144
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,440
I may be no more
than a newcomer, but I've risen fast.

145
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,040
A fallen princess and a rising power.

146
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,520
Do you think Lord Hanfeng will let you
get your hands on that decree?

147
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Ji Bozai, don't forget it was me
who freed you from the prisoner's brand.

148
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,680
Yes, you did me a great kindness.

149
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,920
But I won't repay it with marriage.

150
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,120
For you, a warrior
who can win the Qingyun Tournament

151
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,440
means far more
than any consort, doesn't it?

152
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Of course.

153
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,080
I ask that you lend me your strength.

154
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I'll be taking her with me.

155
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
And remember this, Your Highness.

156
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,280
If anyone dares to harm my Ming Yi again,

157
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,920
even if it's the Emperor himself,

158
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
I'll kill whoever does.

159
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,080
Your Highness!
How could he speak to you like that!

160
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
It doesn't matter
how he treats me or what he feels.

161
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
What matters is that for now,
he hasn't joined my uncle's faction.

162
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,480
That's enough for me.

163
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,760
Immortal.

164
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
All the ladies on duty today are here.

165
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
Who would you like to perform for you?

166
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,080
Which of you is Ji Bozai's favored?

167
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,240
Immortal Ji's favored lady?

168
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,080
-That's me.
-It's me.

169
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,160
No, it's me!

170
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,520
You're wrong. It's me.

171
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,880
They say once, two immortals
chased a fairy through Moonlit Blossoms.

172
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,480
Ji Bozai stepped in
and claimed she was his.

173
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
-Who?
-I don't know who that is.

174
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
If any of you can identify that fairy,

175
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,760
these treasures are yours.

176
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,200
I really can't be sure.

177
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,040
Every fairy here admires Immortal Ji.

178
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,000
He has made far too many companions.

179
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,480
You must have already asked

180
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,200
the owner of
Moonlit Blossoms when you arrived.

181
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,560
If she doesn't know,

182
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
how could we?

183
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
-That's right.
-How would we know?

184
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,360
We don't know.

185
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
-I have no idea.
-Me too.

186
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
Sir?

187
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,080
-When did he leave?
-Where did he go?

188
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,320
He's gone.

189
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,480
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

190
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,000
Seriously?
Is this the sort of stuff you read?

191
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,040
Well, if I want
to deal with that philanderer,

192
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,880
I need the right medicine.

193
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,680
Then, why don't you just slip him a drug?

194
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,720
I'd love to, but he's too cautious.

195
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,120
He never eats food from others.

196
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,560
All right. Enough teasing.

197
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,000
How have you been?

198
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,440
How's that waist injury of yours?

199
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,440
How's the medicine I gave you?

200
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,280
What do you think? Impressive, right?

201
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,440
As expected of you, Zhang Tai.

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,200
What's wrong?
Why aren't you getting back up?

203
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
Help…

204
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,560
I'm stuck…

205
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,200
Are you serious?

206
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,960
Ow…

207
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
Bear with it. You've only yourself
to blame for showing off.

208
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,520
Well, I thought I was all better…

209
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,360
There's something you should know.

210
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,200
Yesterday, a guest came by.

211
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,000
He wasn't there
for entertainment or pleasure.

212
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Rather, he inquired about the incident

213
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,360
when you were pursued
by those two immortals.

214
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,600
What did he look like?

215
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,280
Tall, handsome, thin.

216
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,200
That isn't helpful.
I didn't even see him, all right?

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,839
He hid behind a screen.

218
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,079
He obviously had ill intentions,
so I covered for you.

219
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,079
Thanks.

220
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,520
He was so secretive.

221
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
You don't think he's a warrior, do you?

222
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,599
He must be.

223
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
A warrior who
trespasses into another realm

224
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,440
and gets caught is as good as dead.

225
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
Rub here for me again.

226
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,280
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

227
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,320
He didn't touch a drop of wine that day,

228
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,920
but he did take a bite of a chestnut cake.

229
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,840
Chestnut cake…

230
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
It's that idiot.

231
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm heading back!

232
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,720
They make a fine pair.

233
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,560
You didn't have to send her off with me.

234
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,320
Well, she's a friend
of the mistress of Wugui Sea.

235
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
It was her first visit.
I can at least observe that courtesy.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,080
As expected of the man of the household.

237
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,480
Today has been good.

238
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,760
What makes today good?

239
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
Um…

240
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,320
The weather. The weather's good.

241
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,480
Good? It looks like it's about to pour.

242
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,080
I'd say thunder's on the way too.

243
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I'll play along
until the worm works its magic.

244
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,840
Lord Ji! Whatever did you mean?

245
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,120
JUDGMENT HALL

246
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,120
SITU LING, CHIEF OF
THE JUDGMENT HALL OF THE JIXING ABYSS

247
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,640
Congratulations to Immortal Situ Ling,

248
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,400
newly appointed Chief of
the Judgment Hall of the Jixing Abyss.

249
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,480
May you bring forth clarity
and righteous fairness.

250
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,400
May His Majesty's blessing
and the stars eternal be with you.

251
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,760
Situ, you're finally here.

252
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,160
I've been acting as head
of the Judgment Hall for months,

253
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,880
and I'm exhausted.

254
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,920
From this point forward,
it's under your charge.

255
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,600
This tea's bitter.

256
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,240
I received your letter
and hurried here as fast as I could.

257
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
I'm ready to share
your burdens, Lord Hanfeng.

258
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
Situ, your talent is unmatched.

259
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,640
You were first
among all the candidates in the realms.

260
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,200
With you as Chief of Judgment Hall,
you'll be a great help to me…

261
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,800
to the Jixing Abyss.

262
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,680
Hou Zhao's been missing
since the Qingyun Tournament.

263
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I've confirmed he was in close contact
with the warden of the Sunken Abyss.

264
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
Perhaps his disappearance's
linked to the Sunken Abyss.

265
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,600
A proper investigation is needed.

266
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Your chamber's been prepared.

267
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,240
You should get some rest.

268
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,680
You'll have as many men as you require
at your disposal.

269
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
Now, a toast to you…

270
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,320
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.
I'll take my leave.

271
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
That was so bitter.

272
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,800
What tea's this bitter?

273
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
Back to work for me…

274
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,680
It's misery piled on misery…

275
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,320
My Lord.

276
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,920
Hou Zhao vanished
right after Ji Bozai's victory.

277
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,200
We never once considered
the connection between the two matters.

278
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
I was short-sighted.

279
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,040
I was fixated on winning him over,

280
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,800
getting him to hand over
the Golden Millet Dream of his own accord.

281
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,480
I forgot that
if he holds the Golden Millet Dream,

282
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,880
his ties to Bo Yulan must run deep.

283
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,480
With Situ Ling's arrival
and Your Lordship's impending retirement,

284
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,200
a banquet is in order.

285
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,640
Why not invite
Ji Bozai tomorrow and test him?

286
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,280
If Ji Bozai is involved with Bo Yulan,

287
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,840
then he mustn't be kept alive.

288
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
You didn't have to come tonight.

289
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,400
How could I skip Lord Hanfeng's banquet?

290
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,240
My point is,
since the former chief went missing,

291
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Mu Qibai's been
managing the Judgment Hall.

292
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
Today's only a farewell banquet.

293
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,160
You only share this with me
after I'm already on board.

294
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
I'd have thought

295
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,600
you were warning me
in case something happened.

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,960
Who's the new Chief of the Judgment Hall?

297
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,440
They say his name's Situ Ling.

298
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,840
What's he like?

299
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,120
I haven't seen him either.

300
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,920
Heard he's just a sly fox.

301
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
He was expected at tonight's farewell,

302
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
but suddenly declined,
claiming he was too tired from work

303
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,600
to drink or indulge in pleasure,

304
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
so he excused himself.

305
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,920
You should've used that excuse too.

306
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,080
I'm not going to miss it.

307
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,800
Things that must be faced should be faced.

308
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
I get it.

309
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
You're worried Lord Hanfeng
will foist someone on you.

310
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,360
-That's why you brought me along.
-Yes.

311
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,640
I prefer not to have
others push people onto me.

312
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,960
I like to make my own choices.

313
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,200
Lord Ji, the night
Lord Hanfeng came to Wugui Sea,

314
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,800
I accidentally knocked over a box
in your room.

315
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
A broken iron fan fell out.

316
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
I wondered why you'd keep such a thing.

317
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Could it be some fairy left it with you?

318
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,200
That was Ming Xian's weapon.

319
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,960
Then, why'd you keep it?

320
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,680
Ming Xian was defeated,
and you wanted to keep it as a prize?

321
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,280
He really is,

322
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,000
as the rumors claim,
an incredibly gifted warrior.

323
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,400
At one point,
I thought he might even defeat me.

324
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,200
But for some reason,

325
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,520
his spiritual power
seemed to fail all at once.

326
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,240
I could hardly draw back my own power then
and almost killed him.

327
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,520
Luckily, his weapon saved him.

328
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,840
I kept it.

329
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,560
I thought I'd return it if we met

330
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
on the battlefield again.

331
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,320
What brought this up?

332
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,760
Pretend you didn't hear what I said.

333
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,840
He didn't sound like he was lying.

334
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,280
Could he not be the one
who poisoned me with Heavenly Grief?

335
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
If it wasn't him, then…

336
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,280
who would've done it?

337
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,120
We've arrived.

338
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,120
-Here.
-This is… for you, Ji.

339
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,600
See? Someone's watching over me now.

340
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,120
Ming Yi won't let me drink.

341
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,320
Ming Yi,
how about you drink this cup for me?

342
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,600
I can't possibly
let Immortal Yan toast me.

343
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,360
I should be the one to toast Immortal Yan.

344
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,640
I've never seen you consume
anything while you're outside, Ji.

345
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
Why's that?

346
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
Nonsense.

347
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,160
He eats like a pig
at Moonlit Blossoms every time.

348
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,280
Look at him…

349
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,640
Work with me here.

350
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
Lord Hanfeng has arrived.

351
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,760
Greetings, Lord Hanfeng.

352
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,080
Spare me the formality.

353
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,720
Haven't I said before?

354
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,920
From now on,
you should all follow Bozai's example.

355
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,520
Well? Put those arms down.

356
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,560
Put them down.

357
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,440
Today, I had a room
cleared for our new chief.

358
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,440
Guess what we found.

359
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,680
In Hou Zhao's old quarters,

360
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,080
we found a portrait of a beauty.

361
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
What an exquisitely painted beauty.

362
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,680
Might she be Hou Zhao's lover?

363
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,680
Hou Zhao's gone missing.

364
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,200
Could he have eloped with this fairy?

365
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,400
Everyone, take a good look.

366
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,840
Does anyone recognize
the fairy in the painting?

367
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,280
What magic was
used to paint this portrait?

368
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,640
She even moves.

369
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,880
To be captured by such a rare technique,
she must be special.

370
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,600
Ji, you're acquainted
with fairies from every realm.

371
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,240
Take a good look.

372
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,400
Do you know her?

373
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
Even if I used to be close
to many fairies,

374
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,080
that's all in the past.

375
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,240
Now, my heart holds only Ming Yi.

376
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,040
Now that Ji's settled down,
even he's afraid of his beloved.

377
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,040
The fairy in the portrait
looks like someone you would favor.

378
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,800
Ji, are you sure you don't recognize her?

379
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,880
Maybe you should take a closer look.

380
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,200
Immortal Ji claims he doesn't know her.

381
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,560
Let me take a look.

382
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,880
This fairy's quite voluptuous.

383
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,520
Let me see too.

384
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,760
With lips like cherries,

385
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,800
it wouldn't be a waste to have a taste.

386
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Such a divine technique that allows
the fairy in the portrait to move.

387
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,520
If it could switch poses,

388
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,680
wouldn't that be even better?

389
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,520
A man's mind holds
vast valleys and flowing rivers.

390
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,680
A beauty's smile topples cities.

391
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,200
In moonlight, neck to neck, intertwined.

392
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,160
Longing stirs…

393
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,280
-Immortal Sun!
-Are you all right?

394
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,680
If you can't handle
your liquor, don't drink so much.

395
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Who threw that cup?

396
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,560
You did it.

397
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,000
You did that on purpose! What's this?

398
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,160
Now that you feel protected,
you're getting a bit too bold, huh?

399
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,640
Get up!

400
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,920
-You…
-What…

401
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Immortal Ji.

402
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,320
Both you and Sun Liao
fought in the Qingyun Tournament.

403
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,840
This is excessive.

404
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,800
How'd it go from me eating
a piece of melon to you two fighting?

405
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,960
Enough.

406
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,720
Immortal Ji, are you this angry

407
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,880
for the beauty by your side
or for the fairy in the portrait?

408
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,120
Lord Hanfeng, it's all my fault.

409
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,880
I knocked the cup over

410
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,120
and embarrassed Immortal Sun Liao.

411
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
Lord Ji has no fault to bear.

412
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
I ruined everyone's mood.

413
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,280
Please punish me instead.

414
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,960
Get up.

415
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,080
You've done nothing wrong.
There's no reason for you to kneel.

416
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,400
Lord Hanfeng, you're mistaken.

417
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,480
What I did just now
was to protect the one I love.

418
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,520
Should you find your true love one day,
you'll understand.

419
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,960
We won't be staying in this dull place
crawling with scoundrels.

420
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,600
-Farewell.
-I…

421
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,480
I did that on purpose.

422
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,920
I know.

423
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,360
Did I cause you trouble?

424
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,280
Lord Ji…

425
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,880
Don't move.

426
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,840
Don't worry about them.

427
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,360
After I take you back,
I still have business to handle.

428
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,239
You should get some rest.

429
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
He's rather good at this.

430
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,240
Ming Yi! Stop spacing out.

431
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,920
The worm reacted.

432
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,800
Perfect. Ji Bozai's away too. Let's go!

433
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,600
This is where the pavilion
in the back mountain used to be.

434
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,920
The pavilion? The one you burned?

435
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,600
Burned it so
thoroughly not a trace is left.

436
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,760
Why did it bring us here?

437
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,160
Nothing's happening.

438
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,040
That's enough. Let me do it.

439
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,440
A familiar sensation…

440
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,640
Ji Bozai hid the Spirit Well here.

441
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,400
The Spirit Well? Impossible.

442
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,120
His power's even stronger than I thought.

443
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,480
He's already reached the point

444
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,240
where he can turn
the Spirit Well into a real location.

445
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
He's picked himself
one heck of a treasure vault.

446
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,800
And I've already burned the place.

447
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,840
Yet Ji Bozai didn't even mention it?

448
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,960
Guess he thinks we're suspicious
and doesn't want to tip his hand early.

449
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,320
Wait. What do
you mean he hasn't said anything?

450
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,840
Didn't he send me away?

451
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,640
If it wasn't for my quick thinking,

452
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,080
who would've cleaned up this mess for you!

453
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,120
Oh… So, this is the Spirit…

454
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,880
This is the Spirit Well, huh?

455
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,320
Twenty-Seven,
you've learned to change the subject.

456
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,440
The worm sensed it.
That means the Golden Millet Dream's here.

457
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,800
What to do?

458
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,080
None but the one
who shares Ji Bozai's divine consciousness

459
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,240
can enter his Spirit Well.

460
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,360
But you're Ming Xian.

461
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,960
You're literally the least likely person

462
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,440
in the Six Realms to share
divine consciousness with Ji Bozai.

463
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,200
Ming Xian can't do it.

464
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,720
But right now you're Ming Yi,

465
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,720
the fairy Ji Bozai took
from Moonlit Blossoms.

466
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,960
What are you getting at?

467
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Rules of the Six Realms.

468
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,280
When you wed,
you have to form a heart imprint

469
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,200
through the Marriage Stone.

470
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,040
After that, you can
share divine consciousness.

471
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,800
You…

472
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
You don't say.

473
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,920
That's a shortcut, huh?

474
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,960
Right?

475
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Right?

476
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,280
Sounds easy enough.

477
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,240
No fighting, no sparring, simple as that.

478
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,080
You just have to marry him.

479
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
-Just marry him…
-Easy.

480
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,520
-It should be a piece of cake for you…
-Hold on.

481
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,400
What about a separation?

482
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,080
I have to go back to Yaoguang Mountain.
Is it a hassle to get a separation?

483
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,200
Easy.

484
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,000
Trust me.

485
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,600
When the time comes, you just agree
to erase each other's names.

486
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,600
All right. Let's do that.

487
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,880
When did you learn all this?

488
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,720
Ji Bozai doesn't look like
someone who'd marry you.

489
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,200
You've got a long road ahead.

490
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,800
It was hard enough just getting
him to take me back to Wugui Sea.

491
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,920
He wouldn't even marry a princess.

492
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,640
How am I going to get him to marry me?

493
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,600
Immortal Ji, are you this angry
for the beauty by your side

494
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
or for the fairy in the portrait?

495
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,880
At the banquet,
Mu Qibai took out a portrait.

496
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,240
Ji Bozai actually seemed to care.

497
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,120
If I help him out,
maybe his affection for me will…

498
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
What are you trying to say?

499
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,720
Story time.

500
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,760
"Chapter 13,
Ming Yi breaking into Judgment Hall."

501
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,800
-Come on!
-Wait!

502
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,360
Hands off.

503
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,320
There's an array.

504
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,680
You think the Judgment Hall's
just a place you can stroll into?

505
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,160
The array barrier activates at night.

506
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,800
It'll definitely make
a petal fall off your Grief Blossom.

507
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,920
It's not worth it for a portrait.

508
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
Since Zhang Tai already brought it up,

509
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,360
Ming Xin probably followed me
into the Jixing Abyss.

510
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,280
My movements can't stay hidden forever.

511
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,960
We might as well make
sure he doesn't come for nothing.

512
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Let's give him a surprise.

513
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,120
If he's here, why aren't we running?

514
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,520
We can't hide forever,
but at least we can hide for a while.

515
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Do you think I have that much time left?

516
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,360
-Even so…
-Chapter 14.

517
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,120
"Ming Yi Takes Risks for Wealth."

518
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,040
-Come on!
-But…

519
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,720
What do you mean
Ming Yi takes risks for wealth!

520
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,640
You're living the wealthy part!

521
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,920
I'm the one risking my neck!

522
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,840
Running here, running there,
burning this, burning that…

523
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,760
You're the one enjoying the rewards…

524
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,000
Don't miss out!

525
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,040
The Search Mirror makes no mistakes.

526
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,280
Ming Xian must be in the Jixing Abyss.

527
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,200
But I can't stay here long.

528
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,480
If my identity's exposed,
it'll be a disaster.

529
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
That looks nice.

530
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,600
Feel free to take a look.

531
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,280
Move!

532
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,240
Stop!

533
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,480
Your Lordship, let me go to Judgment Hall.

534
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,280
If Mu Qibai's set a trap,
it's better I get caught

535
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,680
than risk exposing your connection
to the Golden Millet Dream.

536
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,480
The fact he brought out
my master's portrait already proves

537
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,920
he's figured it out.

538
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,480
If I can't even save one portrait,

539
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,120
then there was no point in my clawing
my way out of the Sunken Abyss.

540
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
I might as well have stayed there
forever as a prisoner.

541
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,160
But it's my duty to protect you.

542
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,680
Braving all dangers is
what I'm supposed to do in your stead.

543
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,480
If something happens to me, it's nothing.

544
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,720
But if something happens to you,
who else can hold things together?

545
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,120
-Let me go.
-You're talking too much.

546
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,240
This isn't like you.

547
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,600
Stop worrying.

548
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,200
His petty tricks won't do anything to me.

549
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,440
JUDGMENT HALL

550
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,480
THE SEA STANDS TALL WITH HANGING CLOUDS

551
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,360
Lord Ji, it's me.

552
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,680
What are you doing here?

553
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,320
I'm here for you.

554
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,360
Heaven has blessed me.

555
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,600
Letting him see this chapter 13
with his own eyes will be easier

556
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,920
than me trying to explain.

557
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,880
That portrait at the banquet
meant a lot to you, didn't it?

558
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,400
I could tell from one glance.

559
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,560
You see, you took me in.

560
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,120
I ought to do something
for you in return, right?

561
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,920
And that's why you're here?

562
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,160
You can't catch a tiger cub
without entering the tiger's den.

563
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,600
And how'd you get in?

564
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,320
The Judgment Hall's array barrier

565
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,880
isn't something
an ordinary fairy can just stroll through.

566
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,160
I didn't exactly stroll in,
but I did come in fair and square.

567
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,760
Fair and square?

568
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,080
You know me.

569
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,000
You're the one
who took me from Moonlit Blossoms.

570
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,480
All I had to do was… Sir…

571
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,080
Sir, oh, sir…

572
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,840
There's a wall in the hidden hall

573
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,000
my father repaired ten years ago.

574
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,600
My mother and I used to come here
to keep him company.

575
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,160
But I was such a brat back then.

576
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,400
I grabbed both their hands
and pressed them into the wall.

577
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,200
Now, there's
a handprint of all three of us.

578
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,760
Today's the anniversary of their deaths.

579
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,400
I just wanted to come in and see them.

580
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,280
I… I…

581
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,240
And they opened a gap in the array for me,
and I came in.

582
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,560
Did that boy do this?

583
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,400
JUDGMENT HALL

584
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,240
Kitten, once you fall into my hands…

585
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,920
Idiot.

586
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,920
Be sure to get out of here fast
when that idiot wakes.

587
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,360
I'll get someone to haul him off.

588
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,400
JUDGMENT HALL

589
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,800
How did you even know
something was on that wall?

590
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
I lied. There's nothing on that wall.

591
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,920
And they believed you?

592
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,400
Well, I added a little performance.

593
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,680
I tugged at my collar just a bit.
They couldn't resist my charms…

594
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,040
That's enough. Come on.
