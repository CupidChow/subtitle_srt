1
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,200
That immortal from Zhushui Spiritual State

3
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
is quite loyal to you.

4
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,920
He cares so much about you.

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Situ Ling and I did everything we could

6
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,480
to stabilize your condition.

7
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
But I'm afraid
that will not last for more than a month.

8
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,080
It's all right. We have one month anyway.

9
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,360
Situ Ling said he had some connections
in Zhushui Spiritual State.

10
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,440
And I will find
some herbs at Mangfu Swamp tomorrow.

11
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Worry not.

12
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm sure I can find
a cure in these vast Six Realms.

13
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,320
Master,

14
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,960
there's still hope
for Twenty-Seven, right?

15
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Of course.

16
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Once a companion beast
makes a pact with its master,

17
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
they become one entity.

18
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,240
Situ Ling preserved a wisp
of Twenty-Seven's divine consciousness.

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,760
Once your spiritual veins
and power return,

20
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,880
so will he.

21
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
Ming Yi.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,480
Ji Bozai does not
have the Golden Millet Dream at all?

23
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,520
He had it.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,400
But he saw me stealing it,
so he destroyed it before my eyes.

25
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,160
Destroy it? Why…

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,280
Why would he do that?

27
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,760
It's your only hope to live.

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,360
That jerk. I…

29
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,960
I could grab his neck now and snap it.

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,600
-And you even lied to Situ Ling for him.
-Master.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,960
What's happened has happened.

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,280
Besides, it was Ji Bozai's possession.

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,640
He can do whatever he wants with it.

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,960
If everyone knows
he had the Golden Millet Dream,

35
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,200
no one will believe that it is gone.

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Some people refuse to give up.

37
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
Also, I let him down first.

38
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't want to trouble him again.

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,600
Why did I take in a disciple like you? I…

40
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,520
I've heard that Ming Yi left Wugui Sea.

41
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
I will not pry into
what happened between you two.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,040
But most of the time,

43
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,480
communication is
the solution to a misunderstanding.

44
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,480
Immortal Ji, I brought you here
to discuss something.

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Now that my uncle has passed,
we should tie up any loose ends.

46
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
What do you want
to do next, Your Highness?

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
We must deal with Mu Qibai's subordinates.

48
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,240
We can recruit those who
wish to serve Jixing Abyss with caution.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,120
And the rebels will be exiled
to the cold, harsh grounds.

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,120
The netherbeast army
was emboldened by the Blood Moon.

51
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,360
Needless to say,
the Emperor of Zhushui is the mastermind.

52
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Given his ambition, he won't stop now.

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,320
The Soul-Consuming Tree
in the Dragon Carp Terrace

54
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,360
connects the Sunken Abyss
and the divine capital.

55
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
If they attack Jixing Abyss,

56
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,680
an opening presents
itself in the Sunken Abyss.

57
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,440
Ah, you noticed it too.

58
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Immortal Ji, it seems like
you already have a plan in mind.

59
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,920
After Hou Zhao turned himself in,

60
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,280
the Judgment Hall released the innocent
prisoners from the Sunken Abyss.

61
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Other prisoners
were transferred elsewhere.

62
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,360
However, knowing how unique the place is,
it will always be a problem for us.

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I plan to withdraw
all guards from the Sunken Abyss,

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,400
seal the Soul-Consuming Tree,

65
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
and then destroy
the Sunken Abyss for good.

66
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,560
As you wish, Immortal Ji.

67
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
My Lord.

68
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,000
My Lord, you hurt yourself
again and again to save Ming Yi.

69
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,720
And this time, you even exposed
your true identity to save her.

70
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,280
Is she worth it?

71
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,440
-As long as she lives.
-My Lord!

72
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,360
Did you find anything
in Zhushui Spiritual State?

73
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,320
I bribed Chao Yu's former confidant

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,040
and found out the truth
about what happened 22 years ago.

75
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,280
We all believed

76
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
a sudden inferno in Zhangwei Mountain

77
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,080
killed everyone in the Bo clan.

78
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,960
But in fact, it was His Majesty

79
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,400
who sent in a secret squad
to raid the Bo's ancestral mansion

80
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,800
in Zhangwei Mountain.

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
I knew it.

82
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,800
Back then, they only found
Part 1 of the Bo's Medical Classics,

83
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,240
which contains the method
to fabricate the Heavenly Grief.

84
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,200
However, the prescription of
the Golden Millet Dream is incomplete.

85
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,040
The Bo clan died in the fire.

86
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
His Majesty gave
Mu Qibai Part 1 of the documents

87
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,120
so that he could make
the poison in the Sunken Abyss.

88
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
But the rest of the classics are missing.

89
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
His Majesty then
gave Chao Yu a secret task

90
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,440
to hunt down the Bo sisters
to retrieve the rest of the classics.

91
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
That said, it is still missing right now.

92
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,800
A century ago, the Bo clan
developed these dichotomous drugs

93
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
capable of giving spiritual veins
to those who were born without one.

94
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,840
The Six Realms fought for them
and many lost their lives.

95
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,640
The Bos then destroyed all the drugs

96
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,160
and warned their descendants
not to make them again.

97
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,400
The Bo sisters are fugitives.

98
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,880
They have probably hidden
Part 2 of the classics somewhere.

99
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,280
After the Bo clan was gone,

100
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
the patron deity,
Zhulong, woke up in rage.

101
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
It sealed
the mountain and burned the forest.

102
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,360
His Majesty had
to retreat from Zhangwei Mountain.

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,799
Since then, the Bo's ancestral mansion

104
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,640
has been kept inside an impenetrable
barrier erected by Zhulong.

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,720
It cannot be discovered.

106
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,440
Only the Bo descendants can enter it.

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,800
In that case,
the best place to hide something

108
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,400
is the hidden Bo's ancestral mansion.

109
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Maybe

110
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,480
Part 2 of the classics
is in Bo's ancestral mansion now.

111
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
And there's currently
one descendant of the Bo clan

112
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,320
who can enter the barrier.

113
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Ji Bozai?

114
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,440
I'll retrieve Part 1 of the classics
from the Sunken Abyss.

115
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
My Lord.

116
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,680
Mu Qibai has passed.

117
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Zhushui Spiritual State
will be on high alert.

118
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,160
If you take it away,
His Majesty will find out.

119
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,680
There's no time for this.

120
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,720
Ji Bozai doesn't have
the Golden Millet Dream.

121
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,920
I need to make a new one
so that Ming Yi can live.

122
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,040
She won't bat an eye at you
even if you do this for her.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,280
One day, she'll fall for me.

124
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
A CLOUD OF PEAR
BLOSSOMS AND A FORLORN DREAM

125
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,280
Are you sure, Immortal Situ?

126
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,240
After the Emperor of Zhushui retreated,

127
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,680
the patron deity,
Zhulong, erected a barrier

128
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
and hid the Bo's ancestral mansion.

129
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,760
If they are still looking for Part 2,

130
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,040
it means Part 2 still hasn't been found.

131
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
We just have to get
Part 1 from the Sunken Abyss,

132
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
then find Part 2.

133
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,920
Once we collect both,

134
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,840
we might be able
to make the Golden Millet Dream.

135
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,800
I am the Chief of Judgment Hall.

136
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,040
I have access to many things.

137
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,880
And even if I am found out,
I can find an excuse to protect myself.

138
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
Ming Yi,
I'll go to the Sunken Abyss for you.

139
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,880
I can't burden you again, Immortal Situ.

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,320
A CLOUD OF PEAR
BLOSSOMS AND A FORLORN DREAM

141
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,000
Ming Yi. Immortal Situ
made you some scallion pancakes.

142
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Have some.

143
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,240
Ming Yi.

144
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,040
Ming Yi!

145
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,600
Immortal Situ!

146
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,440
Ming Yi is gone.

147
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
Ming Yi.

148
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,800
Master, Zhang Tai, Immortal Situ.

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,840
I appreciate
your hospitality all this time,

150
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
but I cannot ask you
to take more risks for me.

151
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
I left to retrieve the classics.

152
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,400
Forgive me.

153
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
Immortal Situ.

154
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,320
Can Immortal Situ find Ming Yi?

155
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,120
Maybe I should inform Ji Bozai.

156
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,160
JI…

157
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,920
Ming Yi!

158
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,720
Ming Yi!

159
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,480
Ming Yi!

160
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,360
Ming Yi!

161
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,360
Twenty-Seven.

162
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Twenty-Seven.

163
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Twenty-Seven.

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
No.

165
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Ming Yi!

166
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Ming Yi!

167
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,760
Ming Yi!

168
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,840
Where are you, Ming Yi?

169
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
"Ming," as in "bright,"
like the moon in your heart,

170
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
and "Yi," as in "feelings,"
like the deep ones I hold for you.

171
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,640
You are the one

172
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,160
who's in a mess.

173
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,640
My relationship with you isn't ordinary.

174
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,280
This sounds more like jealousy.

175
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,640
My Lord! My Lord!

176
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,760
I brewed a lot of Golden Millet Dream
and brought a jar for you.

177
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,080
You're the best, My Lord!

178
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,120
Thank you.

179
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,760
Make me one more artifact.

180
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,760
Show me. Come on. One more.

181
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,080
There's no need for that.

182
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,720
I really want to see it. Make me one more.

183
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,320
-Please.
-Okay.

184
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,640
My Lord,
it seems like you still care about me.

185
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,600
I am rich now.

186
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,800
I want to be your wife,

187
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,040
your loyal, doting,

188
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,080
and legitimate wife.

189
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,920
Get yourself together, Ji Bozai.

190
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,560
Twenty-Seven.

191
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,640
Twenty-Seven.

192
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Twenty-Seven.

193
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,800
Twenty-Seven.

194
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
Twenty-Seven.

195
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,200
Twenty-Seven.

196
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
Only a wisp

197
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,080
of your cat's divine
consciousness is left.

198
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,440
What happened?

199
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
How come you're here?

200
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,480
Didn't you sever the heart imprint?

201
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
Zhang Tai told me to come.

202
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,440
I won't trouble you again.

203
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,360
Even if the Graft Spell backfires on you,
there's no way you can be this weak.

204
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,000
What's wrong?

205
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Nothing.

206
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,760
Even if something's wrong,
it has nothing to do with you.

207
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes, that is true.

208
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,960
I came to ask you one thing.

209
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,920
In Xinliu's testimony,

210
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,880
she mentioned Mu Qibai had a name list.

211
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
Did you erase that?

212
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So you found out.

213
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,600
Yes.

214
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
Moments ago.

215
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,280
When I had Twenty-Seven
investigate the netherbeast army,

216
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,680
I told him to find the name list
in the Dragon Carp Terrace.

217
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,680
He found nothing.

218
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,720
I speculated
that either Mu Qibai found out

219
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,960
and destroyed it

220
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,920
or someone else took it away.

221
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,120
Helping me was your excuse to approach me.

222
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,280
Why should I trust you now?

223
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,600
Maybe you have the name list.

224
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,400
That's why you concealed
this piece of information from me.

225
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,680
If I had the name list,

226
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,840
I would have sufficient evidence
to know who from Yaoguang Mountain

227
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,320
got the Heavenly Grief from Mu Qibai.

228
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
I would strike back and locate the villain

229
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,760
who poisoned Ming Xian.

230
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,080
I wouldn't be here at all.

231
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,040
Ming Xian was
poisoned by the Heavenly Grief.

232
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,440
So that's why
you want the Golden Millet Dream.

233
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,160
It's not because of Yaoguang Mountain.

234
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,480
Owning both the Golden Millet Dream
and the Heavenly Grief

235
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,680
allows one to have spiritual veins

236
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,480
and ascend to the next cultivation stage.

237
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,760
When that happens,

238
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,360
Yaoguang Mountain can win
in the Qingyun Tournament.

239
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,840
It sounds enticing.

240
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
But worry not, Immortal Ji.

241
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
I am not that despicable yet.

242
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,240
So why not return sooner?

243
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,760
To Yaoguang Mountain?

244
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,480
The Golden Millet Dream is destroyed.

245
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,360
What's the point of going back?

246
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,760
Watch as Ming Xian died
from the pain of Heavenly Grief?

247
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
He is prideful.

248
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,520
He won't let anyone see him
when he's at his most vulnerable.

249
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,520
So full of lies.

250
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,120
Zhang Tai, Ming Yi is in…

251
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,680
-Zhang Tai.
-You're finally awake.

252
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,320
I was so scared.

253
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
How did I come back?

254
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,560
I asked Immortal Ji to find you.

255
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
After he found you, he wrote to me.

256
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,200
Immortal Situ was looking for you too.

257
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,000
I told him you'd be staying at my place.

258
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,520
I also told him not to visit now
so that you could get more rest.

259
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,400
When I was there, Immortal Ji was gone.

260
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,920
You were unconscious
so I brought you back.

261
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
What happened?

262
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
You were unconscious
in the temple just now,

263
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,480
and you were so cold.

264
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,240
Fortunately, someone injected
some spiritual power into you.

265
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,360
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.

266
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,800
Ming Yi,

267
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,640
I'm worried about you.

268
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,480
What is happening?

269
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,200
I thought you would tell me
when you recovered.

270
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,360
But it's getting worse now. I…

271
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Thank you, Zhang Tai.

272
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,920
My life isn't worth anything.

273
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,320
But you saved me and care for me.

274
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,720
If you know I've been lying to you,

275
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,040
you will hate me forever.

276
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,000
What are you on about?

277
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,440
I will never hate you
even if you lie to me.

278
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,240
You've been so kind to me.

279
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,240
A few lies won't change my mind.

280
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,240
I won't die just because you lied to me.

281
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,120
And if someone hates you,
that's because they are an idiot.

282
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,360
Can't they see it's a white lie?

283
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,840
You…

284
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,400
So you are…

285
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,880
Ming Yi. How could it be? You are…

286
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,640
Oh, my.

287
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,080
You were framed and poisoned.

288
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
And you only have one month to live.

289
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,840
I…

290
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,760
What do we do now?

291
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,560
I'm sorry

292
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,200
for lying to you.

293
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,120
Come on. This is a serious matter.

294
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,840
You'll die if your identity is exposed.

295
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,640
Of course, you have
to hide it from everyone.

296
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,800
-So after knowing who I am, you still…
-Do you think I'll…

297
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,680
Ming…

298
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
You can call me either name.

299
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,920
Ming Yi.

300
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,640
Jixing Abyss and Yaoguang Mountain
are sworn enemies,

301
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,040
but you are my friend.

302
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,320
Of course,
if you want to attack Jixing Abyss,

303
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll stop you.

304
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,360
But you fought
the netherbeasts and protected the people.

305
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
You are a good person.

306
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,200
Also, when I was in trouble,

307
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,680
you came to help me.

308
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,440
Now that you need my help,
I won't leave you alone.

309
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,680
Ming Yi, have hope.

310
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,080
We'll find a way
to cure you within this month.

311
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,320
Then, you go back to Yaoguang Mountain

312
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,000
and find that jerk who poisoned you.

313
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
Give him a good beating
so that he won't bully you again.

314
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Thank you, Zhang Tai.

315
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,600
The tea gathering is in three months.

316
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,720
Thanks to the help of Fairy Zhang Tai,

317
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,560
our battle robe is ready
to be distributed.

318
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,520
I wish you a swift victory
against Yaoguang Mountain.

319
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

320
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,440
Meng Yangqiu is hardworking
and is improving daily.

321
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,640
Yan Xiao is an excellent healer

322
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,960
who is great at supporting everyone.

323
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,240
Chen Xi has trained for many days

324
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,720
and knows the divine armory the most.

325
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,720
You should represent us as the Forger.

326
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,960
Can… Can I do that?

327
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,400
Our rival, Ming Xian,

328
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
became the youngest warrior
at the age of 13.

329
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,480
You are 14 now.

330
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,760
You are one year older
than him when he was fighting.

331
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,160
You will do fine.

332
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
-Show me your confidence.
-I don't have any right now.

333
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,280
I shall lead the group.

334
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,920
All of you have unique strengths.

335
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,240
Amplify your strengths and we may succeed.

336
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,480
By a draw of lots, the tea gathering
will be held in Yaoguang Mountain.

337
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,000
This will be the best opportunity
to eliminate incumbent warriors.

338
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,000
If we have fewer than three warriors,
we will be disqualified.

339
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,200
Therefore, all of you
are equally important.

340
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,760
Make sure you are safe during training.

341
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,240
As for the shortlisted candidates,
train hard too

342
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
even though you are not attending
the Qingyun Tournament.

343
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,520
Zhushui Spiritual State
will attack us again.

344
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,960
We must work together

345
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
to protect Jixing Abyss with our lives.

346
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,520
Protect Jixing Abyss with our lives!

347
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,920
Ming Yi! I have bad news.

348
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,240
There's a public notice
on the Parade Bureau saying

349
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
that Yaoguang Mountain
demoted Ming Xian to a criminal

350
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,880
due to his desertion.

351
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,280
Lord Chengyun, Ming Xin,
will be the new Crown Prince.

352
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,920
Anything else on the notice?

353
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
It says he will be the warrior for now,

354
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,440
and the conferment ceremony
will be held later.

355
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm sure your father
was forced to make this decision.

356
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,120
The Qingyun Tournament
is around the corner.

357
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,040
The position of
the warrior cannot be vacant.

358
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,920
They had to elect a new one.

359
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,320
He was forced to…

360
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,200
I know.

361
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,960
I've gone missing for a while.

362
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,800
The tea gathering is coming soon,

363
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,720
and Yaoguang Mountain
has to make a statement.

364
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,480
They can't drag this out forever.

365
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,120
I understand why Father did what he did.

366
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
But nothing is set in stone yet.

367
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,280
They merely announced
the decision to all realms.

368
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,720
The conferment ceremony hasn't been held,

369
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,720
which means that
Father still doubts Ming Xin's capability.

370
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,400
He is not the Crown Prince
until the conferment ceremony is done.

371
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,600
Once you are cured
and return to Yaoguang Mountain,

372
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,960
I'm sure you'll find
a way to put a stop to this.

373
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,160
I won't let Ming Xin
ruin Yaoguang Mountain.

374
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,800
Ming Yi.

375
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,240
Ming Yi.

376
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,040
Just tell me.

377
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,280
What do I have to do for you to trust me?

378
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,560
Immortal Situ, you treat me with kindness.

379
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,280
You have saved me many times.

380
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,000
Even though you are
from Zhushui Spiritual State,

381
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,880
I still trust you.

382
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,640
But this is my problem.

383
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,480
I don't want to trouble others.

384
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,800
This is the complete map
of the Sunken Abyss,

385
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,600
including caverns
that are concealed by spells.

386
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Bo's medical classics
might be hidden in these places.

387
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,440
There might be traps in the caverns.

388
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,600
So let's explore them together.

389
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,040
You need help.

390
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,680
Your master is not enough.

391
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,080
I am already involved in this.

392
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm sure you know it's better to trust me

393
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,200
than another outsider.

394
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,320
The Emperor of Zhushui raised
netherbeasts in the Sunken Abyss.

395
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,480
Surprised that Mu Qibai
harbored another plan,

396
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,800
the Emperor used the blood moon

397
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
to drive the netherbeast army to frenzy,

398
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,280
hoping to eliminate Jixing Abyss.

399
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,680
At this point, unless we collude
with Zhushui Spiritual State,

400
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,120
a war will be inevitable.

401
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,160
You're saying…

402
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,280
Your Majesty, please pen a decree
that all warriors in Jixing Abyss

403
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,600
must train hard outside of the preparation
for the Qingyun Tournament

404
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
in case Zhushui Spiritual State
attacks us.

405
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,880
Zhushui Spiritual State is a powerful foe.

406
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,080
Your Majesty, concession
will only feed their arrogance.

407
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,560
In the end, we will have none left.

408
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Yes, Father.

409
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,760
Zhushui Spiritual State will not spare us.

410
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,360
A war with Zhushui is inevitable.

411
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,600
After the Prayer Night,

412
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,120
Yan Xiao and I went to
Shouhua Academy and asked the warriors

413
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,000
what they would do
if Zhushui Spiritual State attacked us.

414
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,520
All of them,
including the 14-year-old Chen Xi,

415
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,920
said they were sick
of coddling Zhushui Spiritual State.

416
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,960
Father,

417
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,200
the victory against the netherbeast army
has raised our morale.

418
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,360
Everyone in Shouhua Academy
is willing to fight for Jixing Abyss.

419
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,280
All of you are too naive.

420
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,000
The Emperor of Zhushui
has lived for centuries.

421
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,880
Who knows how many tricks he has?

422
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,560
If we fight them

423
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,040
and lose,

424
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,800
what will happen to Jixing Abyss?

425
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,000
But no one can decide
the fate of a person, a nation,

426
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,600
or a world.

427
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,920
To cower before the possibility of failure

428
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,160
is to set ourselves up for failure.

429
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,360
You'll think that failure is imminent.

430
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,760
But that's cowardice.

431
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,680
You don't surrender to your fate.

432
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,800
You write your own fate.

433
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,720
Indeed,
the world needs young souls like you.

434
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,520
I shall make it known
that Tianji will act on my behalf

435
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,800
and lead the defense
against Zhushui Spiritual State.

436
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,080
Everyone in Jixing Abyss shall unite.

437
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,760
Invaders will not be spared.

438
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,040
-Yes, Father.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

439
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,159
A CLOUD OF PEAR
BLOSSOMS AND A FORLORN DREAM

440
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,639
Ming Yi.

441
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,719
Are you all right?

442
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,639
I'm fine.

443
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,920
Immortal Situ isn't here.

444
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,560
The spiritual power
I injected in you isn't helping.

445
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,040
You can use your spiritual veins now,

446
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,320
but that doesn't mean
you should exhaust them for me.

447
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,760
Don't worry.

448
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,360
I still have a month to live.

449
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,760
Touch wood!

450
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,120
Don't give up, Ming Yi.

451
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,600
We'll cure you within this month.

452
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,440
-Don't worry.
-Ming Yi.

453
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,600
-Ming Yi, are you all right?
-Master She.

454
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
Please help Ming Yi.

455
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,960
I'll brew more medicine.

456
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,600
You never listen to me.

457
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Why must you leave?

458
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,520
I only went out for a while.

459
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,040
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

460
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
Look at you now.

461
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,120
You think you can head
to the Sunken Abyss alone?

462
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,480
Not alone.
I'm planning to bring you with me.

463
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,560
Do not use your spiritual veins anymore.

464
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,360
Otherwise, you won't live
past the next few days.

465
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,480
Therefore, I stayed up all night
to make this crossbow.

466
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,040
Master, inject your power into it
so that I can use it.

467
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,640
No need to head to the Sunken Abyss.
I'll go on your behalf.

468
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,480
Master,

469
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,640
we're going together.

470
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,480
With you there,
we'll breeze through the Sunken Abyss.

471
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,320
You're done?

472
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,160
-You're the death of me.
-Ow.

473
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,280
It's filled to the brim.

474
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,440
So this is the Sunken Abyss?

475
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,720
It doesn't look so special.

476
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,440
Why did Father pick this place
to raise netherbeasts back then?

477
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,960
This place is full of miasma,

478
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,320
perfect for harvesting
and storing Blood Pearl Bloom.

479
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,720
Mu Qibai volunteered himself right then,

480
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
so Father gave him a chance to serve.

481
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Father also said

482
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,760
that once the Bo's medical classics
were taken out of the Sunken Abyss,

483
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,960
the trap would be triggered.

484
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,520
The Sunken Abyss
would collapse right away,

485
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,840
and the miasma would spread
quickly thanks to the Soul-Consuming Tree.

486
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,760
Now that we don't need anything
from Jixing Abyss anymore,

487
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,040
why don't we give them a taste of miasma?

488
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,800
Then allow me to stand guard
next to the Soul-Consuming Tree

489
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
so that the tunnel will not be destroyed

490
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,440
while you descend to get the classics.

491
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,480
I see you find yourself a quick exit.

492
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,920
It's only right to leave the important
task to you, my dear brother,

493
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
so that you can take
credit for it before Father.

494
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,880
Oh, the fiery phantom.
Calm your mind as I retrieve this item.

495
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,520
Break!

496
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,640
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS, PART 1

497
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,480
Where is he?

498
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,800
Chao Yuan?

499
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,240
Father asked me
to retrieve the medical classics.

500
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,240
Are you here to help me
or to steal it from me?

501
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,080
Should I hand you over to Father

502
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,280
or should I

503
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,600
kill you right away?

504
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,800
Situ Ling said he'd come here
to retrieve the medical classics.

505
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,960
Where is he?

506
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,680
It's my problem.
I don't want to be indebted to him.

507
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,040
Ming Yi, let's split up and search.

508
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,280
-Be careful, Master.
-You too.

509
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,360
Break!

510
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,400
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS, PART 1

511
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,280
My Lord, I have scouted
the place near Dragon Carp Terrace.

512
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,880
There is no other entrance.

513
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,120
Only the Soul-Consuming Tree
is connected to the Sunken Abyss.

514
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Tianji has already withdrawn

515
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,320
all the guards from the Sunken Abyss.

516
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,680
And now, we just need to seal the tree.

517
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,520
What is this?

518
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,720
I'm not sure.

519
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,400
But since it's so well hidden,
it must have a use.

520
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,960
Keep it first.

521
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,840
We'll see after we seal
the Soul-Consuming Tree.

522
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,000
Something's afoot in the Sunken Abyss.

523
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,560
An illusion.

524
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,760
What are you looking for?

525
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,720
Found you.

526
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,480
A fairy like you trespassed into
the Stoneheart Cavern of Sunken Abyss.

527
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,640
Are you here for Bo's medical classics?

528
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,680
Who told you it's here?

529
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm here to sweep the floor.

530
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,160
Oh, you! You're early.

531
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,400
So this is the medical classics?

532
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,760
Master She,
the miasma is somehow spreading.

533
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,520
We need to find
Ming Yi as soon as possible and leave.

534
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,240
You're right. Let's go.

535
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,560
Sure.

536
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,880
If you won't speak,

537
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,120
I might just use Phantom Fire

538
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,880
to give you
the indelible brand of a criminal.

539
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,200
Where should I brand you?

540
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,240
Your chest

541
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,080
or your pretty face?

542
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,520
If you are disfigured…

543
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,360
Where are you going?

544
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,960
Run.

545
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,720
Tell me. Who told you to look
for the medical classics?

546
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,560
Please.

547
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,520
Even on my last breath,
I can kill a weakling like you easily.

548
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,560
You think you can kill me?

549
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,360
Go ahead.

550
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,120
Kill me.
