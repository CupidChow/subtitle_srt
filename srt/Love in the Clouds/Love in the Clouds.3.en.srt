ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
<i>LOVE IN THE CLOUDS</i>

2
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,240
Immortal Ji.

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,920
HOU ZHAO, JIXING ABYSS
FORMER CHIEF OF JUDGMENT HALL

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,640
You lost again.

5
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,520
- That's right.
- As agreed,

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,080
Chief Hou Zhao, you may
request that I do one thing as punishment.

7
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
I will do everything.

8
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,720
Sure.

9
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,320
How decisive of you.
Immortal Ji, you are really decisive.

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,160
In that case, please answer me

11
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,960
whether the rumor out there is true.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Have you
cultivated Golden Millet Dream before?

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,440
Yes. Tell us.

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,960
- That's right.
- Tell us.

15
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
Tell us.

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,080
EPISODE 3

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
There has been a rumor in Jixing Palace

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
saying that your spiritual veins

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,080
were obtained through Heavenly Grief.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,240
You used Heavenly Grief
yet you still live.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Do you actually possess

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,520
the Golden Millet Dream?

23
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,120
To be honest,

24
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
I wasn't born with spiritual veins.

25
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,480
I only

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,000
got it a bit later.

27
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Lord Hanfeng, you know

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
that someone
who committed a crime in Jixing Abyss

29
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,080
will be locked up in
the Sunken Abyss to be enslaved.

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
I had been in
the Sunken Abyss since I was young.

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,720
I was hungry and cold.

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,920
I even had to work all day long.

33
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
It was too exhausting.

34
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,800
In the end,

35
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,640
I couldn't stand living like that,

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,760
so I risked my life
to avoid the supervisor

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,440
and escaped the Sunken Abyss.

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,880
Then, I passed out

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
because my injury was too serious.

40
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,760
When I woke up,

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,800
my spiritual veins

42
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,320
grew on their own

43
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,279
for some reason.

44
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
Perhaps

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,840
it was all a blessing in disguise.

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,520
Lord Hanfeng,

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm not telling everyone about this

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
because I don't want to remember

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
my painful past.

50
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
My days in the Sunken Abyss

51
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,480
were truly a living hell.

52
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,720
You have been through a lot.

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,160
You've had

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,000
a hard time.

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
You have no choice

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,720
but to tell such blatant lies.

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
I understand why.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
Golden Millet Dream
is a good thing after all.

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,960
Everyone must keep it a secret.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,360
However, let's look at
it from another perspective.

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,840
If everyone can have
a miraculous encounter like you,

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,600
wouldn't it be only a matter of time

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,600
before Jixing Abyss
can rule the Six Realms?

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
If you know something
about the Golden Millet Dream

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,360
yet won't share with other people,

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,880
won't that make
you a wanted criminal of Jixing Abyss?

67
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,760
<i>Why are there so many people</i>
<i>who want the Golden Millet Dream?</i>

68
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
<i>Is Mu Qibai not going to give up?</i>

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
Who is it?

70
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,680
Isn't she the fairy from Moonlit Blossoms?

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,160
Don't mind her.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
Greetings, Lord Hanfeng.

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
I didn't notice you for so long.

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,920
You must not be an ordinary fairy.

75
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,560
Don't tell me…

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,120
Did you purposely choose

77
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,440
a fairy with spiritual
veins to be by your side,

78
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,440
Bozai?

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,160
Lord Hanfeng,
what's wrong with you tonight?

80
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,520
You asked me about
the origins of my spiritual veins,

81
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,840
and also suspect my people

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
of having spiritual veins.

83
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,000
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

84
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,360
I asked her to come upstairs.

85
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
I didn't know you'd be here, Lord Hanfeng.

86
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,320
That was why I asked her to hide here.

87
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,240
A night together is worth a fortune.

88
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Sorry to interrupt you both.

89
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Bozai,

90
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
take care.

91
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,160
Wait. Let me send you off.

92
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
No need.

93
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,040
Lord Hanfeng, this is your first visit.
I should send you off.

94
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
Wait for me to come back.

95
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,360
That's enough. This is good.

96
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,320
- You may return.
- Take care.

97
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,559
<i>Worms?</i>

98
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
A bug!

99
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
How come Wugui Sea's lady-in-charge

100
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,880
is so afraid of a small insect?

101
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,440
Thank you, My Lord.

102
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,240
It's late.

103
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Why were you hiding in my bed?

104
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,880
I am the lady of Wugui Sea.

105
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,720
Can't I be in your bed?

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
My Lord, I…

107
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,040
<i>He…</i>

108
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
<i>He's touching me.</i>

109
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,160
My Lord, why are you doing this?

110
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,000
It seems like the Dual Cultivation Manual
is quite useful.

111
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,680
<i>No. I must take back control.</i>

112
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,400
My Lord, don't worry.

113
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,840
I know the rules.

114
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,840
<i>Let me find it…</i>

115
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,600
My Lord.

116
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm prepared tonight.

117
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,240
After all,

118
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,720
I'm serious about you.

119
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,960
<i>The Golden Millet Dream isn't on him.</i>

120
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,880
Stop moving.

121
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
My Lord.

122
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,160
I don't like your outfit.
I'll talk to you later.

123
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,400
What kind of outfit do you like?

124
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,920
Why don't you like…

125
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,520
<i>Hold on.</i>

126
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,160
<i>Fairies with spiritual</i>
<i>veins in the Six Realms</i>

127
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,080
<i>have Soul-hiding Nails</i>
<i>planted in them when they were born</i>

128
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,280
<i>to seal their spiritual veins.</i>

129
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,320
<i>Just now,</i>

130
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,240
<i>he was checking if</i>
<i>I had the Soul-hiding Nail.</i>

131
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,400
Your Lordship,
I've obtained Ruo Shui's Moonshade Grass.

132
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,560
Are you hurt?

133
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,560
- I'm fine.
- Don't be stubborn.

134
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
With your level of cultivation,

135
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I know you can go anywhere

136
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,840
without being noticed by her.

137
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,120
But you were almost found out
when you were there today.

138
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,240
Forgive me.

139
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
It's all right.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,640
Now that we've
obtained the Moonshade Grass,

141
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,520
it's time to meet Hou Zhao.

142
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,440
Yes.

143
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,240
WUGUI SEA PRISON

144
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,320
Ji Bozai. Ji Bozai.

145
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,720
How dare you!

146
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,720
You dare imprison me here?

147
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,320
The chief of Judgment Hall is missing.

148
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,920
Let's see how you handle it

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,120
when the higher-up investigates this!

150
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Do you think you are so important?

151
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Moonshade Grass?

152
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,240
Moonshade Grass!

153
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,880
How did you get it?
Where did you get it from?

154
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
Moonshade Grass can only be
found in Mangfu Swamp once in a century.

155
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,920
Immortal Hou Zhao,

156
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
am I sincere enough?

157
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,400
Your daughter, Ruo Shui,

158
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,440
suffers from
congenital Total Deterioration.

159
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
With it,

160
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,880
the wish of your life

161
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,520
can be fulfilled, right?

162
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,680
No!

163
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,920
Stop!

164
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,320
If you give
the Moonshade Grass to Ruo Shui,

165
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,080
I will promise you anything! Anything!

166
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,240
Such a good father
who loves his daughter a lot.

167
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,520
Even I think

168
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
- I'm doing something despicable now.
- Sure.

169
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,400
Ji Bozai.

170
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
I promise you.

171
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,560
Just like you said,

172
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,160
I'll give you my memory.

173
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,600
Divine souls of all realms,

174
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,080
Immortal Hou Zhao has permitted me

175
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,120
to obtain all his memories.

176
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
Immortal Hou Zhao, thank you

177
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,120
for giving me all your memories.

178
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,600
Otherwise, I will
have to spend more effort

179
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
to find the people I want to get rid of.

180
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,080
Buxiu,
give the Moonshade Grass to Ruo Shui.

181
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,080
Yes.

182
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,000
How do you know
that it's him, Your Lordship?

183
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,600
Have you
cultivated Golden Millet Dream before?

184
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,080
<i>Everyone in the world</i>

185
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
<i>thought Golden Millet Dream</i>
<i>was a kind of pill</i>

186
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,800
<i>or a medicine.</i>

187
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,320
He was the only one
who used the term, cultivated.

188
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,440
That's right. Have you investigated
Ming Yi's background?

189
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,440
Ming Yi is indeed the youngest daughter

190
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,640
of a herb-gathering
family in Freezing Hot Waters.

191
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,680
After her parents passed away,

192
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,680
she came to the divine capital
and joined Moonlit Blossoms.

193
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,920
There's something else I found.

194
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
Ming Yi's parents used to gather herbs

195
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,120
near the Sunken Abyss
when they were alive.

196
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,240
I investigated their deaths.
They were poisoned by Blood Pearl Bloom.

197
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,720
Blood Pearl Bloom?

198
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,080
The worm is rare and hard to cultivate.

199
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
It can break barriers
to find what its master wants.

200
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm sure Mu Qibai wants the worm to find
the Golden Millet Dream.

201
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,000
Unfortunately, Ji Bozai killed it.

202
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,080
It's fine.

203
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,400
There's one more.

204
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,280
A bug!

205
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
You're up next.

206
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,720
Your Lordship.

207
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,520
He still found out in the end.

208
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,040
I've severed the connection
of the worm with its master.

209
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
From now on, it only obeys you.

210
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
It will bring us to
the Golden Millet Dream.

211
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,960
You fool!

212
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,760
- Lord Chengyun, forgive me.
- You fool!

213
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,360
The Search Mirror was
calibrated with Ming Xian's mask.

214
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,320
It will never malfunction.

215
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,680
I failed to capture him
and deserve to die.

216
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
However,

217
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
the Search Mirror reacted to a fairy.

218
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
It was a woman.

219
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,320
It's impossible for her to be Ming Xian.

220
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,280
A fairy?

221
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
Where is she in Jixing Abyss?

222
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,120
- What is her name?
- She's in Jixing Abyss' Moonlit Blossoms.

223
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,040
Her name…

224
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,680
I don't know her name.

225
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,840
I only know that the fairy
is probably serving Ji Bozai.

226
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,880
Ji Bozai?

227
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,840
In five days, Shouhua Academy

228
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,240
will begin choosing warriors
for the next Qingyun Tournament.

229
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,080
His Lordship wants
you to attend the tournament too.

230
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,040
Please learn the rituals and rules

231
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
of the divine capital
from me this afternoon.

232
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
Don't be late.

233
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,160
Granny Xun is obviously testing you.

234
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,400
If you slip up,
all our hard work will be in vain.

235
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,960
She is trying to test me on purpose,
which is why I should go.

236
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,600
But this is too dangerous.

237
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
We have released the worm.

238
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,600
We will find the Golden Millet Dream soon.

239
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,440
Give me five days.
I'm sure we can endure it.

240
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,360
Today, I'll give you a test.

241
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,120
Do you know
what the Qingyun Tournament is?

242
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,080
A millennium ago, the Six Realms

243
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
have been fighting to get
the Nine Heavens' Blessed Rain.

244
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,040
To reduce the number of casualties,

245
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,720
the six emperors formed an alliance
in front of Zhuojin Tower.

246
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,280
They agreed to organize
the Qingyun Tournament every year

247
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,440
to decide who gets the Blessed Rain.

248
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,400
WANGXING COURT

249
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,360
With Hou Zhao's memory,

250
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,960
we can find out
the murderer who killed Fairy Bo that day.

251
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,560
I've been waiting so long for this.

252
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,040
- Granny Xun, why are you hitting me?
- Give me your hand.

253
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,000
- What did I do to deserve this?
- Give me your hand?

254
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,640
No hiding.

255
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,920
Granny Xun, stop hitting me. I…

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What is this about?

257
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,480
My Lord, save me.

258
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,280
Granny Xun is beating me to death.
Look how swollen my hand is.

259
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,800
I can't even wear the thumb ring.

260
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,240
Granny Xun, what's going on?

261
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,960
Your Lordship,

262
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,080
I was asking Ming Yi a few
questions about the Qingyun Tournament.

263
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,920
However, I realized her knowledge
of the Qingyun Tournament

264
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
has far exceeded ordinary fairies.

265
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
I think her identity is very suspicious.

266
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,760
Please investigate, Your Lordship.

267
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,680
My Lord, don't you trust me?

268
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,680
Now that Granny Xun mentioned it,

269
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,200
I've been curious about it as well.

270
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,840
Freezing Hot Waters

271
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,800
is located at the border of
Yaoguang Mountain and Jixing Abyss.

272
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,800
Most of the residents there
are herb-gathering attendants.

273
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,200
They gather herbs all day long

274
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
and work extremely hard.

275
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
You also told me

276
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
your family was poor,

277
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,040
yet you have the appearance
of someone who is privileged.

278
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,800
The Qingyun Tournament is
a grand event among the Six Realms,

279
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,560
but there are only a few ordinary fairies

280
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,200
who have witnessed the tournament,

281
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,240
let alone understand the history of it.

282
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,720
There are 365 days in a year.

283
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,360
My father gathered herbs for 360 days.

284
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,920
His hands were bruised and pink.

285
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,520
They didn't even resemble hands.

286
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,920
I could never wash the dirt off him.

287
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,520
I only hoped for him to hug me
with his hands since I was young.

288
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,920
My mother did embroidery to make a living.

289
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,480
She did it for a few decades.

290
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,160
Her hands were full of calluses
and more kept growing.

291
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,800
However, she still
wouldn't let me help her.

292
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,920
That was how

293
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I became someone who looked privileged

294
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
like you said just now.

295
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,120
When they were alive,
I couldn't repay them properly.

296
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,680
So, I tried
to learn more about the Qingyun Tournament

297
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,120
because I don't want
to have any more regrets.

298
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,960
It's also because

299
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,120
you are the most important
person to me right now, My Lord.

300
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,040
I want to know more about you.
Is it wrong to do that?

301
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
Both of you may continue.

302
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,200
<i>Are you doing this</i>
<i>to make him doubt you on purpose?</i>

303
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,720
That's right.

304
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840
He will feel very guilty
for letting down someone

305
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,320
who treats him sincerely.

306
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
You even know about that?

307
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
<i>Do you think I stayed in</i>
<i>Moonlit Blossoms for nothing?</i>

308
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,520
You are good at crying.

309
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,760
Come here.

310
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,720
Your Lordship. What happened out there?

311
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
It's nothing. Continue.

312
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,760
Your Lordship.

313
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,320
I asked you

314
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,280
to prepare a Blessing Cake

315
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,840
as a tribute to the Emperor.

316
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,280
Are you planning

317
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,720
to make me a Funeral Cake instead?

318
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,160
Your Lordship.

319
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,240
During every festival in Jixing Abyss,

320
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,280
every family will prepare
a Blessing Cake to pray for blessings.

321
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,280
But Fairy Ming Yi
doesn't know how to make it at all.

322
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
Something's wrong about this.

323
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,320
It's just a pastry.

324
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,600
Blessing Cake. First, steam Chinese Yam
and mix it with a starch mixture.

325
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,800
Add sugar, milk,

326
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,360
and different types of flowers.

327
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
Let it cool before shaping its form.

328
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
As before,

329
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,480
- you didn't mention one…
- There's one more crucial ingredient.

330
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,800
Meteor's Night.

331
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,200
It is a type of dew

332
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,720
condensed on the Blessing Flower,
endemic to Jixing Abyss.

333
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,360
How will I not remember
the recipe of Blessing Cake

334
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,000
that every soul in Jixing Abyss knows?

335
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,600
So,

336
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,520
did you make a mistake on purpose?

337
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,920
Yes.

338
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,880
I know you and Granny Xun

339
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
don't trust me.

340
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,280
So, both of you did many things

341
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,720
and worked together

342
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,960
to test me multiple times.

343
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
I want to find
an opportunity to make things clear.

344
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,080
Did many things? We didn't work together.

345
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,760
Get along now.

346
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,320
I…

347
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,480
<i>Blowing up the issue is</i>
<i>a trick to resolve the issue.</i>

348
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,640
<i>Of course. If I want to resolve</i>
<i>the issue once and for all,</i>

349
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,080
<i>I must throw in a small benefit.</i>

350
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,920
- You can clean up for me.
- Granny Xun.

351
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,160
So you know how to make Blessing Cakes.

352
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,440
What are you up to this time?

353
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,560
I didn't know at first.

354
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
I learned how to do
it after you taught me.

355
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,840
Besides, you are so tired.

356
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,280
I must offer you something in return.

357
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
I will never be duped.

358
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,080
You are a moth, Granny Xun.

359
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,280
You like leafy
vegetables and flower petals.

360
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,040
I added rose and bay leaf

361
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,280
in these Blessing Cakes.
What do you think?

362
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm not eating. Go out.

363
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,960
Granny Xun, come on.

364
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,960
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW

365
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,960
Granny Xun.

366
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm sincere about being friends with you.

367
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,560
Look.

368
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,560
Lord Ji allowed me to stay here.

369
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,080
You find me suspicious

370
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,680
and report to him as
soon as I make a small mistake.

371
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,320
Won't that distract Lord Ji a lot?
Why don't we

372
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,080
get along with each other peacefully?

373
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,200
You can observe me more.

374
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,360
If I do things right, all is well.

375
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,720
If I make a mistake,

376
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,720
catch me in the act
and chase me away immediately.

377
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,720
Doesn't it solve
the problem once and for all?

378
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,040
Granny Xun.

379
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,800
I only want to serve Lord Ji well.

380
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,400
Lord Ji was a criminal.

381
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,600
He doesn't have a confidant by his side.

382
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,880
I'm sure you began serving him
in the middle of his journey.

383
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,000
Why are you so loyal to him?

384
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,400
I don't mind telling you the story.

385
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,760
I owed His Lordship a great favor.

386
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,600
My former husband treated me badly.

387
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,680
I wanted to kill him
and commit suicide after that.

388
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
His Lordship passed by and saved me.

389
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,440
He even offered me a new path in life.

390
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,760
So, I will never betray His Lordship.

391
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
It's my first time
hearing you say so many things.

392
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,400
Lord Ji has good taste.

393
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,040
He only keeps
people like you and me by his side.

394
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
They are all yours.

395
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,120
Are they delicious?

396
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,280
Just all right.

397
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,040
Your Lordship,

398
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm sure we won't be interrupted

399
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,360
when we view Hou Zhao's memory this time.

400
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,880
BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS, PART 1

401
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,920
Your Highness.

402
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
We used every way possible

403
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
but Bo Yulan

404
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,240
wouldn't admit to anything.

405
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
Is that all you can do?

406
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,240
I was the one who made you the chief.

407
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,640
Tell me.

408
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,520
How should you be
punished for dereliction of duty?

409
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,360
Your Highness.

410
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
Let me show you the rope.

411
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Do you know what to do next?

412
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,080
Your Highness, give me another chance.

413
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,000
I'll surely find out the whereabouts
of the Golden Millet Dream formula.

414
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,840
He's hard to please, isn't he?

415
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,920
Look at me. Do you think he's happy?

416
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,200
Bo Yulan is really stubborn. Even now,

417
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,040
she still won't
reveal where the formula is.

418
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,000
A member of an apothecary
family that can't fight at all

419
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,200
endures everything

420
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,760
with her stubbornness.

421
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,920
No wonder the group of men
who besieged Zhangwei Mountain

422
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,720
BO YULAN, JI BOZAI'S MASTER

423
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,360
only obtained the first part of
Bo's Medical Classics 22 years ago.

424
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,320
Without the second part
to complete the whole book,

425
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
we will never make
the Golden Millet Dream successfully.

426
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
Enough.

427
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
Don't be so pessimistic.

428
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,840
How can we face him
if we can't get anything out of her?

429
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,120
All of us will suffer.

430
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,360
I still have one more move.

431
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,600
Soul-seizing

432
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,000
Technique.

433
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,320
This is an evil move.

434
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Seizing away her soul
to bring out her inner demon

435
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,880
and force the truth out of her.

436
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,040
If we can't find out anything after that,

437
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,800
it can only mean that Bo Yulan

438
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,800
doesn't know the whereabouts
of the Golden Millet Dream formula.

439
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,960
I only need you to give me an answer.

440
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
<i>Your Highness,</i>

441
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,800
<i>the general used</i>
<i>the Soul-seizing Technique on Bo Yulan.</i>

442
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,680
<i>She couldn't endure it</i>

443
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,960
<i>and her primordial spirit was destroyed.</i>

444
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,920
Master.

445
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Your Lordship.

446
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,880
- The Golden Millet Dream?
- No.

447
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,880
I think he has a nightmare.

448
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,280
Buxiu.

449
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,639
Master died

450
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,400
from their torture.

451
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,240
If Hou Zhao hadn't slipped his tongue,

452
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,920
I would have never caught him.

453
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,280
Thanks to him,

454
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,920
I finally know

455
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,320
who Master's murderers are.

456
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,600
Hou Zhao is just the beginning.

457
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,120
I won't

458
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,720
spare any of them.
