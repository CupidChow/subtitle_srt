1
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 18

3
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you all right?

4
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Why did only you come? Where's Ming Yi?

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,840
How is His Lordship?

6
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,600
The Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop
has been removed,

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,759
but the netherbeast core inside him
is leaking.

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,080
He could lose his mind at any moment.

9
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Be careful.

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,280
Ming Yi?

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,680
-Ming Yi.
-Ji Bozai.

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,480
Ji Bozai. Ji Bozai.

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
Wake up.

14
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
What happened to him?

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,760
His body and mind are weak.

16
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,320
Even the nightmares he finally let go of

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,840
have returned.

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Nightmares

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,800
about the Sunken Abyss?

20
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,800
His Lordship once told me

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,280
that being poisoned there kept him alive,

22
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,440
though at the time,

23
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,720
he wished he'd died instead.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,480
Those miasmas and herbs kept him alive.

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
But it wasn't until he met Bo Yulan

26
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,000
that he was truly healed.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
It's all right.

28
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,480
I'm here.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,080
You're safe now. It's all right.

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
It's all right.

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,760
You're safe now.

32
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
You're awake.

33
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,640
Finally!

34
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,960
At Mu Qibai's instigation, Meng Yangqiu

35
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,640
poisoned me with a
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

36
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,080
Mu Qibai will probably come soon
with his men

37
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,840
to pin the crime of raising
netherbeasts on me.

38
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
Am I alive now

39
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
only because of you?

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,320
Buxiu went to Dragon Carp Terrace first
to stall them.

41
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Then I went to help.

42
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,280
We're allies.

43
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,080
Of course I'd protect you.

44
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
Yesterday at Shouhua Academy,

45
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,440
everyone said I was raising netherbeasts.

46
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,120
Did you not suspect I might have

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,680
absorbed the netherbeast core for myself

48
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,720
instead of refining it?

49
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,040
So you really didn't.

50
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,280
Earlier,

51
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,040
did you also believe
I never plotted against Ming Xian?

52
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,320
I trust you.

53
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
You entered my Spirit Well, didn't you?

54
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,720
Yes.

55
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
So you know everything?

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,840
Yes.

57
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
I know you

58
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,200
hid the Golden Millet Dream
in your Spirit Well.

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,320
Everyone in the Six Realms covets it.

60
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
You had a chance to take it.

61
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,120
And I'm Ming Xian's greatest rival.

62
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You could have eliminated me

63
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,400
once and for all.

64
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Though gravely injured yesterday,

65
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
I could still sense you

66
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,560
using Jixing Abyss spiritual power.

67
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,800
It was the Graft Spell, right?

68
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,400
You could've kept your identity hidden
from me.

69
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
Why didn't you use it before?

70
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,040
I got tired of lying to you.

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
So I stopped.

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,160
Will you lie to me again?

73
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,800
Are your feelings for me

74
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,440
real?

75
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,000
Your Lordship,

76
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,800
Lord Hanfeng and Immortal Situ are here.

77
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,440
It's about time Mu Qibai came.

78
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
You carry netherbeast energy.
How will you face them?

79
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,000
Let me handle it.

80
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,360
Immortal Situ,
you rarely show enthusiasm for work,

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,360
yet whenever it concerns Wugui Sea,

82
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,919
you're always the first to arrive.

83
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,919
Who exactly are you doing this for?

84
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,679
Lord Hanfeng, what are you implying?

85
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,400
Investigation and law enforcement
are the duty of the Judgment Hall.

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,280
No matter the case,

87
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm obligated to uncover the truth
as soon as possible.

88
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
You tried to frame my husband
with some caltrop,

89
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,760
and you still dare to cause trouble at
Wugui Sea today?

90
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,960
Since the day the sinner Hou Zhao
turned himself in,

91
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,520
I'd suspected

92
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,280
someone in Jixing Abyss
was raising netherbeasts,

93
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,640
so I ordered a search.

94
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,600
Little did I expect

95
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,240
Ji Bozai to be the culprit.

96
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,520
-Now, with solid evidence…
-Solid evidence?

97
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
Tell me,

98
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,280
what exactly makes it solid?

99
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,960
After Meng Yangqiu gave Ji Bozai
a Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

100
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Ji Bozai started
to emit netherbeast energy.

101
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Everyone at Shouhua Academy
saw it with their own eyes.

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,800
-Yes.
-Many people saw it.

103
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
-It's absolutely true.
-Yes.

104
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
Do it!

105
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Wait.

106
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
Everyone knows

107
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
that those who raise netherbeasts

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,960
carry lingering netherbeast energy
that never fades.

109
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
So let's test him again.

110
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,960
If no netherbeast energy
is found this time,

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,720
it will prove his innocence.

112
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,440
This Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop

113
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,040
was retrieved

114
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,320
from Shouhua Academy by the Judgment Hall
after Ji Bozai left.

115
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,360
Ming Yi,

116
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,640
may I have the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop

117
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
taken from Ji Bozai?

118
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,680
I can remove its power
so it won't detect anything.

119
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
It disappeared when I took it off him.

120
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
I couldn't keep it.

121
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't worry.

122
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,600
I'll find a way
to prove Immortal Ji's innocence.

123
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,680
Thank you.

124
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,520
How can you prove

125
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,280
this Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop
hasn't been tampered with?

126
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
Then examine it yourself, Lord Hanfeng.

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,440
Anyone who raises netherbeasts

128
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,360
wouldn't dare touch it.

129
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
Situ Ling is bluffing him.

130
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,960
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

131
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,280
Immortal Situ, is this really
the same caltrop as before?

132
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
If it is,

133
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,840
how can you hold it barehanded?

134
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,680
The caltrop can detect netherbeast energy,

135
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,040
but it's harmless itself.

136
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,080
Of course he can touch it.

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,640
Really?

138
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,080
But Lord Hanfeng told me

139
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,800
it must never be touched directly,

140
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,760
so…

141
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,120
-Meng Yangqiu!
-What's happening to Meng Yangqiu?

142
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,400
-Yeah.
-Meng Yangqiu!

143
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Something's wrong.

144
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,680
-Is his old illness acting up?
-Meng Yangqiu.

145
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,880
Meng Yangqiu.

146
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,120
Yan Xiao, check on him quickly.
What's going on?

147
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,240
He looks like he's dying.

148
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Hurry, see what's wrong.

149
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,720
What's wrong with him?

150
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,360
-Yes, hurry.
-Something's off.

151
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,880
-Right.
-He was fine just a moment ago.

152
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
Meng Yangqiu.

153
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,480
Lord Hanfeng, are you trying to
kill him here in my Wugui Sea?

154
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,640
Kill him?

155
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,960
Bozai, what are you talking about?

156
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
Ji Bozai has

157
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,400
netherbeast marks on his face!

158
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,520
He's tainted by netherbeasts!

159
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,000
If Lord Ji truly keeps netherbeasts
and has been corrupted by them,

160
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,520
he would've lost his mind long ago
and fallen under their control.

161
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,720
But look, he stands before us,
perfectly sane.

162
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
What more proof do you need?

163
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,080
You want another test with the
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

164
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,040
I'll do it myself.

165
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Immortal Ji dares to touch it barehanded.

166
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,520
I don't think he keeps netherbeasts.

167
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,880
That brat Situ Ling tricked me.

168
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,520
This caltrop can't detect anything.

169
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,520
Just a petty trick.

170
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
I saw right through it.

171
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,320
It may be petty,

172
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,320
but it's enough to expose you.

173
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,960
How…?

174
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,560
Your Lordship!

175
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,400
Lord Hanfeng has netherbeast marks too!

176
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
-How could that be?
-Right.

177
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,680
-How's that possible?
-Has he…

178
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,240
Has he been raising netherbeasts?

179
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,600
Hard to say.

180
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,680
I simply channeled the netherbeast energy

181
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,480
that was once forced into me
back into the caltrop.

182
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
Lord Hanfeng,

183
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,400
you must be familiar with this technique,
right?

184
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,280
The energy you injected
was a bit too strong,

185
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,040
so I still need more time

186
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
to recover my appearance.

187
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,560
Is this true?

188
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,160
Did Lord Hanfeng really do such a thing?

189
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,560
He wouldn't stoop so low, right?

190
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,160
Now you see.

191
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,960
My husband never kept netherbeasts.

192
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,520
The problem has always been that
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

193
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,800
Meng Yangqiu was tricked by Lord Hanfeng.

194
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
In truth,
Lord Hanfeng tampered with that caltrop

195
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,200
to frame me through Meng Yangqiu.

196
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,880
I merely used his own trick against him.

197
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
If you do not believe me,

198
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,400
I can go to the Judgment Hall
with Lord Hanfeng

199
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,960
and settle this once and for all.

200
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,040
-Good idea.
-Yes.

201
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,200
They should go.

202
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,320
Do a test with another caltrop,

203
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,560
and all will be clear.

204
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
Lord Hanfeng,

205
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
do you not dare?

206
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,360
Then please, Lord Hanfeng and Immortal Ji,

207
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,920
come with me to the Judgment Hall.

208
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
I will uncover the truth

209
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,760
and find out whose body
truly bears netherbeast energy.

210
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,160
The Judgment Hall enforces
the law impartially.

211
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,840
Do you intend to defy it, Lord Hanfeng?

212
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,440
All the immortals are watching.

213
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,920
It was me.

214
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
I accidentally harmed Immortal Ji.

215
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
This is the truth, Chief Situ.

216
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,240
It's all my fault.

217
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,280
His Lordship knows nothing.

218
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
You tried to harm Ji Bozai?

219
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,320
Since Ji Bozai became an immortal,

220
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Jixing Abyss has seen many disturbances,

221
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,240
so I wanted to test him with a caltrop.

222
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,880
But that caltrop
belonged to the sinner Xun Ming.

223
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
Xun Ming

224
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,760
probably tampered with it.

225
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,040
My negligence caused this chaos.

226
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,520
It has nothing to do with Lord Hanfeng.

227
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,920
Please punish me, Chief Situ.

228
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,680
You didn't know Xun Ming tampered with it,

229
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,640
yet you knew it
couldn't be touched by hand?

230
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,560
All is my fault.

231
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,839
Please punish me.

232
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,520
Lord Hanfeng,

233
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,760
you really should be raising dogs.

234
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,320
Otherwise, your talents are wasted.

235
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,560
Surely you jest.

236
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,680
I've failed in my duty.

237
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,720
I raised these worthless "dogs"
who brought shame upon me.

238
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,840
I failed to discipline them

239
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,520
and ended up causing harm

240
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,080
to your body and mind.

241
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,600
Since he has confessed,

242
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,040
Chief Situ, please investigate impartially
and strictly.

243
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,080
Of course.

244
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,000
And don't forget Meng Yangqiu.

245
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,320
He was the one who gave Bozai

246
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

247
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
Bring him away.

248
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,080
Now that the matter is settled,

249
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,040
we will take our leave.

250
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,720
-I knew Immortal Ji was innocent.
-Yes, he's innocent.

251
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,320
We are sorry, Immortal Ji.

252
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,720
We misunderstood you before.

253
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,440
We truly misunderstood you, Immortal Ji.

254
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Please, Lord Hanfeng,

255
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,400
find the one
who's been keeping netherbeasts

256
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,680
and tear them to pieces.

257
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,280
Certainly.

258
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,280
When that day comes,

259
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I will invite you both to witness it.

260
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,360
Great.

261
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,280
-Granny Xun.
-Yes.

262
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,200
See them out.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Please leave.

264
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,960
They're finally gone.

265
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,600
How did you suddenly think

266
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,640
to plant a caltrop with netherbeast energy
back onto Mu Qibai?

267
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Situ Ling's plan

268
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,520
was simply to use a weakened caltrop
to solve the immediate problem.

269
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,960
But those who wish to frame me

270
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,800
will always come up with new tricks.

271
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,560
So I muddied the waters.

272
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,960
Then they would have no
leverage against me.

273
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,480
What's wrong?

274
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,480
I think the Graft Spell backfired.

275
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,000
It reverses spiritual veins.
Dangerous indeed.

276
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,960
-Let me take a look.
-I'm fine.

277
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,800
I…

278
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,320
Mu Qibai just lost a round.

279
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,840
He'll try to get back at you.

280
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,840
Go and refine the netherbeast core.

281
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I will head back now.

282
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
After some rest, I'll be fine.

283
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,800
Be careful when
you refine the netherbeast core.

284
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,280
Yan Xiao, what are you doing here?

285
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,280
Shao Qun took all the blame.

286
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,680
The Judgment Hall can only punish him
according to the law,

287
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,560
so I came to get you out.

288
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,240
What's wrong?

289
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
Look at me now.

290
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,800
You must be laughing at me inside.

291
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,520
It's not that bad.

292
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,560
Come on.

293
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,720
But Yan Xiao,

294
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,480
I really can't figure it out.

295
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,880
What on earth is going on?
Ji Bozai is innocent.

296
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Lord Hanfeng's men tried to frame him.

297
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,280
But why?

298
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
What does Lord Hanfeng even want?

299
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
And now,

300
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Tianji will never forgive me.

301
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,160
How can I ever explain this to her?

302
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,560
Yangqiu, how could Tianji possibly
forgive you?

303
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,720
You and I are both Lord Hanfeng's men.

304
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,440
And anyone who serves Lord Hanfeng

305
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,040
is naturally Tianji's enemy.

306
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,160
I am Lord Hanfeng's man?

307
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,440
Since when?

308
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,360
-You have always been.
-Why?

309
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,120
I'm just distantly related to him.

310
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Tianji was close to him as a child

311
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,800
and often brought me along
to play with him,

312
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,840
so I got to know him too.

313
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,560
Lord Hanfeng is just
a relative with an official title.

314
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Every time you had those meetings,

315
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
pre-meetings, meetings within meetings,
and whatnot,

316
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,280
I just happened to be included.

317
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,760
How does that make me…?

318
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,680
I guess I really am his man.

319
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,360
So that means you are too, right?

320
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,400
-Let's go.
-Oh, right!

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,720
You used to be just a guard.

322
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Lord Hanfeng helped you
become a physician.

323
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,880
No wonder Tianji never seemed happy
to see you after that.

324
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,360
Yangqiu,

325
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,360
maybe you should learn
to be a bit sharper.

326
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,360
I'll never go near Lord Hanfeng again.

327
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,360
Yan Xiao,

328
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,040
you won't either, right?

329
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,520
Why aren't you saying anything?

330
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,040
When he tried to kill me,
did he give you a signal?

331
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Did he tell you

332
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,040
to kill me?

333
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm right this time, aren't I?

334
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,560
We're close like brothers.

335
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,560
He ordered you to kill me.

336
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
Isn't that enough to make you
stop working for him?

337
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,720
Did it never occur to you

338
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
that I would have killed you?

339
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
Of course not.

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
I know you well.

341
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,640
Lord Hanfeng used to be kind,

342
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,440
but now he's cruel.

343
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,160
Why would you want to keep serving him?

344
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,680
You want to become a physician?

345
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,240
What a joke!

346
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,480
What are you doing?

347
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,520
Lord Hanfeng.

348
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,600
You were all promoted by me.

349
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,160
Is this how you serve His Majesty?

350
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,400
By bullying a colleague?

351
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,120
Our apologies, Lord Hanfeng.

352
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Pick up his books for him.

353
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,400
-Yes.
-Yes.

354
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,480
Remember,

355
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,320
from now on, no one is to bully
Immortal Yan Xiao again.

356
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,040
Understood.

357
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,840
Lord Hanfeng,

358
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
you know my name?

359
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
I remember the name and background
of every one of the 9,000 members

360
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
of Jixing Palace.

361
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,600
Thank you for standing up for me.

362
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,840
Even in your humble position,
you remain diligent.

363
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,040
If all of Jixing Abyss's young ones
were like you,

364
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,920
I would have no worries.

365
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,360
From today onward, you have access
to the Langhuan Pavilion

366
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,640
to study medical texts.

367
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
I hope that one day,
you will become a physician.

368
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,880
Lord Hanfeng…

369
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,240
My goal is to make Jixing Abyss
rise above oppression

370
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,960
and for its descendants
to live free from humiliation.

371
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,240
You will be able to walk that upward path,

372
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
right?

373
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,560
I won't fail your expectations,
Lord Hanfeng.

374
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Is there a reason
why you have to serve him?

375
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,360
Why must there be a reason?

376
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Yangqiu,

377
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,120
let me tell you the truth.

378
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,840
I chose to serve Lord Hanfeng.

379
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,440
I wanted to climb higher through
his power.

380
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,320
Why are you so surprised?

381
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,720
Meng Yangqiu,
you come from a family of wine immortals.

382
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,760
No matter what happens,

383
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,920
you can still live comfortably in
Jixing Palace as a casual immortal.

384
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,560
But me?

385
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,240
I have no one to rely on.

386
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,240
No one has the right to judge
how I choose to rise.

387
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,600
Only those born to comfort and privilege

388
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,720
can afford to care about dignity.

389
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,680
Let's go.

390
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's go.

391
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,920
Yan Xiao,

392
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,960
should I write a letter of apology
to Tianji?

393
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,560
Shao Qun…

394
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,360
Greetings, Lord Hanfeng.

395
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,800
It's time to find an opportunity

396
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,520
for His Majesty to take this.

397
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,720
That won't be necessary, Lord Hanfeng.

398
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,320
His Majesty is old and frail.

399
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,200
Even without intervention,
he will not last long.

400
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,640
This elm was my favorite.

401
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,160
After it withered,

402
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,960
I tried many ways to revive it.

403
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,040
But its roots were too weak.

404
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,000
No matter how carefully I tended to it,

405
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,880
I could not bring it back to life.

406
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,560
So why not uproot it,

407
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,520
bury it

408
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,560
with those other plants
that can no longer grow,

409
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,720
and turn them into nourishment?

410
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,040
Perhaps then it might live again

411
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,320
and one day grow into a towering tree

412
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
that shelters all beneath it.

413
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,240
If you wish to save this elm,

414
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,640
I will return to study my medical texts.

415
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,880
There may still be a cure.

416
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,720
Even with your skill,

417
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,120
you cannot ease the pain I feel right now.

418
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,240
Yan Xiao,

419
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,800
the choice is yours now.

420
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,160
Will you save one person today

421
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,800
or save millions in the future?

422
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,920
Immortal Ji, the netherbeast core
in you keeps leaking.

423
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,600
You must refine it again
as soon as possible.

424
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,840
You forced your way out of seclusion,

425
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,680
and after removing
the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

426
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,040
your body has become dangerously weak.

427
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,800
You're now even more vulnerable
to the netherbeasts' temptation.

428
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
You must hold fast to your heart

429
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,600
and not let them cloud your mind.

430
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,040
Are you really going to refine us?

431
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
Ji Bozai,

432
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,400
I can grant you the greatest power
in the world

433
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,720
and make you the strongest
in all Six Realms!

434
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,480
Join us!

435
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,200
Stay off my bed. You shed.

436
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Ming Yi, you've been suppressing

437
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,480
the aftereffects all this time in order
to save Buxiu.

438
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,240
You are truly tough and heroic.

439
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,480
I'm just lucky Ji Bozai didn't notice.

440
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,680
It actually took me an entire day
to treat the aftereffects.

441
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,080
The more petals this Grief Blossom loses,
the worse it gets, huh?

442
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,240
So you do realize it.

443
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Ming Yi, we do aim to destroy
the netherbeast army,

444
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,840
but as you see, the situation now is…

445
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
I know.

446
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,040
Time is running out.

447
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,360
So, Twenty-Seven, listen carefully.

448
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,000
If something happens to me,

449
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,320
you must sever our master-servant
spiritpact in advance.

450
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,040
At least one of us should survive.

451
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,680
How heartless are you?

452
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,000
I treat you like family,
and you treat me like a stray cat?

453
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,400
I'm just being reasonable here.

454
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,360
Am I wrong to say so?

455
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,080
-I'm only talking about a possibility.
-That won't happen!

456
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,920
His Lordship is in seclusion refining
the netherbeast core.

457
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,880
Before leaving, he gave me a prescription

458
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,560
and told me to gather
the herbs accordingly

459
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,080
and take care of you.

460
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Here.

461
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,640
Wugui Sea is truly busy today.

462
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,960
We have another visitor.

463
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,400
Ming Yi, you used a lot of
spiritual power yesterday.

464
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
I brewed this Jade Dew Tonic for you.

465
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,080
It will help.

466
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,920
Thank you, Immortal Situ.

467
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,600
From yesterday until now,

468
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,199
you have helped me twice.

469
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,760
-I really don't know how to repay you.
-If you are willing,

470
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,080
repay me with your hand in marriage.

471
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm joking.

472
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,199
I ask nothing in return
for what I do for you.

473
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Immortal Situ, I…

474
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,360
I only hope

475
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,480
that when you someday leave Ji Bozai,

476
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,639
you will remember to come to me.

477
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,280
Immortal Situ,

478
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm not the person you think I am.

479
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,239
Even if I were,

480
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,440
you don't need to be so…

481
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,600
Ming Yi,

482
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,880
I once lived

483
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,160
like a walking corpse,

484
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,000
unable to see any hope.

485
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,440
It was because I met you

486
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,480
that I made it this far.

487
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,880
What you have done for me

488
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,520
matters far more than you realize.

489
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,840
Well…

490
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,080
-This…
-May I

491
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,320
keep this hairpin as a memento?

492
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,080
This is my…

493
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,280
Has Your Lordship found
any new leads in Wugui Sea?

494
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,200
Ji Bozai did create a real Spirit Well

495
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
and hide the Golden Millet Dream
inside it.

496
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
Ming Yi must have
married Ji Bozai because of that,

497
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,840
to form a heart imprint
and share divine consciousness.

498
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,280
So she also knows that the
Golden Millet Dream

499
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,800
is hidden in the Spirit Well?

500
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,760
She shares divine consciousness
with Ji Bozai,

501
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,600
so why hasn't she

502
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,360
entered the Spirit Well
to take the antidote?

503
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,120
Given how cunning Ji Bozai is,

504
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,160
he must've hidden it somewhere
even more secret.

505
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
There is another possibility.

506
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,240
She couldn't bring herself to take it.

507
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,680
Impossible.

508
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,360
Only those who share divine consciousness

509
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,600
can enter each other's Spirit Wells.

510
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,520
Your Lordship cannot reach
the Golden Millet Dream for now.

511
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,920
But that person already discovered
your whereabouts.

512
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,920
For your safety, let me kill him.

513
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,600
He once showed interest in me.

514
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,240
If I offer myself,

515
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,160
he will drop his guard.

516
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,360
Fuyue, I don't need you to go
that far for me.

517
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,840
This is between him and me.

518
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,400
Arrange a meeting with him
for me tomorrow.

519
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,520
Remember, I will go see him myself.

520
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,040
Not you.

521
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,320
You returned empty-handed again

522
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,080
from raiding Wugui Sea.

523
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,000
If Situ Ling hadn't interfered,

524
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,960
everything could've gone
according to plan.

525
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,960
The Situ family has always been
loyal to me.

526
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know what's with that youngest
son of theirs,

527
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,200
but he keeps sabotaging my plans.

528
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,520
-I've sent people to look into it.
-Enough!

529
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,000
How dull are you?

530
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,360
After all this, do you still not realize
whose side Situ Ling is on?

531
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,680
I

532
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,520
will deal with him myself.

533
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,960
Understood.

534
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,680
Although we didn't succeed this time,

535
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,760
the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop
did serious damage to Ji Bozai.

536
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,480
He must be retreating to seclusion now

537
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,600
to refine the netherbeast core again.

538
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,000
If we can find his hiding place,

539
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,000
we can destroy him in one strike.

540
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,960
Do you have a plan?

541
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,280
I do have one.

542
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,360
You know too little about Ji Bozai,

543
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,680
which is why you keep making mistakes.

544
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
Please instruct me, Your Lordship.

545
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,720
Ji Bozai was gravely wounded yesterday.

546
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,720
His companion beast should not
have been able to counterattack.

547
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,920
Yet his silver dragon defeated you all.

548
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,280
Do you know why?

549
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,560
Yesterday at your mansion,

550
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,600
I saw a woman with spiritual veins.

551
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,880
She was the one who beat you.

552
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,160
Ming Yi?

553
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,920
As I recall,

554
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,640
you know a soul-seizing technique

555
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
that can shatter a person's guard

556
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,320
and force them to tell the truth.

557
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,560
You know what to do, right?

558
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,640
Tomorrow, make sure you draw Ji Bozai out.

559
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,760
Flowers!

560
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,360
Take a look, miss.

561
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,400
I like this one.

562
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,320
-Take this one, then.
-All right.

563
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
Flowers! Have a look!

564
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
-I'll take this one.
-Flowers!

565
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,320
-Sure.
-Here.

566
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,040
Thank you. Come back again.

567
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,400
I never expected a mere dancer like you

568
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,560
to be so defiant.

569
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,480
I only want you to casually
lure Ming Yi over.

570
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,800
It's a simple thing.

571
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Why make yourself suffer so much?

572
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,080
In your dreams.

573
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,480
Give it back to me!

574
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,600
Give it back!

575
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,120
What are you doing?

576
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,040
Lord Hanfeng.

577
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,280
When Situ Ling came by yesterday,
what did he say to you?

578
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,760
He said to remember to come to him
if I left Ji Bozai.

579
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,000
-Twenty-Seven!
-No way.

580
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,800
That was a plain love confession!

581
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,920
How could you just say that so calmly?

582
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,880
It's not like that.

583
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,920
He used to be bullied
by his older brothers.

584
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,040
I took him to the Qingyun Tournament
to cheer him up.

585
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,360
He's probably just grateful to me.

586
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,040
If you ask me,

587
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,560
he's just confusing gratitude
with affection.

588
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,040
He will understand in a few years.

589
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,720
Didn't you tell him you weren't Ming Xian?

590
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,960
Yet he keeps helping you

591
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,640
again and again.

592
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
He's a stubborn kid.

593
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
What if he can't move on?

594
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,640
Then I…

595
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,960
"Need to discuss something with you.
Zhang Tai."

596
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,400
Fuyue,

597
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,320
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

598
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,280
get people to get Chao Yu drunk,

599
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,840
and I will handle the rest.

600
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,240
My dear brother,

601
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,920
you don't really think

602
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,840
luring me here

603
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,960
with the Golden Millet Dream's whereabouts

604
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,280
gives you a chance to kill me, do you?

605
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
In your dreams!

606
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,040
Just like your lowborn mother,

607
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,040
you don't deserve to live
in this world at all.

608
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,640
"All is proceeding as planned.

609
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,280
We await Your Lordship.

610
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,000
Respectfully, Lord Hanfeng."

611
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,160
Do you remember

612
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,600
the day you stood against me with Ming Yi?

613
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,080
One look,

614
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,240
and I knew you liked her.

615
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,880
Useless fool,

616
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,120
you actually fell for a married woman?

617
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,640
I will show you

618
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,000
what will happen to the woman you love.

619
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,200
Chao Yu,

620
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,640
what are you going to do?

621
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,120
If you lay a finger on her…

622
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,960
Just wait and see.
