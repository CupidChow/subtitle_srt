00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,920
(The location and characters described in this play
Organization, scenes and events are purely fictional)

2
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,960
Dominant Species

3
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,247
(Episode 8)

4
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,213
You don't have to explain anything to them
They are all bereavement families

5
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,507
I just think

6
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,052
It will be great if you can talk to some people once a week

7
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,057
No

8
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:44,145
I just heard about the support group

9
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,856
Just thinking of you

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,654
(Murder company)

11
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,701
Please help me

12
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,664
Let her go

13
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,543
Let her go

14
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,630
She can bear it

15
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,218
She is responsible for Professor Jin's death

16
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,178
And Mr. Jin

17
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,390
She must be very aware of the risks.

18
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,225
She deserves it

19
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,895
She has killed Professor Jin

20
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,731
Let her go, she is not worthy of this

21
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,152
No, you heard what he said

22
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,989
He just admitted that it was Xian Yuzai who sent him here

23
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,200
Tell the truth quickly, it's you, say

24
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,869
Jiang Yingshi, tie her up

25
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,252
You owe me an explanation, too

26
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,932
hateful

27
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,145
So he...

28
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,774
Which one do you want to use?

29
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,486
If the representative allows

30
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,949
Did Xianyuzai send you here?

31
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,285
I chose to come

32
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,039
Then you said that just to get her words?

33
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,541
If I hadn't decided to investigate

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,086
I won't listen to anyone's instructions, even the Prime Minister

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,922
What to investigate?

36
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,552
Azolan terrorist attack in January 2024

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,472
Is it you who is the mastermind behind the scenes?

38
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,937
Yingshi, confirm the position of Yu Caiwen

39
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,566
You came to save him, and it was faster than I expected

40
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,653
That's all fake

41
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,989
-You and Xian Yuzai want to frame me
-No

42
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,991
What did you say to him and what did you leak?

43
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,660
Say nothing

44
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,870
You still suspect that I did that, bastard

45
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,373
You're the most hateful

46
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,751
People like you are the most disgusting

47
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,634
I didn't know you at that time

48
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,430
I don't know how much pain you have suffered

49
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,684
Or do you have any dreams

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,524
It was not a coincidence that we were all in Yazoran at that time

51
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,276
That's right

52
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,569
Then what about becoming my bodyguard?

53
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,905
It's not a coincidence

54
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,327
Then what about you attending our event at the beginning?

55
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,708
What about ransomware?

56
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,048
That's not a coincidence.

57
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,765
I don't know which one is true

58
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,103
It was the Prime Minister who brought me into his ransomware plot

59
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,399
He decided to use me after finding out that I had relevant experience.

60
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,278
He secretly asked for information
But he didn't explain why he needed it?

61
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,904
I've never given him information

62
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,573
Of course you will deny it

63
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,491
I only have one goal

64
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,331
That's to find out my comrade
Dead at the hands of one's own or foreign enemies

65
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,667
But I can't find any relevant information here

66
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,753
No clues at all

67
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,129
You should give him information.

68
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,216
If you let Xian Yuzai instruct, you will be useful to him

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,179
「郑海登被抓，你只有我了」
Take the opportunity to gain an advantage

70
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,686
You're willing to give it to me...

71
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,815
Is the last chance to be useful?

72
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,820
Let me catch the person who killed Jin Haosheng

73
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,492
Why do you ask for my consent? You won't listen

74
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,163
Because this is my last mission here

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,958
I want to go back to the welfare service center

76
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,669
There will always be someone there to remember the murderer

77
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,214
When I come back, I will tell you my discovery

78
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,423
No

79
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,636
You don't have to quit, you're fired

80
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,859
Jiang Yingshi

81
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,114
Ask Director Zheng to pack up what I have at Yu Caiyun’s house…

82
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,032
yes

83
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,418
(Brain-computer interface input)
(Processed human output)

84
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,962
This is what she sees now

85
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,881
These images are being transmitted through brain waves

86
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,677
And this is what she thought of after seeing the image

87
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,430
What was she thinking? I don't understand

88
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,349
She struggled to resist psychologically

89
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,561
So the output result is not clear

90
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,480
Oh my God, she is so stubborn

91
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,442
All photos of her victims have been played, but she is still resisting

92
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,989
The output image gradually becomes clearer

93
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,159
Has her psychological defense become weaker?

94
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,495
Bad, I haven't become weak

95
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,585
Should I cover her ears?

96
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,803
How are you?

97
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,847
Fortunately, it's abominable

98
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,350
What?

99
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,854
(Processed human output)

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,156
It was him who jumped off the overpass and fell on Yin's car

101
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,369
Isn’t Zheng Haiden also present?

102
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,122
She witnessed it with her own eyes

103
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,167
The blood we let her look at will remind her of it

104
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,419
The picture that reminds her of blood most

105
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,424
Representative, we are doing an experiment, do you want to continue?

106
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,348
Zheng Haiden

107
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,599
Be careful, she will bite

108
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,892
You are torture me

109
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,269
I won't settle for things

110
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,691
If I think I am a spy, report me and call the police

111
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,569
I called the police, I inform you that you are missing

112
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,073
"The commercial spy who penetrated BF escaped

113
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,535
My bodyguard was killed while chasing her
The murderer and the spy

114
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,371
All disappeared."

115
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,291
Dawson will find you at any cost

116
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,795
Everyone will find the disgusting Xianyu family

117
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,465
Install spies in someone else's company
But they won't abandon you

118
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,677
They will try their best to save you

119
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,639
Keep dreaming

120
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,975
You won't be satisfied

121
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,980
You know, the layout of this building is very complicated

122
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,607
We have a lot of freezer

123
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,449
Feed her three meals a day until she confesses

124
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,868
If necessary, stuff food into her throat

125
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,413
Don't think of dying

126
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,217
I didn't see another spy, did you let him go?

127
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,600
If he had planned to reveal it
What about his relationship with Xian Yuzai?

128
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,395
He and Zheng Haiden may be conspiring together
So that one of them can escape

129
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,026
He came here to find out
Did I plan the Yazolan terror attack?

130
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,446
What a creative excuse

131
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,075
But how can we believe him?
What if he was talking nonsense?

132
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,121
-Do you want to believe him?
-Do you think I want it?

133
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:30,254
Can we control the electronic chips in his ears?

134
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,799
What do you want to do with it?

135
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,554
If he is really a spy
And we have to take action and talk about it

136
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,098
In theory

137
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,893
We can create vibrations in his ears

138
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,897
Hurt his inner ear and cause severe pain to him

139
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,815
Wearing a noise reduction device is useless

140
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,570
-Hello
- Just do it

141
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,280
Get it ready

142
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,368
-sorry
-What's wrong?

143
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,453
I thought he was trustworthy

144
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,540
After all, I tested and interviewed him

145
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,252
I promised to confirm the side effects.

146
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,296
What?

147
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:18,511
Jiang Yingshi, Yu Caiyun turned off a BF application
Send him an alarm

148
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,930
-yes
-I originally trusted Director Zheng very much.

149
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,023
The sir will arrive in five minutes

150
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:37,530
"Even in the face of heavy rain
We farmers have protected our crops

151
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,282
When our country suffers from foot-and-mouth disease...

152
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,534
(Prime Minister Xian Yu Zai)

153
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,536
Crazy bovine disease and avian flu attack

154
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,162
The government ordered the killing of livestock

155
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,165
We can only obey

156
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,835
We thought it was God's will

157
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,132
But now there is a monster named BF that is rampant in our country

158
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,634
God's will is dead

159
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,096
Has this hopeful world abandoned us?

160
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,809
Still me, a useless farmer
Should we give up this world? ”

161
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,773
USDA this morning

162
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,277
Already expressed concern about the BF monopoly market

163
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,489
They threaten us
It also says that BF may cause diplomatic problems

164
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,993
BF no longer seems to focus on

165
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,162
A large enterprise that pursues public interests

166
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,665
I'm worried about this person leaving his suicide note

167
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,125
Then the farmers who committed suicide

168
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:38,674
This company will burn the entire industry

169
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,050
We'll be

170
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,678
How long will it take for the pretext of economic first to deceive?

171
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,307
In fact

172
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,145
I've seen a representative of BF after the culture medium incident occurred

173
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,525
Nothing worse than the safety of the product being questioned by the public

174
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,360
But the representative of BF

175
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,780
As an influential person

176
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,866
The only goal is profitability

177
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,951
That makes me reflect

178
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,956
“Is she really our top representative?
Did I do the same before? ”

179
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,797
Attorney General

180
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,967
Can we investigate BF?

181
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,095
Yes, we can file a case at any time

182
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,765
There have been several cases pending trial against BF

183
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,476
But if we investigate

184
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,395
Since Representative Yin has been accused of poisoning subordinates

185
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,106
It will appear that the government approves these allegations

186
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,316
That's exactly

187
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,570
I don't think a company is suspected of attacking its representative

188
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,658
Or it is common for the company manager to die in an unfaithful life

189
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,786
This investigation is not only shown

190
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,623
The government is also working hard, or the government will not favor enterprises

191
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,916
We have to check it out thoroughly

192
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,878
In this way, BF will correct and reflect on itself

193
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,216
I need all leaders to help BF

194
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,845
Make it a company that works for our country

195
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,763
National Human Rights Commission, Ministry of Industry and Commerce

196
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,224
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Animal and Food Department wants

197
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,308
Assist the inspection and investigation unit

198
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,020
-Can you do it?
-yes

199
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,489
Dominant Species

200
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,376
I'm a house agent who works nearby

201
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,130
What's wrong? Is she the new homeowner here?

202
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,593
That young man really should have told me if he sold it here

203
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,970
He didn't know anything afterwards

204
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,980
Is this house for sale?

205
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,315
What's wrong?

206
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,192
I heard your conversation with Fang Zhong

207
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,530
I don't want to eavesdrop, but your voice is clear

208
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,950
how? Do you want to move into an apartment?

209
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,952
It is to help my niece pay tuition for abroad

210
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,538
What? Are you selling the house to help her pay for the tuition?

211
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,291
What school does she study for? Harvard?

212
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,044
She's in elementary school

213
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,921
-She is still a child
-right

214
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,715
Why do you pay for her father?

215
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,345
Oh my God, I don't have the right to worry about others

216
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:17,059
I have to buy a house first to get married and have children

217
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,352
Do you have a partner?

218
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,064
Do you really think that you will be single with this handsome face and a good figure?

219
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,734
Oh my God, you are only 26 years old, why are you anxious?

220
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,862
Even I'm not married yet

221
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,448
Why is that window open?

222
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,285
That is to say, Yin

223
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,664
Have you ever heard of such things as uncles paying for helping raise their niece?

224
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,625
This is not my house, my whole family lived here before

225
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,587
Listen, I know it's nothing to do with me

226
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,299
But it doesn't make sense for you to do this
She only speaks fluent English

227
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,261
Then I won't give you any reward

228
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,430
You're nosy all day

229
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,640
Anyway

230
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,812
You have to work hard to buy this kind of house again

231
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,362
I've always wanted to study abroad

232
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,282
You can go now

233
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,578
My parents can only send one of us abroad

234
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,790
I can't believe you have had times when you have no money

235
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,420
Parents want to give as much as possible for their children

236
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,547
I have no choice

237
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,551
She is allergic to dairy products

238
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,262
Can't drink any kind of milk

239
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,934
When the little girl was here
I've been sent to the emergency department countless times

240
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,813
Sellers will say their products do not contain any milk

241
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,232
But her throat was still swollen and unable to breathe

242
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,736
What do you guess those people say?

243
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,405
「我们不知道它有牛奶」

244
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,742
Some people say she should drink milk
Help her overcome allergies

245
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,744
Is she cured her illness in the United States?

246
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,287
That's not cured

247
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,000
Interestingly, people in the United States have all kinds of allergies

248
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,379
She has a classmate who is allergic to water

249
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
Some people do

250
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,135
Your niece's parents must be very sad

251
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,347
Her dad gave up on her

252
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,643
He said he couldn't afford her

253
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,730
He expressed his dissatisfaction with me and asked for a divorce

254
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,859
Why is he dissatisfied with you? It's not your fault that she is allergic

255
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,196
Because I want my sister to go abroad

256
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,283
I was in the United States for a long time training

257
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,872
After her daughter went to kindergarten
She often calls me crying

258
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,584
Why does her daughter feel sad when she goes to kindergarten?

259
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,838
They have birthday parties every month

260
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,798
The kids have cakes

261
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,176
Oh my god, your niece must want to eat it

262
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,096
She never eats cakes

263
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,600
Because she knows more than anyone else how painful it is

264
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,104
But her classmates were offended

265
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,274
They were angry that she didn't eat their cake

266
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,694
Later they began to bully her

267
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,696
Oh my god, I hate bully

268
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,533
Maybe it has something to do with her race

269
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,911
But she has never been to an emergency clinic in the United States

270
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,881
Even if you have 100 children
You can definitely send them all abroad, too

271
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,721
What's wrong? Too many?

272
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,141
He is only 26 years old

273
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,647
I don't know how his girlfriend is

274
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,679
(Kim Ho-sen)

275
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,693
Did Director Zheng speak?

276
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,406
Does Yin look like a terrorist?

277
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,496
Kim Shin-sun rescues Mr....

278
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,709
Maybe it was brainwashed in a short time

279
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,885
-Brainwashed by the murderer?
-right

280
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,806
He never said anything about him at a group party

281
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,476
And he has only participated in it two or three times in total

282
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,813
But there is someone sitting next to him every time

283
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,024
Talk to him

284
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,196
Once they didn't attend the party
Run to the coffee shop opposite

285
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,866
He said they didn't attend the party again after that

286
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,539
Professor Jin was hurt by a damn bastard

287
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,917
How could he know
Can he meet Professor Jin at the Welfare Service Center?

288
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,754
Zheng Haiden must be busy with information

289
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,219
He must be vicious enough to stab someone else to death

290
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,596
It also set fire to the entire community

291
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,599
Instead of starting a move in the open space, it's such a crazy guy

292
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,315
You don't have to tell me your discovery, but...

293
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,232
(Bozheng Police Department)

294
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
don’t worry

295
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,987
By the way, have you told the police that we have caught Zheng Haiden?

296
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,031
No

297
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,494
How could they quickly load so much explosives?

298
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,085
And in the military camp

299
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,964
Representative Yin and we once suspected that it was done by professional killers

300
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,592
Not an extremist

301
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,388
If you have discussed it, forget it?

302
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
What can we do?

303
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,025
But she is also a victim

304
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,945
(Anzhi Funeral Home)

305
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,847
She looks very familiar

306
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,854
Have you found anything?

307
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,700
Oh my God

308
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,083
You can warn me first

309
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,268
What's wrong?

310
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,116
You call me when you finish, I'll do it until she confesses

311
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,461
It's time for you to eat

312
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,060
don't want

313
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,984
Are they worthy of your starvation to show your loyalty?

314
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,279
I don't want you to see this side of me

315
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,782
What?

316
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,408
Let someone else come

317
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,371
Don't be you

318
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,545
I'm not asking you to understand me

319
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,631
I've been caught

320
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,054
But among all

321
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,101
I hope you only have good memories of me and make me happy

322
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,903
Are you messing with me now?

323
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,032
You can't fool me if you suddenly do this
What do you think I am?

324
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,285
How do you know if it was sudden?

325
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,831
You only have representative Yin in your eyes, you...

326
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,751
You never gave me a chance

327
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:35,927
Zheng Haiden, if this is true
You shouldn't have said anything nonsense to me before

328
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,348
I once swear
Every time I come to work, I have to hide my mood

329
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,767
Because I know I can't have you

330
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,186
It seems I'm doing a good job

331
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,524
Did you really not notice it?

332
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,284
If I want me to leave positive memories of you, I will tell me the truth

333
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,622
What happened to Professor Jin?
Who is the murderer who killed Jin Haosheng and where is it?

334
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,083
What does Dawson want you to do? What information did you leak?

335

336
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,923
He was killed on the street, how could that happen? ”

337
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,427
I said that to my friend because I was very sad

338
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,721
Stop talking about the friend we can't find...

339
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,307
I'm going crazy, she's like my sister

340

341
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,104
Her cell phone

342
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,815
Is it untrackable?

00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,582
It's in the swimming pool

348
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,752
We met in the swimming pool

349
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:57,550
She approached me first, and she was very nice to me

350
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:11,064

We met in the swimming pool

352
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,364
She approached me first

353
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,991

00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,141
What about the images for Director Zheng?

360
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,230
I'll start it and leave
I said you'll tell me when you end

361
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,235
It's okay, it's time for you to leave

362
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,670
What's wrong?

363
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,965
You must think I'm silent

364
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,468
It means I don't know anything

365
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,765
What do you keep silent about?

366
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,278
You've ever wanted to confirm the traitor

367
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,489
Is it me

368
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,325
Do you think I'm related to Kim Ho-sung's death

369
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,701
-You can't blame you...
-What?

370
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,332
That's fine, I won't delay you

371
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:00,256
Listen, I don't know

372
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,760
Even I wonder what the murderer is

373
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,804
Find our bodyguard

374
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,724
But we all caught the insider

375
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,646
Isn't I worth your apology?

376
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,524
-worth?
-What's the result

377
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,778
You look at me like I'm a torture expert

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,326
I can't believe what I've heard

379
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,702
When did you mean?

380
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,287
Just now

381
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,749
I originally wanted to say that woman looks familiar

382
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,004
woman? What woman?

383
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,006
The woman that Director Zheng remembers

384
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,467
The woman that the man who fell to death reminded her of

385
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,678
She looks familiar, but I didn't say it

386
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,805
Because I can't remember, but you doubt me?

387
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,309
You are insecure, no one accused you

388
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,480
Maybe you already know that you're torturing her

389
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,233
So when others see you, you feel guilty

390
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,964
"He dared not question the person who gave the order."

391
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,050
Everyone thinks I'm easy to bully

392
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,844
I'm so angry

393
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,386
(No blood)
(No blood)

394
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,741
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

395
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,701
Send a letter to shareholders

396
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:40,041
"We foresee that external forces are trying to acquire maliciously

397
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,503
The company will issue relatively cheap stocks

398
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,339
And let shareholders purchase first

399
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,925
We do this just to prevent

400
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,136
Illegal M&A caused by short-sighted profit and market failure

401
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,305
We believe in external forces

402
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,558
Will try to buy cheap stocks in large quantities

403
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,436
We call on wise shareholders

404
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,190
Work with us to protect this company”

405
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,071
把「呼吁」改成「恳请」

406
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,614
Yes, it has been modified

407
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,367
「此外」…

408
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,912
Xian Yuzai sent me here to swallow BF in one breath

409
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,835
Catch me so you won't lose everything and regret it

410
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,629
Jiang Yingshi

411
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:31,259
What is the market value gap between Dawson and BF?

412
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,844
According to 2025 data

413
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,014
Dawson's total market value is 1570 trillion won

414
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,057
BF is 260 trillion won

415
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,273
Less than a quarter

416
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,532
Director Zheng denies any connection

417
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,286
We'll just be accused of taking her as a hostage

418
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,582
If she is not thrown into the freezer
Just hand her over to the police

419
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,209
What if she dies like Professor Jin?

420
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,797
Then go to the freezer

421
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,842
I don't expect her to admit that she's doing things for Dawson

422
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,886
But we have to find out who the murderer is

423
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,888
Even if she admits everything

424
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,974
How do we fight against Xian Yugen and the Prime Minister?

425
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,479
This is your last chance

426
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,106
This is my last chance

427
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,758
Yes, representative, Mr. Yu

428
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,323
There are more people in Haiyuntai, right?

429
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,408
Especially at night

430
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,745
There has been laid out there, we are now in Nampodong

431
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,124
Not instant, they will pass on the edited version

432
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,834
What about other areas?

433
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,794
Yes, we're ready, too

434
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,308
Hello, I am the representative of BF Yin Zi

435
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,726
- Look
-Oh my God

436
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,146
Sorry, I suddenly appeared

437
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,858
I have something to tell
Everyone who lives in this era

438
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,025
BF Company

439
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,487
Always on a secret plan

440
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,697
That's the organoid

441
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,492
In short, we have been cultivating human organs

442
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,453
With top cell culture technology

443
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,498
We are committed to replicating human organs,

444
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,458
We're able to cultivate muscle fiber

445
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,711
Osteocytes, blood

446
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:15,131
Heart, liver, kidney, lungs

447
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,800
-Pancreas, stomach, small intestine...
- Look

448
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,844
Large intestine, bladder

449
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,638
We have successfully cultivated all human organs

450
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,723
- Except for the brain
-No way

451
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,435
But our plan is not perfect

452
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,521
We must conduct clinical trials

453
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,982
So I want to ask everyone for help

454
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,695
People in the end of cancer

455
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,740
People with incurable diseases

456
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,785
We want to seek volunteers for clinical trials

457
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,956
We will pay for all the surgery

458
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,336
We will conduct applicability tests on volunteers

459
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,171
The first batch will have 60 patients

460
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,382
There will be 150 patients in the second and third batches

461
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,011
I admire the BF's acquisition very much

462
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,555
Extraordinary achievements

463
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,227
But as the Prime Minister of this country, I am deeply angry

464
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,354
Representative Yin of BF

465
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,899
Why use the health of our people as bait

466
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,734
Shake the entire country?

467
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,445
What you see

468
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,739
It's an advertisement

469
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,410
As a representative of the company, she is just selling products

470
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,664
But before I unfold this project, I must share

471
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,916
A heartbreaking news

472
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,546
Two years ago
Our researchers have conducted clinical trials, but

473
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,465
We failed

474
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,176
Although the patient agreed beforehand

475
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,388
Cancer cells have been metastasized long ago

476
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,642
But we cannot and cannot deny the fact that she passed away

477
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,562
I want to take responsibility and assure you two things

478
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,106
I have no doubt

479
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,400
I believe the people are wise

480
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,152
BF won't get what it wants

481
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,866
I know her words may give some hope

482
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,076
but

483
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,621
The government will do its best

484
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,084
We will never allow private companies to take risks with their lives

485
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,087
Make a gamble of this scale

486
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,298
First of all, I will take it

487
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,509
Legal liability for treatment outside of medical institutions

488
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,677
second

489
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:30,558
I volunteered to be the first test subject

490
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,310
Are you crazy?

491
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,396
Have you known it long ago? Director Wen

492
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,606
Director Wen, have you known it a long time ago?

493
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,442
Have you agreed on it?

494
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,359
Are you crazy?

495
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,610
That…

496
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,072
I won't use people's desperate situations to push my plans

497
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,324
It's her crazy idea

498
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,243
I will use the organs we cultivate

499
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,163
-Replace all my organs
- My dear national

500
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,040
Remember this

501
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,794
Even if she wants to sacrifice herself to prove something

502
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:03,090
You don't have to agree with her, let alone respect her

503
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,011
The entire operation will be made public

504
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,306
We'll see if I'll have it in the next three months

505
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,684
Any complications, infections, rejection

506
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,602
Wife

507
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,229
We will only select new test subjects after confirmation

508
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,147
Really?

509
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,815
Cell culture technology of BF

510
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,319
It is currently the culmination that modern humans can reach

511
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,156
The surgery will be made of absolutely accurate artificial intelligence

512
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,701
Since its establishment and BF
I have been studying the cultivation of human organs

513
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,953
-Top researchers conduct
-Representative Yin Ziyi

514
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,413
Promoting her products

515
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:39,460
BF is promoting products that are not perfect at all

516
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,462
This is not a reckless attempt

517
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,255
It's entirely because

518
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,885
Many people are eager to
Can live in a world without illness

519
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,847
I believe in your courage and determination

520
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,600
I and the biotech company BF will wait

521
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:58,104
People who want to change humanity with us

522
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,397
Yin Ziyi Representative

523
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,857
If in your heart

524
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,778
There is also a little conscience or reason

525
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,365
Don't try to make profits by using the lives of the people

526
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,992
On the contrary, you should repent

527
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:17,164
And sincerely to all
Apologize for the innocent life of your company

528
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,667
The beep will be transferred to your voicemail...

529
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,461
-Why didn't she answer the phone?
- Your call will be charged

530
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,672
(Representative Yin)

531
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,426
Yin Ziyi, are you really crazy?

532
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,928
What do you think of us?

533
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,391
Even people with bad organs will not do this

534
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,936
You weren't forced to jump out of the building or something, I...

535
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,155
He only knows how to work hard

536
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,615
Wait, Jiang Yingshi

537
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,575
yes

538
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,202
Issue December 24, 2025

539
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,747
The name of the farm of the farmer who jumped off the Meishan Sky Bridge

540
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,500
Yes, search for news articles

541
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,087
The name of the farm is Yangzhou Li Guangyang Animal Products

542
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,006
(Representative Yin)

543
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,351
The inspection and investigation unit has learned

544
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,480
Illegal surgery for BF and patient death

545
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,190
Representative Yin of BF

546
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,485
Now she is talking about this and she knows it very well

547
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:32,281
She will be questioned soon
Therefore, I want to pretend that I have a conscience

548
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,034
Let's save her face

549
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,579
Everyone has heard that the prosecutor will respond to BF

550
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,664
-Change investigation
- Continue to play

551
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,333
-yes
-We will continue to report

552
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,252
The latest statement issued by the government

553
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,464
Let's hear the Chinese people hear the declaration of Yin Zi

554
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,049
What do you think

555
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,969
I was very shocked, I wonder if she would do what she said

556
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,531
Let me be your evidence

557
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,284
What discoveries did you find after you go to find the murderer?

558
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,005
"My life was in danger, but BF saved me

559
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,132
Is there any better evidence? ”

560
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,343
Who should I tell?

561
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:39,890
I'll say I'm getting stronger
Hearing gets better, so…

562
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,976
Don't do this

563
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,940
Since there are shortcuts, why take a long way?

564
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,900
There is no better solution

565
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,410
Why do you have to be so overdoing it?

566
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,997
Because I have to subdue them

567
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,041
No other reason

568
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,336
I've faced countless obstacles and I've overcome them all

569
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,131
This one is no exception

570
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,301
I'll let them know

571
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,053
They can't suppress me

572
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,849
Have you had to sacrifice your body before?

573
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,019
Do you want to survive?

574
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,565
I'm just trying to survive

575
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,400
I'll survive

576
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,779
I see

577
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,658
What do you know? where are you going?

578
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,038
If the second best approach works...

579
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,417
You don't need the best way

580
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,506
what you up to?

581
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,886
I have things that I can't give up.

582
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,971
My mission...

583
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,391
Not over yet

584
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,692
I haven't taken a walk at night for a long time

585
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,944
You know very well

586
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,948
The point is not just about replacing organs, right?

587
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,786
You can still become energetic, you must have experienced it yourself

588
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,208
If you want to walk again, you can wear prosthetics

589
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,214
Captain Yu, beware of the misfortune coming from the mouth

590
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,385
Have you told Ling Yan?

591
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,763
You said it was a surprise visit

592
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,601
But visits by the head of state cannot be arranged temporarily

593
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,897
You must have arranged a visit before boarding the plane

594
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:39,695
Have you told Ling Yan about your plan before boarding the plane?

595
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,114
So what if I said it?

596
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,326
I want to see her

597
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,873
Why?

598
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,750
Yin Zi is not an attacker

599
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,419
We should shift our goals

600
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,590
Just like we switched from President Park to investigating Representative Yoon

601
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,136
You want to transfer your goals

602
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,680
But want to see my daughter?

603
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,391
To be precise

604
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,854
I want to meet President Xianyu's ex-wife

605
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:21,904
leave

606
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,364
Would you ask her in person?

607
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,034
Leave me

608
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,566
(President Dawson and Mrs.)

609
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,979
I'm very happy to see you, I'm Yu Caiyun

610
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,275
I have something to report to you

611
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,235
Related to the Prime Minister's request

612
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,660
What's up?

613
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,760
You want to apply for an outsourcing
Just to pay for my niece's tuition?

614
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,640
I've also had enough of everyone's criticism of each other for ransomware

615
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,434
Look at you

616
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,272
You must have heard of how beautiful women in that country are

617
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,607
You crazy guy

618
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,651
Do you know? I'm going to stop you from marrying the woman there

619
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,864
You want to come too?

620
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,618
If they only see you
I think Korean men are ugly

621
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,162
Don't say you've already had an interview

622
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,938
I will do whatever it takes...

623
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,400
Catch him

624
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,242
