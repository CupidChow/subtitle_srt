Mr. Yu Caiyun?

5
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,233
I'm

6
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,984
Please

10
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,574
Wear these glasses, too

(No blood)

12
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,800
OK, let's start

13
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,405
Why did he stop?

14
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,200
He can continue to attack without waiting for the system to load

15
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,078
Is he deliberately waiting for his opponent?

16
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,339
Very dangerous

17
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,508
I thought the program was too old and it was knocked out

18
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,885
Good luck to you, at least there is an old version

19
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,762
Our group can't do anything at all

20
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,846
All files are locked

21
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,599
Nothing is displayed

22
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,310
I need to see their blood oxygen concentration

23
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,647
But aren't they obviously hypoxia?

24
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,533
Shoot only red targets

25
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,004
Please look behind you

Wen Shan, Research Director and Leader of Research Group 2

29
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,087
He and Yin Ziyi formed BF together

30
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,882
But when BF was having a difficult start, he devoted himself to the field of medicine

31
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
Being a medical examiner for three years

32
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,762
What job do you do at Naval Intelligence Command?

33
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,057
I was in the sea and air information and communication support group at that time

34
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,269
Then you go to the scout team

35
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,187
He is trying his best to avoid exposure in the media

36
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,899
Even as a research director, I never participate in BF activities

37
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,735
You have received long-term training in the US for the Pacific Rim training

38
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,279
That's like a SEAL, right?

39
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,989
I'm not going to train

40
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,367
I'm going to participate in the Pacific Rim Exercise

41
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,244
You retired last year

42
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,707
With your background, you can be an officer for life
Have a stable career

43
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,877
And you can have a stable career as a medical examiner

44
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,884
If you checked my background
Must have checked the representative Yin

45
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,678
Will I be responsible for escorting her?

46
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,555
Why did you leave Shanghe Group?

47
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,516
The salary of the escort president must be very good

48
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,019
I'm very glad that President Park doesn't need my protection

49
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,605
No one wants to be bad for him

50
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,356
Now the representative Yin is

51
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,358
People who need close protection

52
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,531
In 2023, she went to North America

53
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,909
Attacked while visiting production facilities

54
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,453
Eighty-mostly the killer suspect was shot dead on the spot

55
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,873
In 2024, there are extremists
Attack her in Greenpeace Conference

56
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,335
These are just events that the public knows

57
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,259
Thank you very much today

58
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,179
-Is it over?
-Please go back

59
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,140
-I have a question
-Please say

60
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,476
What is the salary?

61
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,396
What?

62
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,981
Can't I ask?

63
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,237
How much does it cost to pay you?

64
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
Isn't that written on paper?

65
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,199
I mean, shouldn't I ask?

66
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,076
We do not ask about the previous salary of our employees

67
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,285
But you just asked

68
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,500
You won't have fixed hours

69
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,126
That's no problem

70
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,878
You will get the same amount at least

71
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,922
If you pass, let's talk more

72
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
I see

73
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,884
Thank you

77
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,211
None of my team members

78
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,339
Using external networks during work

79
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
My group is the same

80
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,301
We only use the internal network according to security regulations

81
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,385
My group is also

82
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,720
What about ransomware?

83
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,264
I'm afraid both of me and the security team will still be

84
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,432
Can't solve the problem

85
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,434
We're still thinking of a solution

86
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,519
Should I extend the closing time?

87
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,565
On Monday, the rumors spread

88
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,942
Thank you everyone

89
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,070
-goodbye
-Representative Yin, etc.

90
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,781
The bodyguard candidate just left

91
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,782
good

92
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,202
He is very competent, but he is very rigid

93
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,580
Not talking much but stubborn

94
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,749
Loyal but disobedient

95
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
Did you interview in person?

96
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,087
The point is that his background is fine

97
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,090
Shanghe must have done it for their president

98
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,549
A thorough background check

99
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,761
The most important thing for you is whether you can

100
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,304
Trust him

101
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,806
This is my opinion

102
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,224
I'll remember

103
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,521
I have bad news

104
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,273
And not that bad news

105
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,901
How bad can the situation be?

106
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,153
You should meet Prime Minister Xian Yuzai

107
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,030
He wants to talk to you about the culture medium

108
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,616
Are you free this afternoon?

109
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,244
He said he only has time to go free

110
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,247
Do you want to reject him?

111
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,124
「真的非常抱歉

112
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,001
But Representative Yin is not available today.”

113
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,504
I can say that

114
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,424
Tell him I'll see him in the afternoon

115
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,718
Not that bad news?

116
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,929
Sorry, that's it

117
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,224
This is bad news

118
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,362
Don't get in the way, those who block the way will die

119
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,740
BF pays the price for threatening our business

120
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,909
Who can bring Yin Zi's head
You can get $3 million

121
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,953
We warn you, Yin Zi

122
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,081
Ignore us and you will end up like this

123
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,466
They are South American gangster "Archie Forest"

124
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,761
They offer you a reward

125
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,722
They were originally drug trafficking groups

126
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,974
But it will also set fire to the jungle and exploit local people

127
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,435
Also operates a large tropical farm

128
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,063
This has something to do with the food you say you will cultivate in the next six months

129
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Can't go to South America

130
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,526
No time to joke

131
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,028
These assholes...

132
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,739
If it is a Korean farmer, I can understand

133
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,658
But why are these scumbags getting angry?

134
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,744
Because I threaten the primary industry

135
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,332
I've been mentally prepared for a long time

136
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,588
If you're OK, that's fine

137
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,382
No

138
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,511
I'm scared of what happened

139
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,638
Fear of death

140
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,392
represent

141
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,980
One of the bodyguard candidates we interviewed today
Was a cyclist before

142
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,274
His thighs are really...

143
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,027
You definitely don't believe it, but it's so rough

144
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,446
He also subdued the robbers on the street

145
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,283
- Not bad
-The person mentioned by Director Wen

146
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,869
Very strong, too

147
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,456
I'm not sure if I should use him

148
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,541
You don't like him?

149
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,501
So do you want to clean him out?

150
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,381
Which level has he reached?

151
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,149
Full plant

152
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,447
Full plant?

153
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,043
Slide out your hands

154
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,384
Is the test not over yet?

155
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,012
Is it true this time?

156
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,223
What is the name of "Manzhi"? Too cheesy

157
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,359
Let it go

158
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,945
the same as you

159
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
Your salary in the army must be very high

160
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,957
Only then can I send her to a foreign school

161
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,251
Who sent you here?

162
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,211
BF's Yin Zi

163
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,754
Leave her to us

164
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,922
We only want this

165
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,341
We won't hurt her

166
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,593
So you don't have to feel sorry for it

167
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
We just want to ask her a few questions

168
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,866
You go find her by yourself

169
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,827
The school you want to go to is very expensive

170
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,752
If you can't do it

171
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,337
Just tell us

172
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,215
When and where Yin Zi is

173
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,010
Will be alone

174
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,974
money

175
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
Your family’s safety

176
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,352
Is it not good to have both?

177
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,001
Wait, calm down

178
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,214
Open the door quickly, she will explain everything

179
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,799
I only know so much

180
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,276
Mr. Yu, please come with me

181
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,947
I've supported you

182
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,326
I think you're the perfect person

183
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,329
Isn't it the end?

184
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,666
I'm not sure, I'm not sure about it.

185
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,459
But you should be alert

186
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,462
Representative Yin has another enemy

187
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,756
Who is it?

188
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,092
A bunch of stupid poisonous insects

189
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,474
Illegal research…

190
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,311
Strictly condemn the murderer Yin Zi

191
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,526
The cultured meat should be discarded

192
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,952
(No blood)

193
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
Good luck

194
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,607
We know each other's names, but we never say hello

195
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,484
My family is not a meat-raising

196
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,987
Please don't use them for experimentation

197
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,405
That's verification, not experiment

198
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,163
Please don't stand by the window

199
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706
Can I pull the curtains?

200
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,380
You have to verify because you don't know who you can trust

201
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,092
Because your bodyguard may be your biggest threat

202
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,180
The same goes for bodyguards

203
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,140
When we and our customers can trust each other

204
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,059
Only then can we show the highest efficiency

205
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,227
in addition…

206
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,687
You should stay away from the window

207
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,529
Mr. Yu

208
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,035
yes

209
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,915
I hope you are the person we need

210
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,126
And you showed up at the right time

211
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,131
Coincidence or not

212
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,885
You seem to have all the skills we need

213
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,556
I thought about asking you
How could you have all the experience we need

214
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,685
But if you really have ulterior motives

215
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,688
You've practiced those replies

216
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,360
What kind of experience do you mean?

217
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,074
You happened to be there when the animal owner was seeking death

218
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,410
You happen to be

219
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,911
A bodyguard

220
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,039
Add your previous military post

221
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294
At the time of the incident, I was on my way out of the event venue

222
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,214
Activity?

223
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,383
right

224
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
Have you been to our conference?

225
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,513
I went there on my own, so that's not a coincidence

226
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,557
As for escorting customers

227
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,269
That's just my job, nothing to say

228
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,186
but

229
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,940
I didn't expect you to remember my former military post

230
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,444
But your resume is written

231
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,822
What do you mean?

232
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,990
(October 2020
Naval Intelligence Command)

233
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,283
Navy Intelligence Command

234
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:07,993
What's wrong?

235
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,786
What's the problem?

236
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,596
You know Citizen X

237
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,974
They attacked while you were in service

238
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,934
right

239
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,354
-Did you solve it?
-Sorry, that's a secret

240
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,564
Do you crack the ransomware or give money?

241
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,982
That's confidential information

242
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,651
You can't crack it

243
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,279
Or catch them

244
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,281
No one yet

245
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,034
The mastermind behind the ransomware was caught

246
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,079
-None of them?
-No one

247
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,668
How much does they want?

248
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,133
(Welcome to X Citizen)
(All files have been encrypted)

249
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,102
Sir, look

250
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,528
(Oh my God, your file is encrypted
View payment method)

251
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,908
If

252
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,828
We give money, will they unlock it?

253
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,206
If it is not unlocked, our losses will be greater

254
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,087
If they want to keep doing this
I probably won't run away after taking the money

255
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,589
Once the news of their rebellion spread

256
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,716
No one will give money

257
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,177
What happens after you give it money?

258
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,641
They will unlock the file, but you are not asking

259
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,101
Can't catch them?

260
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,070
If the gangster is extremely greedy...

261
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,822
How about it?

262
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,117
You can only

263
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,619
When they exchange Bitcoin

264
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,207
If someone raises a record of 80 billion won

265
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,710
You can track them down

266
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,421
I'll exchange it little by little

267
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,882
I will take it slowly to every exchange

268
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,884
Carry out small amounts of requisition

269
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,844
Usually that

270
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,637
Or multiple people will be picked up at the same time

271
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,559
Anyway, I have to give money...

272
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,937
Only then have the chance to catch them

273
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,898
Yes, wait and see what happens

274
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,943
I'd rather throw money on the street
Don't want to pay those bastards

275
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,035
Yes, represent

276
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,119
us…

277
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,206
Pay the ransom

278
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,458
are you sure?

279
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,375
Sure

280
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,673
(fail)

281
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,316
It's so hateful

282
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,276
never mind

283
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,861
I won't do it anymore

284
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,951
You're amazing

285
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,749
I've sent out Bitcoin

286
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,591
File unlocked

287
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,555
You have to inform you of this

288
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,223
Must be

289
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,060
Even if it's a group like you
It is also impossible to monitor all exchanges

290
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,063
International investigations must be carried out by government agencies

291
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,942
If this matter is reported, the people will believe the rumors.

292
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,654
Once they are in the culture medium after rumors
I heard about this again...

293
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,907
The one who was scared was the confidential archives of our laboratory

294
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,784
No one has caught these hackers so far

295
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,786
It's because the victims dare not show off

296
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,080
These hackers hope this is

297
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,252
People will believe rumors and think that our secrets are leaked

298
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,336
That's the result

299
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,592
Madam, you have an appointment in 40 minutes

300
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,597
-Where is your car?
- Yingshi, prepare the car

301
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,724
Yes, I'll prepare the car

302
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,405
Hello, my name is Jin Haosheng

303
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,490
Hello

304
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,581
Of course I will drive the car

305
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,300
Everything is ready

306
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,679
It will rain from this evening

307
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,180
I'll drive carefully

308
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,449
Oh my God, they are still making trouble?

309
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,993
Aren't they cold?

310
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,831
You might as well invite them to eat.

311
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,666
that…

312
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,668
If you invite them to eat

313
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,920
They don't know how to say bad things about you

314
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,067
(The file is unlocked)
(Representative Yin has paid the ransom)

(Representative Yin has paid the ransom)

318
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,572
He has never caused trouble in his life

319
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,283
Always busy taking care of his cow

320
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:51,164
My poor brother

321
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,919
Some of his bone fragments are still there

322
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,047
Not fully cremated

323
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,383
It's going to be ground into ashes

324

(Chief Researcher Hong Xinye)

325
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,139
-He died with his eyes closed
-Hello?

326
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,016
Director Wen, is it convenient for you to speak?

327
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,018
-Well...
-Where are you now?

328
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,563
I'm...sorry, I have to call back later

329
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,986
He did nothing wrong

330
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,370
He only knows how to work hard

331
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,792
My poor brother...

332
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,268
It's you

333
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,271
I'll talk to you before...

334
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,233
Right?

335
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,485
-right
-As sure it's right

336
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,696
I'll know

337
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,367
We've entered a big company

338
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,161
I guess big companies will provide these for free

339
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,456
This should be our identification card

340
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,378
I need a blue strap to identify the card

341
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,883
I want to hold iced American coffee with an identification card around my neck

-How old am I?
-我能叫你「耘哥」吗？

347
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,398
You look much bigger than me

348
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,442
-Yeah?
- Am I wrong?

349
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,613
I apologize to you

-Yes, Brother Yun

The key part of establishing mutual trust relationships with foreign countries

354

Your company's reputation will be damaged, and our country's reputation will be damaged

"The rumors about the culture medium are not true
I will provide scientific evidence.”

356
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,442
I thought you would reply like this today, but...

357
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,819
Are you scared?

358
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,696
And the ransom has been paid?

359
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,991
-right
- That's it's over

360
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,034
It's all over

361
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,495

362

Our lab has core technologies

363

Let's dominate the meat market

364
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,168
Think hackers are just locking files

365
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,586
No information was copied

366
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,672
It's a wishful thinking

367
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,466
What if the technology has been copied and sold?

368
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,051
You were scared two days ago

369
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,636
Then they should be caught

370
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,013
Find out where the information is leaked

371
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,600
If that's so important, why don't you call the police?

372
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,061
If I could catch them, I would have called the police long ago

373
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,648
But the reality is that we
No fraud groups who speak out can catch them

374
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,860
Prime Minister

375
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,448
Once someone exchanges cryptocurrency, he will leave a record of

376
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,742
I just need you to help find out the person who brought the

377
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,453
Or someone who intends to take the lead

378
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,124
Rumors about culture medium

379
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,167
All are true, right?

380
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,628
That's why you didn't call the police

381
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,464
No

382
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,466
Is the rumors of illegal research true?

383
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,223
If you make this assumption

384
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,434
What will the people think?

385
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,229
If I publicize the hacking event

386
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,190
How will they react?

387
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,488
You said that the reputation of BF will affect our country's reputation

388
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,159
I'm here to

389
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,120
Protect that reputation

390
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,582
Because I know you are different

391
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,294
Let's make it clear

392
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,007
You come just because you need me to show my power

393
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,385
Distract the public from the attention of BF

394
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,765
No one has ever caught the mastermind behind the ransomware

395
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,684
I hope you can be

396
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,353
The first successful politician

397
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,958
Listen

398
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,960
Why not do this

399
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,714
I'll listen carefully

400
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,810
Sorry, Representative Yin is unable to answer the phone now

401
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,896
(Emergency Center)

402
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,404
Today's rain caused many accidents

403
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,158
Fortunately, a witness rescued her in time

404
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,243
Any witnesses?

405
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,120
How did her car get out of control?

406
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,288
Witnesses did not see it

407
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,333
They only saw her car sinking completely into the water

408
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,835
That's it

409
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,641
-Go to Seoul branch
-yes

410
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,853
Your company

411
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,312
Make us in a difficult situation

412
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,732
BF makes a lot of money, but the people ask us to compensate

413
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,984
so…

414
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,610
first

415
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,197
I hope your company will donate money to the primary industry

416
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,824
As for the amount...

417
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,745
You generously paid 80 billion to those thieves

418
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,249
It should be no problem to give the same amount to my fellow countrymen

419
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,543
In the form of donating money to the government

420
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,671
What to do?

421
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,007
Come again

422
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,678
Propose evidence
Prove to the public that your culture medium is safe and sound

423
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,849
I will prove that our cultivation of meat is safe

424
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,691
You are unwilling to reveal the ingredients of the culture medium?

425
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,484
Ingredients and composition of culture medium

426
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,987
It is the core and secret of this industry

427
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,741
Revealing the content for this obstacle is suicide

428
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,534
Everyone will imitate

429
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,957
Should the people continue to live in fear?

430
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,877
You're not dominating the market by yourself

431
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,130
"We do not kill animals or emit carbon dioxide"

432
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,091
You owe those who believe and eat BF meat

433
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,303
If our culture medium is full of bacteria
The meat that absorbs it

434
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,846
It's also full of bacteria

435
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,350
They're already analyzing the meat

436
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,771
As for the money donation

437
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,398
I'll listen to it

438
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,153
So, will the Interpol pay attention to exchanges?

439
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,451
I'll tell them

440
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,040
"The first prime minister to catch a ransomware hacker"

441
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,920
It's good to get that title

442
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,679
That cunning bastard

443
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,397
Hello?

444
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,773
You call me

445
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,694
Which hospital?

446
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,030
-Who is it?
-Ms. Hong had a car accident

447
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,118
Sleet on the road
Eighty percent let her crash into the water while speeding

448
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,746
Yes, her car fell into the water at 5 pm

449
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,165
Why did it happen today?

450
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,209
Which hospital?

451
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,671
Has she lost consciousness?

452
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,299
She didn't stay in the water for too long and would wake up soon

453
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,634
-How long has she been in the water?
-I'm not sure

454
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,886
The weather is bad, the car will be pulled up tomorrow

455
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,514
We will look at the driving recorder to understand the incident

456
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,224
All right

457
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,560
-Call me if you have any problems
-good

458
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,972
(Exit BF)

459
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,371
-I park the car and go up
-You can go home

460
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,706
-I will send you to...
- See you on Monday

461
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,765
First, the laboratory system

462
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,184
Then the laboratory staff was injured

463
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,314
Everything revolves around the lab

464
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,567
Is it a threat...

465
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,029
From within the company?

466
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,451
Thank you for your hard work today

467
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,882
"She is building a safe house with the latest technology

468
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,094
And it seems that it is planned to stay in a different hotel before completion."

469
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,638
Message error

470
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,663
(Junji likes it very much. What were you doing yesterday?)

471
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,292
(When working, I'll go back to you later)

472
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,518
(Completed)

473
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,115
-None of them?
-No one

474
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,010
Ransomware blocks encryption devices and security systems

475
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,345
Confidential information cannot be transmitted

476
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,348
If North Korea is scared now, we can't stop it at all

477
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,766
Maybe they did it

478
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,562
They want us to think they are citizens X, but they are actually North Korea

479
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,646
It's indeed possible

480
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,816
But Citizen X is an existing hacker organization

481
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,651
Be prepared so they are really

482
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,905
This is a mailing to a citizen X in 2021

483
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,490
Oil Pipeline Company Profile

484
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,993
Information, format and fonts are all in line with us

485
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,411
The same file received

486
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,205
We believe that citizen X is a Russian organization

487
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,165
Russia? How to judge?

488
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,795
Not there

489
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,339
(Director Zheng Haiden)

490
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,638
What's wrong?

491
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,974
Yes, sorry, you're already asleep?

492
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,270
What's up?

493
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,647
Mr. Yu is waiting on the first floor

494
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,026
He has no identification card

495
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,237
But I'm at home now

496
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,241
All right

497
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,375
Yingshi, open the security door on the first floor

498
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,960
yes

499
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,296
Pass my number to Yu Caiyun

500
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,341
(No blood)

501
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,014
Sorry to bother you

502
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,475
There must be a reason you come

503
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,188
Citizen X attacked an oil pipeline company in 2021

504
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,522
This is the file they sent

505
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,150
This matter has never been made public

506
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,153
But the intelligence unit believes

507
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,864
Citizen X is a Russian organization

508
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,907
What is the reason?

509
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,409
They first appeared five years ago

510
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,037
At that time, their malware had a Cyrillic letter

511
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,164
They fixed that bug, but...

512
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,001
There are still clues in Russian

513
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,629
I only see English

514
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,423
Strictly speaking, it is punctuation

515
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,927
You speak Russian?

516
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,387
I've found an interpreter

517
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,809
This is a symbol table in Russian and Korean

518
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,310
According to this document

519
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,313
There are 16 punctuation marks shared by the two countries

520
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
In addition to these

521
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,609
The symbols they use are very different

522
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,949
These are quotes

523
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,659
Only Russia is using it

524
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,661
They also use this backslash very often

525
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,081
It is rarely used in other countries unless it is encoded.

526
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,582
Not to use it in sentences

527
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,254
Do you have screenshots of the scenes that were hacked?

528
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,390
Here

529
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,809
These angle brackets

530
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,561
Koreans can use it

531
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,897
Russians rarely use these symbols

532
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,816
But the most important thing is

533
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,652
There is no unique symbol in Russia here

534
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,575
This looks like the X citizen's technique

535
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:45,993
But it's not them

536
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,122
Someone pretends to be them

537
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,957
Hide your identity

538
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,379
None of my team members use external networks during work

539
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,424
We only use the internal network according to security regulations

540
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,510
In case someone

541
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,514
If you don’t pretend to be a hacker, you will get into the system?

542
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,933
Will we find out right away?

543
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,019
If they didn't pretend to be X citizens

544
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,605
Just hack into the system?

545
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,860
No, they can't be tracked

546
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,403
They are still anonymous

547
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:28,118
This gangster has worked hard to hide his identity?

548
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,706
Maybe it's someone around you, so you need to pretend

549
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,375
Because they are very familiar with you

550
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,003
Don't want to be suspicious

551
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,840
People I know

552
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,969
The person who knows me

553
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,898
English

554
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,483
yes

555
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,653
Please come to the laboratory immediately.

556
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,113
I'll call Director Xu

557
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,259
The laboratory has two hundred employees

558
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,679
There are nearly a thousand employees in total who can access the Internet

559
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,558
Director Xu is the first to know

560
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,102
I'm suspicious of the people in the company

561
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,659
They happened to be hacking in when we released a new product

562
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,578
Did they know we would be in the venue

563
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,746
Isn't anyone in the laboratory?

564
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,749
Not everyone is in the venue

565
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,667
(Wenshan)

566
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,960
If it is Director Wen...

567
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,629
If it was him

568
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,966
He will try his best to hide his identity

569
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
but…

570
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,304
Not only Wenshan

571
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,141
Can you catch a bastard who treats my culture medium as garbage?

572
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,059
They're all the same

573
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,311
They say it's full of germs

574
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,937
The news was reported

575
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,690
-They're all the same
-The closer you get, the more dangerous you are

576
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,150
I've worked hard all my life

577
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,902
Is that all acting?

578
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,739
Professor Jin robbed himself and pretended to be angry?

579
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,160
Sleet on the road
Eighty percent let her crash into the water while speeding

580
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,328
5 pm

581
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,747
Why did she speed at that time?

582
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,749
Because she received the money?

583
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,253
In that case, the first person to know that the money was remitted is...

584
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,588
I've sent out Bitcoin

585
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,633
Zheng Haiden

586
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,718
Even if she doesn't work in the lab

587
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,304
Access to the laboratory network

588
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,272
Is it really

589
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,483
One of them?

590
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,706
