Organization, scenes and events are purely fictional)

00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,960
Dominant Species

00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,679
(BL1 Laboratory)

4
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,438
So you're here

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,355
(Material storage room)

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,609
I have to go to the police station

7
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,694
Recording the incident

8
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,695
That's it

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,614
Want to go together?

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,534
No, thanks

11
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,577
They must...

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,661
(Episode 6)

13
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,996
Want to hear what you said

14
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,374
What exactly happened?

15
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,376
You should at least tell me

16
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,170
Why?

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,005
What?

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,758
Because we work together

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,803
I think I'm excluded

20
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,596
It won't happen again

21
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,848
What will not happen again?

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,560
where are you going? Representative Yin…

23
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
She's just one person

24
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,567
The other bodyguards are privately protected, so I...

25
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,739
True or fake?

26
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,075
What do you want me to do?

27
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,870
You're so stubborn

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,261
Damn, why exclude me?

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,099
I also came to work on my strength.

30
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,612
Keep your promise

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,906
You're leaving, you're lying

32
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,874
Excuse me

33
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:57,427
I just saw our first success

34
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,970
Case study on muscle fiber cultivation

35
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,600
No one would believe that the subject was originally injured and died

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,604
Thank you, thank you

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,772
It means that it did it

38
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,484
After people create new things, they will naturally want to boast

39
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,694
Especially the engineers

40
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,822
But please don't do that first

41
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,199
This is still a secret

42
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,826
-yes
-yes

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,163
You don't have to come here to say this

44
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,331
We are not children

45
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,375
I want to talk to Ms. Hong

46
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,929
What? Already ready?

47
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,014
It seems we did it

48
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,309
What do you want to talk about?

49
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,524
You must not want to hear his name again, but you two

50
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,193
Have the closest working relationship

51
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,822
Professor Jin

52
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,162
I've been thinking about it repeatedly

53
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,123
"Are what he said afterwards lies?"

54
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,000
afterwards?

55
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,836
After his wife passed away

56
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,801
「我知道你尽力了」

57
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,681
「你们都做得很好」

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,474
-Warning, EEG, EKG...
- Yingshi, open the hospital bed

59
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,142
Email cannot be measured

60
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,813
Warning, EEG, EKG
Email cannot be measured

00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,314
-100 Joule, electric shock

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,151
-200 Joule

63
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,736
electric shock

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,905
Once again, electric shock

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,369
Once again, electric shock

66
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,858
Really sorry

67
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,362
What?

68
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,659
It doesn't matter

69
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,829
I know you've tried your best

70
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,124
You all did a good job

71
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,007
Wife

72
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,634
Let's go home

73
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,308
Let's go home

74
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,314
Will he hate me since then

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,151
But he has been hiding his feelings

76
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,820
So that one day we can get revenge?

77
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,075
Because if I knew he hated me

78
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,827
I was the first to doubt him

79
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,455
Let's just argue this way

80
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,291
He asked you to perform the surgery at the beginning

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,211
But then his wife's health worsened

82
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:22,340
So based on human nature, he began to hate you

83
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,092
Even if that

84
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,053
Will he hide his feelings from the beginning?

85
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,514
Do you think he intends to take revenge?

86
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,225
Only then can the subsequent events be explained

87
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,852
He died before being arrested and failed to tell the truth

88
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,231
As a result, the public suspected that I was poisoning him

89
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,026
Do you think he committed suicide?

90
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,028
In order to complete the revenge plan?

91
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,489
But he almost never succeeded in revenge

92
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,699
You think he wants

93
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,245
Do you have as much harm as possible to you before being arrested?

94
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,081
For him, that would be a better result

95
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,291
Because that was his choice

96
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,422
But he could not foresee his fate

97
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,259
He didn't know he would be arrested after landing

98
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,969
That's why he drinks champagne

99
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,430
He is celebrating his success

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,850
If you think that's not his choice, then...

101
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,811
If he didn't want to take revenge from the beginning

102
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,980
Just changed your mind

103
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,983
He must be at some point

104
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,153
Suddenly something changed

105
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:32,034
Maybe he did something that didn't fit his personality
Or after losing your wife

106
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
Meet a new person

107
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,082
I thought

108
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,336
He is adjusting and returning to his original life

109
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,257
-He also joined the group
-What group?

110
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,925
Nothing special

111
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,262
At the beginning of last year, after his wife passed away

112
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,974
He gets off work on time at 6 o'clock every Wednesday

113
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,476
-You are going to go today too?
-What?

114
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,061
I asked him later and he said he was going to meet a group of people

115
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,606
Leave it to you here

116
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,609
Groups of cancer patients

117
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,110
That doesn't look like him

118
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,029
That's right

119
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,364
I think he must be in great pain

120
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,492
After all, he is not good at socializing

121
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,953
But that must have helped, he did get better

122
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,206
He must have made friends

123
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,832
only

124
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,834
That didn't last long

125
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,045
Are you not leaving?

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,255
-What?
-Today is Wednesday

127
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,382
-Which group party do you have
-right

128
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,886
Everyone there is a coward

129
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,471
coward?

130
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,768
I can not understand

131
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,981
How could he become so evil

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,701
I will never ask you again

133
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,745
Think of him

134
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,433
Team Leader Hong Xinye

135
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,018
What?

136
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,396
I'm not the team leader

137
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,730
Why not?

138
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,608
Since the position of the leader of the research group three is empty

139
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,487
It is natural for the chief researcher to become the team leader

140
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,031
Not taken for granted

141
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,616
Once you become the team leader

142
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,204
Your research in the basement has been successful again

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,457
Your future will be bright

144
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,426
I don't think so

145
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,971
How long will BF consider cultivating meat as a core project?

146
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,055
We don't know

147
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,766
Our IT department has indeed grown significantly

148
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,728
I'm the one who should worry about

149
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,146
Why?

150
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,232
If our company's future is in the basement

151
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,153
I might get kicked out, after all, that has nothing to do with me

152
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,531
I'm not like you guys

153
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,455
We always need someone with legal expertise

154
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,707
I'll leave first

155
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,173
It seems to be with

156
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,467
Medical related

157
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,680
As soon as you declare your culture medium is garbage
It defiles one's reputation

158
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,266
It's not me, I'm lying

159
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,392
Isn't it him?

160
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,102
They say it's full of germs

161
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,396
As soon as the news was reported, the people believed it

162
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,066
They are all the same, I have worked hard to study it for a lifetime

163
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,444
They're slandering me

164
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,405
I'm not sure

165
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,870
Yes, represent

166
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,622
I need to track an employee

167
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,127
Even if a person dies, do I need his consent?

168
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,046
-What?
-It's Jin Sheng who saved me

169
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,717
You haven't asked when he was alive

170
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,344
He started at the beginning of last year

171
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,639
I go to a place every Wednesday at 6pm

172
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,975
Please find the address and send it to Mr. Jin Haosheng

173
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,770
Mr. Jin is now in the police station

174
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,980
I just told him about the suits.

175
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,899
Got it to him now?

176
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,027
Yes, we just received the sample for the bodyguards

177
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,155
He said he would be back soon
Will you give him one at that time?

178
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,826
Are my two bodyguards close in size?

179
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,162
Yes, they will get the same size, what's wrong?

180
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,207
Both sets are given to one of them

181
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,004
What? Why do you want a bodyguard to get two sets?

182
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,048
Yingshi, location tracker

183
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,133
yes

184
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,322
I said I can't stop you from leaving

185
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,409
-You said
-but?

186
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,327
I still haven't finished my work

187
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,710
If you go to Room 503, Director Xu will give you an address

188
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,921
Jin Shin-jue's place to party with cancer friends

189
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,633
What's there?

190
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,136
Hope there is nothing

191
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,181
Where would you be when I go out?

192
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,518
I'm not going to leave this building today

193
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,189
It's safer for you to work from home

194
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,238
I'll try to move out of your house as soon as possible

195
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,575
Then my neighbor will be very sad

196
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,541
Director Xu

197
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,753
-Is it difficult for me to find?
-I've come to the right place

198
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,505
Our headquarters is like a maze

199
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,589
It doesn't matter

200
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,802
By the way, choose a suit that fits

201
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,221
May I? Free?

202
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,389
Yes, free

203
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,184
What a formal suit

204
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,522
By the way, thank you for protecting me last time

205
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,941
-I didn't even have the chance to thank you
-It doesn't matter

206
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,943
I'm just doing my duty

207
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,195
Glad you were not injured

208
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,114
Brother Caiyun has also recovered

209
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,701
By the way, this is what Deputy Yin wants to give you

210
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,869
What's up?

211
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,121
What?

212
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,919
I'm here to get the address

213
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,463
What? Did Representative Yin say it?

214
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,422
Is that one?

215
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,763
You choose a suit

216
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,691
They are prototypes, so they are a bit heavy

217
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,150
But you're optimistic

218
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,825
They can withstand most blades

219
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,160
Also bulletproof

220
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,829
Unfortunately I didn't get them earlier

221
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,458
Oh my God, it's great, Director Xu, this is great

222
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,881
They are not perfect, but you guys see

223
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,220
This is carbon fiber

224
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,474
That hiss means the bond is torn apart

225
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,020
Fiber will absorb heat instead of you

226
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,355
If this is a car

227
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,191
The car will be damaged, but it will save the life of driving

228
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,776
That's right

229
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,778
(Park Sangmin)

230
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,865
I also think BF is a meat company
I should give some meat during festivals

231
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,201
"Some" meat? We ship the meat in boxes

232
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,119
Really?

233
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,249
That's good, I have a thin brother and foot that needs meat

234
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,217
What is that address to do?

235
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,135
I'm not sure

236
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,890
Damn, I can't stand you looking down on others like this

237
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,187
You owe me an explanation
You snatch it from me

238
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,731
-「抢走」？
-Do you think I'll tell someone?

239
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,318
I'm also a bodyguard, you're not working alone

240
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,028
But I can do it alone

241
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,077
Now Representative Yin lives in your house temporarily

242
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,288
Just think I'm a little bug?

243
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,041
You really think...

244
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,554
What?

245
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:18,018
What? What are you doing? Wait a moment…

246
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,479
how so?

247
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,069
Enough, why are you two fighting?

248
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,784
He's so annoying

249
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,411
I'll complain

250
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,121
Why do you fight?

251
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,580
Is it not enough to be shot?

252
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,082
-hateful
-terribly sorry

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,293
You have a message

254
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,268
At least put on a suit and let me see how durable they are

255
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,565
Stay away from me, I can't stand you

256
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,316
You guys got away

257
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
What did you say?

258
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,028
You said I look bigger than you

259
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,071
Then can't I speak directly?

260
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,033
Oh my God, do you still remember?

261
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,118
You little-minded bastard

262
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,245
「混蛋」？「小心眼」？

263
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,789
I really shouldn't be worried about a petty bastard like you

264
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,875
I really shouldn't care

265
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,217
I've never said I think you're a worm

266
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,428
You made a conclusion and got angry

267
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,680
I don't know you're so worried

268
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,768
When they carry you away

269
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,645
You're seriously bleeding and pale

270
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,564
Who wouldn't worry about the whole night?

271
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,024
Have you been worried all night?

272
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,859
No, I didn't

273
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,407
-I'll drive the car
-Don't think about it

274
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,284
Your arm is injured, I'll do it

275
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,203
You're so embarrassed to say

276
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,831
Do you want to grab my job?

277
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,053
I heard about the fight, but you all seem to be fine

278
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,554
You are really reliable

279
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,517
Damn it

280
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,241
Why are you all here? You should be separated

281
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,828
It's OK, I'm sorry

282
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,996
represent

283
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,375
Director Zheng said you won't go out today

284
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,001
I just went to the police station

285
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,003
I know you want to change the topic

286
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,964
Feel sorry

287
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,133
We won't fight again

288
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,843
This is not a scheduled itinerary

289
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,595
Do you want to find out the news again?

290
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,098
Go to this address

291
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,183
If you can explain what it is

292
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,229
We can deploy bodyguards in advance

293
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,024
I probably won't need a bodyguard

294
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,944
The Prime Minister will have enough bodyguards

295
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,028
Prime Minister?

296
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,572
Start guiding the route

297
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,511
Dominant Species

298
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,337
I'm going to the hospital

299
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,631
-Hospital?
-I'll come back

300
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,055
He must still be in pain

301
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,906
Oh my God

302
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,243
Thank you for coming here

303
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,503
They're right, you're fine

304
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,297
right

305
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,095
I've never heard of this place

306
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,931
I come here sometimes

307
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
Enjoy the time alone

308
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,197
I know you're very busy, but you still have to eat

309
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,490
So do I

310
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,829
So I invite you to have a meal

311
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,666
Not much, but I hope you will like it

312
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,710
alright

313
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,920
Let's start

314
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,013
Does it taste ordinary?

315
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,557
Melt in the entrance

316
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,976
Because it's our meat

317
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,272
I'll tell them to use your meat

318
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,817
All dishes on this table are taken out

319
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:04,698
I promise that your table will be filled with our products in the future

320
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,036
That's good

321
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,127
After I heard about the gun battle

322
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,422
I originally wanted to go over and care about it immediately, but I don't want to bother you

323
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,760
I know that a strong woman like you will hold on
But I want to

324
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,429
"It's easier to say than to do

325
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,765
I saw someone waving his knife on the street

326
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,850
It's scary enough

327
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,604
What's more, those people shot at her

328
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,106
How could she be fine? ”

329
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,608
but

330
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,194
You just calmly promoted your own products

331
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,820
Sure enough

332
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,073
Very strong

333
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,369
I didn't expect you to have such a hobby

334
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,913
I didn't expect it either

335
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,207
I don't know if it's a hobby

336
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,250
Actually, I've never camped

337
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,503
If you go camping

338
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,672
I'll give you 100 servings of meat

339
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,219
You just think about your product

340
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,101
Do you have the only product in your heart?

341
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,895
Yes

342
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,503
Sir, you can't go in

343
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,005
It doesn't matter, wait for us

344
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,512
Please avoid it, please

345
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,352
I asked you to come to my house later, why are you here?

346
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,691
Do you know Kim Seon’s rescue?

347
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,027
I know

348
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,281
His death caused a lot of commotion. What's wrong?

349
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,743
What about ransomware?

350
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,248
You don't think I'm old?

351
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,252
I know more than anyone else what happened these days

352
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,881
What am I

353
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,176
Selected to work in BF?

354
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,930
Come

355
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,265
I have to go now

356
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,855
How do we catch those scumbags?

357
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,025
I mean Yaqi Forest

358
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,572
How dare their little gang attack you?

359
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,995
I don't know how powerful they are

360
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,498
But they are influential

361
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,334
Their technique is very bold

362
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,877
No

363
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,713
It's the time

364
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,507
No

365
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,844
I know I passed their tests and I'm asking about the process

366
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,806
With so many candidates, how could BF come to me?

367
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,643
Because you're very capable

368
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,103
Mr. President

369
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,065
Have you intervened?

370
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,110
Or is your son-in-law intervening?

371
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,490
He is not my son-in-law, he divorced my daughter

372
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,035
That is to say...

373
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,829
It was made by the Prime Minister

374
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,458
When I first visited you

375
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,126
Is he at home too?

376
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,838
I'm asking you for my decision

377
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,383
Mr. President

378
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,595
I am serving you, not the Prime Minister

379
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,807
Please don't let him know that I've been here

380
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,228
What are you talking about? I'll send you to investigate Yin Zi

381
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,316
BF hired me because before I joined

382
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,193
Someone was intimidated into their laboratory

383
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,153
In the end, Kim Son rescued his death

384
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,948
you mean

385
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,120
We killed someone to arrange for you to go in?

386
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,123
Stop talking nonsense

387
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,084
No

388
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,504
I'm just a soldier on the board

389
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,591
You said the timing is influential

390
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,093
It means you have lost a lot

391
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,347
You said you're fine, but it's not

392
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,640
Are you injured?

393
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,935
It's not me who was injured

394
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,228
Who is that?

395
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,148
Are there anyone else injured?

396
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,989
Like you said, the little gang on the other side of the world

397
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,660
Just commit a crime at the perfect time

398
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,581
It seems they know the current affairs here very well

399
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,252
What current affairs?

400
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,630
The people had doubted me

401
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,382
Save Jinsun

402
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,843
It's easy to believe that the gunfight is directed and performed by me

403
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,514
That's just a rumor

404
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,855
Do you mean there are spies?

405
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,318
Someone told the gang that now is the best time?

406
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,779
There is this possibility

407
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,491
Want to know who it is

408
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,791
Eighty-most are those criminals

409
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,251
Those who hold guns inform

410
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,129
That's it

411
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,466
you're right

412
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,719
I thought you said

413
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,180
There are criminals who are at ease

414
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,601
As the saying goes, misfortune never comes alone

415
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,938
I'm afraid I've already

416
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,525
Take up too much time, thank you for inviting me

417
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,947
-Please be careful on the way back
-Thank you, goodbye

418
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,877
He isn't coming back yet?

419
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,883
Why are you the only one?

420
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,386
What? Please get in the car

421
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,377
Hello?

422
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,378
Where are you?

423
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,923
You ask clearly

424
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,511
I called you just sent the guest. It could not be a coincidence

425
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,804
Your guest?

426
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,848
It's so disgusting, don't say that

427
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,851
What's disgusting about meeting a company representative?

428
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,606
Father

429
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,442
I said don't ask about my private affairs

430
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,320
If she were a man, would you still meet her alone?

431
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,864
Speaking of politicians, there is no wind and waves

432
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,783
You won't even let me go there

433
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,034
But let her in

434
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,119
What are you talking about?

435
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,163
She lives with the bodyguard

436
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,122
I've hung up the phone

437
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,085
He's getting more and more sloppy

438
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,386
Not very well healed

439
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,224
I believe the Prime Minister came to her

440
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,560
Is he really interested in her?

441
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,621
Who is it? Which of you told the president?

442
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,462
I remember you once crying for the death of a soldier

443
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,380
but

444
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,591
Some people don't take human lives seriously

445
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,927
Their goals

446
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,680
Is it just a threat?

447
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,181
Or do you want to destroy BF?

448
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,143
That rash bastard

449
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,494
(Result Report)

450
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,929
nothing

451
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,098
I'm afraid of

452
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,226
It's fear itself

453
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,131
How are you?

454
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,096
represent

455
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,765
represent

456
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,520
I thought you were asleep, I'm sorry to disturb you

457
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,440
You didn't disturb me

458
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,241
There is a person

459
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,953
I can hear the footsteps of soldiers 30 years ago

460
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,500
When he hid under the floor
Search for the footsteps of his soldiers

461
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,503
Who is it?

462
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,881
Military officers hunted by Nazis during World War II

463
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,094
The war ended 30 years ago

464
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,596
But he would still suddenly hear footsteps

465
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,350
He has suffered

466
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,021
Soldiers who have been training for life

467
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,109
Did he overcome the trauma later? still…

468
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,865
Even if you have been trained for a lifetime

469
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,909
Still he has to live like that?

470
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,289
He didn't explain

471
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,043
He didn't overcome it

472
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,379
I can understand

473
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:10,923
Maybe not

474
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,260
Not everyone can overcome the trauma smoothly

475
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,679
Like you

476
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,185
What did I do?

477
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,354
After the trauma occurs

478
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,566
Have the courage to face it

479
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,495
I've heard of it

480
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,413
The story of the birth of BF

481
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,380
What? Already ready?

482
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,383
It seems we did it

483
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,052
I have to talk to you

484
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,136
Wenshan told you?

485
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,221
right

486
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,060
We should really read the news, not to go to the scene

487
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,605
We've seen hell

488
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,774
Everyone present has seen it

489
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,859
Fight them so they don't climb up

490
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,779
There is also here

491
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,572
How are you?

492
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,865
Hit them with a shovel

493
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,868
Head

494
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,205
Keep beating them, over there

495
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,708
Civil servants who have been ordering pigs to beat them are like demons

496
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,380
Later I heard that he committed suicide

497
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,679
After that time, the taste of pork belly always makes us feel nauseous

498
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,848
We are very angrily professor

499
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,601
He can conduct his own epidemiological investigation

500
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,729
We don't understand why he had to bring innocent students with him

501
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,691
But leave freely...

502
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,319
Representative Yin left the university

503
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,407
She returns after two semesters

504
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,702
"Don't you want to be the perfect dominant species?"

505
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,999
This is your first sentence after you come back?

506
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,961
Don't you want to be the perfect dominant species?

507
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,382
For better or worse, humans are already top predators

508
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,427
Top of the pyramid that dominates the ecosystem

509
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,554
Humans need to eat to live

510
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,098
We have to eat creatures to survive

511
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,725
When our life

512
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,311
How can it be called perfect if you rely directly on other animals and plants?

513
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,272
She never pity animals

514
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,734
Or question our right to kill

515
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,028
Humans are imperfect dominant species

516
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,741
If you want to pursue perfection, you have to cut the chain

517
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,702
We have to leave the food chain

518
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,249
We will be in our time

519
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,168
End it

520
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,713
That's the beginning of BF

521
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,968
Volkswagen has two misunderstandings about our company

522
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,638
The first is that we just want to make money

523
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,476
If that was her goal, she would have sold the company long ago

524
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,269
Live comfortably

525
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,231
So you shouldn't have just saved your life

526
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,401
Accuse her of just trying to make more money

527
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,571
Another misunderstanding is

528
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,076
They thought it was just a matter of cultivating meat.

529
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,497
Methods to not slaughter animals and protect the environment

530
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,293
Listen, it is natural for humans to eat animals and plants.

531
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,753
But she changed that

532
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,716
Yin Zi's achievements

533
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,844
Discover ways to survive without oxygen

534
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,221
Also admirable

535
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,644
But someone outside wants to destroy her

536
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,564
In the company

537
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,484
I'm the one who misunderstood and criticizes her

538
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,237
Director Wen

539
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,033
Just debate whether to change to vegetarian food

540
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,077
He said

541
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,997
You changed the birth of human beings millions of years ago

542
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,249
The natural law that has always existed

543
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,170
If that's the beginning of it all...

544
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,092
How good should it be?

545
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,430
That way...

546
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,562
She has returned from studying abroad for less than a month

547
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,481
Loss of most brain functions

548
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,780
CJD, that is, Kuja's disease

549
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,906
Human Crazy Bovine Disease

550
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,868
They call it human savage

551
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,789
My smart sister

552
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,251
Become an old woman with dementia

553
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,964
My identical twins

554
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,427
All signs of Kuja's disease appear and slowly die

555
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,557
But the government

556
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,685
Refusing to admit that it was caused by mad bull disease

557
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,730
Some people even said

558
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:23,319
"How much beef did she eat when she was studying abroad?"

559
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,954
Why was I powerless at that time?

560
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,794
Why didn’t I express anger or scream?

561
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,756
How did I do that then

562
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,592
So indifferent?

563
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,435
sorry

564
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,230
I should have saved you

565
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,984
I shouldn't have cremated you

566
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,988
I should replace your organ

567
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,200
Fill your brain and rebirth

568
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,623
If I bury you

569
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,669
You can dig out and give you a new body

570
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,171
Give you a life

571
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,886
I miss you so much

572
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,766
I really want to be again

573
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,769
Chat with you and laugh

574
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,761
Mr. Jin will go with me tomorrow

575
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,932
Is the address given to me by Director Xu?

576
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,351
sure

577
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,777
How do you feel?

578
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,031
almost

579
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,287
Do you need new dominant species?

580
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,709
If your primary goal is to get humans out of the food chain

581
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,919
Then your secondary goal

582
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,796
Is it to make human beings immortal?

583
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,216
That's why you cultivate human organs

584
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,927
Make skin that won't age?

585
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,180
If that's what you call a new dominant species

586
00:41:56,263 --> 00:42:00,434
That means
The immortal human beings dominate other things

587
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,312
They will dominate the elderly and the patients at least

588
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,648
Those are so poor that they cannot be replaced

589
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,067
People with failed organs

590
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,531
Do you know how much it costs to raise meat at the beginning?

591
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,035
My palm-sized meat costs 300 million won

592
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,538
But see how cheap it is now

593
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,291
The same goes for human organs

594
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,919
We shouldn't limit it

595
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:30,130
Large-scale production and price wars will reduce the price

596
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,800
That means...

597
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,599
Not slaughtering animals will not make us perfect

598
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,812
We must live forever to achieve perfection

599
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,273
Humans cannot live forever

600
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,483
That would be a mistake, not a perfect

601
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,570
But if there is a way to make people

602
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,406
Don't have to endure the pain until you die?

603
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,909
Otherwise, why should I do my best to achieve first-class technology

604
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,411
Save money again?

605
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,583
First-class technology is always used

606
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,460
Build weapons

607
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,673
When I got the weapon for the first time

608
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,717
I find it surprising

609
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,636
But I realized later

610
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,598
Their purpose is to take human life

611
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,269
People invest money and technology just to kill people

612
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,774
Since there is the technology of killing people, there should be life-saving technology

613
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,320
right

614
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,822
I'll think so

615
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,200
Probably because I don't know much about science

616
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,495
The basement scene disturbs me

617
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,540
That's probably because

618
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,876
I always think that humans rely on war

619
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,754
Eat meat to survive

620
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,969
I'm just here to change my clothes

621
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,983
Thank you

622
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,319
Save my life

623
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,660
Thank you…

624
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,580
Keep me safe

625
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,397
He is Gilgamesh

626
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,607
Will you say "Gilgamesh"?

627
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,858
-Gilgamesh
-Gilgamesh

628
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,986
Gilgamesh tall and strong

629
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,325
What were you teaching just now?

630
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,202
I told the story of Gilgamesh

631
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,578
「吉尔伽美什」？

632
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,081
He is the hero in mythology

633
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,127
After many hardships, he
Finally got it to make him rejuvenate

634
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,712
The herb of immortality

635
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,131
But it was eaten by a snake

636
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,758
The kids go crazy when they hear it

637
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,261
They said he should eat the herb right away

638
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,807
Then he should eat the snake

639
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,851
-What?
-Snake Soup

640
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,187
Will that work?

641
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,444
What happened to him?

642
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,030
Want to know

643
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,582
Jin Shin can't save him

644
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,753
"I hate BF" at the support group gathering

645
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,296
I want to take revenge on Representative Yin”

646
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,716
We can't find any clues

647
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,803
Who knows? Anyone who has worked with him for many years said

648
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,805
His temperament suddenly changed drastically

649
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,933
you're right

650
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,687
His attempt to drown his colleague is proof

651
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,860
Do group members think he is an outsider?

652
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,031
That's why that old man got out of control?

653
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,657
Maybe someone affected him

654
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,869
Hopefully none of these are the reasons

655
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,622
I hope it's a heart disease

656
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,501
-Oh my God, this is so heavy
-What?

657
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:40,172
Is this suit so heavy?

658
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,011
(Welfare Service Center)

659
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,655
Hello

660
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,867
Are you Mr. Kim Shin-shun?

661
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,078
After his mother passed away, he started to come here

662
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,997
He said this place gave him a lot of comfort

663
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:20,212
He's about to see me

664
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,674
Has he talked about me?

665
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,261
Of course, he has mentioned it on many occasions

666
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,513
His son living in the United States

667
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,474
I can't believe he will commit suicide

668
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,064
-Feel sorry
-I was also shocked when I saw the news

669
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,609
I haven't known him for long

670
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,112
But I know he is a good person

671
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,247
Did he say anything strange?

672
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,958
Did he appear impatient at the party?

673
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,794
He is my uncle

674
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,004
So, hello

675
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,842
This kid

676
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:12,681
Just can't understand
How could his father make such a decision

677
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,602
Nothing special

678
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,980
In fact, he didn't talk much

679
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,399
What about his friend?

680
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,943
He told me he made a friend

681
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,862
-friend?
-right

682
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,242
He often talks to a gentleman

683
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,330
I want to ask him about my father's affairs

684
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,582
Can you give me his phone number?

685
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,875
Oh my God

686
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,670
We cannot provide other people's phone numbers

687
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,424
I will tell him that it was given to me by my father, not you

688
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,635
Excuse me

689
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,637
-but…
-You kid

690
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,933
When your father was alive, you should see him more

691
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,354
What about you? What did you do?

692
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,941
I'm your uncle

693
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,987
My uncle...

694
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,365
My uncle

695
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,993
Who said that my uncle cannot visit his sister's husband?

696
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,912
He is your brother-in-law

697
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,163
Am I wrong?

698
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,916
-etc
-They will come to visit you too

699
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,293
-etc
-Yes, are you serious?

700
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,462
Listen, there's no need to quarrel

701
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,466
Big sister

702
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,177
Sister, I beg you

703
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,261
Please tell me

704
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,181
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

705
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,478
We should not provide address

706
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,563
What's his name?

707
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,192

710
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,245
May I ask

711
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,914
Is there a Mr. Park Sangmin here?

712
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,249
Park Sangmin?

713
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,166
No

714
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,586
Is this Room 101, Haijing Building?

715
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,673
Yes, this is Room 101, Haijing Building

716
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,757
Thanks

717
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,137
Didn’t she say this is his address?

718
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,851
Even if it is the company address, there is no

719
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,144
A person named Park Sang Min

720
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,313
He was suspicious if he didn't answer the phone

721
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,652
By the way, you only wear one headphone

722
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,947
-Is it popular?
-Do you think so?

723
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,251

I've seen that black sedan

728
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,366
