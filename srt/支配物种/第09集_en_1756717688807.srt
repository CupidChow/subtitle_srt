Dominant Species

3
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,508
Don't tell me you...

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,470
Go home now

5
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,597
(Recent calls)
(son)

6
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,566
I'm very happy to see you, I'm Yu Caiyun

7
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,737
Is there anything wrong?

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,405
I've been waiting for you

9
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,951
I have something to report to you, it is related to the Prime Minister's request

10
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,162
(Episode 9)

11
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,248
Lingzun probably only tells you

12
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,086
He wants to visit a base that was originally a battlefield

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,092
And you inform your ex-husband

14
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:38,389
Sorry, you did not inform him or report him

15
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,141
You just didn't think too much

16
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,522
You've been married for 40 years
It's normal to talk about these things

17
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,903
Ling Zun and Zunfu are the two closest people you are

18
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,281
You're just telling your husband

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,909
But dozens of deaths

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,332
You've decided it was him

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,709
Divorce him

22
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,338
This is my current conclusion

23
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,008
If I say it wrong, please let me know

24
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,308
You've made all mistakes

25
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,730
I lost a fellow comrade in that incident

26
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,525
Yeah?

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,444
It's a pity

28
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,574
I swear by his body

29
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,288
I will definitely punish the mastermind behind the scenes, no matter who it is

30
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,916
If it's not President Xianyu

31
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,169
Please

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,963
Please tell me I'm wrong

33
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,009
Because I have to go

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,469
Conforming my promise

35
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,320
Didn’t my son send you here?

36
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,656
He would never do that

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,494
You can confirm with him

38
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,958
Did you send him? Did you really tell him?

39
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,793
Did he say that?

40
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,004
What I told him?

41
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,840
I've only told you, so if it's not you...

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,927
I hope you have a good talk with him

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,095
"Talk him a good talk"?

44
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,557
What benefits do you want to get from this?

45
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,770
I hope you find peace in your heart

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,273
I know you did it for me

47
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,070
For my sake, tell him the truth

48
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,823
-slaughter
-The head of the ministry is waiting for me

49
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,450
I'll call you later

50
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,378
Mother?

51
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,879
Don't turn on the lights

52
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,179
What happened this time? What did my father do

53
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,391
Making you so sad?

54
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,562
Did he not make a show this time, but did he find true love?

55
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,315
I'm going to kill him

56
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,320
That would be a waste, you have tolerated him for so long

57
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,201
Mother

58
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,495
mom

59
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,042
Did he hit you?

60
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,794
is that so?

61
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,846
I think it's your father

62
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,433
I think he is the messenger

63
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,185
What did he do?

64
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,815
I wanted to divorce him at that time

65
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,899
mom

66
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,695
So I'm collecting evidence

67
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,953
Sorry, the security measures are tight and it is difficult to take good photos

68
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,834
I want him to panic and put him in trouble once

69
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,669
But that won't be public...

70
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,548
Because I will be humiliated, too

71
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,177
But that man

72
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,638
Too shameless

73
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,143
What did you see on his phone?

74
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,479
When did you first see "TATP"?

75
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,440
Before or after the attack?

76
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,649
I don't remember

77
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,318
Are you sure it is TATP?

78
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,820
You're such a crazy woman

79
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,864
How could you say that to me?

80
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,866
Even if you are frightened, you can't talk nonsense

81
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,369
How can you accuse me of trying to kill your father?

82
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,414
I saw it, you can't deceive me

83
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,042
So you're really crazy

84
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,503
Yes, I've searched

85
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,715
Some media say that explosives are made of TATP

86
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,175
So I'm very curious

87
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,802
My father-in-law is injured

88
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,389
Shouldn't I care about the explosives that hurt him?

89
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,811
You always look down on me, do you think I didn't look at the date?

90
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,440
The search happened before the attack, before my father was injured

91
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:45,363
Can you foresee the future? That's why you searched for it in advance?

92
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,656
Who looks down on you?

93
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,117
You are my wife, why should I do that?

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,868
But that's what you are

95
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,122
You don't respect me at all

96
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,959
So you never bother to cover up those affairs

97
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,294
Hello, which president has no affair?

98
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,298
Those wives didn't say they were looked down upon

99
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,219
You're just insecure
Because you think you should have special treatment

100
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,221
Don't think about changing the topic

101
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,392
It's you, you are the mastermind behind the terrifying attack

102
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,018
When?

103
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,564
Tell me when you checked my phone when you saw it

104
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,648
Give me evidence

105
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
I've seen it

106
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,111
evidence

107
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:30,074
He said I was frightened, so I got the date wrong

108
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,871
The more I listened to his argument

109
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,331
The more he convinced

110
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,754
Now I don't know if I'm looking at his phone

111
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,259
It was before or after the terrorist attack

112
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,577
Do you often look at other people’s phones?

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,081
No, I said, I was going to get a divorce

114
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,542
You even do that after the attack?

115
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,339
Lingzun has lost his legs, but you still

116
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,757
Searching for divorce?

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,674
I…

118
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,598
It is more convenient to distort your memory

119
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,476
If you look at his phone after the attack

120
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,063
It means your ex-husband did not attack Ling Zun

121
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,106
You have not covered up the culprit either

122
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,821
You are for the

123
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,616
You don't want the man...

124
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,742
You're very busy

125
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,329
There is a father who took dozens of lives

126
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,707
Will that make you easier?

127
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,420
If I forget about this, will everything get better?

128
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,140
TATP is often used in terrorist attacks

129
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,979
But most people have never heard of it

130
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,648
Except for two kinds of people

131
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,069
Those who suppress and promote terrorism

132
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,782
And you already know the president...

133
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,910
Which side did you choose

134
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,001
Yes before

135
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,128
Yes

136
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,339
Before the terrorist attack

137
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,698
Are you coming soon?

138
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,701
Where are you?

139
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,377
sorry

140
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,256
We should shift our goals

141
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,760
I want to meet President Xianyu's ex-wife

142
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,888
You really...

143
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,183
So you know everything

144
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,693
Father

145
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,288
My son did not shelter his father's sins

146
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,916
He just refused to believe me

147
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,462
You have an explanation
What did you see on his father's phone?

148
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,882
But he doesn't believe me

149
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,802
It's normal, because it's his father

150
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,222
So slaughter is innocent

151
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,905
Dominant Species

152
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,178
Who are you?

153
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,724
Hello, I am...

154
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,896
My name is Wenshan, I am from BF Company

155
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,984
Sorry, but...

156
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,071
What else do you want? Do you want me to jump off the building, too?

157
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,615
Get out of here

158
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,378
Sorry, sorry, but...

159
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,255
Even animals have conscience

160
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,301
Even my brother is dead, you haven't come, I'm going to call the police

161
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,807
I did go to the funeral home

162
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,143
I'm not saying how good I'm doing

163
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,520
I saw you at that time

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,315
That's why I'm here

165
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:01,113
One of our employees died and he was killed

166
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,660
And we think the murderer knows you

167
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
how? Are you accusing me of killing?

168
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,082
I did not mean that

169
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,170
You may know a woman named Zheng Haiden?

170
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,758
You see, simply put, she is an accomplice

171
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,635
I think she knows you

172
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,514
That's too much, are you really accusing me?

173
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,935
We do not think you have anything to do with this matter

174
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,187
Wait, there is

175
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,524
Do you recognize this man?

176
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,984
-They are co-conspirators
-What?

177
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,403
You know him, right?

178
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,659
How did BF employees know our pastor?

179
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,868
priest?

180
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,330
It turns out that's his cover-up

181
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,874
What's the meaning?

182
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,335
Can you contact him?

183
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,466
What do you mean by concealment?

184
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,885
Because he is a murderer

185
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,847
What are you talking nonsense?

186
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,808
Can you contact him? He's been missing these two days

187
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,436
He may be busy

188
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,230
He killed someone and escaped

189
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,816
Sister, where does he live?

190
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,835
(Bozheng Police Department)
(Jin Tongjin)

191
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,920
(Mingshan Hospital)

192
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,220
Mother

193
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,848
It's a slaughter

194
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,765
Is he okay?

195
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,353
I heard he was hospitalized last night

196
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,065
Yes, he woke up at night later

197
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,611
You should call me, not handle it alone

198
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,326
He doesn't know you know...

199
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,705
He doesn't know I've told you

200
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,041
Just keep it like this

201
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,852
How do you feel?

202
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,438
Have you eaten it?

203
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,274
Have to eat to restore

204
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,743
Captain Yu

205
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,039
Do you want to call him?

206
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,123
right

207
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:13,973
What is that?

208
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,350
Pain relief needle

209
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,901
He had a pain in his back all night

210
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,112
Thanks

211
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,954
By the way, aren't you busy?

212
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,539
I have a free time

213
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,220
Grandpa

214
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:55,931
Grandpa

215
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,146
Why do you want to meet Captain Yu?

216
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:03,981
Is he here?

217
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,943
Bring him

218
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,826
Grandpa

219
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,371
Do you have something to tell him?

220
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,957
never mind

221
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,709
I'll transfer it for you

222
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,296
Forget it, just...

223
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,847
Just cover up all this, Captain Yu

224
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,060
Living is hard enough

225
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,564
You should spend your days peacefully, too

226
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,820
The more you reveal, the ugly the situation becomes

227
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,283
Let go of all this

228
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,703
Don't you want to take revenge?

229
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,540
You finally found the mastermind behind the scenes

230
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,381
If that child finds out

231
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,302
What would his father think of his evil deeds?

232
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,890
Your grandson?

233
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,727
That must be too

234
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,773
It hurts his mother very much

235
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,781
I can rest after I die

236
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,700
no

237
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,621
You have to get everything you deserve

238
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,290
You finally achieved your lifelong goal

239
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,960
But he had to step down because of losing his legs

240
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,129
No politicians speak for you yet

241
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,630
You are the founding leader of the party

242
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,549
Grandpa

243
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,718
Grandpa

244
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,211
sorry

245
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,767
Are you leaving?

246
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,902
good

247
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,071
You may not be able to visit him today

248
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,366
Are there any restrictions? Who restricts it?

249
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,828
No one restricts it, it's the prisoner who doesn't want to see you

250
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,417
In this way...

251
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,551
Can you make this

252
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,345
Leave it to him?

253
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,814
(I know who you are afraid and who should you be afraid of)

254
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,867
You're also a victim

255
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,704
You only knew it was a terrifying attack after the explosion occurred

256
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,216
don't want

257
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,760
You only knew that when you got home that night

258
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,346
Your family is in danger

259
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,765
-Righten your hand high
-I am a terrorist

260
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,851
You're back to the base before midnight

261
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,186
And surrender

262
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,815
「我是恐怖分子」

263
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,291
Please don't, don't hurt my family

264
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,709
I'm a terrorist

265
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,544
「我是恐怖分子」

266
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,838
「我很引以为傲」

267
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,172
Please don't...

268
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,301
You said you were proud

269
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,052
don't want

270
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,015
Even if you are frightened, force yourself to say that

271
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,478
Terrorists already knew the president would visit

272
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:58,233
They are eyeing you because you can enter and exit the base

273
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,610
Is it someone you know?

274
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,240
Are you a villager?

275
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,331
That piece of paper

276
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,835
You said you know who I should be afraid of

277
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,754
You don't know, right?

278
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,591
Why do you think I don't know?

279
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,926
Because I think the terrorists are villagers?

280
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,804
But they are not the leader

281
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,807
Even you don't know

282
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,518
Who is the real mastermind behind the scenes

283
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,109
They won't reveal to the little scapegoat

284
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,405
It's fresh

285
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,117
Dawson Group boss

286
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,998
Even if you only hear his name now

287
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,750
But you must know what happened to him

288
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:01,338
Clues pointing to him
Or whatever you hear or see

289
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,512
If I can protect your family, I can guarantee

290
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,305
What about their safety?

291
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,683
Are you willing to speak?

292
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,193
My intuition tells me that this is our last chance

293
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,695
You'll be in jail for the rest of your life

294
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,531
I'll be trapped in my own cage

295
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,294
He told me

296
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,257
After I arrived in Korea, my tone would be tighter

297
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,134
He said I can't get out of him

298
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,052
「他」？

299
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,807
It's my cousin

300
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,019
Once I accidentally mentioned the location of the military camp

301
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,648
We had a drink at that time

302
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,358
He is my cousin after all

303
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,236
I told him where the barracks are

304
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,364
The location of the command center?

305
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,284
He said I wasn't safe in Korea.

306
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,871
Because the mastermind behind the scenes is the most powerful person in South Korea

307
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:20,417
He is also the richest person in South Korea

308
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,711
As long as I'm obedient

309
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,756
My family and his family can live a good life

310
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,925
Your cousin tells you

311
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,180
The leader is a Korean, and you still force you to take all the responsibilities?

312
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,902
I've recorded all our conversations

313
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,195
Do you understand?

314
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:56,328
But without your permission, I won't use it.

315
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,920
We'll see you again soon

316
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,595
(Visiting Room)

317
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,030
You're here

318
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,031
right

319
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,953
Wake up, you're not here to take a nap

320
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,375
Miss Zheng

321
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,138
She has a pulse, but she doesn't breathe

322
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,933
She might be pretending

323
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,269
Yingshi, when did Zheng Haiden stop breathing?

324
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,480
It has been 4 minutes and 16 seconds since her last breathing

325
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,856
Let her go

326
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,152
Jiang Yingshi, let her go

327
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,199
Jiang Yingshi, showing her life signs

328
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,164
Don't move, no

329
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,961
Don't come over, don't follow me

330
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,630
I'll kill her, don't come with me

331
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,883
Don't follow me or I'll kill her the fuck

332
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,511
-You can't leave
-Stop nonsense

333
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,722
-The doors are locked
-Yeah?

334
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,434
Then I'll kill her, come on

335
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,186
You should know

336
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,523
You are a doctor, you should know what will happen if I stab you here

337
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,025
Open the door quickly

338
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,070
Do you think I dare not do it? Fuck it open the door

339
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,865
Jiang Yingshi, open a safe area

340
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,170
Open the car door, hurry up

341
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,421
Jiang Yingshi, open the car door

342
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,682
Step on the accelerator, fuck it to the bottom

343
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,603
No, stop

344
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,439
Stop, no, stop

345
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,482
Stop

346
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,569
Jiang Yingshi, lock the door

347
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,372
Get up quickly

348
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,168
Wait here

349
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,938
I'm in front of the Seoul branch of BF
All reporters came here to ask Representative Yin
I'm in front of the Seoul branch of BF
All reporters came here to ask Representative Yin

350
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,775
-The content announced yesterday...
-BF has not made any other announcements

351
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,444
They seem to have fully demonstrated their position

352
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,988
-We believe that Representative Yin…
-Her transplant surgery...

353
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,908
-The experiment will be started soon
- BF's opening price hits a new low

354
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,744
People have high hopes for the organ transplant industry

355
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,956
- That's priceless
-BF is a one-person company

356
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,792
Deputy Commander of the company and Research Director Wen Shan

357
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,378
Low-key style, different from Yin's representative

358
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,463
Transplantation will not happen

359
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,381
Who are you?

360
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,759
I am Wen Shan, Research Director of BF

361
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,302
-Wenshan?
- Director?

362
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,470
He is the director

363
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,472
Please express your opinion

364
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,016
Does Representative Yin really do experiments?

365
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,686
Why did she do that?

366
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,148
BF will not perform the surgery on Representative Yin

367
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,816
Is that announcement a lie?

368
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,569
-Why change your mind?
-Have you successfully cultivated your organs?

369
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,363
Yes, what she announced is true

370
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,742
BF has successfully cultivated human organs

371
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,287
And we are using top AI technologies

372
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,331
To improve the accuracy and success rate of transplantation

373
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,877
Representative Yin voluntarily became the first test subject

374
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,005
Just to save critically ill people

375
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
As for me personally

376
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,721
I totally understand why she made that decision

377
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:28,975
But as her friend and doctor for many years, I cannot allow it

378
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,479
Does it mean that she decided without consulting the staff?

379
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,607
No, that's not what I want to say

380
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,817
I'm just against this experiment

381
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,195
Because I want to continue working with her

382
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,782
She has been working hard since she was 20 years old

383
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:48,369
Create a world where humans do not have to eat creatures

384
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,872
So she created the cultivation of meat

385
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,168
As a scientist, I look forward to seeing

386
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,962
Other achievements she can achieve

387
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,257
She is a very important person for us humans and BF

388
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,135
So the experiment won't happen, we won't do it

389
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,689
(Representative Yin)
(Missed call)

390
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,114
Tell them you will hire a new research director

391
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,909
You want to take the lead

392
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,913
Tell them that you fired me because I was disobedient
The surgery will be delayed

393
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,959
I know why you said that

394
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,670
Writing a blank check is better than risking your life

395
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,507
It seems I did something meaningful

396
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,260
That will make you a low-key person take action

397
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,845
I don't want to take action

398
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,429
I found out the murderer

399
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,515
The one who killed Jin Haosheng?

400
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:55,353
His name is Chi Shunyuan, 39 years old
The police compared his fingerprints...

401
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,479
Then what?

402
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,774
His identity card looks different

403
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,568
Representative Yin

404
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,695
Jiang Yingshi, open the door

405
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,779
yes

406
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,824
He may have had plastic surgery, but his fingerprints cannot be changed

407
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,119
Where did you find fingerprints?

408
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,163
Professor Jin is not the only one who has been brainwashed by him

409
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,874
The person who fell in your car

410
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,751
He pretended to be a pastor and approached him

411
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,422
Then he wins him over, just like he wins over Professor Jin

412
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,550
After he gained the trust of the farmer
Obviously this is often said

413
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,302
"The government is out of salvation

414
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,430
Relying on farmers to stop Yin Zi

415
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,766
I, a pastor, have no choice but to stop her? ”

416
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,811
He pushed the farmer

417
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,772
He also killed Kim Ho-sung and Professor Kim

418
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,735
Dawson is the mastermind behind the scenes

419
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,821
Those bastards

420
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,199
The same goes for Yazoran

421
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,537
Xianyugen planned a terrorist attack

422
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,250
Rampant asshole

423
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,548
What if they found out and caught that person first?

424
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,595
BF discovered his location earlier than you

425
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,056
If the police hadn't told me, you wouldn't have known

426
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,349
But you still betray me

427
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,395
I'm just giving an example, the point is

428
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,815
I have to confirm the hotel's monitor screen to know

429
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,234
Where did that person go after he left

430
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,737
So I need a reason

431
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,907
You have the greatest power, ask the police to obtain the video

432
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,951
Should I say that?

433
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,619
"My father and I already know

434
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,497
Which hotel is the murderer who killed BF bodyguards?

435
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,625
Which room, please let us see the picture”?

436
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,251
Would they be disobedient?

437
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,922
Why do I have to use a monitor
Have you ever recorded an excuse for my affair to ask for a video?

438
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,216
If you don't cooperate, think of your own

439
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,095
You should have known before I spoke

440
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,847
When did the murderer escape?

441
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,351
Does the Prime Minister want to take revenge?

442
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,897
Because it was his father, he avenged his grandfather before avenging his grandfather.

443
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,357
Must be confirmed carefully?

444
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,025
That's why he monitored me?

445
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,319
See if I found more evidence?

446
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,781
If Xianyugen is indeed guilty

447
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,700
I'll expose him

448
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,038
What if the Prime Minister wants to kill you for silence?

449
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:23,960
Then he would have died long ago
Now we are the only two of us here

450
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,754
The Prime Minister did not stop me from visiting the prison

451
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,632
I also know I've talked to his mother

452
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,094
Then he should guess where I will go next

453
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,222
What I care most about is...

454
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,891
Didn’t my son send you here?

455
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,811
You can confirm with him

456
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:47,358
If her son intervenes, she will keep her mouth shut as if she is

457
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,068
Why didn't he stop her?

458
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,987
Although the line is different

459
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,574
But they must also want to know who the mastermind is behind the scenes

460
00:33:55,658 --> 00:34:00,246
That's the most reasonable explanation she gave to you

461
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,417
He searched for explosive material before attacking

462
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,503
In court, that fact was very unfavorable to him

463
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,050
Xian Yuzai is not a person who can share intelligence

464
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,301
But what did he share?

465
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,305
He doesn't want to frame someone

466
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:23,853
He seems to want the whole world to know
Who is the real terrorist

467
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,607
What are the benefits of his exposure of his father?

468
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,858
What about Zheng Haiden?

469
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:30,860
What did she say?

470
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,529
Why is she silent at this time?

471
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,740
She knows only a limited amount

472
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,000
It's not your style to speak to others

473
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,168
I didn't speak for her

474
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,255
I'll take care of my people
Just concentrate on stopping that crazy woman

475
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,093
She promised to perform free surgery on patients after her surgery

476
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,302
But that's only a few hundred people

477
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,681
If she succeeds, she will open up a brand new market

478
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,435
Even I can't predict how much demand will be

479
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,354
That will change the entire business community

480
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,857
Can you imagine BF surpassing Dawson?

481
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:18,116
Do you need to worry about Dawson's situation?

482
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,036
The focus is not on the growth of the organ transplant industry

483
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,584
You think people will replace their old cars first

484
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,419
Or an aging organ?

485
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,090
Nothing is more important than a new organ

486
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,719
if…

487
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,140
I'll get the sample for you?

488
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,436
Can Dawson do it too?

489
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,693
If I help you get the BF cultivation organ

490
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,071
What about all the samples?

491
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,953
If you do that, you can only bring Yin Ziyi.

492
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,415
She said she would replace all her organs

493
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,916
If you bring her

494
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,919
We can get all the organs

495
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,588
Do you want to do this?

496
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,715
If I get them...

497
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,847
Can Dawson do it too?

498
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,435
Must do it

499
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,022
Those things will never go out of date

500
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,868
When did you decide to accompany Li Wenkui on a visit?

501
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,039
About a week ago

502
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,749
So suddenly?

503
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,168
When did Xian Yugen's ex-wife look at his mobile phone?

504
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:57,548
She said it was about two months before the visit

505
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,176
Before I was selected

506
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,764
The Blue House suddenly invited me, so I checked it

507
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,767
They were going to lead the President Kim Dong-seok who was too solemn

508
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,560
Who changes the plan?

509
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,562
I want to know who it is, too

510
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,565
He found a lump in his body

511
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,402
Is it Dawson again?

512
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,821
- Probably not
- Then why?

513
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,491
If the terrifying attack

514
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,161
The goal is not you, it will make people feel at ease

515
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,122
Why did Xian Yugen hurt his father-in-law?

516
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,290
No good for him

517
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,670
That's not something we can tell

518
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,880
We just need to find out the connection

519
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,216
Yazoran's incident was a massacre

520
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,218
Kim Ho-sung was also killed

521
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,888
If Dawson can be proved to be the initiator, it is worth fighting

522
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,225
I can finally subdue fresh roots

523
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:53,896
The problem is that we only know that Dawson is all about it

524
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,817
Director Wen, we have to prove that Dawson arranged Director Zheng to come in

525
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,987
We also have to prove that Xian Yuzai ordered her

526
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,614
Helping Mr. Yu to admit it, there is another thing

527
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,741
We need Xianyugen or his son

528
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,785
Evidence of telling the murderer and helping him escape

529
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,330
She must give it the connection

530
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,835
Xian Yugen's ex-wife lied because of resentment

531
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,713
Kiel also lied for what he hadn't done

532
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,007
We have to prove this...

533
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,924
Wait a moment

534
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,802
Director Zheng had a car accident

535
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,263
-But she was tied up...
-What's the meaning?

536
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,392
She tried to escape? How did she loosen her?

537
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,895
OK, I'll go there right away

538
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,690
She bumped into the door and is now in the hospital

539
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,774
Is she okay?

540
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,152
They don't know yet, I'll call you

541
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,625
How much coffee did you drink today?

542
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,793
Five cups

543
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,215
Kiel's cousin is the one who wants him to take responsibility

544
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,261
It also mentioned that the richest and most powerful person in South Korea is the mastermind behind the scenes.

545
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,432
We must find his cousin

546
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,817
We have to track down his money flow, but the problem is

547
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,737
This may all be in the Prime Minister's plan

548
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,285
We need to take action to know

549
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,621
Where is his cousin?

550
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,332
Living in Dubai with family

551
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,585
Go find him and I will notify the Dubai branch

552
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,050
As long as you keep a promise, I'll go

553
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,345
Don't worry, I'll take care of Manzhi

554
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,180
Before I come back

555
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,557
Please don't undergo surgery

556
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,190
Anyway, it will take time

557
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,859
I'm not in a hurry at all

558
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,487
-The medical team must also prepare...
-Please promise me

559
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,617
Go and prepare

560
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,453
I'll ask them to book the earliest flight

561
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,296
I promise you

562
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,717
I'll wait until you come back

563
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,791
I don't want them to know that something happened to BF again

564
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,586
So I said it seemed the car suddenly accelerated

565
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,172
I didn't mention BF at all

566
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,801
But I have to tell the police the truth

567
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,429
Where is Miss Hong? Is she okay?

568
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,849
Fortunately, she was going to come with me

569
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,976
But she said the doctor saw her wound

570
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,312
Will doubt our statement

571
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,981
So she chose not to come

572
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,735
I haven't left for long

573
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,862
How can I trust you?

574
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,490
terribly sorry

575
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,496
I didn't expect she had a weapon

576
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,207
She carved plastic products

577
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,459
That stupid guy Zheng Haiden

578
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:44,960
plastic?

579
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,505
Yes, plastic spoon

580
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,257
When did she get it?

581
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,801
Director Wen, I...

582
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,015
Compared to her flesh wounds

583
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,185
The doctor is more worried about her brain damage

584
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,483
Director Wen

585
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,027
Representative Yin is already exhausted

586
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,447
Can you speak tactfully to her?

587
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,243
Of course, I will

588
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,204
Thanks

589
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,715
Zheng Haiden didn't even go home?

590
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,676
Nothing at once?

591
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,720
Keep watching

592
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,850
Did she run away?

593
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,478
Or was arrested?

594
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,530
(Punishment of the murderer Yin Zi)

595
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,274
(Yu Caiyun)
(I'm leaving)

596
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,568
Yingshi, read the brief message

597
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,029
"I'm leaving"

598
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,834
(I'm leaving)

599
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,176
(Yin Zi's surprise declaration caused controversy)

600
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,012
(Research Director says BF has successfully trained organs
But clinical trials are too early)

601
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,308
(Petitioning for mocking critical illness and terminally ill patients punished BF)

602
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,067
(Latest news)

603
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,237
Today we are going to have the first meeting to add budgets

604
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,614
But you didn't mention the meeting

605
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,243
This is my answer to your question

606
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:08,330
Can save Yin's representative such a precious person
Makes me feel very relieved

607
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,583
Besides, I don't know that it's the research director's personal behavior

608
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,295
Or he had already talked to Representative Yin

609
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,007
But he doesn't want to do it that it may cause the society

610
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,720
A strong impact is a decision worthy of respect

611
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,806
However, whatever their decisions about the surgery

612
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,685
BF has made illegal plans...

613
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,187
-You're still embarrassed to say
- So it must be accepted

614
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,439
The investigation of the investigation...

615
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,066
You're much worse than me

616
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,446
I have the right to act illegally against BF
Issued a search and seizure order

617
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,073
I will confiscate all evidence and related technology

618
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,120
Please wait until I come back before undergoing surgery

619
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,588
Please come to see me by the PR manager

620
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,133
Please promise me

621
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,930
(Director Xu)

622
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,600
I'll be back soon

623
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,768
good

624
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,896
We don't have to worry anymore

625
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,273
Representative Yin just announced

626
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,445
She wants the top organ transplant doctor in China

627
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,739
She asked the exact number of doctors

628
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,949
It can be seen that she had this plan very early

629
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,495
But the problem is that the surgery is between the doctors

630
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,121
It also sparked controversy

631
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,999
The most famous doctors are tenured professors

632
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,627
Who would risk being criticized to assist?

633
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,755
If it fails
Their social and professional status will not be guaranteed

634
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,049
That's definitely a shame

635
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,384
But what if they succeed?

636
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,931
In that case, they should all win the Nobel Prize

637
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,474
But who wants to get

638
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,268
Will the presidents of the Transplant Medicine Society come?

639
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,436
(Park Shin-young)
(President of Transplant Medicine Association)

640
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,606
Why didn't you try to persuade her to give up?

641
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:01,318
How to persuade? She will never listen to me

642
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:06,240
So you have to stand by and watch? Let her perform surgery?

643
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,117
If we succeed, everything will be fine

644
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,118
What?

645
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,497
If successful, this will be the greatest thing

646
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,417
This will be a new achievement and we will be respected

647
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,380
If anyone among us has an accident
We will do the same

648
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,131
That's just a hypothesis

649
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,384
OK? Don't be stupid...

650
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,927
Representative Yin called me

651
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,267
He was so happy about this

652
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,158
Miss Hong brings the doctors here

653
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,910
We're ready, representative

654
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,912
Director Zheng hasn't recovered his consciousness yet?

655
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,583
Yes, she hasn't woken up yet

656
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,170
But I think she's just pretending to be asleep

657
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,678
Is there a way to pretend her voice?

658
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,682
Use the instructions she gave to Jiang Yingshi?

659
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:19,771
You asked if we can
Create her voice with existing information?

660
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:24,484
Yes, let her speak as we want
It seems to be in a conversation

661
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,197
What do you want her to say?

662
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,535
goodbye

663
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,458
goodbye

664
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,047
-Please send them out
-yes

665
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,175
Hello, what's the matter?

666
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,678
who?

667
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,685
He is not in Korea?

668
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,063
Where is he going?

669
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:08,528
good

670
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,410
-What's up?
-We've gone in

671
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,579
(Cracked encoding)

672
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,050
A new firewall appears immediately, but we go in

673
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,093
Do they have any movement?

674
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,260
No

675
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,847
We pretended to be theirs and deceived them

676
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,349
good

677
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,236
Yes, Prime Minister

678
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,612
BF

679
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,573
Yes, BF, what should we do?

680
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,036
Captain Yu is not in Korea now, he is going to Dubai

681
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,206
Start searching and seizure

682
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,968
