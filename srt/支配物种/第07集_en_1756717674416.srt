00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,960
Dominant Species

00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,878
(Previous summary)

4
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,963
Please welcome those who turn the impossible into the possibility

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,631
BF's Yin Zi Representative

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,759
I have a dream

7
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,220
I assure you all, all kinds of cereals and grain crops

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,638
We will all be successfully trained

9
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,183
Don't repeat the same mistakes, that shouldn't have happened at all

10
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,061
Go to find Yin Zi
Become her deputy and gain her trust

11
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,271
-What's this?
-They want us to follow instructions

12
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,439
Decrypt the file

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,317
I hope you are the person we need

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,485
You know Citizen X

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,614
Someone pretends to be them and hides their identity

16
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,282
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

17
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,867
Search for Yu Caiyun

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,202
Then why are you hiding it from me?

19
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,454
I don't think it's necessary to mention the past

20
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,414
I don't even know if it's a good thing for us to reunite

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,793
The insider should not keep his mouth shut

22
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,712
Ransomware may be tricked

23
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,464
Is Professor Jin going to another place?

24
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,341
Find Jin Shin-sun to save immediately

25
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,927
We have been in love for 20 years, is he...

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,515
I've been thinking about it repeatedly
"Are what he said afterwards lies?"

27
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,391
I finally lied to her

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,811
Representative Yin of BF called

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,395
She found the mastermind behind it

30
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,398
Some people rumored that you poisoned him, what do you think?

31
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,358
hateful

32
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,693
Have you ever killed someone?

33
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,446
We're going to deal with more lunatics now

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,075
But I don't plan to do that, I don't plan to stop

35
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,453
I regret it, but now I want to make a difference

36
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,708
I will protect you, I will accompany you, have you heard it?

37
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,587
Breathe, keep breathing, you're fine

38
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,590
Mr. President, we have bigger problems

39
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,883
Start the basement of the head office

40
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,010
We're not ready yet

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,722
You were in this lab

42
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,224
Cultivate human organs

43
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,976
We meet on the first day

44
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,019
I want you not to use me as a cultured meat for experimentation

45
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,731
Don't tell me
You really think there are other terrorists running away

46
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,774
You have no power

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,027
You can't reverse the outcome of that case

48
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,529
What about you, Prime Minister?

49
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,115
Do you mean there are spies? Want to know who it is

50
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,200
I said I can't stop you from leaving

51
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,161
Thank you for saving my life

52
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,080
Thank you for keeping me safe

53
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,948
Even if it is a consortium bodyguard like you

54
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,200
Can't defeat a wanderer like me

55
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,749
Golden Hokkaido

56
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,215
Pick up, stay awake and breathe

57
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,428
-Scars...
-Don't talk, it's okay

58
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,973
-Jiang Yingshi, call the police quickly
-yes

59
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,810
Pick up, wake up

60
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,105
You're OK, breathe, pickaxe

61
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,405
Here

62
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,572
Don't let him run away

63
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,492
There, hey

64
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,257
The gangster is still nearby, he can't run far

65
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,604
Don't move

66
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,988
How are you?

67
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,573
fine

68
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,221
We're going to cultivate cereals

69
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,474
The question is whether you can make a profit

70
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,855
I just received a call from the police station

71
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,274
We have a bodyguard who died

72
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,944
Another person considered a murder suspect was arrested on the spot

73
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,156
You must meet them in person

74
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,242
Show that we will handle all his funeral expenses

75
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,744
Sigh them sincerely

76
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,745
yes

77
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,790
Yin Zi's bodyguard is dead

78
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,750
It's not him, it's someone else

79
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,793
(Michimori)

80
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,713
Did the engineer call you? He should have paid back the situation long ago

81
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,841
Did he do it? Are you sure?

82
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,302
What did he say? Don't say you haven't contacted him yet

83
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,721
Wait a moment

84
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,143
- Find him anyway
-yes

85
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,105
-Damn, that bastard must have run away
-Hello

86
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
-I'm going to run away
-no

87
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,985
Yin Zi is not an idiot

88
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,321
She'll be puzzled
How could the gangster know where her bodyguard would go

89
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,698
Sooner or later she will find out

90
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,950
Do you think she can't find you?

91
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,579
Engineers disguised themselves as others from the beginning, but what about you?

92
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,540
Escape will only prove that you leaked the secret

93
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,083
What if she catches me?

94
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,251
Deny to the end

95
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,753
Your participation has left no evidence

96
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,298
She can only guess

97
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,049
Don't escape, just deny it

98
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,096
I'll find that bastard
You stay there, help me inform me

99
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,014
Yes, President

100
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,602
These bastards are the same

101
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,827
-Is my favorite restaurant
-Yeah?

102
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,663
-I want to go there
-Me too

103
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,873
- Come with me
- Not that delicious

104
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,459
-It's really great there
-yes

105
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,670
- Very delicious
-Really?

106
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,880
He has left, what should I do?

107
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,048
What do you think?

108
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,175
Find him at any cost and bring him

109
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,558
That's why I want you not to hire outsiders

110
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,476
It will be worse with your own people

111
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,936
Nothing worse than this

112
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,399
He hides, you may be accused of conspiring with him

113
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,859
Then find him earlier than the police

114
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,862
Why did I ask? This is what you did

115
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,283
If he claims to be instructed by the Dawson Group

116
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,785
Don't think about what the police will say

117
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,705
"No wonder the Prime Minister wants to come forward for the death of a bodyguard

118
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,290
He has something to do with that matter.”

119
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,209
Catch him first, don't complain

120
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,296
Why do you think I made you the Prime Minister?

121
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,464
He's good at shaking others

122
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,675
Must find him before he is caught and questioned

123
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,427
You have to find him first

124
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,429
Are you listening?

125
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm listening, I'm going to hang up the phone

126
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,391
You are not allowed to talk to your father like this

127
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,644
If you don't stop talking, how can I find him immediately?

128
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,188
It seems like I'm talking more than him

129
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,859
Call the police chief

130
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,943
yes

131
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,407
Hello, Director

132
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,075
That's it...

133
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,955
I just heard bad news

134
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,791
I heard that someone died in BF again

135
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,501
Is it the gang?

136
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,920
Do I have to apologize publicly again?

137
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,257
Wait a moment

138
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,596
You mean your person was chasing someone else at that time
Only then will the gangster be chased away

139
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,473
Why are you so useless?

140
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,396
How could a man throw three policemen into the air?

141
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,819
who is he?

142
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,333
He has a strange body of power, not as strong as a human

143
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,836
He was dangerous, so we had to arrest him

144
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,260
Supernatural power

145
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,100
Not as strong as a human

146
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,364
Representative Yin

147
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,578
You made all my childhood dreams come true

148
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,590
Dominant Species

149
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,560
Why did she have to send me?

150
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,273
Good night

151
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,816
I'm fine, it's nothing

152
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,110
I patrol the whole house again

153
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,197
-Are you okay?
-right

154
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,242
That damn bastard

155
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,954
Why did he have to kill an innocent person?

156
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,585
(Episode 7)

157
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,003
Oh my God, I'm so annoying

158
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,173
-Who?
-Hello, I...

159
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,550
Is this Mr. Kim Ho-sung's home?

160
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,968
He's not here now

161
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,763
I'm his colleague

162
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,849
Can you talk about it? I have something to tell you

163
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,642
Do you have to open the door?

164
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,730
What is he talking about?

165
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,446
I am Zheng Haiden, who do you belong to Mr. Jin?

166
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,781
He is my parents' son

167
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,408
-What?
-He is my brother

168
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,926
It wasn't that time, everyone had already left

169
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,433
Who heard us talk?

170
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,645
Who knows we are going to the welfare service center?

171
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,440
Let's go now, Representative Yin will not go out

172
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,570
Representative, Director Zheng Ben

173
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,031
-You won't go out today
-Excuse me

174
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,242
Sorry, sir

175
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,810
He injured a police officer

176
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,020
He was arrested even though he made a big fuss in the scene

177
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,527
(Police Department)

178
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,209
I've dropped your murder charge

179
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,588
terribly sorry

180
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,966
As for Jin Haosheng, we finally...

181
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,928
Can't save him

182
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,391
I shouldn't have sent you there

183
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,019
I shouldn't be too much

184
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
Can I leave here?

185
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,359
You didn't kill anyone, but you attacked the police

186
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,239
What's going on? Why did you attack the police?

187
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,908
They said you threw people away

188
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,493
I don't know either

189
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,245
At that moment, I suddenly felt

190
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,665
Body fever

191
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,882
I'm not sure

192
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,759
Is it your arm?

193
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,303
It should be

194
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,306
You go for a physical examination as soon as you leave here

195
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,724
I'm going to catch that bastard first

196
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,100
Of course, I have to catch it

197
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,437
But we must first clarify one thing

198
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,484
How did he know?

199
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,529
He may pretend to be a member of the cancer group
Come to get close to Professor Jin

200
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,324
And provide a fake address

201
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,787
But he doesn't live there at all
Why did it appear there today?

202
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,166
He knew we would go there long ago

203
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,963
Who else knows you are going to the welfare service center?

204
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,091
No one, I only told Haosheng

205
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,593
Do you want to go to the welfare service center with me?

206
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,846
We were the only ones, no one could hear us talking

207
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,057
That's my person?

208
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,935
Hong Xinye? Xu Xi?

209
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,230
Hong Xinye knows about Professor Jin’s cancer friends group

210
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,314
Did Representative Yin say it?

211
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,067
Director Xu gave me the address of the welfare service center

212
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,653
If Hong Xinye is a spy

213
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,989
I won't tell the group's affairs

214
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,116
She won't drown, either

215
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,076
One person left

216
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,746
If Jin Haosheng didn't say it

217
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,999
That's Xu Xi

218
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,963
Do you think he hired a killer?

219
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,091
The killer claims to be a wanderer

220
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,012
Have you talked to him?

221
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
I heard from a distance

222
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,349
He said that, it must mean that he was employed

223
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,145
He didn't attack Kim Sung-sun or BF because of his personal grudge

224
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,066
Tell me what you need

225
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,984
represent

226
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,282
We can find out this ghost
It's all because of Haosheng's sacrifice

227
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,286
It also proves that Kim Shin-shun may have been murdered

228
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,124
Should I feel comforted?

229
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,418
Because we have achieved success?

230
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,711
Even so

231
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,340
You still regret sending us over and not giving up

232
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,093
Is this a clue?

233
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,184
Must catch the traitor

234
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,107
I shouldn't have sent you there

235
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,570
I should go by myself

236
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,035
After I go out, I will tell you if you have something to do

237
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,792
You want to know me

238
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,544
You were shot before, but today you lost your colleague

239
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,048
You can't work for me anymore

240
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,217
Yeah?

241
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,887
In short, it can be said

242
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,765
terribly sorry

243
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,476
I can't protect you

244
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,563
Even now

245
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,449
Wait a moment

246
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,828
Just be fine, please

247
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,913
Have they finished talking?

248
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,373
The talk is over

249
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,874
OK, let's go

250
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,922
Bye now

251
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,985
-Please get something for me
-What is it, representing?

252
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,739
Hello, Yin

253
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,993
I am Li Dashi, the director of the Yizheng Police Department

254
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,454
Sorry for my bodyguard doing those things

255
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,707
I asked to meet you to apologize in person

256
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,794
Don't take it to heart, it's okay, please

257
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,466
Our driving monitor records the escaped figure of the gangster

258
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,844
That's the suspect

259
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,931
We all arrived at another location

260
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,142
So it's not here at this time

261
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,895
good

262
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,331
This driving monitor video
The car from the late bodyguard

263
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,141
We can get this video

264
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,269
Is it because we quickly contacted the control center?

265
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,229
Yes, Director

266
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,659
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

267
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:48,330
Show our car
Driving route 20 minutes before Kim Ho-sung's death

268
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,041
Connect to the monitor that car

269
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,339
Rewind for ten minutes

270
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,549
stop

271
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,635
Rewind for four seconds

272
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,304
Turn it for two seconds

273
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,978
Merge the screens before and after 60 seconds

274
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,398
(Completed)

275
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,942
Young-shi, remove his glasses

276
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,820
(Identity scan No. 0059)

277
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,573
With his face, this will be passed on to you

278
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,993
(175 to 178 cm high)
(About 40 years old)

279
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:30,247
Even the control center can't determine where he is going

280
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,542
So we are pursuing his whereabouts

281
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,464
We have his license plate number

282
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,634
But he rented the car with fake documents

283
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,891
Are there any pictures of the deceased when he was first discovered?

284
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,645
Of course there is, didn’t the body camera take a picture of him?

285
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,314
Yes, he was photographed

286
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,607
Let you see the photos first

287
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,331
As for the anatomy photos...

288
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,167
Please...

289
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,418
We haven't got it yet

290
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,589
We're looking for that car, we'll find it soon

291
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,342
Hope so

292
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,804
But I don't think he was driving and escaping because he needed to move

293
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,848
So to say

294
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:35,771
He will probably abandon the car first because the car is full of his DNA

295
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,688
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

296
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,358
Any traveler car models have been abandoned... not right

297
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,777
Any travelers after 11 a.m. this morning

298
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,029
Burned, exploded or fell into the water?

299
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,655
Did my bodyguard say

300
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,325
What about welfare service centers and post offices?

301
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,869
Their monitor must have photographed the suspect

302
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,414
We're trying to get those videos

303
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:02,589
I heard that my bodyguard accidentally injured a police officer

304
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,010
terribly sorry

305
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,763
It doesn't matter, Representative Yin, the injury is not serious

306
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,642
Please investigate this case carefully

307
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,560
We will try our best to cooperate

308
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,566
By the way, your bodyguard is really strong

309
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,652
He is a bodyguard after all

310
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,612
Yes, that's right, but...

311
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,696
I found his car

312
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,827
A car was suspected to have been set on fire

313
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,786
What?

314
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,623
The Jiangbian Fire Department reported that there were repair shops and cars nearby

315
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,750
Burn out of combustible substances

316
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,293
But I think it's the same car

317
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,797
The fire site of Jiejing repair shop by the river

318
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,215
How do you know?

319
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,593
- Check it out
-It's time for me to leave, goodbye

320
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,972
Be careful on the road, Representative Yin

321
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,522
How did she know?

322
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,613
(175 to 178 cm)
(70 to 75 kg)

323
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,865
(About 40 years old)

324
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,949
What?

325
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,118
-I've spread it
-Where are the headphones?

326
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,454
Leave it to them

327
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,477
Director Xu, please close this message that pops up

328
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,063
(Ancestor Mode)

329
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,568
Is it him?

330
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,652
right

331
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,822
He is very good, he is a professional

332
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,366
He subdued our bodyguard

333
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,662
No, it's sensory pretending... It's okay

334
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,664
What's wrong?

335
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,293
how? Is it a test pretending to kill Mr. Jin?

336
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,669
No

337
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,714
Yingshi, crime scene photos

338
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,216
yes

339
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,433
He was stabbed from this little opening

340
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,396
Choose a suit that fits

341
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,357
May I? Free?

342
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,609
Yes, free

343
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,862
Oh my God, it's great, Director Xu, this is great

344
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,211
Why do I make that design?

345
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,421
-You can't blame you...
-What?

346
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,389
That's fine, I won't delay you

347
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,098
Very good connections

348
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,683
The assaulting policeman can retreat

349
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,643
Enough

350
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:48,398
Representative Yin wants us to hand this over to you before you leave

351
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,031
Can I leave now?

352
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,699
Yes, yes

353
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,410
I'm sorry for what happened before

354
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,536
It doesn't matter

355
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,121
(Bozheng Police Department)

356
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,423
Where are you? Have you come out?

357
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,300
I thought you asked me to come out

358
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,135
Not me

359
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,139
But the policeman said I have a meridian

360
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,521
Hello?

361
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,117
-Yingshi, confirm the position of Yu Caiyun
-yes

362
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,782
Will bionics dream of having electronic sheep?

363
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,044
I thought she just saved your life
Not turning you into a bionic

364
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,922
What did BF do to you?

365
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,218
I'm afraid I don't understand what you're talking about

366
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:47,267
No, you will definitely understand, so stop pretending to be stupid

367
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,856
I don't know what you're talking about

368
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,331
I heard you easily subdued a group of police officers

369
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,419
I heard you threw them into the air

370
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,673
Because of the sensing installation

371
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,593
BF gives me this set of sensing outfit

372
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,887
It is bulletproof and makes people wearing it stronger

373
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,264
But I'll still feel it

374
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,350
-So please don't throw anything at me
-How dare you...

375
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,270
So frivolous in front of me?

376
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,693
Let's talk about a serious topic

377
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,654
Kiel

378
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,698
Do you know him?

379
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,076
His family after the explosion

380
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,579
Leave Azolan with a special immigration visa now

381
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,333
Now living a comfortable life abroad

382
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,922
You don't seem to be surprised

383
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,425
Terrorists' families live a good life

384
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:08,139
I can't believe it, you actually thought I didn't know

385
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,350
Very interesting

386
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:16,231
If you know, you should be as suspicious as me

387
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,072
I won't feel it
I believe that the mastermind of the attack had someone else

388
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,949
Just a simple delusion

389
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,536
I'll make you angry if I say that

390
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,454
Have you been holding a grudge?

391
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,915
You are the one who should be reasonably suspicious

392
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,086
But I think the gangster has been arrested and the matter ends

393
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,671
It doesn't make sense at all

394
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,840
There must be some reason

395
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,302
I've always been very curious

396
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,515
Almost impossible at the time
Obtain a special immigration visa in Yazolan

397
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,226
How did his family do it?

398
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,103
One more thing

399
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,359
How can the South Korean Embassy issue a visa?

400
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,071
Is it you?

401
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,289
Do you think I would abuse my power like that?

402
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,373
No

403
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,461
I'm asking if you are trying to kill former President Li Wenkui

404
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:28,595
At that time he opposed all forms of synthetic biology

405
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:33,600
If he was in power for a few more years, he would shut down the BF

406
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,061
And that's the company you're very interested in

407
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,190
You've lost your mind

408
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,905
Do you think I will hurt my grandfather? My blood relative?

409
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,616
That must be a higher status
A person who has no blood relationship with him

410
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,242
People above you

411
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,954
After the Yazolan incident, President Xianyugen

412
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,081
Is it a coincidence that a divorce will soon be done?

413
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:02,754
He made countless scandals
His ex-wife tolerated him for decades

414
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,050
Dawson Group's wife...

415
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,638
Have you explained it to your son?

416
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,155
You didn't lie

417
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,076
That sensory pretense is really good

418
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,846
Water…water

419
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,641
Water, water

420
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,774
You have hemophilia

421
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,651
Shut up

422
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,367
What's up?

423
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,913
OK, I get it

424
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,809
roll

425
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,732
I'll tell you to get out

426
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,414
Why do you choose me when I am so embarrassed?

427
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,585
He cares so much about appearance...

428
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,233
Where is he?

429
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,697
-Are you okay?
-fine

430
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,991
The Prime Minister knows a lot of inside information

431
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,743
He doesn't intend to cover it up either

432
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,404
The rumors are true

433
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,073
About your relationship

434
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,996
What can we have to do with each other?

435
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,873
You're here to save him

436
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,499
It's faster than I expected

437
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,962
Prime Minister, I didn't expect you to be romantic

438
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,339
I've known you for many years

439
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:21,053
You have never been interested in others, let alone men

440
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,015
Then why should you come here?

441
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,393
To protect company confidentiality

442
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,314
Because that man is your living secret

443
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,528
Have you found a way to prolong your life?

444
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,450
Have you successfully cultivated the organs?

445
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,080
That's true

446
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,678
Let me see it, just let me see it

447
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,056
I won't even tell my father

448
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,892
If you want to know, it's simple

449
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,938
Please modify the bioethics law

450
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,191
Then we will announce it to the public

451
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,736
"BF has been successfully cultivated
Commercialized human organs

452
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,697
Humans no longer have to bear it..."

453
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,117
No, not all humans

454
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,119
Why announce that?

455
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,710
What if everyone could live forever?

456
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,171
Those outside can't handle it

457
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,926
They will become unforgettable because they can live forever

458
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,973
「外面那些人」？

459
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,976
What to do with natural resources? People will still reproduce

460
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,435
We can always produce meat

461
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,772
But what about the land? Where are natural resources? What about job opportunities?

462
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,068
Generations must alternate, Yin represents…

463
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,448
"Life may not be fair
But there is one thing that everyone has to face

464
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,993
die

465
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,455
Cultivating organs will deprive us of the only remaining fairness”

466
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,957
I've heard this passage countless times

467
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,126
And I decide every time

468
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,588
"I want to create a future where everyone is equal"

469
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,634
This is very fresh

470
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,054
Do you think everyone except you should get sick and die?

471
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,225
You have said other excuses, but are you really worried about the people?

472
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:36,230
You are the supreme you, don’t want to be like them, right?

473
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,317
We can't be the same

474
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,153
It's impossible to be the same

475
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,488
Even if you realize your dream

476
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:49,035
Even if buying organs becomes as cheap as buying patent medicine

477
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,871
Even everyone can live for hundreds of years

478
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,664
All poor people will be poor people

479
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,667
We will only prolong their pain

480
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,252
Then who will they blame?

481
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,422
We rich people

482
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,800
The world has limited wealth, but they can live forever

483
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,678
Don't you think that will trigger an riot?

484
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,556
Look at the civilians

485
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,808
They think rich people are evil

486
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,854
You are still their number one victim

487
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,815
Stand on the side of humans

488
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,943
Otherwise, which side should I stand on?

489
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,862
Wherever you

490
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,409
Together, it will be considered human evolution
But the words

491
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,536
You're just a mutation

492
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,333
You are the richest and most powerful person I know

493
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,837
You will be pampered throughout your life

494
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,925
Nevertheless, what you have been looking forward to

495
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,594
Is it just a mutation?

496
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,806
Different from others?

497
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,643
People who create mutations themselves dare to say

498
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,062
I heard he has a strange power

499
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,400
He should have died long ago, but now he has super powers

500
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,277
That's not called a mutation, what's it?

501
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,738
I understand, he is your first test subject

502
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,282
OK, he is your first white mouse

503
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,785
You said we must cooperate

504
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,996
So I voluntarily become the test subject

505
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,878
Otherwise I will dissect the white mouse

506
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,551
I have the right to act illegally against BF
Issued a search and seizure order

507
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,011
I will confiscate all evidence and related technology

508
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,148
Can you only threaten me like this?

509
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,859
Do I need to say more?

510
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,574
Are you very upset?

511
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,704
Representative Yin

512
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,083
I care a lot...

513
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,963
Yin represents you

514
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,397
Catch me so you won't lose everything and regret it

515
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,817
This is your last chance

516
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,032
I can see

517
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,496
You'll show your true face and challenge me

518
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,498
I can see

519
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,085
You pretend to be smart and capable, and you always pretend to be very similar.

520
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,190
Yes, Prime Minister

521
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,984
OK, I'll go now

522
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,907
I'll drive

523
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,669
It's Director Zheng

524
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,421
Have you caught her?

525
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:33,259
Have you told Haosheng about your itinerary this morning?

526
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,017
Director Zheng also knows

527
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,734
He said we should set off right away
Because you don't have a trip today

528
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,405
Representative, Director Zheng said you won’t go out today

529
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:58,450
He must be like last time
Inquired about your itinerary from Director Zheng

530
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,705
(Representative Yin)
(Zheng Haiden may be an insider)

531
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,669
"Why do you ask the representative of today's itinerary?"

532
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,171
Director Zheng asked him back like that

533
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,969
We have to find out what she did later

534
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,138
We've checked

535
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,227
(No blood)

536
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,021
-Hello?
-Are you still outside?

537
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,190
Go to Luojingdong, where is the suspect

538
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,483
Has he been arrested?

539
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,860
Corner Automobile Travel in Luojingyidong

540
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,918
(elder sister)
(Engineer may be arrested)

541
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,173
do what? Return it to me

542
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,968
What's going on? Let me go, what's wrong with you?

543
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,928
What do you want to do?

544
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,180
Who did she send a message to?

545
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,681
They cannot track the recipient

546
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,266
Is there any record of communication?

547
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,684
-Not at all
-hateful

548
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,852
You've made a mistake

549
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,104
Don’t you feel embarrassed to be caught?

550
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,106
Not angry?

551
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,319
"Why did Wenshan want me to meet the suspect?"

552
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,072
You must be too anxious to think

553
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,621
Who is the "sister" you are in a hurry to contact? Say it quickly

554
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,166
represent

555
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,086
How could you do this to me?

556
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,089
Listen, you asked me to quit my job as a lawyer

557
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,299
Here to do things for you

558
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,093
How could I kill someone?

559
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,679
Representative, it's me, Zheng Haiden

560
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,722
Don't fucking touch me

561
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,142
You are not just a spy, you also kill a person

562
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,185
Not me

563
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,772
How many times do you want me to say it? Call the police

564
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,399
Tell them I'm a spy

565
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:58,195
Let them question me
Find out what confidential information I leaked

566
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,115
How much does Dawson pay you?

567
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,909
If it's not money

568
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,995
Are you secretly dating Xian Yugen?

569
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,289
Or Xianyuzai?

570
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,542
Maybe both

571
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,587
represent

572
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,632
How can you...

573
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,302
How could you let him say that?

574
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,055
hateful

575
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,402
Professor Jin's wife died in our laboratory

576
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,031
The seriously ill woman died after going to her husband's company.

577
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,616
Xian Yuzai must know

578
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,786
That might be the first thing Professor Kim told the killer

579
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,206
But Xian Yuzai didn't mention it when he threatened me

580
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,751
He has to pretend to be stupid

581
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,712
Even the Prime Minister cannot know

582
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,506
Unless the spy or killer was sent by him

583
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,300
That's right

584
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,763
He knew that would be
My biggest weakness in law and society

585
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,516
But he kept silent to protect himself

586
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,728
If he mentions it, it's like he's pleading guilty

587
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,859
What about Director Zheng?

588
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,655
She's their spy

589
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,200
Will she confess?

590
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,285
This is illegal imprisonment

591
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,624
Do you know I am a lawyer?

592
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,168
The Prime Minister said

593
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,755
Will you be immortal?

594
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,889
(Cracked encoding)

595
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,935
(Ancestor Mode)

596
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,992
hateful

597
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,621
Do you want to join in the fun?

598
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,291
Who do you think you are?

599
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,587
Hit me, I will add the charge of injury

600
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,266
You add me to the interview list

601
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,811
That way I will become her bodyguard

602
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,564
Dawson will send me here

603
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,567
Xian Yuzai didn't send me to investigate

604
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,778
Who should be responsible for his grandfather's injury

605
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,115
We want to hack into BF and sneak into their security system

606
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,786
Next two days
Completely shut down their systems and obtain information

607
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,167
He wants to take advantage of the disabled old man

608
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,045
Swallow BF in one breath

609
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,222
but…

610
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,685
It seems he is not going to protect his spy

611
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,567
Let me go

612
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,449
I'm not like anyone else here

613
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,286
Who killed Haosheng?

614
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,122
Damn, let me go

615
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,212
Who killed him?

616
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,558
Representative, please help me

617
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,644
It's time for you to leave

618
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,063
Representative, please help me

619
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,901
represent…

620
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,947
How long have you worked for him?

621
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,659
-Start with a terrorist attack?
-What do you want to say?

622
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,035
What are you talking about?

623
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,955
Representative... Representative

624
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,873
Representative, help me
