00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,024
Mr. Hong, you have visceral fat

5
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,985
We have developed this AI scanning system

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,447
It can detect various diseases

7
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,033
You can get down

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,993
Oh my God, it's done well

9
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,161
(Episode 10)

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,621
You should go to our hospital

11
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,666
When can we see the cultivation of organs?

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,502
Before that

13
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,421
Everyone should know that this system contains

14
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,924
All transplant information that has been made public

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,718
But that's information already public

16
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,845
This AI must achieve

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,473
The degree to which the perfect surgery can be performed if there is an arm

18
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,102
But to achieve this goal
We need your help

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:46,481
Please provide all the information and technology you have

20
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,902
By the way, there are also surgical videos

21
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,031
How do we digitalize our own expertise?

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,951
It will take several months, my ten years of professionalism...

23
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,953
I'm not in a hurry

24
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,248
It's about my life

25
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,043
I won't lie on this bed unless everything is perfect

26
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,504
Everyone knows

27
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,423
One mistake can make everyone present pay

28
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,758
A huge price

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,096
We want to avoid errors
Not to steal your knowledge

30
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,765
No, we are not worried about that

31
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,308
Do you want to see the organs?

32
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,394
They're there

33
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,399
It took us ten years

34
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,360
That's how it's progress

35
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,906
Please start

36
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,333

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,963
(Research Director)
(Research Group 2 Leader)

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,510
What an irresponsible research director

39
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,734
Are you playing games?

40
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,736
Are you my mom? Why are you watching me?

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,364
Do you have a phone number that the murderer used to pretend to be a priest?

42
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,536
Yes, but what do you want to do? Even the police can't track it

43
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,040
That just means he's still using it

44
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,166
The number has been passed to you

45
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,757
Where is his ID number?

46
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,096
Your phone cannot be connected and will be transferred to you...

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,848
It should be here, there

48
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,602
Jiang Yingshi, send a message to this number

49
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,686
yes

50
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,358
"Chishunyuan, born on January 2, 1988

51
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,236
I know who you are

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,698
If you want to survive, come to see me. I am Yin Ziyi, send it out

53
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,116
The message has been sent

54
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,036
Why do you want to meet a killer?

55
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,747
If you are worried, you can come together

56
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,668
Hey, he is probably Dawson's

57
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,836
Do you think he will appear after seeing it?

58
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,174
I thought so at first

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,510
I thought Dawson was hiding him

60
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,886
But the message sent by Zheng Haiden...

61
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,349
(elder sister)
(Engineer may be arrested)

62
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,312
If he fled to Dawson after killing, she would know

63
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,315
But we deliberately made her think he would be caught

64
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,818
She also tried to repay Dawson, why?

65
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,071
Don't Dawson know his whereabouts?

66
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,658
-Why did he run away...
-Because his intuition told him to escape

67
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,911
Don't think about solving this alone

68
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,876
Don't think about meeting him

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,379
Solve everything before surgery

70
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,424
It's bad enough that your bodyguard is not here

71
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,471
-You can continue playing the game
-I don't…

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,102
Don't mess around, okay?

73
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,479
I've warned you

74
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,113
Chi Shunyuan, born on January 2, 1988

75
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,157
I know who you are

76
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,869
If you want to survive, come to see me. I am Yin Zi

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,006
I will chase you to the ends of the world, Chi Shunyuan

78
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,593
No matter where you are

79
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,221
If you kill my people, I will find you

80
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:24,801
You're just a time bomb to Dawson
The eternal murderer

81
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,430
Do you think they will take you in or get rid of you?

82
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,058
You already know

83
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,020
From your identity to your entire life, it's fake

84
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,273
Their best choice is to let you

85
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,651
The corpse sank at the bottom of the river

86
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,153
That's the easiest solution

87
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,622
You know who can save you

88
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,129
(Politic killing suspicion)

89
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,297
Make a decision so as not to become Professor Jin's second

90
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,805
OK, let's go, I'll see him

91
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,975
It's okay to ask me for you, please give me some good words

92
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,602

Oh my God

96
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,898
Can you see me?

97
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,275
Can you see it?

98
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,445
Doctor, doctor

99
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,615
Who are you?

100
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,537
Yingshi, search for articles about BF bacteria

101
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,831
Jiang Yingshi, call Yin Zi Representative

102
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,000
English: English...

103
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,753
What?

104
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,213
What's wrong, Jiang Yingshi?

105
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,881
(Capture the voice)

106
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,259
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

107
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,426
What happened just now?

108
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,928
What's the meaning?

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,897
Hello?

112
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm

113
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,402
What?

114
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,074
When did she wake up?

115
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,412
(Cracked encoding)

116
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,132
I couldn't ask her doctor, her mother was too panicked again

117
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,217
"Mother"? Director Zheng’s mother?

118
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,969
Yes, she's in the hospital

119
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,641
I don't know if she pretends

120
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,936
But if she really lost her memory
I can't explain to my mother what happened

121
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,522
Do you want to go on my behalf?

122
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,696
How could I forget that she is also someone else’s daughter? Oh my God

123
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,759
I'm Chi Shunyuan

124
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,432
Yin Ziyi, I want you to come here and don’t bring anyone else

125
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,519
Where is she going?

126
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,980
Why did she go there?

127
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,821
Promise me something

128
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,492
We don't know if Dawson sent him here

129
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,412
Or is he going to appear? Negotiate with you

130
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,790
-No matter what, don't force him to get angry
-good

131
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,167
Don't anger him when he gets close

132
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,877
I'll follow you

133
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,462
I know

134
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,132
We need him

135
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,136
Mr. Yu Caiyun

136
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,686

138
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,263
Area C is currently safe

139
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,394
Find him anyway

140
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,813
There

00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,651
(Mr. Wenshan)

142
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,903
A car just drove in

143
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,783
There were two people in the car, but neither of them were him

144
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,667
parking

145
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,545
-Representative Yin
-Representative Yin

146
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,629
What's wrong?

147
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,465
What's going on?

148
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,803
Chi Shunyuan, open the door quickly

149
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,972
-Let's do it
-Please let go

150
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,192
Who sent you here? Who gave the order?

151
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,910
Take me to BF and save me

152
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:09,997
Carry him out

153
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,671
Oops, Yin Zi is going to take him away

154
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,798
Stop her with all your might

155
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,645
Catch them

156
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,647
Where is the representative of Yin?

157
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,320
Free, no...

158
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,868
don't want

159
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,060
Her liver, kidneys, and femoral arteries were ruptured

160
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,771
-She has small intestine
-I'll get the organ

161
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,064
Transplant action

(Ancestor Mode)

163
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,942
Wait, what about other doctors?

164
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,278
- Only the two of us are not enough
-What?

165
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,321
(Plusal action)

166
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,032
-What's this?
-It integrates your knowledge

167
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,618
You guys who are in their best condition

168
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,202
There are several other doctors

169
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,747
-I haven't entered half of it yet
-Me too

170
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,249
This is not our best condition, it's not finished yet

171
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,501
There is no time, the image is already in front of you

172
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,004
What do you want to do?

173
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,763
Scalpel

174
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,939
All I know is that BF is still alive when he is carrying him onto the helicopter

175
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,941
And not sent to any hospital

176
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,865
That's all left

177
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,785

180
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,811
What's up?

181
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,317
I just heard the news
They are going to search and seize the laboratory

182
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,819
They want our hard drive, too

183
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,363
They are coming soon, what should I do?

184
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,908
What's the meaning? You've just received the notification

Several employees saw her, what should we do?

189
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,465
OK, I get it

190

I've blocked the entire basement

I am the chief investigator of Zhenchuan Police Department

196
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,390
Due to BF's illegal activities and violations of medical laws

197

We want to work with BF's head office and laboratory

Refusal to cooperate will be considered obstruction of justice

Obstructing justice only
Only established if violence or threat is involved

Thank you for your cooperation

Simply refuse to cooperate without attack

202
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,165
Can't be considered obstructive of justice

Hello Mr. Prime Minister

236
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,088
Hello

237
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,717
I believe this is our first meeting

238
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,845
First of all, I would like to thank you for agreeing to this visit

239
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,473
High-level political figures

240
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,768
Rarely appear on our news programs

241
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,479
That's because many people think

242
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,899
We are critical of the government

243
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,152
But Prime Minister, you agree

Participated in this visit

245
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,115
I'll get to the point

246
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,660
Can you say you are not afraid of difficulties and stand up?

247
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,371
I'm not sure

248
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,708
Is it necessary that?

249
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,629
Then I won't beat around the bush

250
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:08,676
People say that my father, President Xian Yugen, is a terrorist

251
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,180
They said he planned the tragedy

252
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,098
He hurt his own father-in-law

253
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,100
Countless government officials and foreign children

254
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,646
Do you believe it?

255
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,273
Do you think that is reasonable?

256
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,361
Who spread this ridiculous rumor first?

257
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:31,366
It was in the recent shooting
BF that took 11 innocent lives

258
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,660
They carried out a massacre

259
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,705
Then suddenly accused my father of being a terrorist

260
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,290
That's indeed a massacre

261
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,502
But there is something we cannot ignore

262
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:46,839
That's the BF employee who caught the terrorist

263
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:51,260
At the time of the Yazoran bombing, it was served there

264
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,764
He is Captain Yu of the Navy

265
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,684
At that time, he was responsible for escorting former President Li Wenkui

266
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,894
What do you think about this?

267
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,771
So what do you think about this?

268
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,398
That Captain Yu

269
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,902
I was jailed for assaulting police

270
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,406
Sorry, I don't know that

271
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,700
What we know is him...

272
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,494
That's it...frankly

273
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,830
I've known Captain Yu for a long time

274
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,082
"It's been a long time"? How to say it?

275
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,545
He used to visit former President Li Wenkui

276
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:29,215
That is, his grandfather, he also wants to meet his father and mother.

277
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,301
He repeatedly asked them to let him visit terrorists

278
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:37,015
I know he witnessed the tragedy with his own eyes

279
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,308
Not very healthy

280
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,813
You are alluding to Captain Yu accusing President Xian Yu of

281
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,733
Is terrorist attacks caused by psychological problems?

282
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,109
Is this what you mean?

283
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,737
I asked Captain Yu's position

284
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,282
I've never heard him claim

285
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,536
He exposed the head of the terrifying attack

286
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,998
We have also invited BF to be interviewed...

287
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,376
I just want to say that BF is taking advantage of that poor soldier

288
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,920
He is a Vengeance who has severe post-traumatic stress syndrome

289
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,632
They want to emphasize his past achievements
So that he looks credible

290
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,471
I know they're panicked
After all, they lost 11 employees

291
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,556
As for me

292
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,518
I won't just ask you to believe in your father's innocence

293
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,687
I heard that the former soldier was arrested

294
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,024
Know the real culprit

295
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,694
OK, then start from there

296
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,492
They claimed that their father paid the terrorists

297
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,912
I will remove all your doubts about this

298
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,164
That bastard

299
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,792
He knows

300
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,711
By "all suspicions" you mean

301
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:53,091
Did Yazoran's attack and raid the BF's armed groups?

302
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,511
Some people think that it was made by President Xianyu

303
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,845
The purpose is to seal the mouth of BF

304
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,975
We're more professional, okay?

305
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,063
Yin's bodyguard was killed

306
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,650
After she got into the car with the murderer, she was even more in danger of her life.

307
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,403
Are these two cases unrelated?

308
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,866
Captain Yu, who accused President Xianyu, was also her bodyguard.

309
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
I…

310
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,454
Trust your father

311
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,626
Not because I am the Prime Minister, or because he owns Dawson

312
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,337
My son believes in him

313
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,965
Let me give you a warning

314
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,178
Refusing to apologize for such a big uproar
Still talking nonsense

315
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,347
BF Company and Yin Zi Representative

316
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,560
This has exceeded the level of slander, you must take responsibility

317
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,938
Then the conclusion should be everything BF said

318
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,065
Not true

319
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,151
We've come to that conclusion long ago

320
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,698
Prime Minister, can you please listen to this recording?

321
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,908
-President
-Where are you?

322
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,370
I'm in the hospital, BF thought I had amnesia

323
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,875
What? Did they believe it? No matter what, talk about urgent matters first

324
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,335
What did the engineer say? Did he mention me before he died?

325
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,131
I'm not sure, I'll be arrested that day

326
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,800
Is Yin Zi dead or alive? Do you know?

327
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,303
Don't you know either? Have your people not been rewarded?

328
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,680
They shouldn't have paid back, they were caught

329
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,600
I don't know either

330
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,477
I pretended not to remember anything about Dawson or Yin Representative

331
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,188
OK, hang up the phone

332
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:35,026
OK, I want to apologize to our audience first

333
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,945
Female voice in that recording

334
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,198
It's fake

335
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:45,745
It is created by AI technology with the voice of real BF employees

336
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,371
But the male voice is true

337
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,625
The dialogue was recorded instantly

338
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,670
The female employee is suspected to be a spy who sneaked into the BF

339
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:59,133
BF has been identified by voiceprint analysis

340
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,637
The male identity on the call

341
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,099
But we agree not to announce it until the authorities confirm it

342
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,438

343
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,693

345
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,323
Do you have a share, too?

346
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,993
You ruined your son's life

347
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,496
Why do you think I'm going to keep you safe?

348
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,209
Not all for slaughter, I don't want to hurt him

349
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,836
But how can you repay me like this?

350
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,714
You are so sad

351
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,426
Honey…

352
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,554
Convince him

353
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,308
He shouldn't have treated me like this, we are family

354
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,397
Tell him I'll handle everything

355
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,316
He should remain silent

356
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,737
Answer me, I'm talking to you

357
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,536
I'll kill everyone who goes against me

358
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,745
Try it, bastard

359
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,545
Does he know too?

360
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,214
What?

361
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,301
Jae also knows

362
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,469
Who hurt me?

363
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,972
Do you know it is his father?

364
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,767
No, he doesn't know

365
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,395
How is that possible?

366
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,043
Dear national, I'm sorry

367
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,962
I'm trying hard to think about what to say

368
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,759
And the only thing I can think of is to apologize to you

369
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,802
sorry

370
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,223
Yazoran Investigation Committee

371
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,143
I've given the result to me today

372
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,604
They've tracked it down

373
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,523
The flow of gold believed to be paid to terrorists

374
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,319
As a result, suspicion about my father

375
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,863
All proved to be facts

376
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,493
If the result is not so conclusive, let me treat myself

377
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,955
So strongly refuting the accusation only feels a little embarrassed

378
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,916
How good should it be

379
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,000
(Dawson, Xianyugen)

380
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
You're still here

381
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,799
You think you pretended to be unaware
Will I sit quietly?

382
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,428
What do you think I know?

383
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:53,891
Know everything
The shooting and my plan to take everything from BF

384
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,103
Shooting? I?

385
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,774
You mean the search and seizure operation?

386
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,778
Yes, I said I would take away the results of BF illegal research

387
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,071
Before that

388
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,782
What a shit South American gang

389
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,993
No one

390
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,956
Think that's related to our family

391
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,207
Why do you have to?

392
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,753
Do you have any evidence?

393
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,926
I used to believe in my father

394
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,345
I didn't expect him to do this

395
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,350
If I say the reason is
One of the victims of the terror attack is someone I love deeply

396
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,602
Will you understand?

397
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,439
You don't care about your grandfather being disabled

398
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,859
You just want to use him and make excuses to overthrow me

399
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,403
And you provide an excuse

400
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,323
He never obeys

401
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,787
I made him president, but he thought he was above me

402
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,497
the same as you

403
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,127
I won't let anyone steal my stuff

404
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,214
「偷」？

405
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,091
They are mine

406
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,345
Yes, yes, it's all

407
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,222
I'll give them to you

408
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,349
My only son

409
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,143
when?

410
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,481
You said you will live forever, but what about me?

411
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,484
Should I be your son forever?

412
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,864
I will make you immortal, I will do what I say

413
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,535
So it should be no big deal to go to prison for a few years

414
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,914
-But you are the Prime Minister
-So I have a term

415
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,124
Not like you are the president

416
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,755
Thanks to my position, I can cover you up from all sides

417
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,006
How about it?

418
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,926
You are responsible for what is being exposed at the moment

419
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,969
Or fight to the end?

420
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,263
Is it really because of the home business?

421
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,224
Or is it because of what I did to your mom?

422
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,810
What is the main reason why you treat me like this?

423
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,437
What?

424
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,648
My father's actions to cover up

425
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,360
I tried to hurt more people

426
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:15,533
Because he has hurt Yin Ziyi and many people

427
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,578
I can only assure you two things

428
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,249
First, the authorities will have other doubts

429
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,334
Conduct a rigorous investigation

430
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,587
Second, I'm a slaughter

431
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,007
Acknowledge that I have shortcomings and will resign from the position of Prime Minister

432
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:40,307
Will resign from the position of prime minister and step down

433
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,396
Thank you

434
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,317
I want to be sincere in attacking Yazolan

435
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:55,447
And all the victims of subsequent incidents apologized

436
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,369
Dear national, I'm sorry I let you down

437
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,999
However, this is just a frustration within our family

438
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,376
Nothing to do with this country

439
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,046
This country to be proud of

440
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,759
Will shine even more after this tragedy

441
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,888
if you can

442
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:24,560
I hope to be an ordinary citizen
Support our country

443
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,940
I am sincerely sorry and grateful for all this

444
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,860
(Ordinary Citizen)

445
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,486
As a sinner

446
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,576
sinner?

447
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,217
You're not a traitor

448
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,848
You've been exploited, too

449
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,355
Or is it all the same for them?

450
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,524
You've visited me before

451
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,487
You are a BF employee

452
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,039
You've been actively experiencing a psychiatrist

453
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,916
For whom?

454
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,711
You fake my voice and say in the media that I am a spy

455
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,507
I'm not a fool, I just don't remember

456
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,350
We've known each other for about three years

457
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,603
But I feel like we met in the past life

458
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,068
We're not monitoring you anymore

459
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,367
It means you've been monitoring me?

460
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,958
Miss Zheng Haiden

461
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,961
Take good care of yourself from now on

462
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,507
Don't be like Professor Jin or that engineer

463
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,347
What's wrong with them?

464
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,773
who are they?

465
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,530
Miss Zheng, please come in

466
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,869
What kind of person am I before?

467
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,458
I hope my memory will be restored as soon as possible

468
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,299
Maybe I lived a very ordinary life before...

469
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,429
He's a very boring person

470
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,519
But I still hope my memory will be restored as soon as possible

471
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,107
(Daoson, Xian Yuzai)
(Daoson, Xian Yuzai)

472
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,152
There are a lot of things, so it took a lot of time to move them

473
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,822
But we brought all the searches and seizures

474
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,703
Thank you, thank you for your hard work
Hope to work together again soon

475
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,455
Thank you, President Xianyu

476
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:35,501
Also, congratulations on becoming the new president

477
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,920
You've said it many times

478
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,259
By the way, we believe that Representative Yin is dead

479
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:50,599
We suspect they are guarding
The Secret of Her Death During the Operation

480
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,018
I'm afraid it will affect the business of organ cultivation

481
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,854
But we don't know how long they can hide it

482
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,106
goodbye

483
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
Are you dead?

484
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,706
After giving me this...

485
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,212
Yin Ziyi

486
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,423
Are you really dead?

487
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,877
Why didn't you call the police immediately?

488
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,213
I think those militants are some police forces

489
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,257
They are much like searches and seizures

490
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,678
The deceased was shot

491
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,430
The neck is twisted or suffocated

492
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,806
Who did that?

493
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,311
That wasn't done by one person, we all have a share

494
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,771
We just want to live

495
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,275
So is Yin Zi Representative?

496
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,277
Of course not

497
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,033
Has she been seriously injured?

498
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,078
She didn't participate in the fight, she was the representative after all

499
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,591
don't want

500
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,648
What about now? Is she okay?

501
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,444
She asked me to explain everything to the inspection and investigation unit

502
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,658
Why can’t we find Mr. Yu Caiyun?

503
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,287
Can't find it?

504
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,248
I haven't contacted him yet

505
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,640
You did it

506
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,018
You did it, and...

507
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,220
(Class A)

508
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,063
Jiang Yingshi, where am I?

509
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,842
