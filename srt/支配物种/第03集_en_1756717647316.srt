00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,920
(The location and characters described in this play
Organization, scenes and events are purely fictional)

2
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,960
Dominant Species

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,919
(Abstract)

4
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,963
Please welcome those who turn the impossible into the possibility

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,631
BF's Yin Zi Representative

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,759
I have a dream

7
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,260
I promise you

8
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,220
Various cereals and food crops

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,889
We will all be successfully trained

10
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,225
We ask Yin Zi to apologize, the murderer

11
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,020
who is he?

12
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,938
He just happened to pass by

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,732
It's just an ambulance officer

14
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,942
And you recognize him

15
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,278
Represent, you have to hold on

16
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,072
-Who are you?
-Have you found out about your identity?

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,158
-I think his goal is Yin Representative
-Where is the representative of Yin?

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,534
If it's the bodyguards

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,287
What about leaking the mobile route that represents today?

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,081
That always makes me feel very upset

21
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,832
Should I find a full-time bodyguard?

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,293
Don't repeat the same mistakes, that shouldn't have happened at all

23
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,378
Is the next target BF?

24
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,381
Go to find Yin Zi
Become her deputy and gain her trust

25
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,716
What's this?

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,511
They asked us to follow the instructions before decrypting the file

27
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,221
I opened the description file

28
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,140
Then see this

29
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,266
This is their method

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,728
Ransomware rarely opens files

31
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,564
But no one can guarantee

32
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,193
"Training" is reasonable now, but why?

33
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,195
Is he the resource I should use?

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,322
Or should I avoid him?

35
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,116
Now the representative Yin is

36
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,076
People who need close protection

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,954
I hope you are the person we need

38
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,122
You know Citizen X

39
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,541
All rumors about culture medium are true, right?

40
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,000
That's why you didn't call the police

41
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,920
Someone pretends to be them

42
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,255
Hide your identity

43
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,631
If it is Director Wen...

44
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,216
The closer you get, the more dangerous

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,510
Is that all acting?

46
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,429
Professor Jin robbed himself and pretended to be angry?

47
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,890
Why did she speed at that time?

48
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,017
The first person to know that the money was remitted was...

49
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,520
Is it really

50
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,355
One of them?

51
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,162
Already started

52
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,339
Track all accessibility
Employees in the Central Laboratory's internal network

53
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,425
That would violate the Location Information Act…

54
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,220
To obtain their consent, they can be followed

55
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,680
Track their location

56
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,473
Do you want to initialize the input code?

57
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,103
(I'm sure you want to initialize the input code?)

58
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,688
Initialize the input code

59
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,274
I need the initial command code

60
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,278
Enter code

61
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,458
Track employees who are accessing the Central Laboratory internal network

62
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,964
Show people who went abroad after 4 pm this afternoon

63
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,304
What about those who buy air tickets after 4 o'clock?

64
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,935
Then they have to open their payment record,

65
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,686
That's definitely illegal

66
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,896
Jiang Yingshi

67
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,900
Shows people who purchased air tickets or boat tickets after 4 pm

68
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,403
(Ancestor Mode)

69
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,489
(Input the access key)

70
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,312
Is Professor Jin going to another place?

71
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,313
You heard the news?

72
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,815
No

73
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,899
Zoom in South Korea

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,694
Air tickets and boat tickets details

75
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,991
January 19, Phoenix City

76
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,162
Isn’t Professor Jin going to work on January 16th?

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,457
He went to Phoenix City to find his son

78
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,295
Run away as soon as you retire, his child won't be happy

79
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,757
Jiang Yingshi, find out after 4 pm today

80
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,385
Employees who transfer more than 100 million won to private accounts

81
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,761
Currency is unrestrained

82
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,723
What about 50 million or more?

83
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,684
What about more than 10 million?

84
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,729
If only ten million were found in a month

85
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,772
It will take 67 years to find 80 billion

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,441
Jiang Yingshi

87
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,401
From now on

88
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,113
If an employee makes a transaction worth more than 30 million

89
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,491
Or leave the country, notify me immediately

90
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,951
Yes, I get it

91
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,497
By the way, why do you think the gangsters are our own people?

92
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:33,791
Thanks for your hard work

93
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,212
You can go home

94
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,130
where are you going?

95
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,757
head office

96
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,343
-So…
- See you on Monday

97
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,223
A person as rich as her sleeps in the company
I feel sad when I think about it

98
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,436
We have great facilities

99
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,521
That's it

100
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,955
Director Xu was the first to discover

101
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,751
I'm doubting the people inside BF

102
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,213
Look at him after he left the lab tonight

103
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,548
What actions will be

104
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,721
Cryptocurrency, hacker attack

105
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,392
Director Xu is the one who knows the most

106
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,525
But with his profession, he can suck away BF's money

107
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,156
You speak Russian?

108
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,158
I've found an interpreter

109
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,993
Koreans can use it

110
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,455
Russians rarely use these symbols

111
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,376
There is no unique symbol in Russia here

112
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,544
The gangster has someone else

113
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,295
You know Citizen X

114
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,297
He is more capable than Director Xu

115
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,510
You can only grasp when they exchange Bitcoin

116
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,469
us…

117
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,929
Pay the ransom

118
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,391
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

119
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,976
Search for Yu Caiyun

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,769
Yes, start searching

121
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,563
If they

122
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,607
If you want to continue doing this, you shouldn't run away after taking the money

123
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,153
Anyway, I have to give money to get a chance to catch them

124
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,742
How could I blindly believe in strangers?

125
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,233
He left the scout team in 2024, and as for his family…

126
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,360
Say something that is not in his resume

127
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,697
This is the image found

128
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,823
(The President visits Yazolan)

129
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,455
What's this?

130
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,082
You mean he is in the photo?

131
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,128
Yes, this is him

132
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,300
Was this taken before the explosion?

133
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,303
(The President and Azoran were bombed)

134
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,763
(The president's situation is critical)

135
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,531
This is…

136
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,116
Yu picked it?

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,494
Sorry, I can't identify this person

138
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,665
He leaves the scout team in 2024

139
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,583
(Retired from the Navy Central Command in April 2024)

140
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,503
That's it

141
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,885
(Yu Caiyun)

142
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,855
Director Xu went home directly

143
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,983
I'll wait here for a while

144
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,279
represent?

145
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,364
Why do you want to hide it?

146
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,703
What am I hiding?

147
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,456
President Li Wenkui

148
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,129
Why did you come to BF?

149
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,760
It was BF who contacted me first

150
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,014
They saw me on the professional bodyguard list

151
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,099
Ask me if I'm interested

152
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,603
When you escort President Lee

153
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,354
I must have seen Prime Minister Xian Yuzai

154
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,111
Have you seen him before that?

155
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes, I've seen it

156
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,453
Come back and have a conversation in person

157
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,711
The pleasure is over

158
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,149
I was a soldier at the time

159
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,151
I know

160
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,404
I learned 40 minutes ago that the head of state was about to arrive

161
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,990
The top selected several officers to escort him

162
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,160
I escorted him from the landing ground to the command center

163
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,120
Only 30 minutes in total

164
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,288
I know this, too

165
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,208
I also know after the explosion

166
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,293
When everyone falls, you will take him away

167
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,549
You seem to be criticizing my actions
But I have no problem with doing

168
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,761
You only wrote "Overseas Service" on your resume

169
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,638
You must know that I was there at the time.

170
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,431
Why not mention it at all?

171
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,811
Including me, you know three people at the explosion scene

172
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,771
Is this a coincidence?

173
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,191
Or am I delusional and nitpicking?

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,360
Sorry, but I don't know

175
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,445
What are you picking on

176
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,322
Don't know President Park

177
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,741
What did you say when you recognize you

178
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,160
He knew from the beginning

179
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,371
We are all treated in Yazolan

180
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,872
That's why he hired me

181
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,249
Then why are you hiding it from me?

182
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,002
I don't

183
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,338
You obviously don't recognize me

184
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,589
So I think

185
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,008
There is no need to mention the past

186
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,886
I don't even know if it's a good thing for us to reunite

187
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,764
But you used that evil fate to work for President Park

188
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,517
I don't know what you did with Li Wenkui

189
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,936
Do you still have any contact?

190
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,275
I visited him once in the hospital where I was at that time

191
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,777
That was the first time and the last time I met the Prime Minister

192
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,362
What does this matter?

193
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,323
Where is your injured part?

194
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,577
No impact on current job

195
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,495
You retired due to injury

196
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
No effect on me

197
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
Why are you unhappy that I have been to Azoran?

198
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,336
Because that's your trauma?

199
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,672
You're not afraid, you just don't like it

200
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,592
I can understand

201
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
You can leave now

202
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,494
I discovered it later

203
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,704
You've also visited Azolan

204
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,623
What I read in the news

205
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,670
For female entrepreneurs, Li Wenkui is the worst president

206
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,006
Now his grandson is the Prime Minister

207
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,927
They must have put eyeliners in our company

208
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,220
Do you think it is me?

209
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,848
Do you think I handed him the secret of BF?

210
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,766
It's possible

211
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,229
If possible, I'll send a spy to him right away

212
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,273
I don't do that, I won't tell the truth

213
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,526
Then you will...

214
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,238
Send ransomware software?

215
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,830
Do you think I'm sending ransomware to your lab?

216
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,962
Have you been doubting me for a while?

217
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,258
You're more excited now than when I said you were eyeliner

218
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,553
How can you not be excited?
I'm still determined to catch X citizen

219
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,971
If it weren't for them, we would...

220
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,149
I didn't expect you to even doubt me

221
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,820
I think I trust you too much

222
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,866
You should doubt your lab first

223
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,993
After being terrified, a researcher was injured

224
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,160
There is also the rumor of culture medium...

225
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,289
Rather than doubting me

226
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,375
You should doubt the laboratory more

227
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,169
Thank you for your hard work today

228
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,025
(President Li Wenkui)

229
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,118
Visitation?

230
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,245
Do you remember the person named Kiel?

231
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,291
Of course I remember, he was a terrorist

232
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,168
He has never refused to see me

233
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,253
I would like to ask for help

234
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,342
With my help, you will see him soon

235
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,343
thank you

236
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,012
Where is Yin Zi?

237
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,722
She just recognized me

238
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,516
She recognizes you?

239
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,727
Because Azoran at that time?

240
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,729
She will find out one day

241
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,648
Sooner or later she will find out

242
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,694
Did he mention anything other than visitation?

243
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,032
Like news about the lab?

244
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,825
What's wrong?

245
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,953
I'm just giving an example

246
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,996
He hasn't found anything yet?

247
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,208
Today is his first day to work

248
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,459
Too

249
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,795
You're right

250
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,505
I'm too impatient

251
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,135
Considering my health, I am the most urgent person

252
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,472
Don't worry, leave it to me for treatment

253
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,350
Don't do anything, you're in a bad situation

254
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,727
Tell your father to go

255
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,062
OK

256
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,439
What about visiting?

257
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,692
I can handle it in just one sentence

258
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,987
Don't worry, go to bed

259
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,365
Good night

260
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,289
The insider should not keep his mouth shut

261
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,386
Dominant Species

262
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,495
You shouldn't be here alone

263
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,914
It's time to take a break on the weekend

264
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,249
We can take turns

265
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,917
I mean myself

266
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,171
I didn't see it

267
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,422
(Episode 3)

268
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,506
Probably in the water

269
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,133
Don't get out of the car

270
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,137
But it wasn't very windy at that time

271
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,933
It's strange, the water flow is not strong

272
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,352
Maybe when they broke the window to save people

273
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,979
The driving recorder fell out

274
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,981
Still very strange

275
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,235
Glass fragments did not fall out
How come there are only wires left?

276
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,198
Is there anything wrong?

277
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,583
let's go

278
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,588
Do we want to search for the bottom of the reservoir?

279
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,133
-Go back first and then talk about the reward
-Yes, sir

280
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,938
(Qingshui Police Department)

281
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,150
Hello?

282
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,821
She is our researcher

283
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,036
We hung up just after talking a few words on the phone yesterday
What's wrong?

284
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,414
dissatisfied?

285
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,252
To Miss Hong?

286
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,640
(BF also doesn't apologize if it kills)
(Removal of Yin Zi)

287
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,451
Are you having lunch?

288
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,205
Do you want to eat?

289
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,375
-No, thank you
- Want coffee?

290
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,459
No, thanks

291
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,795
Thanks

292
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,226
It means staying up late?

293
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,646
It's not working hours now, so you don't have to be restrained when speaking

294
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,400
Have you just got up?

295
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,615
What's wrong?

296
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,784
By the way, the police call

297
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,164
They asked if anyone was dissatisfied with Miss Hong

298
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,084
It means that the accident may not be an accident

299
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,302
You already know?

300
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
What's going on?

301
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,026
Ransomware

302
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,278
Maybe it was a trick

303
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,488
may be…

304
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,037
How do you know?

305
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,164
Those hackers are not citizens X

306
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,291
When did you know? Why didn't you say it?

307
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,877
- Let's talk now
-You didn't know now

308
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,380
What you should ask is, these events

309
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,882
Is it a coincidence to happen one after another?

310
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
Have you checked so deeply?

311
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,847
Do you think the ransomware is related to Ms. Hong’s accident?

312
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,476
Why did the police contact you?

313
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,396
I'm obviously the last call she had.

314
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,690
What is that?

315
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,817
About 5 pm

316
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,695
Her accident came an hour later

317
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,863
Notified at 6 pm

318
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,949
She called me at 4:58 pm

319
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,706
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

320
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,375
Yesterday at 4:58 pm

321
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,836
Any employees are 100 meters around Hong Xinye...

322
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,589
Is it within 50 meters of the surrounding area?

323
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,842
some

324
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,969
Are you following us?

325
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,346
-Who is it?
-From when? Including me?

326
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,639
Jin Shin-sun rescue

327
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,021
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

328
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,606
At 5:10 pm, are there any employees next to her?

329
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,067
Jin Shin-sun rescue

330
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,112
What about 5:30 pm?

331
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,865
Jin Shin-sun rescue

332
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,325
What about 5:50 pm?

333
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,536
Jin Shin-sun rescue

334
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,455
Find Jin Shin-sun to save immediately

335
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,332
He is in Taiping, Gyeonggi-do

336
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,708
-On Dongmen Road
-He is at home

337
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,418
-To specify the address...
-Quiet

338
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,268
(Professor Kim Sun-risk)

339
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,146
Your phone cannot be connected and will be transferred to you...

340
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,696
Wait a moment

341
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,782
Miss Hong must have gone to his house yesterday

342
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,158
She often takes him home

343
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,829
Think carefully

344
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,706
The accident happened on her way out of his house

345
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,585
good

346
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,097
She left his house alone

347
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,850
On the way home, the car lost control

348
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,187
How far is the accident scene from his home?

349
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,732
About 20 to 30 minutes drive…

350
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,735
wrong

351
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,115
If she stayed at his house until 5:50

352
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,993
That accident that happened so far from his home

353
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,038
Will not be reported at 6 o'clock

354
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,255
There are protesters downstairs

355
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,716
See you there

356
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,060
We've had 20 years of friendship

357
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,648
We've gone through a lot of ups and downs

358
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,068
We even created BF

359
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,865
Could it be that he...

360
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,252
The years spent together may not be created

361
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,546
Trust relationship

362
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,813
(Yesterday at 4:49 pm)

363
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,152
(Representative Yin paid the ransom)

364
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,492
Successful, 80 billion yuan

365
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,735
Sorry, professor

366
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,321
I brought your stuff

367
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,698
I'll do it

368
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,160
By the way, what happened?

369
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,621
I seem to hear something

370
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,253
Maybe it's TV

371
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,341
Stop picking it up, I will clean it up

372
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,097
Then you have a good rest

373
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,307
Miss Hong

374
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,643
yes

375
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,651
-What's this?
- That one

376
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,904
I've prepared a small gift for you to retire

377
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,577
Thanks

378
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,744
Just a small thing

379
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,162
goodbye

380
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,587
(Representative Yin paid the ransom)

381
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
Professor Jin, Laboratory…

382
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,510
that is…

383
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,975
It seems to be solved

384
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,244
OK

385
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,621
「成功了」

386
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:04,789
80 billion yuan…

387
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,791
Maybe it's TV

388
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,712
Did I hear it wrong?

389
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,721
Professor Jin, Laboratory…

390
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,474
Success

391
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,943
Director Wen, is it convenient for you to speak?

392
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,111
That's it...

393
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,655
Where are you now?

394
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,990
Sorry, I have to call back later

395
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,840
Professor Kim

396
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,594
Is there anything wrong?

397
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,223
Something is wrong

398
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,809
Is it you?

399
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,612
Fortunately, there were witnesses

400
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,573
Any witnesses?

401
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,218
Miss Hong had a car accident

402
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,347
Sleet on the road
Eighty percent let her crash into the water while speeding

403
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,603
She didn't stay in the water for too long and would wake up soon

404
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,566
The weather is bad, the car will be pulled up tomorrow

405
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,401
Her car fell into the water at 5 pm

406
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,739
We will look at the driving recorder to understand the incident

407
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,995
Why do you want to...

408
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,123
Come here at that time?

409
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,585
No one would have been hurt.

410
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,045
good

411
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,339
It could have ended successfully

412
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,095
I can't be caught like this

413
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,974
I finally lied to her

414
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,227
Finally got the huge sum

415
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,647
That's your fate

416
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:39,527
We will look at the driving recorder to understand the incident

417
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,322
They won't find a driving recorder, but...

418
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,700
If they find it was forced to be pulled out...

419
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,799
Professor Kim?

420
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,613
Where are you?

421
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,491
professor? Hello?

422
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,451
professor?

423
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,286
Director Wen

424
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,248
Can we open the door outside your home?

425
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,041
My home?

426
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,586
Yes, we are here, we have something to tell you

427
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,796
Hello?

428
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,174
Professor, hey?

429
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Where are you?

430
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,763
Answer me

431
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,099
-「回答我」？
-You did it?

432
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,768
What did you just say?

433
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,103
「回答我」？

434
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,106
Bitch, I'm not your friend

435
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,066
Don't order me, a arrogant bitch

436
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,609
Who are you calling a bitch?

437
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,738
You hacked into the system and stole my money

438
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,033
You really dare to say that, what about you?

439
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,286
You killed someone

440
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,247
If it weren't for you, she would have lived for a few more months

441
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,164
But you intervene...

442
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,417
You begged me for surgery

443
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,919
Your hands are also covered in blood

444
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,589
Miss Hong really cares about you

445
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,841
She's still alive, I didn't kill anyone

446
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,386
As soon as you declare your culture medium is garbage
It defiles one's reputation

447
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,972
You have devoted 20 years to your research

448
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,098
-How can you...
-wrong

449
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,975
It's not me, I'm lying

450
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,618
Representative Yin

451
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,192
I'll be back soon, can you stay here first?

452
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,157
Yes, represent

453
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,409
Save Jin

454
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,329
Join the no-fly list

455
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,705
What's going on?

456
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,137
(Secretary Jin)

457
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,014
The secretariat message is coming

458
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,766
good

459
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,603
Representative Yin of BF called and they said you are not here

460
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,648
She asked them to pass on the message to you

461
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,443
She once asked you for help in person

462
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,404
But I found the mastermind behind it

463
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,115
Ask for help in person?

464
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,867
She said she had to report the other party formally

465
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,790
She wants me to help

466
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,881
Sorry, I didn't expect it to be done by the insider

467
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,387
I know it's too late

468
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,766
But I will report him immediately so that he can be on the ban list

469
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,977
Why is it too late?

470
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,313
According to his attitude...

471
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,192
I think he's gone abroad

472
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,903
What did he say to you?

473
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,656
You really dare to say it

474
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,825
What about you?

475
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,077
What did he say to you?

476
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,996
You killed someone

477
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,331
Representative Yin

478
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,542
he…

479
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,547
If it weren't for you
She could have lived for a few more months, but you intervened

480
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,719
He seems to be unafraid

481
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,764
He's not afraid of being caught

482
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,681
Wait me a moment

483
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,101
Has Chacha Jinshen been rescued?

484
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,062
Ask them to approve BF immediately

485
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,314
Apply to add him to the no-fly list

486
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,607
Yes, Prime Minister

487
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,609
Representative Yin?

488
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,071
-yes
-They will notify you of the results

489
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,448
Thank you, Prime Minister

490
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,232
He must have transferred the phone

491
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,988
Can you unlock your phone?

492
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,658
Please

493
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,077
Do you think I am 007?

494
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,328
Whose phone is this?

495
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,122
Professor Jin is ransomware

496
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,916
The mastermind behind cryptocurrency and culturing liquid rumors

497
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,504
Did you catch him?

498
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,133
Where is he now?

499
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,218
He is 9 am today

500
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,262
Have already flew to Vietnam

501
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,850
He entered the country two hours ago and then disappeared

502
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,853
Kim Shin-shu's passport has been cancelled

503
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,187
We also informed the embassy

504
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,439
Thank you, sir

505
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,401
Please express your gratitude to the Prime Minister on my behalf

506
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,330
This is my wife's stomach

507
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,875
Her large intestine is full of cancer cells

508
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,418
Representative Yin

509
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,003
Let's try it

510
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,463
You know it's not finished yet

511
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,215
We cannot make any guarantee

512
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,885
I know, I know very well

513
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,012
You should reject him

514
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,096
It's what he wants to do

515
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,974
Of course, he didn't want to let go of any hope

516
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,392
And you're using him

517
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,644
We'll know after trying

518
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,479
He just wants to use his wife to try it?

519
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,898
Otherwise, how to experiment?

520
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,733
Do we have to do nothing?

521
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,736
Our company can't even do animal tests

522
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,447
We need human subjects, we need human bodies

523
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,618
If we don't care, she will die

524
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,163
This is not a gambling, but a last resort

525
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,791
Don't worry about her, she will live longer, you know very well

526
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,461
If it weren't for you, she would have lived for a few more months

527
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,067
Do you want to stop by?

528
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,103
Professor Kim...

529
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,940
What a bastard, right?

530
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,946
Should I take back my words?

531
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,554
let's go

532
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,977
(Director Zheng Haiden)

533
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,605
Professor Jin has gone abroad

534
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,733
He must have started preparing long ago to escape so quickly

535
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,903
I've checked where he escaped...

536
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,696
-Vietnam
-Yes

537
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,991
The embassy there already knows it
Did you contact them?

538
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,621
Wait, where are you now?

539
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,206
No

540
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,541
What's the meaning?

541
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,211
You're going to do stupid things by the river

542
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:44,006
Representative, this is not the end of the world, okay?

543
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,841
Why am I doing stupid things?

544
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,094
I'm not alone, either

545
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,013
Really

546
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,265
You should tell me

547
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,602
There is someone next to you

548
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,686
Director Zheng

549
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,606
Please continue to monitor if Professor Jin will

550
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,982
Swipe his credit card

551
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,610
But then again, he shouldn't be that stupid

552
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,903
I see

553
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,218
Why doesn't he use a fake passport?

554
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,972
If he did that, no one would find him

555
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,934
He has everything, except the most important thing

556
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,727
-Arizona?
-Phoenix City?

557
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,319
If he goes to find his son after retirement, no one will doubt him

558
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,738
He doesn't have to risk a fake passport

559
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,408
That must be his original plan

560
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,536
But Ms. Hong found something strange

561
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,830
He must let her car sink

562
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,291
Because he must escape immediately

563
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,211
He will make a new passport in Vietnam

564
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,048
We can never find him again

565
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,440
Yingshi, send an email
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

566
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,025
Yes, what to write?

567
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,986
Send people to exit areas of all airports in Vietnam

568
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,615
Chuanjin Shin-shuo wearing a hat
All kinds of photos of them without glasses

569
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,368
Call all our production line employees
Send employees and contractors

570
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,704
Upload his photos to social media

571
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,624
Those who said they reported him or caught him at the airport

572
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,627
Will get a bonus of 50 million won

573
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,172
Ask the legal representative and ask the Vietnamese police to provide assistance immediately

574
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,592
After sending the email, call the legal representative

575
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,845
Yes, call Vietnam's legal representative now

576
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,558
Hello, sorry to call on the weekend
Please read my email now

577
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,435
(Visit him)

578
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,355
I'll wait for you, let's see now

579
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,321
Shiny and shining

580
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,533
The sky is full of little stars

581
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,620
Hang in the sky to shine brightly

582
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,541
It seems like many small eyes

583
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,919
Shiny and shining

584
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,296
The sky is full of...

585
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,430
Two years have passed, Keel

586
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,726
I want to talk about that incident

587
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,770
Must talk

588
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,817
I've been on trial

589
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,529
It's not your confession at trial, I want the truth

590
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,408
I've told the truth

591
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,745
Even those soldiers

592
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,332
It was only before the president arrived

593
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,293
But you've known it long ago

594
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,295
Still leaking information?

595
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,757
You're never that kind of person

596
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,596
I've always been

597
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,683
How did you know we would go to the command center?

598
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,728
How do you know where to blow up?

599
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,898
That's the most important place

600
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,234
"I don't know it will explode

601
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,279
I can only tell when he will arrive.”

602
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,698
This is what you said in court

603
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,452
I don't remember

604
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,171
Don't you remember him either?

605
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,885
You still remember

606
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,266
You know it will explode when you let the kids in.

607
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,934
The children you feed and teach

608
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,611
But you know your family is well abroad

609
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,074
Does the name Yin Zi look familiar? Where is Han Jihao?

610
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,626
This is life imprisonment

611
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,880
You'll stay in prison until death

612
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,340
Please...

613
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,218
Help, please...

614
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,307
It's not too late now

615
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,643
Why do you have to bear the blame?

616
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,977
What are your problems?

617
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,437
it's all over

618
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,647
Not over yet

619
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,982
Not over yet

620
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,618
Not over yet

621
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,247
not yet

622
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,277
Go to find Yin Zi

623
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,612
Become her deputy

624
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,697
Gain her trust

625
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,452
He will make a new passport in Vietnam

626
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,079
We can never find him again

627
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,887
May I ask

628
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,266
Is there an illegal immigrant...

629
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,090
very good

630
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,217
here you go

631
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,930
Nice to meet you

632
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,348
Listen

633
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,226
I'm looking for someone

634
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,020
You are the new face, you are the new one?

635
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,105
no

636
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,816
I'm just looking for someone

637
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,484
I'll know

638
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,239
Hello, don't move

639
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,251
You idiot, you're dead

640
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,669
Catch him

641
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,163
hateful

642
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,752
Who are you?

643
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,004
Put your hand into my pocket

644
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,255
your…

645
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,924
Pants? Are you crazy?

646
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,008
Coat pocket

647
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,218
left

648
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,304
You'd better not move

649
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,931
Do it

650
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,226
I said to the left

651
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,157
What's this?

652
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,120
Is this true?

653
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,509
