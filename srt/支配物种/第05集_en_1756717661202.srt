Dominant Species

00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,471
Hold tight

4
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,079
(Episode 5)

5
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,553
Jiang Yingshi, what's wrong?

6
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:39,349
Detected gun use within a central radius of 2 km

7
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,101
Causes the alarm to start

8
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,731
Jiang Yingshi, turn on the screen

9
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,612
This is a video of the video of the video

10
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,000
(Go to BF Center)

11
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,383
Send a drone

12
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,272
-Hello?
-Hello

13
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,525
The location is 37.4769 degrees north latitude

14
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,734
Hello? Where are you?

15
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,028
West longitude 127.1592 degrees

16
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,072
Sounds like a game

17
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,949
what happen?

18
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,582
(Check the criminal record)

19
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,626
I've found Yin Zi Representative

20
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,549
Between Qinggeshan Pass and BF

21
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,050
There are about ten militants

22
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,550
You're OK

23
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,011
Breathe, continue breathing

24
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,191
They are there, and our people

25
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,359
-superior
-There are four people

26
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,027
One woman and three men

27
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,364
Two of the men had weapons
Don't shoot at them, they are bodyguards

28
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,817
Here

29
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,901
Deal with the injured first

30
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,996
Dominant Species

31
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,499
free

32
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,463
He needs a blood transfusion now, otherwise he will die of life

33
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,257
I'm a doctor, come here, please move it away

34
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,262
I've helped him

35
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
One and two

36
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,975
Representative Yin, it's time to leave

37
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,685
- Director Xu, go quickly
-yes

38
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,936
Representative Yin

39
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,944
Just a bullet passed

40
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,405
I'm fine, he needs help

41
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,157
I can't do anything now

42
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,459
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

43
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,461
Start the basement of the head office

44
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,299
Go to the basement of the headquarters

45
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,024
one two three

46
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,443
OK, let's go

47
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,278
Give him a bandage

48
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,779
-yes
-Get out

49
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,573
Fast movement

50
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,851
Jiang Yingshi, open the bed

51
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,711
Mr. Yu

52
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
Does he have no pulse? Too late?

53
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,347
Jiang Yingshi, starts a medical scan

54
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,745
Still jumping

55
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,622
But it's very slow

56
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,006
Does he need a transplant?

57
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,551
No, his organs are not injured

58
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,512
But the muscle was torn to pieces and blood transfusion was not enough

59
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,819
(No blood)

60
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,285
We're not ready yet

61
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,430
What about the necrotic part?

62
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,890
We will use culture organization

63
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,767
Is it done?

64
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,353
Just think this is our first clinical trial

65
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,314
This is not an experiment

66
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,826
This is

67
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,370
Our first success

68
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,288
(police)

69
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,874
They attacked while there was only one person on duty

70
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,834
It can be seen that they must have been here before

71
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,464
We are analyzing the monitor screen
To identify their identity as soon as possible

72
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,009
Eight people died and five were arrested

73
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,805
A total of 13 people have been arrested

74
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,309
Mr. President, but we have bigger problems

75
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,062
What's worse than a gangster?

76
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,022
The messenger of this incident

77
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,524
It seems that many criminals have been summoned

78
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,610
Use drugs as bait

79
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,737
Yes, drugs

80
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,949
They took the gun
Then launching an attack in Qingge Mountain means...

81
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,993
"A group of ex-confessors conspired to kill

82
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,746
Business celebrities in exchange for drugs

83
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,416
The police equipment that should have protected the people was still used.

84
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,293
Gossip will say that

85
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,087
Someone was injured or killed in BF?

86
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,296
Who is it?

87
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,090
The injured person is unknown

88
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,926
However, when the rescue arrived, the injured were unconscious and had severe blood loss

89
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,679
We believe the injured cannot survive

90
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,182
I will report the latest casualties in person. Goodbye

91
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,437
South Korean Police Department will report details of casualties after confirmation

92
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
Let's go

93
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,525
Shooting in broad daylight is already amazing

94
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,237
Their boldness and viciousness are unprecedented

95
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,407
BF's Yin Zi Representative and her employees

96
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,991
Escape from the scene...

97
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,079
Jiang Yingshi, call Yin Zi Representative

98
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,833
Yes, call Yin Zizhong

99
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,252
Your phone will be transferred to…

100
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,295
Jiang Yingshi, call Yu Caiyun

101
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,965
Yes, call Yu Caiyun

102
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,218
(Yu Caiyun)

103
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,970
Receive the call

104
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,638
Call Jin Haosheng

105
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,731
(Dashboard)

106
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,207
Is it immune rejection?

107
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,584
All we can do is that much

108
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,296
They must be fused

109
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,219
What's going on?

110
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,735
breathe

111
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,070
Continue to breathe

112
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,071
Mr. Yu

113
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,217
His vestibular cochlear nerves were damaged

114
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
Yingshi, is there any infection?

115
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,556
Mr. Yu's vestibular cochlear nerve and cochlear nerve

116
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,891
The damage is up to 60%

117
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,311
His left ear may lose hearing, tinnitus or dizziness

118
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,607
But his right ear is fine. Is it an old injury from the past?

119
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,318
It's an explosion

120
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,903
explode?

121
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,698
Was he injured by the grenade?

122
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,741
No, it looks like an old injury

123
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,243
At least a few years

124
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,121
Where is your injured part?

125
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,455
No impact on current job

126
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,332
You retired due to injury

127
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
No effect on me

128
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,335
Did he not receive treatment?

129
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,962
Isn't it?

130
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,591
Look, it's successful

131
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,807
Oh my god, I...

132
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,351
I can't believe it's successful

133
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,729
I haven't seen this before

134
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,731
We don't have

135
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,768
Director Xu

136
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,685
What's up?

137
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,021
Now only trauma needs treatment, you can leave

138
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,942
That's it...it's okay

139
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,488
Hello?

140
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,074
I'm fine

141
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,162
I'm really fine

142
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,833
The police are coming now?

143
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,337
Wait a moment

144
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,260
Director Xu, you will be escorted to the hall in five minutes

145
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,846
Yes...is it?

146
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,811
I can't believe I'm going to have a bodyguard

147
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,773
"They detoured because of construction
The gunfight happened there."

148
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,025
That's fine

149
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,445
Police are concerned about the injured who were seriously injured during the rescue

150
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,574
represent

151
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
I'm fine

152
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,455
Is the police outside?

153
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,082
Yes, they want to know what happened

154
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,252
But what about your bodyguard? How do you walk alone?

155
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,796
Tell them that we will cooperate with the investigation

156
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,590
As for the injured, he was said to have been taken to the hospital.

157
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,551
-Who is the injured?
-My bodyguard

158
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,469
Are both?

159
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,222
Five minutes later, someone was sent to escort Director Xu home

160
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,665
The last time I saw Delegate Yin, she was about to go to the basement

161
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,083
basement?

162
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,587
Yingshi, floor plan showing basement

163
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,214
Sorry, you don't have the relevant permissions

164
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,632
Monitor screen in the basement

165
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,635
Sorry, you don't have the relevant permissions

166
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,039
-English
-yes

167
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,666
Don't let anyone in

168
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,543
Yes, ma'am

169
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,275
Yingshi, turn off the noise

170
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,404
Currently, the measured value of external noise is 27 decibels

171
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,490
I did not detect special noise

172
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
Turn off that noise

173
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,203
What noise are you referring to?

174
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,288
Please turn off that noise

175
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,082
What noise are you referring to?

176
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,381
His surface antigen is being replaced by cultured hemocytogenes

177
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,757
His heartbeat...

178
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,182
Miss Hong is right

179
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,767
She said you look extremely calm

180
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,771
Did she and Director Xu leave?

181
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
Yes, you should go back and rest

182
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,820
Where should I go?

183
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,449
The owner of that house is here

184
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,747
When will your house be built?

185
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,208
A few more months

186
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,628
I'll stay here tonight

187
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,137
Those people are chasing you

188
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,306
It's not him that you should worry about now

189
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,674
Who will take care of Manzhi?

190
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,908
Your phone number is unanswered and will be forwarded to you...

191
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,470
(Emergency Center)

192
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,347
They came to me

193
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,724
(BF is afraid of attacking the suspect, Yun Nan)

194
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,933
They promise

195
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,729
As long as I cooperate, I will provide the right to supply

196
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,772
He said "they"

197
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,483
It refers to a gangster named "Archit's Forest"

198
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,526
Yes

199
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,652
They're kidnapped

200
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,947
Notorious with the murder of a rainforest environmentalist

201
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,076
Last year they even issued a hunting order to BF Yin Zi's

202
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,745
The suspect said

203
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,832
As long as he cooperates, the gang will provide him with the right

204
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,294
Then what is the "right to supply"?

205
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,587
Methamphetamine

206
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,130
This overseas gangster

207
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,549
Convincing a Korean drug addict

208
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,553
Murder the CEO of a company in exchange for drugs

209
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,725
Sounds too exaggerated
Can't believe this really happened in South Korea

210
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,685
The suspect is also very bold

211
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,688
In fact, he ransacked the police station's bullet room

212
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,607
Prime Minister Mr. Xian Yuzai

213
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,818
I have just publicly apologized for this matter

214
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
We are unparalleled in this unprecedented

215
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,616
I feel deeply sorry for the lack of safety
Promise to your dear nation

216
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,826
We'll target this

217
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,953
Improve relevant measures

218
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,124
About Yin Ziyi
Or new news about the safety of her employees?

219
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,252
Fortunately, no one died because of this

220
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,338
What's even more shocking is

221
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,006
Although it is a minority opinion

222
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,093
But some people believe that this gun battle was directed and performed by Representative Yin himself.

223
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,389
They claimed that Yoon represented the murder of the BF's Kim surnamed Superintendent

224
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,810
And plan this gun battle to distract the public

225
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:20,107
This representative almost died
Why are they still criticized?

226
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,986
We must think about cell culture technology for this society

227
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,989
Pros and cons

228
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,157
They criticized me...

229
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,158
(Park Jeon-won)
(Captain of fishing boat)

230
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,328
Say I'm destroying the environment, saying I'm sticking to the rules

231
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,879
Now they want to raise fish?

232
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,798
How do I...

233
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,220
Father

234
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,304
That's what you said

235
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,558
Have you found other uses for that soldier?

236
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,351
What's the meaning?

237
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,771
Yin Ziyi will try his best to save him

238
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,190
After all, she's sleeping at his house

239
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,403
If BF saves him, it means the time has finally come

240
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,448
If they fail, it means they are not ready yet

241
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,783
Thanks to you, I can wait and see

242
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,828
Your imagination is too much, Father

243
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,456
I'm the Prime Minister

244
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,460
Those lunatics robbed the bullet room
Destroy our peace and security

245
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,878
The people were scared and trembling

246
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,754
But do you think I am behind the scenes?

247
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,965
How dare you pretend to be innocent in front of me

248
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,383
I'm not pretending to be innocent

249
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,012
Do you think of me this way?

250
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,472
You really think

251
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,850
I ordered those people

252
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,978
Fired a gun at Yin's bodyguard for observation

253
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,188
Did her reaction?

254
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,732
So it's not you?

255
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,400
Of course not

256
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,278
All right

257
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,641
We can almost confirm the full effect of Omega Company

258
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,769
It is about to withdraw from the meat cultivation market

259
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:26,775
I'm not sure if the United States and Europe will have different reactions

260
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,030
We said we will
Put more money into microbial plastics

261
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:36,368
But we never said we would give up on cultivating meat

262
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,495
Representative Yin?

263
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,876
Contact Quanji Omiga Company

264
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,128
It's not the meat culture department, it's the microbial department

265
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,549
Tell them
We are interested in investing in their microbial technology

266
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,300
But we never invest in biological products

267
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,218
We won't

268
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,389
We express interest in biological products
Only to find out their voice

269
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,642
Then they will decide whether to make the meat

270
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,020
-good
-I understand

271
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,314
We will have a meeting later after we have the results

272
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,160
yes

273
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,495
I have to go to a place

274
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,792
It's handed over to you

275
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,876
All right

276
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,392
What?

277
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,103
Look at you

278
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,814
I'm fine, it's nothing

279
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,153
I patrol the whole house again

280
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,988
You don't have to worry, it means

281
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,990
Thank you

282
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,662
You all depend on it

283
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,957
Listen to my instructions carefully

284
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,598
Full plant

285
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,059
hello

286
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,271
Very sorry

287
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,941
You must be lonely and scared

288
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,417
Why is it coming again?

289
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,006
What's going on? Where is Mr. Yu?

290
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,550
I want to ask you

291
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,676
you do not know?

292
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,886
-Is he not with you?
-No

293
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,890
By the way, are those people newly hired bodyguards?

294
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,928
(Please check it out)
(The bed has been turned on in manual mode)

295
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,833
(heart)

296
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,101
(Small intestine)

297
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,702
You woke up? How are you?

298
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,622
Representative, are you okay?

299
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,793
I'm fine

300
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,547
Why am I okay?

301
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,508
You took the bullet from me?

302
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,426
Yes, you've been shot

303
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,096
but…

304
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,807
I didn't see the wound taken out

305
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,644
Will you feel pain? Can you move?

306
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,855
Where are your ribs?

307
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,275
They're broken
It must be painful when moving, do you feel it hurt?

308
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,986
Have you put these into me?

309
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,531
「这些」？

310
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,615
Pig's organ

311
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,326
Have you transplanted them?

312
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,704
No

313
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,291
None, no pig organs, no transplants

314
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,131
So they are human organs

315
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,138
Go out now

316
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,851
You were in this lab

317
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,020
Cultivate human organs

318
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,565
I'll tell you to go out

319
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,368
I know why you guys now...

320
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,580
Worry about the government's close attention

321
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,956
Who are you talking to?

322
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,418
Go back to bed, you can't move

323
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,253
I'll explain everything later

324
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,256
No, I've heard enough

325
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,341
Mr. Yu

326
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,219
Go back to bed

327
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,638
I'll do as you say

328
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,569
You were seriously injured at that time and your life was in full swing

329
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,867
I know you don't remember

330
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,203
But you don't have the right to blame us

331
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,752
You shouldn't have left so early

332
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,841
I don't know what to do

333
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,888
Say it

334
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,726
(Material storage room)

335
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,322
You shouldn't let him go

336
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,993
Then you ask him to come back, he will probably go home

337
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,079
I've tried my best, okay?

338
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,545
They don't obey

339
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,664
Am I too strict?

340
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,794
Maybe I should thank them first

341
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,853
Hello?

342
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,566
Who are you?

343
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,955
However, when the rescue arrived, the injured were unconscious and had severe blood loss

344
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,416
We believe the injured cannot survive

345
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,132
By the way

346
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,218
My grandfather fell asleep

347
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,513
He didn't sleep yesterday

348
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,598
He's worried that you're injured

349
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,976
After all, he sent you there

350
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,855
Please apologize to him on my behalf

351
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,065
Of course it's fine

352
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,361
That's why I'm here

353
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,278
Please sit

354
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,863
I'm fine

355
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,991
You really look fine

356
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,328
I'm really relieved

357
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,706
Someone reported to me before

358
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,001
A civilian was seriously injured

359
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,421
He's fine, either

360
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,881
You two

361
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,218
All recovered very quickly

362
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,264
This is a good sign

363
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,143
Please tell Mr. President

364
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:41,397
I'll visit him again soon

365
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,235
He is so weak, don't irritate him

366
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,696
You agree with whatever he says

367
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,991
That way you can make him happy

368
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,285
I should

369
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,872
What's the matter with him?

370
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,002
Don't tell me

371
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,798
You really think there are other terrorists running away

372
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,432
The severity of the situation

373
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,810
Severity of the situation

374
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,521
The identity of the victim

375
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:28,027
All our investigation resources are used to investigate the mastermind

376
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:37,119
Your locked comrade has not been framed
He's the mastermind

377
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:42,124
My grandfather has long accepted the facts

378
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,753
Until he heard that there was a delusional retired soldier

379
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,714
For the whole incident

380
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,050
Have some doubts

381
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,512
I've sued

382
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,473
You have no power

383
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,977
You can't reverse the outcome of that case

384
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,481
What about you, Prime Minister?

385
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,364
If I catch the real mastermind, you have a way

386
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,533
Face the consequences?

387
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,342
You're asking me

388
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:38,305
If your delusions come true
Can I openly and cope?

389
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,184
Listen, Captain Yu

390
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,479
You're so confident

391
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,148
Just show evidence

392
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,569
Then I'll show you

393
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,490
You will witness in person how I deal with those

394
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,077
The bastard who broke the legs of our president

395
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,855
Want breakfast?

396
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,905
I'm almost frozen to death here

397
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,617
It will get colder at night

398
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,286
What do you want to eat?

399
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,716
(Ringer sound volume)

400
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,119
(Ten years ago)

401
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,081
Is it that painful?

402
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,549
No therapy can defeat aging

403
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:42,971
How is your treatment?

404
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,433
Great, thank you for inviting me

405
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,522
It's my honor to know NBA players

406
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,485
How great it is to be able to live forever with your body

407
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,655
Do you want to exchange it with your company?

408
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,573
Can't use my company

409
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,327
But it is good to trade money for your youthful strength.

410
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,289
Don't be so sure, you want to be young?

411
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,416
Young and not long

412
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,210
Yes, Ruz?

413
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,838
There are novices who want to play me at any time

414
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,800
18, 19-year-old boys, they never feel tired

415
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,884
I hate them

416
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,679
I hate death

417
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,515
I hate death, that's terrible

418
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:30,310
I don't need to be reincarnated, I'm not interested in the next life

419
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,648
You will probably be the fourth richest man in the world in your next life

420
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,150
I have endless money to spend

421
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,236
With my power, I can handle everything in one sentence

422
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,530
I should live a thousand years

423
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,283
Is there a way for the human body to survive for a thousand years?

424
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:48,412
More than a thousand years, the life of a human body living for ten thousand years

425
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,289
Will definitely come

426
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,124
I'll make it happen

427
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,502
Then I want to be the first, Mr. President

428
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,545
Of course it's fine

429
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,881
Then you will have one or two hundred years

430
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,258
Can play like a teenager

431
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,344
And I will always be there to watch the game

432
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,187
Ten years have passed

433
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,776
Loose skin

434
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,111
Fragile teeth

435
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,864
Aging organs

436
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,202
I want to replace them with new organs, and I will live forever

437
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,997
I'm more worthy than anyone

438
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,540
Life is forever

439
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,087
Why wait? You've confirmed it with your own eyes

440
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,799
His wound may not be that deep

441
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,092
Maybe the bullet just brushed him

442
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,178
He will know if it is dissected

443
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,514
Dissect him?

444
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,182
That person is still alive

445
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,851
That way, I know what transplant he did

446
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,562
Only by comparing us with their replication technology

447
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,272
Find out their secrets for success

448
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,861
I'm going to fire all my researchers

449
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,406
Before dissection

450
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,866
I've been waiting for a lifetime

451
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,453
In case of transplant

452
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,039
What if he was rejected by his body and rotten inside?

453
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,000
I understand your doubts, you can wait, you are still young

454
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,419
I'm not young, I'm almost 40 years old

455
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,213
And I'm almost 70 years old

456
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,215
You don't look like someone who is almost 70 years old

457
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,550
But I can feel

458
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,594
Even if you have a good night's rest

459
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,513
The whole body still hurts as if it had been beaten

460
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,100
Representative Yin has just been involved in a gun battle

461
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,311
If something happens to Captain Yu, it will only make them more alert

462
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,813
Are you standing with them?

463
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,066
Why do you always protect Yin Zi?

464
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,111
Boldness and recklessness are different

465
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,155
I don't want to listen to your preaching.

466
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,199
This is what you said

467
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,076
I learned it from you

468
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,161
Father

469
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,500
He is now like a goose that can lay golden eggs

470
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,919
We're going to take it slowly

471
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,298
Can be done like someone chasing her

472
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,550
Not caught her, but instead caught her bodyguard

473
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,929
Having said that, we owe those people, as...

474
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,015
What are their names?

475
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,726
-Aqi Forest
-right

476
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,645
Thanks to them, her bodyguard was injured

477
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,815
We finally know it's time to take over BF

478
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,423
What?

479
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,344
It doesn't matter, he's his own

480
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,846
but…

481
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,269
Where have you been?

482
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,359
Let's go in

483
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,036
(Chest scan treatment)

484
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,539
Because you're seriously bleeding
We lost 1.6 liters of cultured blood

485
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,168
Also added to cultivate muscle fibers in your wound

486
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,713
Your broken ribs and arm muscles

487
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,800
The surgery itself is very simple, it cannot be called a transplant

488
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,843
The point is whether they will

489
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,262
Fusion with your cells or being rejected by your body

490
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,931
But according to your current situation

491
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,349
The result is very successful

492
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,688
Artificial hematopoiesis may cause the number of red blood cells to go wrong

493
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,189
Causing heart disease

494
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,650
Am I wrong?

495
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,360
No

496
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:52,239
You have the only screening test
and obtained approved artificial blood

497
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,824
Don't I know the only one?

498
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,325
It has not been approved yet

499
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,164
There are no side effects in cultivating muscle fibers

500
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,833
We're not sure yet

501
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,334
Over-dividing of cells

502
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,296
There are also derivative cell cycle problems

503
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,882
We don't know when that will happen

504
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,095
Don't you know?

505
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,347
You exercise frequently, you must know

506
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,141
It is strong muscle fibers

507
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,936
Let your fractures and gunshot wounds recover so quickly

508
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,313
Blood is also bone recovery

509
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,565
Very important factor

510
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,736
Then why treat my ears?

511
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,404
Your ears?

512
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,115
-Is there any?
-Yes, wait a moment

513
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,244
(Audio inspection)
(12000 Hz)

514
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,624
What's that sound?

515
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,508
Turn it off

516
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,886
(Audio inspection)
(30,000 Hz)

517
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,308
It was 30,000 Hz just now, and the human ears probably won't hear it.

518
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,684
Did you help him implant the chip?

519
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,686
You want to try it too

520
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,813
If he can be fixed, why bother to hesitate?

521
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,316
「修好」？

522
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,234
Did you implant the chip?

523
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,861
If you don't like it

524
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,696
-We can remove it at any time
-Inlet

525
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,239
Extremely angry

526
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,993
That electronic chip...

527
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,871
It should be said that electronic skins are not illegal

528
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,040
It is still in the development stage

529
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:28,085
But it's almost exactly the same as the real skin

530
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,170
It can cure you

531
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,464
Who wants you to cure me? I don't have

532
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,093
Did you tell the doctor this way?

533
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,761
Don't heal your ears?

534
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,640
Why not treat?

535
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,767
Why do you punish yourself?

536
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,143
I didn't say that

537
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,438
You deliberately chose not to undergo surgery, why?

538
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,277
I'm afraid I'll become useless

539
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,614
Why is it useless to receive treatment?

540
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,699
My injuries are close to the vestibular system

541
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,076
Treatment may hurt it

542
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,370
The doctor said I might not be able to walk

543
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,415
I don't want to be a burden to my family
So choose not to operate

544
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,253
The sound is small now

545
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,547
Without noise reduction, it makes me deafening

546
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,966
Everything sounds like an explosion

547
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,884
How can I cure me?

548
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,388
Have you activated the noise cancellation function?

549
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,515
But can you still hear us?

550
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,017
Freedom, our technology has made great progress...

551
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,941
Enough

552
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,406
I said enough

553
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,369
Let him go

554
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,008
-How high is the setting value?
-Highest

555
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,843
Are you crazy?

556
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,053
I did the first time and don't know how to set it up

557
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,932
I asked him to stay yesterday, but he left

558
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,309
Lower it quickly

559
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,812
Get treatment

560
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,772
Keep your promise

561
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,403
You told me that everything will be fine

562
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,905
It's fine

563
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,616
No one will get hurt, okay?

564
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,451
You said no one would be injured

565
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,745
You're leaving, you're lying

566
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,163
Keep your promise?

567
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,750
We meet on the first day

568
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,461
I want you not to use me as a cultured meat for experimentation

569
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,381
When will you treat wealth as your life?

570
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,343
How much do you plan to use these organs?

571
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:45,013
Stop talking nonsense, you don't know...

572
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,015
Hello

573
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,890
(Class A)

574
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,382
