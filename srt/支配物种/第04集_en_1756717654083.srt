Do it

11
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,385
I said to the left

12
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,358
What's this?

13
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,654
Is this true?

14
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,577
He called Kim Sung-sun and arrived in Vietnam this morning

15
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,703
(Rewards of 30 million won)

16
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,831
He may get a fake passport there

17
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,792
Just find out his new identity and tell me

18
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,130
Why do you want us to find people in Vietnam?

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,923
You guys have a connection there

20
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,342
All the agents know the local forgery group

21
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,426
Intermediary?

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,639
But this bounty...

23
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,683
This number...is not enough

24
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,476
Stop talking nonsense

25
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,566
Would you really give 30 million?

26
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,775
It seems you're very curious

27
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,861
Give me the information

28
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,450
Hello

29
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,121
Call soon

30
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,749
It's me, I'm looking for your boss

31
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,961
Call him to listen, bastard

I didn't expect you to work so close

37
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,388
I was very sorry that I didn't have a chance to meet
It seems you're better now

Finally want to take a photo with a newcomer like us

42
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,577

Did you come as my son or as prime minister?

49
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,670
Of course it's the Prime Minister, President Xianyu

50
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,131
Yeah? I'm so honored

51
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,633
Hello

52
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,220
A strange rumor came from a country in the south

53
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,765
It's about your company

54
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,601
Have been searching for someone

55
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,482
Found it?

56
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,026
So is it true?

57
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,069
are you free?

58
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,157
You mean me?

59
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,575
Yes, Representative Yin

60
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,450
I've seen you on several occasions
But because of your entourage

61
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,577
I haven't had a chance to say hello

62
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,661
Not a escort

63
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,163
Just a flatterer

64
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,874
Why do you want to see me?

65
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,627
Of course it is for business negotiation, otherwise?

66
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,338
-Representative Yin
-yes

67
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,547
You're in trouble

68
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,928
You also know there will always be some ups and downs

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,596
Sell ​​it to me

70
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,393
-What?
-Your company, BF

71
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,478
How about 32 trillion won?

72
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,272
Buy lab and cell culture technology

73
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,275
You can keep the fashion department and other subsidiaries

74
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,528
Just hand over yours

75
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,988
Headquarters, laboratory and cell culture technology are good

76
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,782
32 trillion won

78
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,895
Let me apologize to him, please

79
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,025
Let him in

80
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,969
When I was in Yazoran

81
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,763
Are you next to me?

82
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,600
Yes

83
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,271
There were two officers at that time

84
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,024
Escort me

85
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,902
Except for you

86
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,112
There is still next to me

87
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,239
An officer

88
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,825
How is he doing?

89
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,370
He sacrificed his life for the country

90
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,339
I don't know he's dead

91
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,051
No one told me

92
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,764
We're not able to protect you

93
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,975
Sorry, Mr. President

94
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,957
When did you

95
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,584
Tell the peers to work hard?

96
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,964
Does anyone know in advance?

97
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,550
What did you say?

98
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,761
Who said he could come in?

99
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
Who let this bastard come in?

100
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,559
It's me, he's here to apologize

101
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,644
Father, you are not wrong?

102
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,855
He didn't even know that there were bombs in his military camp

103
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,692
You actually went there to encourage these idiots?

104
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,319
Where is your team leader?

105
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,238
Tell him to come here to kneel

106
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,575
He went overseas

107
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,285
Investigate this attack

108
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,245
How dare you look me in the eyes?

109
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,455
Don't do this, it's enough

110
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,749
Captain Yu

111
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
Let him go

112
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,169
You should also be calm

113
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,382
He's a wounded soldier

114
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,593
Even though you're injured

115
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,928
But our president is now disabled

116
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
You made him unable to walk again

117
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,309
He is the president of our country, my father-in-law

118
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,831
32 trillion won

119
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,250
With that money...

120
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,631
Other people's opinions are different from those of the company's boss

121
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,008
They all say that the money you make belongs to the company

122
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,718
We can't even spend it at will

123
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,721
You should enjoy the life of a young, successful woman

124
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,390
You should spend money and enjoy life

125
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,937
I've encountered many merger and acquisition invitations

126
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,441
But I didn't expect you to bid

127
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,652
So you have rejected a lot of bids

128
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,153
Until now

129
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,073
I believe you know very well

130
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,118
The meat-cultivated market will soon enter the Warring States Period

131
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,121
Under the development of technology, similar products are launched

132
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,040
Will make the competition very intense

133
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:06,957
Representative Yin

134
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,085
This is exactly what I want to say

135
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,379
Can you hold on?

136
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,882
Dominating the market is not easy at all

137
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,966
That's right

138
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,428
I've learned this since I was a kid

139
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,847
This market will face an ice age

140
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,892
Just like the previous home appliance market

141
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,519
But Dawson can bear it

142
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,813
Because it has many subsidiaries

143
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,982
Can the BFs of only a few subsidiaries hold on?

144
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,860
Who knows how long that period will last?
10 years? 20 years?

145
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,281
Representative Yin

146
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,450
You must not lose

147
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,203
Your market dominance

148
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,373
You reject those bids

149
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,084
It's for this day

150
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,544
For me

151
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,505
For this meeting

152
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,894
This meeting is indeed very precious

153
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
But this decision is not easy

154
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,694
I'm sure you'll need some time to think about it

155
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,654
I have time

156
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,741
I have

157
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,659
Very plenty of time

158
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,456
I will visit and reply to you soon

159
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,265
Are you leaving?

160
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,309
Why are you the only one?

161
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,020
Mr. Yu left in an emergency

162
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,938
He said that to me, too

163
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,024
Didn't he report to you in advance?

164
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,737
Sorry, he will notify you before leaving

165
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,160
She said she had a lot of time

166
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,954
Delegate Yin said she has plenty of time

167
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,459
That might be how she feels now

168
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,836
She's still young

169
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,050
If you are missing outside, you will be dead. Let's go

170
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,347
I don't know you're still in touch with him

171
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,849
-who?
-He's that guy

172
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,018
The person in the hospital

173
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,770
You've known it a long time ago

174
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,940
Of course I know

175
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,526
Why did he send him to monitor Yin Zi?

176
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,321
What's wrong? I think this decision is good

177
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,158
"Representative Yin, I'm not an ordinary bodyguard

178
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,495
When you are in danger, I'm by your side."

179
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,082
Who made this good decision?

180
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,211
Your grandfather?

181
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,422
He actually used me to install his people

182
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,132
You agreed at the time.

183
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,969
You said we should try our best to install our people

184
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,637
I thought it was your idea

185
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,138
If it weren't for me

186
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,808
Yin Zicai won't hire former officers as bodyguards

187
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,604
Grandpa didn't use you, he just didn't have the chance to tell you

188
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,982
I know you're divorced

189
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,860
But you should go and see your ex-father-in-law occasionally

190
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,197
I'll ask you, the old man has installed a letter

191
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
Have you found out what happened to her?

192
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,121
His informant seems to have not yet gained the trust of Representative Yin.

193
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,624
That's not easy

194
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,378
Unfortunately, his informant has found nothing

195
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,255
If he doesn't do anything well

196
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,257
We can always find other uses for him

197
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,728
32 trillion won

198
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,399
I can remove the public identity
Use that money at will

199
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,027
I won't use it again

200
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,530
Worry about production results or force yourself to meet investors

201
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,533
I can only focus on my research

202
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,078
But why did he offer that price?

203
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,164
He has everything

204
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,918
Why is he so anxious?

205
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,837
Sorry, it means

206
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,758
I'll make sure he won't leave his post again

207
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,302
I'll call him and ask him to come back soon

208
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,679
He

209
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,183
What's wrong with him?

210
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,310
-He has scars on his face
-I asked him

211
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,395
Did you get beaten up by someone else

212
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,481
But he's the same as me

213
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,150
It's a type that won't say anything easily

214
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,362
He should have told me first before leaving

215
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,821
That's right

216
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,033
He even depends on me when he enters the company building

217
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,870
He always asks me to help him open the door

218
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,290
What's wrong, representing?

219
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,043
fine

220
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm going to the hospital

221
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,340
Why are you looking forward to it?

222
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,592
The point is not me, it is Miss Hong

223
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,302
She just woke up

224
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,055
That's it

225
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,434
I'll tell her that you're very excited when you hear the news

226
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,104
Director Wen, if...

227
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,606
We can sell part of the company

228
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,902
Do you think we can only sell the cultivation meat technology?

229
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,153
Sell ​​only that?

230
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,030
Sales company or laboratory

231
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,617
Is it possible that the other party will not know about other facilities?

232
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,538
Who are you talking about?

233
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,540
Dawson's Fresh

234
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,505
He will soon doubt our intangible assets

235
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,341
He will also doubt our tangible assets

236
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,676
After all, it's Dawson

237
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,555
But you're still moved

238
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,432
The conditions must be very attractive

239
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,228
What's up? What's wrong?

240
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,107
What conditions did he get...

241
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,942
Really

242
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,408
(Yu Caiyun)

243
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,161
What's this?

244
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,955
Professor Kim flew to Cambodia and got a Thai passport

245
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,541
His new name is Songchaitlan

246
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,918
He is not in Vietnam?

247
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,755
Wait a moment

248
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,300
Yes, represent

249
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,428
What?

250
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,805
etc.

251
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,976
Professor Kim ran from Vietnam to Cambodia

252
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,687
Then get a Thai passport?

253
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,235
I'll report it now

254
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,863
I'll go back soon

255
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,996
How did he...

256
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,293
I'm lucky

257
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:08,921
"luck"?

258
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,008
Even though he passed by land, I found him

259
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,854
I synced it

260
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,023
It will connect to our application as soon as it is launched

261
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,900
You mean Jiang Yingshi?

262
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,862
Thank you for your hard work today

263
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,263
Did I do something wrong?

264
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,726
If you want to lie, just lie, but don't push it to luck

265
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,357
You mean I got his photo?

266
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,735
Why am I lying to you about this?

267
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,330
People who appear at critical moments of an accident

268
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,582
It turned out to be a bodyguard

269
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,666
Don't touch her

270
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,376
And I'm looking for a bodyguard

271
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,005
And he was working somewhere else

272
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,923
But he just resigned

273
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,341
If not for this

274
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,219
I feel like I'm stealing without hiring him

275
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,181
Then I found out that he had experienced the same hack

276
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,683
This is a symbol table in Russian and Korean

277
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,936
Our company has just been scared

278
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,355
Not only that

279
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,442
He has been to Azoran like me

280
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,444
And today...

281
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,573
How about my bodyguard

282
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,285
Always have something I need?

283
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,540
When I saw that photo

284
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,002
I admire you for finding him

285
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,256
But this time when you come back

286
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,426
I thought to myself...

287
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,430
"How could he have this photo?"

288
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,021
Why don't you speak?

289
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,233
You should be angry

290
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,526
I'm questioning you, not grateful

291
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,698
You should say I'm hitting your morale

292
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,835
It seems I haven't done it yet

293
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,673
If the client feels suspicious and uneasy, I am dereliction of duty

294
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,883
You should make...

295
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,557
The final decision

296
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:17,109
I can get his photos
It's because I'm determined to catch him

297
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,196
Even if the attack is not a citizen X

298
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,573
I still want to catch it

299
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,410
Anyone who spreads ransomware

300
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,376
Naval Intelligence Command was hacked
What is your military rank?

301
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,837
Captain

302
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,755
Captain?

303
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,174
So you have to take responsibility

304
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,634
right

305
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,012
That's why you were sent overseas?

306
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,097
It was my own voluntary

307
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,849
Because you want to serve overseas?

308
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,394
no

309
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,937
Because you feel bored?

310
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,398
Don't want to wait for the intelligence unit?

311
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,192
I'm adding to the salary

312
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,154
I heard that I have no place to spend money overseas, so I can save money

313
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,241
Not bad

314
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,784
I regret it very much

315
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,787
But now

316
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,999
I want to make a difference

317
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,879
I've talked to the migrant agent

318
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,674
I think they know the most about illegal immigration

319
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,053
That's the only place I can help

320
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,477
Has the police found him?

321
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,603
Prime Minister

322
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,147
BF's Kim Hon is heading to France

323
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,150
-Who told you?
- Director

324
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,068
Take me over

325
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,826
According to BF's line report

326
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,871
We traced a 56-year-old man named Songchaitlan

327
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,623
Departed from Cambodia

328
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,626
Arrival at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in three hours

329
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,003
And arrested by airport police

330
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,298
French authorities

331
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,884
He also issued a red wanted order from Interpol

332
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,388
He will be deported to South Korea soon

333
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,182
We'll arrest him tomorrow morning

334
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,225
(Son: What did you do?)

335
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,816
Why don't you tell me?

336
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,110
I'm not sure if there will be any gains

337
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,237
But the bounty is 30 million

338
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,655
That's my money

339
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,824
Your money?

340
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,327
You should have asked for the payment before.

341
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,122
How to say it?

342
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,667
That wouldn't be cool

343
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,049
-Do you want to drink it?
-I'll do it

344
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,552
Director Zheng will send you the money

345
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,345
Including you promised to give

346
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,514
The bounty of those in Vietnam

347
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,266
No

348
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,643
But promise me one thing

349
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,772
If you leave BF, you won't work for other companies

350
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,024
-What?
-May I?

351
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,826
I'm afraid I can't do it

352
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,551
I can't allow that kind of thing

353
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,852
That scar...

354
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,188
Those agents beat you up?

355
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,232
Those terrible and lawless people?

356
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,777
I'm not beaten

357
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,071
We fought

358
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,740
but…

359
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,117
Madam, you have new information

360
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,578
The sender is the director

361
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,081
Jiang Yingshi, read it to me

362
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,002
"It's a pity, but Kim Son saves it
Died on a flight to France

363
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,046
The cause of death is suspected to be acute myocardial infarction

364
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,548
I will give you more details.”

365
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
If you want to reply

366
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,638
Please say "Jiang Yingshi, reply"

367
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,678
I know he ran away from the company with the money

368
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,429
But did Yin Zi really kill him?

369
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,558
Maybe it was her fabricating rumors that he stole money

370
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,017
(BF Jin Nan was suspected of being killed by poison)

371
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,769
So scary

372
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,774
How did Jin Shen die when he rescued him? Is it really a myocardial infarction?

373
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,733
(Michimori)

374
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,110
You already know

375
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,572
You claimed before that you didn't know he was a blackmailer

376
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,408
Some people think that it's strange that you still paid the ransom

377
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,118
What do you think about this?

378
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,372
It would be even more strange if I knew who paid the ransom

379
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,750
Some people rumored that you poisoned him, what do you think?

380
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,835
I have no idea

381
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,130
I think poisoning someone on the plane

382
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,675
A plot that only a movie

383
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,768
hateful

384
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,025
No toxic substances were found in the autopsy results

385
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,943
His coronary artery is blocked...

386
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,195
(Fresh root)

387
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,156
It's okay to leave traces

388
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,624
The deceased are a very powerful scientist

389
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,083
He is the best

390
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,170
Yin Zi killed him cruelly

391
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,547
He also used heart disease to cover up, why?

392
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,676
Because he is the person who reported that the culture medium was contaminated

393
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,971
The late Jin Shin-sun rescue

394
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,891
Tell them about their culture solution

395
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,684
Full of bacteria

396
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,021
She slandered him as a useless blackmailer

397
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,858
He also killed him

398
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,695
So, the murderer must...

399
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,863
(Exit BF)

400
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,615
Punished

401
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,080
We want Yin Freedom to disappear

402
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,040
Representative, don't come to the Seoul branch

403
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
(Director Zheng Haiden)

404
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,167
You can't come here

405
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,803
Take me to the headquarters

406
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,264
Sorry, are there any other options?

407
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,893
If you mean my home, construction is underway.

408
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,479
No, I should have told you earlier

409
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:14,442
These protesters are looking for you
Will first lock in the headquarters and Seoul branch

410
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,405
It's easy to guess that you'll be in one of them

411
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,865
After the hacking incident

412
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,869
You shouldn't step in
Laboratory, headquarters or Seoul branch

413
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,623
Should I not go to work because of a South American gangster?

414
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,000
Now is the era of globalization, and they may...

415
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,962
Come running all of a sudden

416
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,802
Ask Director Zheng to find a restaurant

417
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,102
Is there any problem that way?

418
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,020
No

419
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,568
It is impossible to be unobtrusive in a hotel

420
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,028
(High-quality meat)

421
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,098
I can't find a hotel with free rooms on the entire floor

422
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,977
But Agaolo Hotel will check it out
How many rooms can be cleared around the suite

423
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,437
So wait a little longer

424
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,857
But we've been wandering around for 30 minutes

425
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,402
Most hotels have been fully booked these days, so I'll look for them again

426
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,405
Take me to the headquarters

427
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,074
Just go there

428
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,203
yes

429
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,249
Damn, why do they insist on protesting on New Year’s Eve?

430
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,837
represent

431
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,799
Please bear with it for a day

432
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,218
Where are we going?

433
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,679
-To this address
- Start guiding the route

434
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,598
City gate hole?

435
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,059
What's there?

436
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,763
You can stay here

437
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,274
There are only three entry points here, crossing this wall...

438
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,862
And the walls between these houses

439
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,824
Can't see the inner wall from here

440
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,409
We have to watch from the yard

441
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,954
Then I'll go patrol first

442
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,331
Anyway, we have to take turns

443
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,332
good

444
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,614
May I have your name?

445
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,207
Trouble

446
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,463
This is your home

447
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,301
Can I get in?

448
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,137
good…

449
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,765
This is your room

450
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,935
We'll take turns patrolling you'll be able to sleep

451
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,023
What? You little scoundrel

452
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,649
What's wrong?

453
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,238
Why are you like this, Manzhi?
You never welcome me home

454
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,494
Do you don't like your master?

455
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,370
Don't answer that question

456
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,881
It's suffocating

457
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,592
Because its name does not match

458
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,220
Its handsome appearance

459
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,556
Its name was taken by my mother

460
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,893
Better than your name

461
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,770
It will live a long life

462
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,232
It was originally a stray cat

463
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,192
That name is hope it has a strong head

464
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,652
It was originally petite

465
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,572
"Manzhi" must be the strongest name in her mind

466
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,075
But it hides when it sees a man

467
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,494
Never come out to greet me

468
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,206
Has anyone hurt you on the street?

469
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,129
Your house is beautiful

470
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,755
This house?

471
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,509
I grew up here, not paying attention

472
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,804
I'm at your parents' home?

473
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,097
Then your family...

474
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,932
It's OK, they're in the United States

475
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,892
My sister is there

476
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,311
My mother has moved here recently

477
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,233
She lives with her daughter

478
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,069
That must be not very comfortable...

479
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,031
Didn’t you already know?

480
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,033
I thought you did a background check

481
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,871
I won't remember everything on my employee resume

482
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,455
There are a few thousand people

483
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,678
It's going to melt in your hands

484
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,098
I owe you once

485
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,102
How are you?

486
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,359
You must feel unfair

487
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,531
You are not familiar with Li Wenkui
But I suspect you are his confidant

488
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,076
Doubt your motivation to join BF

489
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,663
You know people related to Yazolan

490
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,790
I'm also asking for trouble

491
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,960
Even if you regret going there

492
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,298
I'm asking if you're OK, not me

493
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,720
You should be more unfair than me

494
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,809
Yesterday I was the murderer of the animal industry

495
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,103
Today I was accused of poisoning and killing people

496
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,689
What's the difference?

497
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,067
The former is a tragedy

498
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,986
It is an inevitable result of changes in the world

499
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,573
You did speed up that process

500
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,660
But if you didn't kill Jin and save him, that was a misunderstanding and slander

501
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,703
I'm misunderstanding

502
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,790
So what if you feel unfair about slander?

503
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,918
Then what?

504
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,464
As long as you are innocent
It should deny the allegations and prove your innocence

505
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,386
After that

506
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,472
I can't do anything suspicious anymore

507
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,059
But I don't plan to do that

508
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,146
I'm not going to stop

509
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,406
I think you and I are destined to doubt each other

510
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,201
Because you seem to be insinuating

511
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,331
I may be guilty because I don't seem to be very sad

512
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,210
I know you have nothing to do with his death

513
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,755
-Is she here?
-right

514
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,842
Oh my God, this is so heavy

515
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,306
Wait, give me a minute

516
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,274
This box is so heavy, what is inside?

517
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,151
Go inside and open it

518
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,739
Please enter

519
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,711
I understand, it's a real house

520
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,386
Protect her if necessary

521
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,265
-Loaded?
-No

522
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,483
You can take it apart

523
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,110
Have you used it?

524
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,909
- Are these bulletproof?
- Just do not shoot directly at close range

525
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,953
We're going to deal with more lunatics now

526
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,748
Getting permission is not easy, carry them with you

527
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,832
yes

528
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,752
I'll hire more bodyguards as soon as possible

529
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,630
They can temporarily live in the next house

530
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,090
So you can stay

531
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,551
next door? Where are the residents there?

532
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,513
I offered 10 million a week and they moved away

533
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,681
I borrowed the entire house

534
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,558
Can I rent it for the same price?

535
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,352
-I…
-I'll leave tomorrow

536
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,561
Do you feel uncomfortable?

537
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,149
So...what will happen after New Year's Day first?

538
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,318
All the hotels are full of people

539
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,612
May I?

540
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:08,906
certainly

541
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,161
Good night

542
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,504
When will Miss Hong come back to work?

543
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,090
She will come back after New Year's Day

544
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,675
Please come to see me then

545
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,592
yes

546
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,761
Very comfortable

547
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,223
Should I stay here overnight, too?

548
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,475
-No
-Good night

549
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,046
Give me a minute

550
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,217
Do you know I have nothing to do with his death?

551
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,803
Then what are your doubts?

552
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,975
Have you ever killed someone?

553
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,397
Is it his family? His wife who has cancer?

554
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,903
Please come in, Director Zheng

555
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,488
I'm very suspicious

556
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,574
You'll kill people because of personal factors

557
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,619
But for your business?

558
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,163
Is it possible?

559
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,247
Ask Director Zheng...

560
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,833
Come in

561
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,592
(No blood)

562
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,637
Her hands and feet died of degenerative brain disease

563
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,514
She doesn't interact with her family

564
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,476
After two crises, she severed relationship with her family.

565
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,022
The first time she was in the early days of BF
When you owe huge debts

566
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,192
The second time was after her mother successfully listed on BF

567
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,027
Convicted of financial fraud in 2022

568
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,238
Two years later

569
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:16,158
Yin Zixian announces that she will stop paying debts for her family

570
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,368
(delete)

571
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,703
(Do you want to permanently remove the file?)

572
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,903
Happy New Year

573
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,657
He has gained more than just her trust

574
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,200
Was he ordered to tempt her?

575
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,453
I didn't expect that she likes the military type

576
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,665
But how could she go to the bodyguard's house? How shameless

577
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,041
What did your grandfather say?

578
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,294
After Yu Caiyun lured Yin Zi to his house

579
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,379
Must have already returned to him

580
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,173
The bell ringing ceremony has just ended

581
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,259
I haven't had a chance to talk to him yet

582
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,219
You call me as soon as you finish the conversation

583
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,097
I'll call him tomorrow, it's very late

584
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,224
So education is very important

585
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,518
I can't believe she's sleeping at his house

586
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,603
She has no morality

587
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,271
Those stupid nouveau riche

588
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,606
I wish you all your wishes come true this year

589
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,026
I've received enough blessings
I just need one thing

590
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,527
goodbye

591
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,486
good

592
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,541
Representative Yin rejected his father's offer

593
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,962
He doesn't want to do any mergers and acquisitions now

594
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,715
BF is like that woman's child

595
00:43:55,674 --> 00:44:00,679
But children are not as precious as their own life.

596
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,805
She will give up

597
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,976
I know it's there

598
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,647
They just hide it very well

599
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,068
Grandpa, did Captain Yu repay you?

600
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,409
Thanks

601
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,433
The unique features of BF sensing installation

602
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,811
It's its special fabric and structure

603
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,354
Do you think that is entertaining?

604
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,649
This is an advertisement

605
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,360
Advertising must also be entertaining

606
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,863
But that's like a manual

607
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,741
It means that the function is very important...

608
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,162
But we will use the second version

609
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,583
Hello, Prime Minister

610
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,337
Am I available? Now…

611
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,799
I see

612
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,845
It's okay, I was in the car

613
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,265
goodbye

614
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,770
Does he want to see you?

615
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,524
There has never been any good thing when I received the call suddenly

616
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,155
He didn't mention me, you can go there by yourself

617
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,908
-Go to go
-yes

618
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,531
Representative Yin

619
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,868
What's wrong?

620
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,745
Sorry, but I have to go out

621
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,121
Where are you going?

622
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,874
A police station's bullet room was robbed

623
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,544
terribly sorry

624
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,507
I have to go over and decide whether the president wants to be present.

625
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,008
It's okay, go quickly

626
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,676
I invited you here

627
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,846
-I'm rude
-You don't need to explain

628
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,181
It's time for you to set off

629
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,776
You're over?

630
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,738
Yingshi, searching for "Today's police station's armed bullet room was attacked"

631
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,448
Have you received the list?

632
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,616
Eight pistols

633
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,243
Five hunting guns

634
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,663
150 live ammunition, two magazine rifles

635
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,039
Four radios

636
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,542
Three grenades

637
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,710
Grenade?

638
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,214
The Prime Minister will arrive in 30 minutes

639
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,969
(BF Center Road)

640
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,181
Yes, the report just released

641
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,766
But this is the latest news

642
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,561
It said, "A large number of police station ammunitions were stolen."

643
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,439
Dare to steal the weapon room, there must be some shameless scumbags

644
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:56,999
(In construction)
(Please do not pass)

645
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,917
(Traffic Police)

646
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,544
We are working on the construction, please turn around

647
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,380
Do we want to take a detour?

648
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,384
Turn around

649
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,747
Do we want to take a detour?

650
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,946
Reversing, lowering your body

651
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,574
-Why?
-Download your body

652
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,122
Open the window

653
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,211
Hold tight

654
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,969
hurry up

655
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,230
come out

656
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,405
English, police

657
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,616
OK, do you want me to call the police?

658
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,350
Walk

659
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,771
Walk

660
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,174
Are you scared?

661
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,259
Why?

662
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,053
This will be better

663
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,640
How to die than a brain hole

664
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,226
This will be faster

665
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:45,977
Just get one injection

666
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,239
represent

667
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,740
represent?

668
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,243
It's fine

669
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,746
No one will get hurt, okay?

670
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,711
I will protect you, I will accompany you

671
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,672
Have you heard it?

672
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,546
You're OK

673
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,425
Breathe, keep breathing, you're fine

674
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,104
