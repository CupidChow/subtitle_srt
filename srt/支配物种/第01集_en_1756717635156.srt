Dominant Species

3
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,008
Which meat do you like?

4
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,101
I asked this question four years ago

5
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,272
"What kind of meat do you like?"

6
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,535
But I don't need to ask you guys again

7
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,707
Because BF successfully succeeded in 2022

8
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,501
Commercialize the cultured meat

9
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,963
Global consumers are about our meat products
Showing an overwhelming preference

10
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,965
That's our solution

11
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,341
(High-quality meat)

12
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,637
（BF）
(No blood)

13
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,515
But I've asked similar questions

14
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,103
It has something to do with what kind of clothes you like

15
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,247
Kill, slaughter

16
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,001
"If you want to enjoy meat, can you only sacrifice animals?"

17
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,588
(BF successfully cultivates fur)

18
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,050
Fifteen years ago

19
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,053
BF was created based on this issue

20
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,181
Thanks to everyone, we can achieve it

21
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,892
An astonishing 72% market share

22
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,693
Now we can say confidently

23
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,112
Our serving meal

24
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,074
More transparent and safer than ever

25
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,409
Meat that needs to be slaughtered

26
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,453
Has become a past

27
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,121
This is by everyone

28
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,542
Excellent achievements created with BF, a biotech company

29
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,941
(BF 2025 press conference)

30
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,902
Dear guests

31
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,447
Please welcome those who turn the impossible into the possibility

32
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,907

(VIP invitation letter)

34
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,844
Hello everyone, I am Yin Zi

35
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,180
First of all, I want to thank everyone

36
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,018
Take time to participate in BF on Christmas Eve

37
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,352
New product launch conference

38
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,439
How are you?

39
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,693
There was a news channel last year

40
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,905
Selected me as the most greedy woman in the world

41
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,825
It doesn't matter if you agree with them

42
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,952
I'm really greedy

43
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,662
I'm never satisfied

44
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,873
Do you know?

45
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,668
Cell culture only requires original feeding and feeding of livestock

46
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,504
One percent of the land required

47
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,509
It can produce the same amount of food

48
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,095
Have you already known it?

49
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,389
What about this matter?

50
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,516
Everyone knows that a cow is produced

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,519
Is there more greenhouse gases than a car?

52
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,647
Why do I ask clearly?

53
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,607
(Kim Sun rescues)
(The leader of the third group of BF research)

54
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,484
Because I want to boast

55
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,486
I'm very proud

56
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,445
(Xu Xi)
(Head of BF laboratory research group)

57
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,406
BF contributes to preventing global warming

58
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,574
(Hong Xinye)
(The youngest medical team cadre in the BF laboratory)

59
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,410
But we're not perfect yet

60
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,246
「BF」

61
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,790
「毋血」

62
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,044
Some people pronounce it as "beef" in English

63
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,214
That's really a good fit for a room

64
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,049
The company that produces meat

65
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,926
but

66
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
Maybe we should

67
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,764
Change the company name

68
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:42,193
We have incorporated water production into the business map

69
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,695
We refuse to be complacent

70
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,447
Cultivate only meat on land

71
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
Dear guests

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,035
Here is an introduction to you

73
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,580
Our finale at the end of 2025

74
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,346
How does this new product taste?

75
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,641
All these dishes are cultivated meat?

76
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,892
That's right

77
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,770
BF not only successfully cultivates livestock

78
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,648
It also successfully cultivated seafood in the top four consumption

79
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,902
That is tuna, salmon, mackerel, shrimp

80
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,066
All the fish in the sea are dead

81
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,776
I can't catch any

82
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,779
That's awful

83

(Zheng Haiden)
(BF Legal Counsel and Director of Strategy)

84
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,663
I have to tell you something

85
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,624
Our seafood does not include

86
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,501
Three things

87
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,921
Parasites, plastic particles, mercury

88
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,924
Our products will not only not see blood

89
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,717
Nor dangerous

90
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,845
Please use it slowly, everyone

91
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,680
We can produce unlimited meat

92
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,608
I have a dream

93
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,489
There are things that must be achieved

94
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,076
That is one day we don't have to make food anymore

95
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,286
Destroy the world

96
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
Me and my company

97
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,375
Will make that day come sooner

98
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,919
I promise you

99
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,005
In six months, we will successfully develop

100
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,757
Various cereals and food crops

101
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,551
Like rice and potatoes

102
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,261
Even palm oil that destroys the jungle

103
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,388
We will all be successfully trained

104
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,307
I promise you

105
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,642
Six months later

106
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,853
We'll meet here again

107
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,491
Please welcome Professor Jin Shinjiu from BF Laboratory

108
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,755
Hello everyone

109
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,716

Jin Shin-shun of BF Laboratory

111
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,638
I'll just watch this when I'm speechless.

112
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,309
I'm very soon

113
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,769
Will retire

114
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,481
As a PhD in Biotechnology…

115
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,739
They've surrounded the entire building

116
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,617
We ask Yin Zi to apologize

118
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,121

If you want to get on the highway, you can only walk here, but you will encounter a traffic jam

140
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,428
Sorry, the representative

141
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,140
What did you say?

142
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,351
If you want to get on the expressway, you can only walk here.

143
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,770
But I'm sorry, it means

144
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,537
It's the end of the year

Don't hurt her spine

151

You have to wait for the ambulance

152

Represent, you have to hold on

153
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,271
Who are you? Do you know him?

154
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,482
Don't know

155

160
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,882
Have you found out about your identity?

(Shan Yuzai)
(Current Prime Minister)

162
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,011
He went bankrupt because of BF, a livestock industry man in his 50s

163
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,804
The monitor caught him

164
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,598
Wandered around the overpass for an hour and a half

165
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,059
I think his goal is Yin Representative

166
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,437
He walked in the ambulance

167
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,981
How did he know where she would be?

168
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,818
BF asked the same question for the criminal police officers in charge

169
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,737
The detective said

170
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,197
That's the only way to leave the BF venue

171
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,907
And there are often traffic jams there

172
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,951
He said it would be jumping off the overpass there

173
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,703
Dropped in the ideal position on the car

174
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,329
What about Representative Yin?

175
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,665
Fortunately, she only has a few scratches

176
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,210
Oh my God

177
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,047
Send someone to visit the funeral home

178
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,174

-「另一边」？

-Representative Yin
-Yes, I got it

181
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,399
Do you have to watch it?

182
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,611
He is waiting for the best time to break your neck

183
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,497
Director Zheng went to the police to ask about the deceased

(Wenshan)
(Research Director and Leader of Research Group 2)

185
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,418
Whether it's really suicide or something else

186
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,753
All to be confirmed

187
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,423
Is the cause of death the organ rupture?

188
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,466
They said yes

189
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,512
Break the organ

190
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,181
it's a pity

191
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,517
If he fell on you

192
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,103
You're the one who broke

193
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
Isn't it?

194
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,830
He must have calculated the drop position wrong

195
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,373
I heard he suffered a lot of crimes

196
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,127
Even the last moment of his life was not going well

197
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,298
who is he?

198
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,182
Don't know

199
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,018
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

200
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,689
I brought clothes

201
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,484
Don't tell me you're working now

202
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,987
What did the police say?

203
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,823
I want them to investigate if he is possible

204
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,950
It's an incitement to him, his communication record

205
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,244
He's been to the scene a few times before

206
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,871
Are you all alone

207
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,665
But the police wanted to ask our bodyguard for a question

208
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,625
Why?

209
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,711
If it's the bodyguards

210
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,132
What about leaking the mobile route that represents today?

211
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
Sorry, the representative

212
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,345
If you want to get on the highway, you can only walk here, but you will encounter a traffic jam

213
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,805
Sorry, the representative

214
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,516
Only the driver will know

215
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,560
Her exact route

216
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
That always makes me feel very upset

217
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
Should I find a full-time bodyguard?

218
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,357
That might be more dangerous

219
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,902
She doesn't like being escorted all the time

220
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,322
We should find someone who is the best job

221
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,365
You can't always hire private insurance

222
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,491
is that so?

223
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,704
Seriously, contact a new company every time

224
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,290
It's really troublesome... No, I should say

225
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,793
We don't know who we hired

226
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,047
Did they hear it?

227
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,891
Oh my God

228
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,603
Look at these flowers, who do you guess gave them?

229
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,357
"As soon as possible, Prime Minister Xianyuzai"

230
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,569
who is he?

231
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,488
(As soon as possible, Prime Minister Xian Yu Zai)

232
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,199
He said

233
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,035
He just happened to pass by

234
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,703
-Do you know him?
-Don't know

235
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,622
Is he still alive?

236
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,831
Already just now

237
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,378
Passersby are actually willing to intervene?

238
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,046
Touch someone covered in blood?

239
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,132
I may never do it

240
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,844
He really looks like an ambulance officer

241
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,638
I seem to have seen him somewhere

242
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm so panicked right now

243
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,980
Where did I see him?

244
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,941
I also find it very curious

245
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,031
He just happened to pass by

246
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,534
It's just an ambulance officer

247
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
And you recognize him

248
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,165
How likely is this?

249
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,295
I'll definitely remember it

250
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,380
Where did you see him?

251
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,658
Full plant

252
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,496
Full plant

253
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,840
(The controversy is that the BF culture medium is full of bacteria)

254
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,769

255

256
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,739

(Research three groups of leaders)

258
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,243
don’t worry

259
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,204
I can handle it myself

260
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,665
Sorry, I should go and help you

261
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,293
Representatives are in the hospital, and I am still at home

262
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,837
Please move the thing away if you need it

263
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
I'll sort it out later

264
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,298
good

265
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,801
What?

266
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,886
What's wrong?

267
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,140
What's this?

268
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,102
Professor Jin, all files are encrypted

269
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,438
I think the computer is hacked

270
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,817
(Welcome to X Citizen)
(All files have been encrypted)

271
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,820
They asked us to follow the instructions before decrypting the file

272
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,530
I opened the description file

273
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,450
Then see this

274
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,703
They'll get it within 48 hours
Bitcoin worth 80 billion won

275
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,539
Only then can we unlock the computer in our lab

276
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,916
and all archives

277
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,251

Successfully decrypted any file

282
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,847
We were scared?

283
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,724
How could it be?

284
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,060
A security officer is coming from home

285
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,353
You have to ask him to know

286
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,604
Only the laboratory was hacked?

287
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,648
What about the headquarters or Seoul branch?

288
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,400
They are all fine, only the laboratory is scared

289
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,987
It was a hacker who posted the article

290
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,532
Do you claim that our culture medium is full of bacteria?

291
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,909
I just arrived at the newspaper

292
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,703
I'll ask for their source

293
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,163
Repay to you immediately

294
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,498
We only know at this moment

295
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,168
Anonymous tips say our research is illegal

296
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,088
And the use of the meat cultivation

297
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,383
The culture medium is full of bacteria

298
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,926
that's all

299
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,639
I'm on the road, but the traffic jam is serious

300
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,558
Everyone has a place to go

301
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,351
I'll arrive soon, hang up the phone first

302
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,435
Me too

303
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,437
So, goodbye me

304
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,606
How could this happen?

305
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,567
I can't turn on my computer

306
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,901
Files made by yourself

307
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,070
That's how ransomware

308
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,031
Imagine someone changing your password at home

309
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,367
Ask you to exchange for ransom

310
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,410
New password

311
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,872
So what do you say about the culture medium?

312
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,500
I made those serums, who is it...

313
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,585
This doesn't make sense at all

314
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,395
Yingshi, search for articles about BF bacteria

315
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,815
There are 1003 related articles

316
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,899
That's it

317
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,151
There are so many articles

318
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,653
If I were to read them, please say

319
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,947
"Jiang Yingshi, read articles about BF bacteria"

320
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,116
No, get out

321
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,244
Miss Zheng, your words should be more kind

322
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,039
If only we had received the report

323
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,749
We'll verify from you

324
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,126
"It is said that you do illegal research

325
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,254
The culture medium is still full of bacteria, is it true? ”

326
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,674
After all, I'm so familiar with you

327
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,553
How do you know that every news organization receives tips?

328
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,930
Because there are dozens of recipients

329
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,682
All are news organizations

330
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,352
Is it sent by email?

331
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,355
I thought about deleting it

332
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,066
Because I'm afraid I'll be cheated

333
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,736
But it is sent to the vast majority of people in the industry

334
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,781
I don't want to be excluded

335
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,664
"Most people think that the culture medium for feeding meat is clean

336
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,165
But that's not the truth

337
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,626
BF culture medium is full of bacteria

338
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,212
In short, it is bacteria

339
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,050
BF has been selling meat fed with bacteria."

340
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,303
Is it true?

341
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,471
(High sugar)
(DMEM medium)

342
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,640
The person who said those things was wrong

343
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:05,975
So it's fake?

344
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,269
As the largest entrance website in South Korea

345
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,563
You can find out who the sender is

346
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,110
They also broke the news anonymously, but they will probably be arrested soon

347
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,448
I'm tracking IP address at the Internet Zhenxing Institute
Searched for their emails

348
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,908
What's the result?

349
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,577
IP is in Canada, but the address does not exist

350
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,162
As for the email...

351
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,456
「史洛斯基」

352
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,083
「史洛斯基」？

353
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,086
Is it their name?

354
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,298
This IP address and name...

355
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,345
Let me find this

356
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,514
I opened the description file

357
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,475
Then see this

358
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,479
Can I forward the email to me?

359
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,733
Are the rumors true?

360
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,152
Please, you're not a rookie

361
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,405
Only BF is worth being framed every day

362
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,073
By the way

363
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,242
What does Yin think of the death of animal traders?

364
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,577
Thank you for your cooperation

365
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,916
Wait a moment

366
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,337
Shouldn't she be trying hard to deny the allegations?

367
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,298
They are the messengers behind the scenes

368
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,633
People who entered our laboratory

369
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
That's it

370
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,767
This is their method

371
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,228
They attacked us from the remote end with the router on the fourth floor

372
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,565
It's 4:19 pm today

373
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,525
How do we give money?

374
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,944
This is their account

375
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,822
They want us to transfer bitcoin within 48 hours

376
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,449
That's the account?

377
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,035
Then won’t you catch them?

378
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,870
We can track them

379
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,248
Right? There must be a name behind the account

380
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,751
Maybe it's a pseudonym, but just keep checking...

381
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,212
When opening a cryptocurrency account

382
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,546
No need to verify identity

383
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,965
The exchange is not official

384
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,425
So they can't be tracked

385
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,635
How is that possible?

386
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,138
Not to mention this for now

387
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,683
Can you catch a bastard who treats my culture medium as garbage?

388
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,477
Professor, they didn't say that

389
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,062
They say it's full of germs

390
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,898
As soon as the news was reported, the people believed it

391
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,567
They are all the same, I have worked hard to study it for a lifetime

392
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,987
They're slandering me

393
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,823
Those bastards

394
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,288
How could they prepare 80 billion for us only two days?

395
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,625
They happened to be hacking in when we released a new product

396
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,044
Did they know we would be in the venue

397
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,380
Isn't anyone in the laboratory?

398
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,634
They only took 20 minutes to get into our system

399
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,554
Who knows that our protection is so weak?

400
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,685
To block ransomware, you have to completely cut it off

401
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,228
Our external network

402
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,691
Close the laboratory for two days

403
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,068
Don't let anyone in this weekend

404
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,987
Do you want to deal with it privately?

405
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,822
We must call the police and arrest people

406
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,282
But the alarm cannot guarantee

407
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,658
We'll catch them

408
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,286
Representative, what are your plans?

409
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,663
Do you really have to pay the ransom?

410
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,249
Think about it carefully, 80 billion is considered cheap

411
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,167
Because of these charges

412
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,004
The market value of third-market transactions is declining

413
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,636
What measures should you take now?

414
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,389
We have to find out if there is anyone

415
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,517
Used external networks

416
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,562
But we've told the staff twice

417
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,731
Only use the company network

418
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:45,111
We shouldn't confirm, hackers only lock files

419
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,529
Have you seen the content?

420
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,991
Those computers have core technologies in our laboratory

421
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,077
Ransomware rarely opens files

422
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,664
But no one can guarantee

423
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,083
Then we have to evaluate the loss

424
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,585
If you don't open the file

425
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,712
How much work can we do

426
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,299
Just do this, and set up a new firewall

427
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,261
Denied all charges and threatened legal action

428
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,264
Please ask the food safety agency to analyze the culture medium

429
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,433
And return the results

430
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,809
As for the hacking incident...

431
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,897
Just know it yourself

432
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,402
professor

433
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,413
By the way, it means

434
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,002
About the man I said he looks familiar

435
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,340
President Park Dae-sung of Shanghe

436
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,093
You've met him once

437
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,929
I saw this man while I was waiting outside

438
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,099
He was already on duty at that time

439
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,059
That's why I think he looks familiar

440
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,185
What post should I stand on?

441
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,728
He is President Park's bodyguard

442
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,855
I've asked about

443
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,066
This person has left his job

444
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,609
Did he resign?

445
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,819
Or fired

446
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,404
They didn't explain

447
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,863
very good

448
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,533
I only did a simple background check, do you need to go into it?

449
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,370
Are you okay...representative?

450
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,753
As long as he is not expelled, it will be perfect

451
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,463
How to say it?

452
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,975
(Oh my God, your file is encrypted
View payment method)

453
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,065
-English
-yes

454
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,111
Give me a list of companies and agencies that citizens have attacked

455
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,781
X Citizens attacked seven units

456
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,409
In July 2025, pharmaceutical company Maypal

457
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,203
January 2025, Pacific Bank

458
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,289
-September 2024…
-Jiang Yingshi

459
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,791
-yes
-Did any one pay the ransom?

460
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,793
Sorry, no related articles

461
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,837
Is there a case in South Korea?

462
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,173
Naval Intelligence Command in 2022

463
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,884
navy?

464
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,553
Read related reports

465
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,014
Sorry, I can't find the relevant report

466
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,267
They all covered up the incident

467
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,564
Intelligence Command?

468
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,240
He served in the Intelligence Command from 2020 to February 2023

469
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,161
-Jiang Yingshi
-yes

470
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,246
X When did citizens attack the Intelligence Command?

471
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,998
September 2022

472
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,959
(October 2020)
(Naval Intelligence Command)

473
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,796
「彩云」

474
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,174
Now it's reasonable

475
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,094
But why?

476
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,348
Is he the resource I should use?

477
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,685
Or should I avoid him?

478
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,260
I'm very happy to see you, please sit down

479
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,265
(Li Wenkui)
(Former President)

480
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,239
Have disappeared for a few years

481
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,452
I should have visited you earlier

482
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,954
Sorry, President

483
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,915
Don't apologize

484
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,795
You must be curious why I suddenly looked for you

485
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,425
Yes, what's wrong with you?

486
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,596
Have you participated in the BF press conference?

487
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,851
Did you send me an invitation letter?

488
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,604
Yes, it's me

489
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
You know the reason

490
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,652
I'm afraid I don't know

491
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,613
Captain Yu

492
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,410
Why do you accept invitations from strangers

493
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,623
The reason why you resigned despite President Park's comfort

494
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,500
Or, you

495
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,171
Reasons for deciding to work for President Park

496
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,967
Have you found out the terrorist?

497
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,389
not yet

498
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,767
You asked me once

499
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,813
When did I tell my colleagues about visiting the army?

500
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
And you said it was

501
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,026
Seven hours ago

502
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,945
That's right

503
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,655
Because that's the truth

504
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,367
(January 2024)

505
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,494
I'm visiting overseas

506
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,121
It is normal to be accompanied by senior corporate leaders

507
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,500
But visiting the extradition troops was a temporary decision

508
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,585
So I'll explain it to them

509
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,171
I want to have a surprise visit to the foreign army

510
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,717
Although the war has ended, the local area was originally a battlefield

511
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,885
I told them in advance

512
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,513
After all, they are all very influential people

513
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,183
I said I'll go back and they can wait on the plane

514
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,186
They were very happy to hear that

515
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,313
Want to go with me, too

516
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,439
Everything happened within 30 minutes

517
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,985
The two ministers died, so it wasn't them

518
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,031
It's not my entourage who retired due to serious internal injuries.

519
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,908
So...

520
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,537
STL President Li Nanzhen

521
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,123
Park Dae-sung of Shanghe Group

522
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,417
Han Jihao of Technology Game

523
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,503
BF's Yin Zi

524
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,796
It's one of them

525
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:07,011
Based on safety considerations
I don't even know that I'll come

526
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,182
One of them violated the order of conservative confidentiality

527
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,727
If anyone intends to use explosion

528
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,645
Fix me

529
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,856
That's one of the four of them

530
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,485
You think so too

531
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,071
That's why you're close to Park Dae-sung

532
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,573
You leave him

533
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,658
It means that the Lord is not him

534
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,453
You've changed your goal

535
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,043
Is the next target BF?

536
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,170
Just gave me an invitation letter?

537
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,590
It's Yin Zi, it must be

538
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,388
Why do you think it is her?

539
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,475
Are you implying that I have no evidence?

540
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,939
If you had it, you wouldn't have come to me

541
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,276
But you firmly believe it is her, and I want to be sure of this too

542
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,863
I want to make sure that the person who was imprisoned is guilty

543
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,241
I want to be sure

544
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,244
My retirement time has not been wasted

545
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,123
Why do you think it is her?

546
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,710
As soon as I took office

547
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,964
She asked to meet me

548
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,675
She wants me to abolish

549
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,053
Provisions on the label of cultured meat

550
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,596
Laws for genetically modified foods

551
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,726
She said both the United States and France finally accepted the cultivation of meat

552
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,478
It's a regular meat

553
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,605
She hopes I follow up

554
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,610
That shameless woman wants to trick me into sly

555
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,695
Change the law

556
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,116
And she got what she wanted

557
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,742
Because I have to step down

558
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,163
Legs gone

559
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,376
You know BF

560
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,212
How successful has it become after that incident?

561
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,047
They're growing

562
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,052
Do you know how much BF supports the current president?

563
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,150
After you've been to the hospital

564
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,361
I've been paying attention to your movements

565
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,829
Since you asked me

566
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,874
When did I reveal my surprise visit

567
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,340
You're going to investigate this without any help

568
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,885
Even if you are facing a well-known person
You're still very tenacious

569
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,515
Captain Yu

570
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,391
Let me help you

571
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,560
Let me support you

572
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,358
Even if the past events are too late

573
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:12,196
I dare say Yin Zi is still doing illegal activities

574
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,324
Check it out carefully

575
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,201
We can defeat her

576
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,080
president

577
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,416
I don't want to defeat anyone

578
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,336
You couldn't protect me at that time

579
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,506
It is your duty to protect the head of state

580
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,426
Don't repeat the same mistake

581
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,262
That shouldn't have happened at all

582
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,351
Go to find Yin Zi

583
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,311
Become her deputy

584
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,813
Gain her trust

585
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,285
(President Li Wenkui)

586
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,248
(Bluetooth Audio)

587
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,584
BF's Yin Zi

588
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,379
Facing with the American Meat Export Association with…

589
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,755
"Cowherd Beef Association's lawsuit

590
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,716
and received many death threats

591
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,690
She is building a safe house with the latest technology

592
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,693
And it seems that it is planned to stay in a different hotel before completion

593
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,910
Her hands and feet died of degenerative brain disease

594
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,704
She doesn't interact with her family

595
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,706
In addition to work-related subordinates

596
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,042
She doesn't seem to have any acquaintances."

597
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,501
Will he believe it?

598
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,089
If he doubted me, he wouldn't be a soldier

599
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,721
Always obey the orders of superiors

600
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,641
This is what the soldiers should do

601
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,021
I hope he is a full soldier

602
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,900
"Rumored that her research director and alumnus Wen Shan

603
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,985
It's because of her divorce

604
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,112
If they were actually dating

605
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,199
He may be her only confidant

606
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,159
And weaknesses

607
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,538
BF will recruit bodyguards

608
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,582
I can let you in

609
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,585
What do you want to do?

610
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,673
Do you think I have no power if I am physically disabled?

611
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,175
No

612
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,259
terribly sorry

613
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,098
Many people file for bankruptcy after BF expansion

614
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,684
Even commit suicide

615
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,268
But Yin Zi didn't even blink his eyes

616
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,772
She just wants to make more money

617
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,315
I tried to stop her

618
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,109
That's why she...

619
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,071
Get rid of me

620
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:01,949
Captain Yu

621
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,993
Isn’t it the duty of a soldier to protect the people?

622
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,039
Have you forgotten the humiliation you suffered that day?

623
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,086
salute

624
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,761
Take a break

625
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,349
I'm no matter what

626
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,269
You will be caught

627
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,652
Hello

628
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,863
I'm Yu Caiyun
