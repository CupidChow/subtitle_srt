=Episode 14=

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,750
Your Highness.

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,550
You don't need to be nervous

29
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,780
about meeting His Majesty.

30
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,390
Let's just hope the birthday banquet
goes smoothly

31
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,270
without any mistakes.

32
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,550
If anything goes wrong,

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,350
just blame it on me.

34
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:18,860
Your Highness, don't worry.

35
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,270
This isn't the first time
I meet His Majesty.

36
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,790
I will

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,460
complete my last mission

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,420
in your residence.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,140
It's getting late.

40
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,790
It will be bad if we're late.

41
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,740
You have always been on time.

42
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,070
Let's not become
the subject of criticism.

43
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,140
It's just a family gathering.

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,700
It's alright to be late.

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,460
Let's go.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,680
(Hanyuan Hall)

47
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:04,733
- Greetings, Father.
- Greetings, Father.

48
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,620
You may rise.

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,620
You've worked tirelessly

50
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,022
for days on this birthday banquet.

51
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm deliberately testing you.

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,460
But don't worry.

53
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,270
No matter how it turns out,

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,293
I will only reward you.
There's no punishment.

55
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,790
Tell me

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,222
how the preparations are going.

57
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,990
Father.

58
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,270
According
to Noble Consort's instructions,

59
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,900
the emperor's birthday banquet

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
shouldn't be extravagant

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,900
or lavish,

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,390
so I decided to set the core theme

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,990
as entering
the homes of ordinary people.

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,700
The main point
is to let you feel family bliss

65
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,270
and affection.

66
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,140
Are you saying

67
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,620
that His Majesty has never felt

68
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,900
family bliss and affection

69
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,550
in the palace?

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,740
People might think Princess Consort Jin

71
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,420
is secretly sowing discord
among the imperial family.

72
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,180
Father, that's not what she meant.

73
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,830
She's trying to say...

74
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,620
Father.

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,070
Father. Mother.

76
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,830
Princess Consort Jin is saying

77
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,550
that Father is the sovereign.

78
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,740
You care for the people

79
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,740
and govern leniently.

80
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,990
All sovereigns in the world
are a family.

81
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,420
Speaking of family bliss and affection,

82
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,030
it's a joy
shared between Father and the people.

83
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,710
Yes.

84
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,688
That's what I mean.

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,160
Alright. Tell me the details
of this birthday banquet then.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,030
Details?

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,860
Father, please look forward to it.

88
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,110
Alright.

89
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,022
You want to hold the birthday banquet
in Imperial Garden?

90
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,030
Yes.

91
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,550
Noble Consort gave us a tight budget.

92
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,740
Holding the birthday banquet elsewhere

93
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,244
will require a lot of decorations,

94
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:57,511
which is a thankless job.

95
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,670
So I might as well hold it
in Imperial Garden,

96
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,380
and it will be in full bloom by then.

97
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,350
There will be blooming flowers
and singing birds.

98
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,230
Won't it be beautiful?

99
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,670
Did I do something wrong?

100
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,260
No.

101
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,180
No.

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,707
(Imperial Garden Layout Plan)

103
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,910
It's been several hours,

104
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,470
and you're still looking at it.

105
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,790
How long do you plan to look

106
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,990
at this layout plan?

107
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,030
In principle,

108
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,470
it should be fine.

109
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,444
But I notice
something seems off with His Highness.

110
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,550
There must be something

111
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,155
I haven't thought of.

112
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,620
Alright.

113
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,380
Stop looking at it

114
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,350
and thinking about it.

115
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,260
Let's go eat.

116
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,300
Let's go.

117
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,820
Fine.

118
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,110
Wait.

119
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:11,980
(Imperial Garden Layout Plan)

120
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,060
I see.

121
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,030
Your Highness.

122
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,180
I...

123
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,910
You didn't come out for dinner,

124
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,150
so I asked Jiufeng to go
to the teahouse you favor

125
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,150
and bought some food.

126
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,300
I was just about to deliver it to you.

127
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:32,733
Thank you, Your Highness.

128
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,670
I came to see you
about the birthday banquet.

129
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,740
How about

130
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,350
we sit down and talk?

131
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,180
Your Highness.

132
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,380
I looked at the map

133
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,550
from another angle

134
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,740
and noticed

135
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,550
that Imperial Garden is long and narrow.

136
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,550
There's a forest on the south side
that blocks the view

137
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,500
and makes the security issue worrying.

138
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,380
It was rash of me to hold the banquet

139
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,550
in Imperial Garden.

140
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,910
Why don't we ask for permission
to enter the palace tomorrow

141
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,110
and tell Father

142
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,350
that it's better
to hold the banquet indoors?

143
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,550
But your performances

144
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,266
are all designed around Imperial Garden.

145
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,180
If you change it to indoors,

146
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,420
won't all your previous efforts
be wasted?

147
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,380
Besides, it's too late now.

148
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,110
How about

149
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,790
we take more precautions
on top of what we already have?

150
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,377
What do you think?

151
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,820
I...

152
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,470
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,500
What's wrong?

154
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,860
I don't know.

155
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,670
I just wanted to

156
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,180
help you complete a task.

157
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,800
I didn't mean to cause so much trouble.

158
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,420
I didn't expect it
to turn out like this.

159
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,680
I just wanted things to go smoothly.

160
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:52,777
Calm down first.

161
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,030
I used to plan everything precisely

162
00:07:59,066 --> 00:07:59,990
and demanded perfection,

163
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,860
even to the point of overcorrection.

164
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,550
But later,

165
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,150
I met you.

166
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,500
I learned

167
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,910
that no matter what happens,

168
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,620
we should just accept it.

169
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,230
You haven't eaten all day.

170
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,030
Hurry and eat.

171
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,940
Wait, Your Highness.

172
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,990
I'm not hungry yet.

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,030
Help me check this out first.

174
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,844
(Imperial Garden Layout Plan)
How do we guard this forest?

175
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,022
You just need

176
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,540
to arrange the lighting
and fire prevention in this forest

177
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,660
and make sure no one can hide there.

178
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,620
(She finally stopped
being angry with me.)

179
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,350
Is there anything else
that can be improved?

180
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,260
Here.

181
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,660
Listen well.

182
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,190
Prince Yunnuo must not know about this.

183
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,070
Do you understand?

184
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,740
Yes.

185
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,380
Guihu.

186
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,740
Good job.

187
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,430
You dare to hide things from me now.

188
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,140
I admit my wrongdoing.

189
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,380
Everything I did

190
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,710
was just to lighten your burden.

191
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,430
Guihu, get up quickly.

192
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,260
Guihu.

193
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,230
I know you have

194
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,540
always been loyal to me.

195
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:28,977
But the country is more important.

196
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
We have to consider
the overall situation.

197
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,990
Besides, she's just an ordinary woman.

198
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,260
Have you ever

199
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,110
wanted to protect someone?

200
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,350
Even if it means risking your life
and disregarding everything

201
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,860
like a moth to a flame?

202
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,740
Guihu.

203
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,380
Just let everything take its course.

204
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,950
Do as I say this time.

205
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,470
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,830
I will always wait for you.

207
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,830
Just like when we were little.

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,850
(Imperial Garden Layout Plan)

209
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,500
I couldn't have done it
without you this time.

210
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,710
Thank you.

211
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,900
Hurry up and eat.

212
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:51,440
(Hanyuan Hall)

213
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,230
Your Highness, let me handle this.

214
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,020
This is dangerous.

215
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,710
Be careful.

216
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,590
Don't worry.

217
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,620
Hang this at the back.

218
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,540
Yes.

219
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,990
Good job.

220
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,990
It's well decorated.

221
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,350
I'm very satisfied.

222
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,990
Jin, Princess Consort Jin.

223
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,950
I'm pleased with the arrangements

224
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,900
you've made.

225
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,020
Yunnuo is also involved.

226
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,430
Yes.

227
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,377
Good job, Yunnuo.

228
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,860
Jin, do you have any other surprises

229
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,950
for me?

230
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,860
Father.

231
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,500
Aliya's theme this time

232
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,710
is to celebrate with the people
and uniting the world.

233
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,620
Celebrate with the people?

234
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,710
Are you going to reward the world?

235
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,660
The people will be united,

236
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,479
but His Majesty's treasury
would be emptied.

237
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,850
It's not about rewarding the world

238
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,155
but about inviting together
the best among the people

239
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,955
into the palace
to celebrate with Father.

240
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,620
Together?

241
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,500
Well said.

242
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,140
Just do as you say.

243
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,110
Why are you poking me?

244
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,311
Let's go there and take a look.

245
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,860
- Your Highness, everything is ready.
- This birthday banquet

246
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,020
is well decorated.

247
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,140
Alright, I'm a little tired.

248
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,380
I'll go back first.

249
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,990
You've done a lot today.

250
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,990
Go back and rest.

251
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,380
What?

252
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,140
How could this happen?

253
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,660
Princess Consort Jin is a princess.

254
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,780
I don't believe

255
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,470
she would do such a treasonous thing.

256
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,310
What happened?

257
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,540
Nothing.

258
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,990
I think the palace staff
must have misunderstood.

259
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,310
Since it's a misunderstanding,

260
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:21,511
there's no need to continue.

261
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:22,830
You're easily startled.

262
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,660
It's about Princess Consort Jin.

263
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,377
I think it's better to investigate it.

264
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,660
I deserve death.

265
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,950
I deserve death.

266
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,110
What happened?

267
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,710
Your Majesty.

268
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,900
I was patrolling

269
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,020
and saw this young eunuch

270
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,350
hiding something here secretly.

271
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,560
I called him,

272
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,710
yet he turned around and ran.

273
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,740
So I arrested him.

274
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,140
I dug out this box

275
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,500
from under this tree.

276
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,020
The contents of this box are serious.

277
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,380
After inquiring him,

278
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,266
I found that he acted
on the orders of Princess Consort Jin,

279
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,500
so I sent someone to report it.

280
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,540
What's in it?

281
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:16,010
(Birthday on 4th day of the 10th month,
the 16th year of Luzhao Kingdom)

282
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,230
How dare you?

283
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,110
How dare you practice dark magic
in the palace?

284
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,660
Father, this has nothing to do
with Princess Consort Jin.

285
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,020
Father, calm down first.

286
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,830
Yunnuo, no need to rush
to beg for mercy.

287
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,540
Can I ask them some questions?

288
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,350
Go ahead.

289
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,070
Ask them thoroughly for me!

290
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,660
When you found this eunuch
burying something,

291
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,350
why didn't you report it
to Father first?

292
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,620
Instead, you reported it
to Noble Consort's maid first.

293
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,310
At that time,

294
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,740
she happened to pass by.

295
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,380
So...

296
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,830
What a coincidence?

297
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,110
You claimed

298
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,380
Princess Consort Jin told you
to bury this wooden figure.

299
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,470
Yes.

300
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,350
Did you make this wooden figure yourself

301
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,990
or did she make it herself?

302
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,260
Her Highness made it herself.

303
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,430
She gave me the box,

304
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,177
but I didn't dare to open it.

305
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,977
You didn't dare to open it?

306
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,140
So you have no idea

307
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,900
what it contained before you buried it?

308
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,470
Yes.

309
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,500
I didn't know.

310
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,020
If I knew, I wouldn't bury it
even if I were beaten to death.

311
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,710
Since you don't know what it contained,

312
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,020
why did you run

313
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,333
when the guard chased you?

314
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,380
I...

315
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,780
I was scared.

316
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,430
What's your name?

317
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,540
Chunlai.

318
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,380
There are a total of 46 eunuchs
in Prince Jin's Residence.

319
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,020
Why have I never seen you?

320
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,110
Your Highness.

321
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,200
I've been working
in Imperial Household Department.

322
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,710
Her Highness met me when she
went to Imperial Household Department

323
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,990
to claim her reward.

324
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,053
She also gave me an emerald jade token.

325
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,430
Her Highness was later
responsible for the birthday banquet.

326
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,620
This was our second meeting.

327
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,660
She gave me 100 coins

328
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,540
to bury the box.

329
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,955
You have solid reason and proof,

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,380
along with time and place.

331
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,260
Aliya, what do you say?

332
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,590
He's talking nonsense.

333
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,780
I've never met him.

334
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,620
Your Highness.

335
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,780
What I did for you
could've cost me my life!

336
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,590
Your Highness, you must save me!

337
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,470
I've never seen you.

338
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,710
Aliya keeps saying
that she has never seen this person.

339
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,020
Then why does he

340
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,644
have the jade token you gave him?

341
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,600
Imperial Household Department's ledgers

342
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,620
contain records of every reward.

343
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,830
There's no way

344
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,780
you can deny it.

345
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,740
Are you sure that Father

346
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,190
gave Aliya this jade token?

347
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,710
Of course.

348
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,580
Father gave Aliya

349
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,150
about five carts' worth of things.

350
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,820
You have such a good memory.

351
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,470
You even remember a small jade token.

352
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,630
I manage Imperial Harem

353
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,422
and remember all transactions
of Imperial Household Department.

354
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,990
Do you remember

355
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,800
the multicolored glazed lantern
that Father bestowed upon Aliya?

356
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,060
Yes.

357
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,710
But Father didn't give Aliya

358
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,020
a multicolored glazed lantern.

359
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,740
Looks like Her Highness' memory

360
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,150
isn't very accurate.

361
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,740
Even the sharpest memory
can fail sometimes.

362
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,580
Besides, what does
that multicolored glazed lantern

363
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,260
have to do with today's incident?

364
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,340
The brocade on this wooden figure

365
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,990
is specially supplied by Xilin Kingdom.

366
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,870
Can Aliya explain this?

367
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,430
Aliya doesn't need to explain it.

368
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,710
Just listen to me.

369
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,190
This brocade belongs to Xilin Kingdom,

370
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,200
but it didn't
come from Prince Jin's Residence.

371
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,820
The person who framed us

372
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,150
wanted to dump all the blame

373
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,500
on Aliya.

374
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,230
That's why they used this brocade.

375
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Father didn't bestow

376
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,020
this brocade upon us.

377
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,740
If I remember correctly,

378
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,710
I think

379
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,540
it was bestowed upon Imperial Harem.

380
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,060
Your Highness, as you said,

381
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,740
Imperial Household Department records

382
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,060
all transactions.

383
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,780
A quick check

384
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,600
will reveal the owner of this brocade.

385
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,260
Mother, I remember you told me

386
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,600
that there were thieves
in the inner palace.

387
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:28,340
Hurry and check

388
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,740
if this brocade
is also among the stolen goods?

389
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,020
Yes.

390
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,630
I did lose a piece of brocade
some time ago.

391
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,060
I have a bad memory.

392
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,377
I actually forgot about it.

393
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,950
Your Highness, your mind
changes so quickly.

394
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,990
Sometimes careful,

395
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,950
and sometimes careless.

396
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,780
How dare you?

397
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,500
You falsely accused
Princess Consort Jin,

398
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,020
and now you accuse me too!

399
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,870
Someone, come.

400
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,580
Arrest him.

401
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

402
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,300
I deserve to die!

403
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,340
I shouldn't have wronged Her Highness!

404
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,060
Stop!

405
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,230
I deserve to die!

406
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,230
I deserve to die!

407
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,150
Father, you witnessed

408
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,577
everything that just happened.

409
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,430
This guard and Chunlai's statements

410
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,190
are highly inconsistent.

411
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,300
Noble Consort has asked you here

412
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,466
for a thorough interrogation.

413
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,540
Now that Aliya has been proven innocent,

414
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,820
Aliya and I

415
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,780
will continue
to plan your birthday banquet.

416
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,950
The rest

417
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,230
is is up to you.

418
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,111
(Birthday on 4th day of the 10th month,
the 16th year of Luzhao Kingdom)

419
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,333
I will now take my leave.

420
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,340
Aliya, let's go.

421
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,540
I deserve to die!

422
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,580
I deserve to die!

423
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,500
I deserve to die!

424
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,990
Your Highness.

425
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,710
Thank you for just now.

426
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,470
Do you still have
the mandarin duck handkerchief

427
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,780
I embroidered for you?

428
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,260
I knew my memory

429
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,430
isn't that bad.

430
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,540
This was among the items
bestowed upon me.

431
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,870
Do you know
how to cooperate with me in acting now?

432
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,430
You're influenced
by those you associate with.

433
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,630
Noble Consort

434
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,870
can't stand a day
without causing some trouble.

435
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,990
My eyelid keeps twitching.

436
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,870
Do you think something will go wrong
at the birthday banquet?

437
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,780
Why worry?

438
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,190
You and I are in sync now.

439
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,820
We're a harmonious couple.

440
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,630
A harmonious couple?

441
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,088
You really have nothing to worry.

442
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,740
I will do my best

443
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,230
to protect you.

444
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,990
But I don't want to be your burden.

445
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,430
You already said this before.

446
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,500
You will never be my burden.

447
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,670
You're my weakness.

448
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,060
Then I can't...

449
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,260
You can't

450
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,540
leave my sight.

451
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,740
If you really have my best interests,

452
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,150
you should stay.

453
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,740
Let's go.

454
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,150
Manman,
you weren't frightened, were you?

455
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,630
I want to apologize to you

456
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,711
on behalf of my mother.

457
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,670
It's alright.

458
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,580
Manman, did you come here today

459
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,470
just to talk to me about my mother?

460
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,733
Prince Yunnuo, I came here to say...

461
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,780
Manman, I... I know everything...

462
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,430
You're always absent-minded.

463
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,520
I've made the arrangements

464
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,000
for you to leave Prince Jin's Residence.

465
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,080
When the banquet is over...

466
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,990
Prince Yunnuo.

467
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,910
I don't want to leave.

468
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,300
Manman.

469
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,300
What are you talking about?

470
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,780
I said

471
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,390
I don't want to leave.

472
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,950
But why?

473
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,260
I can give you
everything Fu Chengjin can give you.

474
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,820
But Fu Chengjin

475
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,390
is all I want.

476
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,870
I grew up without parents.

477
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,540
(Still Waters Run Deep)
I have to rely on myself for everything.

478
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,400
I don't want
to cause trouble for others.

479
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,390
But I now found someone

480
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,950
who can face everything with me.

481
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,340
I'm really happy.

482
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,670
Prince Yunnuo.

483
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,780
I hope you'll do me this favor,

484
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,844

What do you expect?

His Majesty's birthday banquet
is in a few days.

497
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,190
The special surprise I prepared
still isn't ready.

498

help me figure out

of a surprise for the birthday banquet.

502
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,630
I'll stop talking.

503
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,930
I have to get down to business.

504
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:18,580
I have to make a contribution

505
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,780
for Prince Jin's Residence
at the birthday banquet.

506
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,430
Contribution?

Surprise?

508
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,470
What can I come up with?

509
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,780
Why don't you

510
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,470
ask His Highness?

511
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,910
No.

512
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,710
I have to come up with it myself.

513
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,190
Because

514
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,150
I also want to give His Highness
a surprise.

515
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,230

Ji Mo.

Manman, why are you here?

521
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,740
I'm telling you.

522
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,044
I have something urgent and major
to discuss with you.

523
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,340
Hurry, follow me.

This way.

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,580
Hurry.

527
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,740
Hurry up.

What is it?

529
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,740
Come here quickly.

530
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,390
Let me tell you slowly.

That's the situation.

534
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,630
So what's the surprise?

535
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,990
Surprise His Majesty?

536
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,190
This...

537
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:39,500
I just can't figure out

538
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,670
what else is there

539
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,300
that can surprise His Majesty.

540
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,870
His Majesty commands the whole country.

541
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,150
He must be happy and satisfied
every day.

542
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,500
What do I have to do to...

Mr. Ji!

544
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,670
Mr. Ji!

00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,150
Something happened to Yuanxiang, Mr. Ji.

546

Something happened to Yuanxiang...

547
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,910
What happened?

548
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,780
Come with me!

549
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,670
What are you doing?

550
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,670
Come down.

551
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:07,820
Come down.

552
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Over there!

553
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,910
What are you doing?

554
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,150
- I want to die!
- Sit down.

555
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,060
Sit down!

556
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,100
Are you alright?

557
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,390
Yuanxiang,
why are you suddenly so reckless?

558
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,870
If nothing in life goes right,

559
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,230
I might as well hang myself from a tree!

00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,060
- Yuanxiang, calm down.
- No.

561
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:28,150
I don't want to live anymore.

562
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,100
Sit down quickly.

563
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,622
Sit down.

564
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,390
Miss.

565
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,260
What's upsetting you?

566
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,740
Tell us.

567
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,630
We'll give you some advice.

568
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,950
Yes.

569
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,230
My father often neglected my mother

570
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,300
because of his business.

571
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,820
My mother died of illness

572
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,430
due to excessive worry.

573
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,260
My father took on several concubines.

574
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,390
They fought all day long

575
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,340
and ignored me.

576
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,470
I'm so unhappy.

577
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,000
- It's alright.
- It's alright.

578
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,670
I'm so upset.

579
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:04,910
I don't want to live anymore.

580
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,100
Let's sit over there.

581
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,500
Alright. Come here.

582
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,390
Here.

583
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,670
Alright, go back and study.

584
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,710
Sit here.

585
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,190
Here.

586
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,540
Sit here.

587
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,740
Yuanxiang, listen to me.

588
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,060
The next line
after "If nothing in life goes right,"

589
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,630
is "leave everything behind
and row away at dawn".

590
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,630
The meaning of this sentence

591
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,870
is that if things

592
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,630
don't go your way here,

593
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,340
a change of place can bring you freedom.

594
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,950
If you're unhappy at home,

595
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,230
you can come to the academy more often

596
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,870
or take a walk
through the streets and alleys.

597
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,230
Of course.

598
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,870
You can also come to Everything Guild

599
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,710
and talk more with Mrs. Ji.

600
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,580
You already stole Mrs. Ji.

601
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,150
I want to die!

602
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,870
Wait!

603
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,820
Yuanxiang!

604
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,060
Don't grab me.

605
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,100
I want to die.

606
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,300
Why do you want to die?

607
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,733
What are you making a fuss about?

608
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,500
Mrs. Ji...

609
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,150
Come on. Come here.

610
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,580
Why are you making such a fuss?

611
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,990
I'm just unhappy.

612
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,910
Why are you unhappy?

613
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,740
Strange.

614
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Yuanxiang is wealthy

615
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,390
but seems unhappy.

616
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,933
You can even say
that she's burdened with troubles,

617
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,990
but Fang easily eased
what's troubling her.

618
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,990
I got it.

619
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,390
I know how to surprise His Majesty.

620
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,580
What do you mean?

621
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,990
Since it's impossible
to surprise His Majesty materially,

622
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,950
let's focus on easing his troubles.

623
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:47,500
(Prince Jin's Residence)

624
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,760
You have to choose one.

625
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,390
This is too cliché.

626
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,820
This isn't fancy enough.

627
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:55,580
Are there any other options?

628
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,580
Yes.

629
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,866
You can choose to write one yourself.

630
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,260
Forget it then.

631
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
With my way with words...

632
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,230
Remember

633
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,260
the female physician
who helped me treat your legs?

634
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,710
Her husband writes very well.

635
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,390
Besides, didn't we say

636
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,870
we'd invite the best from the people

637
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,190
to celebrate Father's birthday?

638
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,500
I think it's appropriate

639
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,688
to leave this matter to him.

640
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,260
Sure.

641
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,580
If you say he can do it,
he can definitely do it.

642
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,910
The preparations
for the birthday banquet

643
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,150
are settled.

644
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,340
Can you feel at ease now?

645
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,190
I still have one thing to do.

646
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:40,300
What else is there?

647
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,190
I'll accompany you.

648
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,630
I have to

649
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,740
do this myself.

650
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,020
I want to give you a surprise.

651
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,100
You're being mysterious.

652
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,100
Yuetao.

653
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Has it been a long time

654
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,911
since we've been alone together?

655
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,340
Well...

656
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,230
Do you have anything to say to me?

657
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,100
I...

658
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,870
At this moment,

659
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,266
I want to write a poem.

660
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,622
I've prepared it for a long time.

661
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,230
Besides writing poems,

662
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,190
do you have anything else

663
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,230
you want to do?

664
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,910
It's not out of the question.

665
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,060
Stop.

666
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,300
I thought about it.

667
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,100
Poetry is good.

668
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,390
I'm Feng.

669
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,710
You're

670
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,500
Tao.

671
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,820
I

672
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,870
blow over.

673
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,020
You

674
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,390
shake.

675
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,300
Shake.

676
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,230
Shake.

677
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,340
Stop.

678
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,950
Stop shaking. I'll feel dizzy
if you continue shaking.

679
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,150
Maybe

680
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,820
I didn't write it very well.

681
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,500
No.

682
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:17,540
It's pretty good.

683
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,500
By the way,
I asked you about His Highness.

684
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,888
You haven't told me anything.

685
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,230
His Highness...

686
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,150
Jiufeng.

687
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,540
Your Highness.

688
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,150
I heard

689
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,300
all your bitter remarks.

690
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,780
If you don't tell me
some useful information

691
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,540
about His Highness today,

692
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,990
I won't let you leave.

693
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,390
Your Highness.

694
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,133
It concerns His Highness.

695
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,740
I can't tell you even if you kill me.

696
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,430
Don't worry.

697
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,470
I don't like

698
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,740
to make things hard for others.

699
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,780
Yuetao.

700
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,910
Let me tell you.

701
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,870
While preparing the birthday banquet
a few days ago,

702
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,950
I found some promising candidates.

703
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,260
They're all wealthy royal relatives.

704
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,150
Let's discuss it
and see if there's anyone suitable.

705
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,000
Your Highness.

706
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,990
Don't go too far.

707
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,470
Jiufeng.

708
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,260
Why are you so loud?

709
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,300
You scared me.

710
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,711
Well...

711
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,820
I...

712
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,580
Yuetao.

713
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,060
If you really marry him,

714
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,820
will he hit you?

715
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,780
I...

716
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,710
I won't.

717
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,060
Really?

718
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,910
Actually,
I don't know much about His Highness,

719
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,340
His Majesty and Her Majesty.

720
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,780
Here's roughly

721
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,990
how it is.

722
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,780
(As the saying goes, time flies.)

723
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,100
(More than ten years ago,)

724
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:51,066
(following Luzhao Kingdom
and Xilin Kingdom's marriage alliance,)

725
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,910
(villains schemed)

726
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,870
(to accuse that Her Majesty's son)

727
00:32:55,066 --> 00:32:56,500
(isn't of His Majesty's bloodline.)

728
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,630
(Rumors spread in the palace.)

729
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:00,977
(Her Majesty burned Imperial Harem
in anger.)

730
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,780
(After a blood test,)

731
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,710
(her name was cleared.)

732
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,580
(After this incident,)

733
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,400
(Her Majesty grew weary of the world.)

734
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,666
(She locked herself deep in the palace
and ignored everything outside.)

735
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,820
That's what happened.

736
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,780
Her Majesty is a bit irrational.

737
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,711
What are you talking about?

738
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,786
I mean

739
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,500
Her Majesty is too pure-hearted.

740
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,060
Women who are purer-hearted

741
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,470
tend to overthink and get stuck.

742
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,950
She hasn't accepted it,

743
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,910
but I have.

744
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,230
You accepted it?

745
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:39,000
Your Highness.

746
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,111
What do you want to do?

747
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,950
Are you dumb?

748
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:42,340
I asked all these questions

749
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,580
just to find Her Majesty

750
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,950
and reunite the family.

751
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,780
Do you know where Her Majesty lives?

No problem.

756
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,740
I'll use a silver needle to wake him up.

757
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,540
I don't believe

758
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,310
that gynophobia is so difficult to cure.
