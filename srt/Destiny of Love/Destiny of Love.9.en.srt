Bilian...

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,030
The audacity of her!

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,500
Bilian?

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,270
Why are you back here?

31
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,900
It's...

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,580
It's nothing.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,620
Wait a minute.

34
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,200
Stay still!

35
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,110
Stop right there!

36
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,020
Bilian!

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,300
Jiufeng.

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,140
Jiufeng!

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,110
Help!

40
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,270
Help!

41
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,420
Jiufeng...

42
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:40,911
Your Highness.

43
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:43,900
What are you panicking about?

44
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,700
Bilian tried to poison Prince Jin.

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,977
She then ran away
and went back to Noble Consort

46
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,177
after getting caught red-handed.

47
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,580
Well, is Princess Aliya hurt?

48
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,020
She is all fine.

49
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:58,755
That's great to hear.

50
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,300
Deal with Bilian as soon as possible.

51
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,066
After all, Brother won't let it slide.

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,790
I feel so hot...

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,350
It's hot...

54
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,830
It's hot...

55
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Did I let him call me Manman last night?

56
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,300
What do I do?

57
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,380
Manman.

58
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,910
You're awake.

59
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,150
Who said you could call me that?

60
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,260
Only my father...

61
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,500
Only my parents can call me that.

62
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:37,990
Fine.

63
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,030
Freshen up and have your breakfast, Aliya.

64
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,955
That was close.
I almost gave myself away.

65
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,030
I'm as quick-witted as ever.

66
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,720
(Benevolent and Kind)

67
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,470
Yuetao. Jiufeng.

68
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,470
Are you alright?

69
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,910
We're all fine.

70
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,380
But she dared try to poison

71
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,590
you two!

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,230
She's truly unbelievable!

73
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,030
Even so,

74
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,740
Bilian works for Noble Consort.

75
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,666
And she came here following the decree.

76
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,670
Is there anything we can do about her?

77
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,300
The easiest way

78
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,420
is Aliya and I seek
an explanation from Noble Consort.

79
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,755
Do I have to be there too?

80
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:30,490
(Hanyuan Hall)

81
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,910
Physician Bilian,

82
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,500
how dare you!

83
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,470
I didn't expect you

84
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:37,866
to cause trouble
at Prince Jin's Residence.

85
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,910
Your Majesty.

86
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,710
Bilian

87
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,710
doesn't look like that kind of person.

88
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,790
Besides, she's a reputable figure
at the Imperial Hospital.

89
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,470
Prince Jin and Princess Consort Jin
might have misunderstood her.

90
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,110
Father,

91
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,288
I am telling the truth.

92
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,380
Bilian.

93
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,300
You were recommended by Noble Consort.

94
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,790
However, you've committed
such a grave crime!

95
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:03,470
Your Majesty!

96
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,940
I did that because I
was left with no choice!

97
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,133
You were left with no choice?

98
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,790
I've worked
for Imperial Hospital for years.

99
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,940
I wouldn't say I'm skilled,

100
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,670
but I remain professional

101
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:16,955
when it comes
to treatments and prescriptions.

102
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,710
And that is the reason
why Her Highness cannot accept me.

103
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:22,860
What do you mean?

104
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,740
Your Majesty.

105
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,590
Her Highness knows nothing
about medicine.

106
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,644
The method she used
to treat His Highness's legs

107
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,155
was worse than those of charlatans.

108
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,620
If I'm not mistaken,

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,180
Princess Consort Jin is a fake!

110
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,990
This woman

111
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,030
is definitely not the Princess of Xilin!

112
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,590
Bilian.

113
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,683
Are you aware

114
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:49,000
accusing an imperial family member
is a great crime?

115
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,710
I dare not!

116
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,470
Please exercise your judgment,
Your Majesty.

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,260
Everyone knows

118
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,670
the Princess of Xilin
is the best physician in the world.

119
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,670
But from my recent observation,

120
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,150
this woman knows nothing about medicine.

121
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,500
That proves

122
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,990
she's an impostor.

123
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,420
(Well done, Bilian.)

124
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:04,300
(Keep going.)

125
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,420
(His Majesty favors Prince Jin.)

126
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,860
(Just say what I told you.)

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,910
(It doesn't matter
whether she's a fake or not.)

128
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,180
(If she can't cure his legs,
she will be executed.)

129
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,990
(When Xilin gets upset about it,)

130
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,670
(Prince Jin will be implicated.)

131
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,380
(There will be no way
turning back for him.)

132
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,740
Father.

133
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,380
Aliya is my wife.

134
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,030
She is also the one treating my legs.

135
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,180
My legs are already showing
signs of improvement.

136
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,740
She is truly a divine physician.

137
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,777
That cannot be faked.

138
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:30,670
Please look into this thoroughly, Father.

139
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:33,844
That is precisely the problem,
Your Highness.

140
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,350
Because she is your wife,

141
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,550
you should all the more avoid suspicion.

142
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,590
Your Majesty,
please exercise your judgment.

143
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,910
I, Bilian, swear on my life

144
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:48,380
Princess Consort Jin
is definitely not the Princess of Xilin.

145
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,088
Princess Consort Jin,

146
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,511
do you have anything to say?

147
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:53,600
I...

148
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,740
Father,

149
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,110
she is obviously framing me.

150
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,620
Bilian,

151
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,420
do you have any evidence
to back your claim?

152
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,230
I...

153
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,230
Enough.

154
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,470
Whether she is genuine or not,

155
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,230
we will find out right away.

156
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,590
Here.

157
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:14,910
Summon Imperial Physician Liu.

158
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,688
Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,550
Take Bilian away.

160
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,110
Once I get to the truth,

161
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,470
I'll make my decision.

162
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:34,700
(Hanyuan Hall)

163
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,860
Imperial Physician Liu is here.

164
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,660
Your Majesty,

165
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,780
to ensure fairness in this test,

166
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,780
I picked several commoners
from the market

167
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,110
to come with me to the palace.

168
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,350
How thoughtful of you.

169
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,070
Her Highness,

170
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,740
acupoints, prescriptions,
and pulse-taking

171
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,310
are the basics
of diagnosing and treating illnesses.

172
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,470
Let's begin the first round,

173
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:07,990
acupuncture point identification.

174
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,950
Please.

175
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,950
(I did learn acupuncture from Aliya,)

176
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,266
(but there are so many acupoints...)

177
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,990
(And the techniques are precise.)

178
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,070
(With my shallow skills,)

179
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,540
(if I actually give it a try,)

180
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,660
(I will definitely be exposed.)

181
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,110
Your Highness, please apply acupuncture
to Fengchi Point.

182
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,710
(Fengchi Point...)

183
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,430
(I think Aliya once mentioned it.)

184
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,950
(Fengchi is about two fingers wide
behind the ear.)

185
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,780
(However...)

186
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,950
(What if they ask me )

187
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,620
(to do more acupoints after this one?)

188
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,590
(I might as well give up now.)

189
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:07,990
I'm not doing it.

190
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,860
Why not?

191
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,110
Father,

192
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,230
it's because he is not sick at all.

193
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,260
Look at him.

194
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,710
This man

195
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,900
is as strong as an ox,
and he has a healthy complexion.

196
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,590
He looks full of life.

197
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,140
So he is not sick at all.

198
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,070
As a physician, I must be compassionate.

199
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,711
How could I perform acupuncture

200
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,377
on someone who is not even sick?

201
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,733
Imperial Physician Liu, am I right?

202
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,230
What Your Highness said makes sense.

203
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,260
(My goodness.)

204
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
She's the one who's sick.

205
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,310
Your Highness,

206
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,780
the second round
is a test on prescriptions.

207
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,900
This child is only four years old

208
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,430
and has merely caught a cold.

209
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,740
Please prescribe a remedy accordingly.

210
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,230
(Got it.)

211
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:45,780
Imperial Physician Liu.

212
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,310
Please take a look.

213
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,350
Your Majesty,

214
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,620
forgive me, but my knowledge is poor.

215
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,500
I do not recognize

216
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,260
the script on this paper.

217
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,140
That's not surprising at all.

218
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:17,400
This is a secret prescription from Xilin.

219
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,900
Naturally, outsiders wouldn't
understand it.

220
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,900
That's normal.

221
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,350
(How would I know how to take a pulse?)

222
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,990
(Her pulse feels different from normal,)

223
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,740
(but the problem is...)

224
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,350
I can't feel anything...

225
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,950
(Feel nothing?)

226
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,755
What's the matter with my child?

227
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,190
(Child?)

228
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,350
(She's pregnant?)

229
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:51,190
Don't worry.

230
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,540
Your child is fine.

231
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,470
You're pregnant.

232
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,430
Then why couldn't you
feel anything just now?

233
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,990
Judging from the look on your face,

234
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,660
you are carrying twins.

235
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:05,070
Just now, I was feeling

236
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,590
the pulse of the other baby.

237
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,260
Twins?

238
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,266
Your Highness,
is what you said really true?

239
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,260
Yes, it is.

240
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:16,777
Imperial Physician Liu,

241
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,666
is Princess Consort Jin
telling the truth?

242
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,350
Your Majesty,

243
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,500
please forgive my lack of skill.

244
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,470
It's too early in the pregnancy

245
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,590
to make a clear diagnosis.

246
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,488
Imperial Physician Liu,

247
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:41,777
she passed all three rounds.

248
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:42,888
What do you think?

249
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:43,933
Well...

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,190
Even after the three tests,

251
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,020
her true abilities remain unproven.

252
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,190
Letting her pass just like that

253
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,350
is rather unjustified.

254
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,020
Aliya is from Xilin.

255
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,190
Their medical practice

256
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,490
is naturally different from ours.

257
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,430
I ask you to reconsider, Father.

258
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,110
I have sought treatment
for my legs for years

259
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,990
without success.

260
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,020
Now, under Aliya's care,

261
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,500
there's finally progress.

262
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,740
I don't want to give up now.

263
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,350
Father,

264
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,190
if I could cure
Noble Consort's chronic illness,

265
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,230
then I believe

266
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,844
I can heal His Highness's legs too.

267
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,288
Noble Consort.

268
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,860
Did Princess Consort Jin
treat your chronic illness?

269
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,900
Actually...

270
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,860
Actually, Mother

271
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,310
was cured of her condition

272
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,110
thanks to Princess Consort Jin's treatment.

273
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,533
Greetings, Father.

274
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,430
Noble Consort,

275
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,140
is what Yunnuo said true?

276
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,590
It's true.

277
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,140
Noble Consort's illness
had resisted all treatment.

278
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:58,400
Princess Consort Jin,

279
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,111
what kind of medicine did you use?

280
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,830
Well, it was...

281
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,710
mystical, mysterious, and inexplicable.

282
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,430
It's something that can only
be understood, not put into words.

283
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,110
It was...

284
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,260
It was...

285
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:19,190
Could it be that?

286
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,044
Your Highness, are you talking about

287
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,540
the legendary Zhuyou Technique?

288
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,260
That's right!

289
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:30,780
(Benevolent and Kind)

290
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,020
The Zhuyou Technique?

291
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,990
She actually dared to say that

292
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,310
just to save herself

293
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,070
during that critical moment.

294
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,190
She is quick-thinking.

295
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,430
How admirable.

296
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,540
What is the Zhuyou Technique?

297
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,260
The Zhuyou Technique

298
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:50,830
is one of the 13 ancient disciplines.

299
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,500
To put it simply,

300
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,590
some Zhuyou Book says,

301
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:56,000
use incantation as the means

302
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,710
to shift the essence
and transform the qi,

303
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,200
without needing needles or herbs.

304
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,500
Hold on.

305
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,500
I simply made that up back then.

306
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,470
I know nothing about it.

307
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,110
If you don't know, just pretend you do.

308
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,380
Mr. Ji,

309
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,500
it's not something I can bluff through

310
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,230
by putting up an act.

311
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,990
Manman.

312
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,110
Remember what I always told you.

313
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,140
Listen carefully,
observe carefully, and feel it.

314
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,377
You need to have faith.

315
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,622
Whether it's the Zhuyou Technique

316
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,620
or something else,

317
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,260
I command you to heal Jin's legs

318
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,540
within a month.

319
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,950
If you fail,

320
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,644
regardless of whether you are
a real deal or not,

321
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,110
I will charge you with deceiving me.

322
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:40,590
Now that His Majesty
has made such a decree,

323
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,155
what are you going to do, Your Highness?

324
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,070
If you choose to stand for Her Highness,

325
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,380
you'll have to face

326
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,140
the power struggle
you've avoided the most

327
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,600
and inherit the throne.

328
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,860
But

329
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,110
if you choose not to stand,

330
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:56,555
you may not be able
to save Her Highness's life.

331
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,990
Worse still,

332
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,260
her true identity will be exposed.

333
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,190
You really are a good son.

334
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,066
You actually joined hands with them
to humiliate me.

335
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,910
I raised you with such care for years.

336
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,780
And your words

337
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,500
have ruined my chance
to wipe them out completely.

338
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,190
I...

339
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:23,870
Mother.

340
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,470
I was wrong.

341
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,780
So, what is going on between you
and Princess Consort Jin?

342
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,020
Mother,

343
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,630
there is nothing between us.

344
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,780
I was only afraid your recklessness

345
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:40,466
would arouse Father's suspicion.

346
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,300
Yunnuo.

347
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,630
Bear in mind

348
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,822
that we've been through a lot
to be where we are now.

349
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
If I hadn't paved the way for you,

350
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,230
your father wouldn't
even spare you a glance.

351
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,230
Just bring glory to me, alright?

352
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,710
Just this once?

353
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,670
Mother.

354
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,740
You taught me well.

355
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,470
I'll never forget it.

356
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,100
Then I hope you'll keep your word.

357
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,740
(Zhuyou Technique...)

358
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,910
(Zhuyou Technique...)

359
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,950
Master Zhuyou.

360
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,244
Where are you going?

361
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,866
You should be treating my legs.

362
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,260
I need to get back
on my feet within a month.

363
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,888
What are you doing?

364
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,230
Cheng.

365
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,060
Just relax

366
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,755
and follow my lead.

367
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,500
Cheng.

368
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,340
Cheng.

369
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,230
You have to believe in yourself.

370
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,020
Believe that you can stand up.

371
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,100
Cheng.

372
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,470
Cheng.

373
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,470
Stand up!

374
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,950
Well, didn't you just move?

375
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,780
One more time.

376
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,300
Cheng.

377
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,150
Believe in yourself.

378
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,580
Believe in yourself.

379
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,020
Believe that you can stand up!

380
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,150
Stand up. Stand up!

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,222
Stand up.

382
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,060
Stand up.

383
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,100
Stand up, Cheng.

384
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,230
Stand up, Cheng.

385
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,910
Stand up, Cheng...

386
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,020
No way.

387
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm way too tired today.

388
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,060
Let's end the treatment here.

389
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,470
We'll continue tomorrow...

390
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,670
How could you fall asleep?

391
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,910
You should at least help me
set up a pillow

392
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,500
or fix the blanket.

393
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,020
How could you just...

394
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,100
You really fell asleep?

395
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,540
Cheng...

396
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,340
Stand up, Cheng.

397
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,190
Stand up.

398
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,990
Stand up...

399
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,822
You don't stay still
even when you're asleep.

400
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:01,680
(Benevolent and Kind)

401
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,190
Your legs moved. They moved.

402
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,780
I don't understand what you're saying.

403
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,630
I said your legs moved.

404
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,060
Wait, let me check on them.

405
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,630
Hold on!

406
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:18,733
What are you doing?

407
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,340
That's

408
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,150
a normal reaction.

409
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,870
It's normal.

410
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,950
Your legs moved

411
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,060
and that's not normal.

412
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,060
Could it be my treatment
is actually working?

413
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,020
Wait here.

414
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll heal you for sure.

415
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,870
Just you wait.

416
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:45,370
(Benevolent and Kind)

417
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:50,612
(The Grand Treatment)

418
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,670
I hereby declare

419
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,090
His Highness's grand treatment

420
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,950
officially begins today!

421
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,150
Why aren't you two clapping?

422
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,580
Aliya.

423
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,870
Could you please put that big gong down?

424
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,500
No way.

425
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,020
It's the hero of the day.

426
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,540
You've taken that historic step,

427
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,533
all thanks to this.

428
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,430
Then may I have a look

429
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,430
at this gong?

430
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,820
Sure.

431
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,430
That was the first phase of treatment.

432
00:22:43,577 --> 00:22:44,533
And it's over now.

433
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,630
Now

434
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,340
we're moving on to phase two.

435
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,820
And what is phase two?

436
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,780
Hypnosis.

437
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,340
But I just woke up.

438
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,230
I said hypnosis,

439
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,390
not sleep.

440
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,780
Jiufeng. Yuetao.

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
Bring His Highness to the courtyard.

442
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,230
"Of seas once seen, none else will do.

443
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,950
Only clouds of Wushan ever compare.

444
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,300
Why look back at a garden of blooms?"

445
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,022
It's "lazy to glance again".

446
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,260
Whatever.

447
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,088
I said no talking during hypnosis.

448
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,780
"Why look back at a garden of blooms?"

449
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,580
Relax and stop holding back.

450
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,670
Your mind should be still.

451
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,990
Your heart is free from distractions.

452
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,020
Your body is all unrestrained.

453
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,780
Well?

454
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Feeling relaxed yet?

455
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,670
Feeling relaxed?

456
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,190
Didn't you just say no talking?

457
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,260
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:05,820
I forgot.

459
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,555
It's alright.

460
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,100
Let's move on to the next step.

461
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,780
The sky is no longer the sky.

462
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,540
The earth is no longer the earth.

463
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,100
The wind is no longer the wind.

464
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,390
The rain is no longer the rain.

465
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,820
Then you will be able to stand.

466
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,340
Then I won't be myself again.

467
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,390
It's fine.

468
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,100
Let's try again.

469
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,500
Jiufeng.

470
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,820
Your Highness!

471
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:41,630
Your Highness!

472
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,488
Where are you off to, Your Highness?

473
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:49,733
How careless of me.

474
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:52,555
Want some?

475
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,870
Your Highness,
considering what Her Highness did,

476
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,500
shouldn't we give her
a small punishment?

477
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:04,377
Should we scold her?

478
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,990
At least talk to her kindly?

479
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,340
She should be rewarded instead.

480
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,990
She's eager to help me recover.

481
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,990
She got a bit carried away just now,

482
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,555
but it's only because she cares.

483
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,630
Don't you get it?

484
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:18,466
Your Highness,

485
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,100
that's so unlike you.

486
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,190
But she

487
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,060
will always be my great consort.

488
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,444
Go get me some sweet potatoes.

489
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,430
Sweet potatoes?

490
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,340
Go now.

491
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,780
I'm still the same.

492
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:46,260
(Prince Jin's Residence)

493
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,580
Why are we buying sweet potatoes?

494
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:53,150
What are you doing here?

495
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:54,340
I'm not here to see you.

496
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,230
Why should I tell you?

497
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,580
This is Prince Jin's Residence.

498
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,990
I'm His Highness's personal guard.

499
00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:59,470
You have no right to keep it from me.

500
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,844
I'm not here for Prince Jin either.

501
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:01,819
Then who are you here for?

502
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,777
Princess Consort Jin.

503
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:03,990
What do you want from her?

504
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm not telling you.

505
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,259
If so, you can't come in.

506
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,590
Is that Princess Consort Jin's order?

507
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,577
None of your business!

508
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,300
Same old rules.

509
00:26:27,572 --> 00:26:30,340
(Rising Clouds Across The Four Seas)

510
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,190
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

511
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,540
I won.

512
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,740
I lost again!

513
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,990
Stop looking at me with that smile.

514
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,430
It makes me nervous.

515
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,670
Have respect for the deities.

516
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:57,066
That's the way it is.

517
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Your Highness,

518
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:00,870
I'll perform a dance for you first.

519
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,870
Just relax and enjoy.

520
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,820
Look at me.

521
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,710
Just keep looking at me.

522
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,260
Don't blink.

523
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:27,820
Don't blink.

524
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,000
Now you see a bright spot
in front of you.

525
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,150
Imagine becoming one with that.

526
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,950
Now you're tired.

527
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,230
If you're tired, close your eyes.

528
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,780
Your eyelids are getting heavier.

529
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,630
Heavier and heavier.

530
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,580
Your mind is getting foggy.

531
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,500
Your mind is going completely blank.

532
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,580
Take a deep breath.

533
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,820
Breathe in. Breathe out.

534
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,740
Breathe in. Breathe out.

535
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,340
Breathe in...

536
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,780
They're acting so indecently

537
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,300
in broad daylight!

538
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:16,950
Breathe out.

539
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,670
Yuetao...

540
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,870
Quick.

541
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,500
He's asleep!

542
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,288
Congratulations!

543
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,300
I've nailed it on my first try.

544
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,230
How impressive I am!

545
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,780
You're brilliant, Your Highness!

546
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,500
Your Highness,

547
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,500
I'll count to three.

548
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:37,888
You can wake up after that.

549
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,630
Three, two, one!

550
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,300
Why is he

551
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,150
still asleep?

552
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,630
You can wake up now.

553
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,500
Three, two, one!

554
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,990
Did you accidentally

555
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,260
kill him?

556
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,150
I don't think so.

557
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,990
Your Highness?

558
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,630
Cheng?

559
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,020
Fu Chengjin?

560
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
Looks like His Highness

561
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,740
is just sleeping.

562
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,060
Fu Chengjin?

563
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,555
Your Highness?

564
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,500
Your Highness!

565
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,740
Where am I?

566
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,870
What am I doing here?

567
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,260
Well, do you feel anything?

568
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,150
What?

569
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,260
I mean the effects of hypnosis.

570
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,540
I've had a nice nap.
Now I feel quite good.

571
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,780
Wait, don't...

572
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,670
Don't you feel anything else?

573
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,190
I do.

574
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,430
I feel quite dizzy from your shaking.

575
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm doomed.

576
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,190
This time I'm done for.

577
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,430
Aliya.

578
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,740
Don't lose hope.

579
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,060
You can keep hypnotizing me.

580
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,390
I really did have a nice nap just now.

581
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:17,990
Go on.

582
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,422
Your Highness.

583
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,260
If you're enjoying this,

584
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,260
I'll do as you wish, then.

585
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,870
You... You're standing!

586
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,580
Yuetao!

587
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,540
Hurry!

588
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,500
Your Highness!

589
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,300
Your Highness!

590
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,622
- I'm feeling weak...
- Quick!

591
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,820
Your legs are healed!

592
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,950
You just stood up!

593
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,910
I tried really hard to stand up,

594
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,630
but then my legs gave out again.

595
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,020
Now I can't feel anything.

596
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,630
How useless I am.

597
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,670
I can't heal you.

598
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,740
Aliya.

599
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,430
Don't be discouraged.

600
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,500
I'll stand again one day.

601
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,630
If I can never walk again,

602
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,390
will you stay with me?

603
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,355
You're blessed, Your Highness.

604
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,630
You'll surely recover.

605
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,430
So, will you stay with me

606
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,340
or not?

607
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:15,577
I will.

608
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,820
I will definitely heal you.

609
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,150
You clearly fancy me,

610
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,800
but you just won't admit it.

611
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,670
This woman.

612
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:44,820
Guihu.

613
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,950
Why are you standing there?

614
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,020
Get over here.

615
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,280
I told you to send the invitation
to Prince Jin's Residence.

616
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:56,577
Why are you back here already?

617
00:32:58,155 --> 00:32:59,044
Your Highness.

618
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,333
Princess Consort Jin
isn't worthy of dining with you.

619
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,430
What do you mean by that?

620
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,780
In broad daylight,

621
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,466
Prince Jin and Princess Consort Jin

622
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,777
were being indecent in public!

623
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,466
What?

624
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,740
They...

625
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,133
Maybe they were doing
some sort of treatment.

626
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,260
But that didn't look like one.

627
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,300
Enough, Guihu.

628
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,377
Keep an eye on them.

629
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:30,111
Whether it's the Prince Jin's Residence

630
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:31,377
or Everything Guild,

631
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,866
don't let your guard down.

632
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:34,244
Yes, Your Highness.
