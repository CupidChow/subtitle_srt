=Episode 21=

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,630
Ridiculous!

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,670
He is your father.

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,060
A ruler guides his ministers,
and a father guides his son.

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,933
How could you speak
to your father like that?

31
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,155
Go and apologize to him.

32
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,830
I am talking to you.

33
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,750
Did you hear me or not?

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,580
I heard you.

35
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,244
Then why are you not going?

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,488
I will not.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,700
So now, you won't even listen to me?

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,220
Have you lost your mind or do you think

39
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,840
you've grown
too strong to be controlled?

40
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:12,866
He is your father!

41
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,460
I know.

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,644
Even if you have problems with him,

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,088
you should not say things

44
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,466
that would break his heart.

45
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,700
When has he ever cared about me?

46
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,110
If he never cared,

47
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,140
then how could his heart be broken?

48
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,900
I will ask you one last time.

49
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,180
Are you going or not?

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,110
All these years,

51
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,466
everything I have suffered,
every hardship and injustice,

52
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,177
was all for your sake.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,950
And now you won't even listen to me?

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,860
Guards!

55
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:54,400
Take Prince Yunnuo back to his residence.

56
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:55,666
Let him reflect on his actions!

57
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,180
Guards!

58
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,180
Guards.

59
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,266
What is the meaning of this?

60
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,510
Mother, your health is poor

61
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,300
and you need rest.

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,755
Without my permission,

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,390
Noble Consort is not allowed to leave.

64
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,230
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,377
You intend to confine me to my palace?

66
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,180
I wouldn't dare.

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,350
I only hope

68
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,270
that you have a quiet

69
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,180
and comfortable place

70
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,711
to recuperate and heal.

71
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,420
I'm your mother.

72
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,350
And this is how you treat me?

73
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,110
Mother?

74
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,900
Mother...

75
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,400
Did you ever raise me with real care?

76
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,140
Play with me?

77
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,830
Laugh with me?

78
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,510
All my life,

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,555
all you did was discipline
and control me.

80
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,620
You only see me as a vessel

81
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,244
to carry your unfulfilled ambitions.

82
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,488
Every time something upset you,

83
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,590
you poured it all out on me.

84
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,180
I know Fu Chengjin came to see you.

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,420
It was you two

86
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,133
who conspired to kill Qiao Manman.

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,770
I cannot forgive that.

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,890
So please, from now on,

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,890
do not interfere in anything I do.

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,250
Otherwise,

91
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,250
I can't promise what I might do.

92
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,840
From this day on,

93
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,960
I will walk

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,960
my own path.

95
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:00,422
Whatever the outcome, good or bad,

96
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,960
is my own to bear.

97
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,933
Your Highness. There is a secret
memorial from the imperial censor.

98
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:03,160
It may be related to Prince Jin.

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,650
I heard a while ago

100
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:08,488
the imperial censor's men have been
asking about Prince Jin all over.

101
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,377
Intercept that memorial

102
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,250
and find out what is going on at once.

103
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Understood.

104
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:19,480
You may go.

105
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:21,480
I want to be alone for a while.

106
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,890
It's all my fault.

107
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,920
All my fault.

108
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,520
If I hadn't been so foolish,

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,570
you wouldn't have died.

110
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,010
I failed you.

111
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,420
(Everything Guild)

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,770
(Everything Guild)

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,570
Aliya.

114
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,160
Good morning.

115
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,480
Eat something before you go!

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm not hungry, Dad.

117
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,270
I'm running late for the consultation!

118
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,810
Madam, you're finally here!

119
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:32,480
This way, please.

120
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,450
It wasn't easy to find you.

121
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,690
You can trust us to get things done.

122
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,755
Morning, Manman...

123
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,360
Watch your step on the stairs.

124
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,360
All right.

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
Jiufeng.

126
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,360
I...

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,570
You're awake, Young Master.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,111
Breakfast is ready. Eat something.

129
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:44,800
I must get busy.

130
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,280
Come here.

131
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,130
Come here!

132
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Be careful...

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,250
Come on!

134
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,720
Good morning, Mr. Qiao.

135
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,570
It's late.

136
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,280
Since arriving at Yinyi Village,

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,890
everyone's found their place and role.

138
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,770
Except me. I still don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

139
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,770
I should find my purpose here.

140
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,410
Manman.

141
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,090
I have always believed one saying.

142
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,840
Everyone is born with a purpose.

143
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,690
You just haven't found the right place

144
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,000
to use your strengths yet.

145
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,840
Whose quote is that?

146
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,880
Sounds quite convincing.

147
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,720
That's why you must believe in yourself.

148
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,170
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

149
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,490
Let's take it one step at a time.

150
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,640
Our whole lives?

151
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,170
You'll stay with me my whole life?

152
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,570
Well, that depends on your performance.

153
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,450
I promise to be on my best behavior.

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,760
What are you doing?

155
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,530
What if my father sees us?

156
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,840
It's late. They're all asleep by now.

157
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,000
Thank you, Manman.

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
What are you two
still doing outside chatting?

159
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,840
Father, I...

160
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,210
Do you know what time it is?

161
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,760
Out here flirting under the moonlight?

162
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
Get back inside and sleep!

163
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,170
Father.

164
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,760
I was just having
a heartfelt conversation

165
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
with His Highness.

166
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,840
Still not allowed.

167
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,466
You did not marry him

168
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:11,866
as my daughter.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,050
This is inappropriate.

170
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,530
Return to your room.

171
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,488
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Mr. Qiao.

172
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,620
(Yinyi Village)

173
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,050
At noon, the farmer hoes the fields.

174
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,000
- At noon, the farmer hoes the fields.
- At noon, the farmer hoes the fields.

175
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,330
Sweat drips down to the soil below.

176
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,170
- Sweat drips down to the soil below.
- Sweat drips down to the soil below.

177
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,050
Who knows that the food on the table...

178
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,410
- Who knows that the food on the table...
- Who knows that the food on the table...

179
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,360
Each grain is the fruit of hard toil.

180
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,930
- Each grain is the fruit of hard toil.
- Each grain is the fruit of hard toil.

181
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,170
Mr. Qiao is right.

182
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,170
Manman did not marry me
as the daughter of Qiao.

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,240
It was improper.

184
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,290
But Young Master...

185
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,840
Didn't you already marry Ms. Qiao

186
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,760
at the residence?

187
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
That was different.

188
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,000
I married "Princess Aliya".

189
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,090
Not Manman.

190
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,640
There's a difference?

191
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
Of course there is.

192
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,866
Is His Highness still upset

193
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,360
over what happened yesterday?

194
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,960
I have not yet officially announced

195
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,240
my marriage to Manman.

196
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,170
So I've decided

197
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,090
I'm going to propose to her again.

198
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,170
All right. Do as you like.

199
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,410
Propose.

200
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,450
Wait.

201
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,090
Propose?

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,640
Manman.

203
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,120
What's wrong?

204
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,930
You look unhappy.

205
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,230
His Highness is going to propose to me.

206
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,810
Propose?

207
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,240
That's amazing!

208
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,450
Keep your voice down.

209
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,090
You've been waiting for this forever.

210
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,170
Yes, but that's before...

211
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,170
After overhearing it just now,

212
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:49,355
I feel a little scared.

213
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,050
I don't even know why.

214
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,240
What are you afraid of?

215
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,444
Is this not
what you've been hoping for all along?

216
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:56,444
It's a wonderful thing.

217
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't know how to explain it to you.

218
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,360
Regardless,

219
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,720
at least Prince Jin is taking action.

220
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,570
Unlike Ji Mo.

221
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,760
Not even a whisper
of a proposal from him.

222
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,210
What?

223
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
You're going to propose to Qiao Manman?

224
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,050
Didn't you two just get married?

225
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,644
That one at Prince Jin's residence
does not count.

226
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,720
I haven't officially married Manman.

227
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,000
And Mr. Qiao has not told me
to change how I address him.

228
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,840
I need to make my position

229
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,240
in the Everything Guild clear.

230
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,170
Well, that's true.

231
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,640
Sounds good.

232
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:36,240
Really good.

233
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,480
What about you?

234
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,360
Aren't you planning to propose to Aliya?

235
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
I'll pass.

236
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,530
Aliya still hasn't recovered her memory.

237
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,810
If I propose now,

238
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,360
I'd just be taking advantage of her.

239
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,330
Besides,

240
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,960
if she does regain her memory

241
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,888
and decides she is too good for me,

242
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,622
then what am I supposed to do?

243
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,050
If Aliya never regains her memory,

244
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,240
are you just going

245
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,570
to wait for her your whole life?

246
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,090
Maybe.

247
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,640
What if we find a way

248
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,410
to help her regain her memory?

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,960
How about that?

250
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,090
I mean...

251
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,120
Would that even work?

252
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,570
Forget it.

253
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,410
No way.

254
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,960
Can you grow a spine?

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,530
Dear.

256
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,290
Dear.

257
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:47,960
Aliya.

258
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
You haven't had breakfast.

259
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,111
Eat something
before you go to the academy. Sit down.

260
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,410
Sit down.

261
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:53,840
Sit!

262
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,120
All right.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
You always skip breakfast.

264
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,810
From now on, eat breakfast on time
before heading out.

265
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,640
Aliya,

266
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,330
you don't need to go
to all this trouble.

267
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,210
I can just grab a bite in the kitchen.

268
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,330
How can I let you do that?

269
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,290
You have a wife now.

270
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,050
Open up.

271
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
I can feed myself.

272
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,050
What if you burn yourself?

273
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,410
Here.

274
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,000
Is it good?

275
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:33,822
Have another bite.

276
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,690
Well...

277
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,050
I heard that

278
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,930
Fu Chengjin is planning

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,690
to propose to Qiao Manman.

280
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't you think we should...

281
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,210
You're choking!

282
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm fine.

283
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,640
Well,

284
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,690
it's late.

285
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,810
I should get going.

286
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,800
Please clean this up.

287
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,410
Wait...

288
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,290
Manman.

289
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,690
I need to talk to you.

290
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,330
Later, all right?

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,570
I have something to do right now.

292
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,480
Manman.

293
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,360
Where are you going?

294
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,960
- Dear!
- It's really important.

295
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,279
- Tell me about it.
- Manman!

296
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,729
I...

297
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,755
- Ji Mo wants to talk to me.
- Manman wants to talk to me.

298
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,960
Who wants to talk to who?

299
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,600
We need each other.

300
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,530
It's mutual.

301
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:11,400
(Is Ji Mo going to tell Manman)

302
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,755
(that I plan to propose to her?)

303
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,640
(I can't let him foil my plans.)

304
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,250
What's going on with them?

305
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,810
You haven't figured it out?

306
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:24,970
He and she have something going on.

307
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:25,680
Same for those two.

308
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:26,590
And Ji Mo and Manman...

309
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,822
Only those two don't
have anything going on. That's all.

310
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you have something going on?

311
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,511
What would I have going on?

312
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,730
Eat your melon.

313
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,680
No one else is around, right?

314
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,120
No.

315
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,840
Perfect.

316
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,600
I need to talk to you.

317
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
What a coincidence.

318
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
I was looking for you too.

319
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,920
Did Manman say something to you?

320
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,090
Did you say something to my husband?

321
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,711
I would never betray my brother-in-law.

322
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,440
And I would never betray
my sister-in-law.

323
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,810
Then let's say it together.

324
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,711
- Ji Mo decided
- Manman said

325
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,020
- he'll propose to you
- she has reservations

326
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,777
- once you regain your memory.
- about your proposal.

327
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,970
- He said that?
- She said that?

328
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,530
If I never regain my memory,

329
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,120
then Ji Mo

330
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,330
will never propose to me?

331
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,880
That's what I said.

332
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,840
What was his response?

333
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,730
He...

334
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,440
He really plans to do that.

335
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,680
Am I supposed to live out my whole life

336
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:02,730
staring at my true love and die alone?

337
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,360
I have an idea.

338
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,330
What is it?

339
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,330
You could pretend
your memory came back.

340
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,970
Pretend?

341
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,880
I don't need the glory and riches
of this world.

342
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,530
You

343
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,400
are my world.

344
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Hold on.

345
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,970
This plan doesn't seem

346
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,770
to involve me and Ji Mo at all.

347
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,530
Let me finish.

348
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,810
Carry on.

349
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,810
Continue.

350
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,160
Manman.

351
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,440
Manman.

352
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,160
Chengjin.

353
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,330
Manman!

354
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,010
Chengjin!

355
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,490
Aliya!

356
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,530
Aliya!

357
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,360
What's wrong, Aliya?

358
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,330
Aliya!

359
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Aliya!

360
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,970
Aliya!

361
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,160
Where am I?

362
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,250
Why am I here?

363
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,400
Manman.

364
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,360
Manman...

365
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,490
Sit down.

366
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,090
Sit down.

367
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,250
Take a break, will you?

368
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:31,810
Surely even you don't believe

369
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,120
your story, right?

370
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,090
Fine, then what do you think

371
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,200
we should do?

372
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,490
If you ask me,

373
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,810
we need some external support.

374
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,440
For example,

375
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,200
maybe I could hit my head against a tree.

376
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:50,955
That could work.

377
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,400
After your head hits the tree,

378
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,920
you can pretend your memory came back.

379
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,970
You're proposing to Manman.

380
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,440
I get all emotional,

381
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,050
and suddenly I run into a tree?

382
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,688
Am I dumb or just brainless?

383
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,440
Well,

384
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,770
that was your idea.

385
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
Then I will...

386
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,570
I will first

387
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,600
run into a tree,

388
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,810
then peach blossoms
fall from the branches,

389
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,050
landing all around you,

390
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,010
setting the mood,

391
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,970
and then you propose.

392
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,730
Smooth enough?

393
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,640
No.

394
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,290
You crash into the tree and faint,

395
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
and we just keep going?

396
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,777
That would make us look heartless.

397
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,200
It's fake.

398
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,680
Just pull Manman to the side

399
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,400
and explain it to her. Problem solved.

400
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,050
That kind of makes sense.

401
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,490
Might even help

402
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,120
with her fear of marriage.

403
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,730
Right.

404
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,050
I haven't seen Noble Consort lately.

405
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,600
How has she been?

406
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,920
Her Highness

407
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
has caught a chill.

408
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,120
To prevent infecting others,

409
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,770
she is resting in her palace

410
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,200
and refusing visitors.

411
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,360
Her Highness has not
set foot outside either.

412
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,490
Has the imperial physician examined her?

413
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,360
Only once.

414
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,090
Only once?

415
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,400
Her Highness dislikes commotion,

416
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,840
so the physician only went once.

417
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,120
She dislikes commotion?

418
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,010
She goes

419
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,120
wherever the commotion is!

420
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,355
How is the matter
I asked you to investigate?

421
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Your Majesty.

422
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,840
This was found
in the imperial censor's room.

423
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,355
Right after the imperial censor
met with Jin,

424
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
he ended up in an "accident".

425
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,120
This matter is more serious
than expected.

426
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:55,244
Go send someone

427
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,920
to bring Jin back.

428
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,250
Tell him I have urgent matters
to discuss with him.

429
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:01,466
Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,470
(Sun Rises, Moon Endures)

431
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,970
Do we really need to sneak around

432
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,730
just to go out and have fun?

433
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,680
This isn't sneaking.

434
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,330
It's just not appropriate for us

435
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,880
to go out with two elders

436
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,160
tagging along.

437
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,150
(Sun Rises, Moon Endures)

438
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,090
Qiao. Why are you so obsessed
with shaving and carving all day long?

439
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,422
I don't even know what you plan to do
with all this stuff.

440
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,530
You wouldn't understand.

441
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:43,969
Madam Li!

442
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,810
I wouldn't understand?

443
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,360
I'm here, Madam Li!

444
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,970
What do you mean?

445
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,533
Qiao Manman!

446
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,770
Wait for me!

447
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:54,730
What do you mean I wouldn't understand?

448
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,200
Dear!

449
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,600
I...

450
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,970
Dear, wait up!

451
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,400
Wait for me!

452
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,600
What do you mean?

453
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,640
The steamed bun shop
by the entrance is amazing.

454
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,680
I am telling you,

455
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,920
the buns there have thin skin
and are stuffed full.

456
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,600
Really?

457
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,920
I could eat ten of them.

458
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,730
What do you mean before?

459
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,244
Let me tell you something, Qiao...

460
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,160
Did you see that?

461
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,120
Did you?

462
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,090
Fu Chengjin

463
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,530
just walked past.

464
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,360
He looked majestic.

465
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:25,022
He's a wonderful son-in-law.

466
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,355
Why can't you
just give them your blessing?

467
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:29,010
It's none of your business.

468
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,355
How is it none of my business?

469
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
Let the kids live their own lives
and face their own fortunes.

470
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,440
Why torment yourself for nothing,

471
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,290
right?

472
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,530
Wrong.

473
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:40,360

Aliya. Time to put your acting skills
to the test.

489
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,330
Are you ready?

490
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,090
Yes.

491
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,570
Oh, my head...

492
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,730
I'm fainting...

493
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,730
I'm dizzy...

494
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,330
I feel lightheaded...

495
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,010
How was that?

496
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,090
It's great, right?

497
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,200
Excellent, really.

498
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,120
I'm not good at acting.

499
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,290
You could teach me.

500
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,490
Look.

501
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,530
Like this.

502
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
It's simple.

503
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:22,880
What's taking them so long?

504
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:25,010
We spent all night
collecting these petals.

505
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,010
We won't be using them?

506
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,010
You don't get it.

507
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,600
Timing is everything.

508
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,640
Just imagine.

509
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,600
The petals dancing in the wind,

510
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,730
two perfect couples pledging
themselves under a peach tree...

511
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,530
So romantic!

512
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,010
So beautiful!

513
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,422
If you like the idea so much,

514
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,090
why don't we join them?

515
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,360
Let's get married.

516
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,822
I don't want to join them
in their moment.

517
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,770
I want a moment

518
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,880
that belongs to only us...
No, to only me.

519
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,090
Fair enough.

520
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,050
When you crash into the tree,

521
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,680
use your hand to brace yourself.

522
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,160
Let your hand take the hit.

523
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,970
That will mitigate the impact.

524
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,600
Allow me to demonstrate.

525
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,400
One, two, three.

526
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,360
Fu Chengjin!

527
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,250
That was amazing!

528
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,050
Come on.

529
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,010
You give it a try.

530
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,840
All right.

531
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,570
Put my hand on the tree.

532
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,920
Let's go.

533
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,888
Let's get some food.

534
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:31,600
Put the hand here.

535
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,530
One more time.

536
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,490
All right.

537
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,010
I still don't think I can do it.

538
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,160
It's your hand!

539
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:42,290
Don't be afraid of the pain!

540
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,120
I'm not.

541
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,090
I'll give you a hand.

542
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,120
Come on.

543
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,810
One, two, three.

544
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,010
Aliya!

545
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,360
That's our cue! Hurry!

546
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,920
Aliya!

547
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,088
What's the matter with you?

548
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,530
How could you hit a woman?

549
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,360
I...

550
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,970
She's a little slow, clumsy,

551
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,200
sometimes unreasonable,

552
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,288
and not the fairest,

553
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,810
but she's still a woman.

554
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,822
I can't believe you did that.

555
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,010
Pull!

556
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,010
It's stuck.

557
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,577
I'm taking Aliya back to the village.

558
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,360
Here.

559
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
I'll help you.

560
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,770
Don't leave!

561
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,400
You're being weird.
I don't know what's gotten into you.

562
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,290

Dear,

588
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,010
Aliya, you remember?

589
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,440
Of course, I remember you.

590
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,200
You're my husband.

591
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,050
So... You don't mind having me
as your husband?

592
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,250

596
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,970
how long I have waited for this day?

597
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:53,022
Day and night,
I've been waiting for this moment!

598
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,810
Oh, right.

599
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,920
Give me a moment.

600
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,090
My mother left me this bangle.

601
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,570
She wanted me to give it
to her daughter-in-law.

602
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,570
I'll put it on for you.

603
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:14,200
This is wonderful.

604
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,440
It's beautiful.

605
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,050
Dear,

606
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,360
I feel a little peckish.

607
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:27,570
Oh, that's not a problem.

608
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,440
Mo, to the kitchen!

609
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,200
Of course.

610
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,050
I'll help you.

611
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,200
I'll be right back, Aliya!

612
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,360
I...

613
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,711
Sit with me.

614
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,490
I thought you didn't remember me.

615
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,880
I was acting.

616
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,530
Acting?

617
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,360
Yes.

618
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,010
It was a scene
Prince Jin and I rehearsed.

619
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,200
What...

620
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,810
Why?

621
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,490
Prince Jin wanted

622
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,250
to give you a romantic proposal.

623
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,530
And I wanted

624
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,680
Ji Mo to propose to me too.

625
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,120

626
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,250
Unfortunately,

627
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,770
he didn't succeed with his proposal.

628
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,120
Wait.

629
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,330
Did I hurt his feelings today?

630
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,160
Of course.

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,330
