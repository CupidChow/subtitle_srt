27
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:45,470
(Hanyuan Hall)

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,500
Prince Jin has returned victorious.

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,270
I led the army back to the capital

30
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,340
to report to you, Father.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,940
Rise.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,066
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Father.

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,910
Prince Jin led the soldiers
to repel the invaders.

34
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,390
In just a few months,

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,270
he managed to bring peace to the south.

36
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:10,460
He deserves a reward

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,580
for his feat.

38
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,911
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,620
You truly are my son.

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,790
Father, when the enemy invades,

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,620
driving them off our land

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,740
is the wish of every Luzhao citizen.

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,180
That we achieved victory so swiftly

44
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,844
is thanks to the people's
support and the court's backing.

45
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,790
I dare not take credit alone.

46
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:34,644
Martial Champion Ji Mo.

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,420
You followed Prince Jin into battle.

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,177
Such invaluable contributions

49
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,020
should be handsomely rewarded.

50
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,111
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Father.

51
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,830
Father.

52
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,110
I'm happy

53
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,488
for Jin's victorious return.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,790
But today,

55
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,580
I have an important matter
to report to you.

56
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,460
It's about Jin as well.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,711
Please make a decision
only after hearing me out.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,555
Very well.

59
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,300
You two may stay.

60
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,180
Everyone else may leave.

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

62
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,355
This concerns the fate of the nation.

63
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,020
I believe it's best
that everyone remains present.

64
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,580
Yunnuo,

65
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,950
your brother has just returned.

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,140
Can't this matter wait until later?

67
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,644
This matter is far too serious

68
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,666
for me to stay silent.

69
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,740
If you have something to say,
Yunnuo, speak freely.

70
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,990
The current Princess Consort Jin

71
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,620
is not Princess Aliya
of the Xilin Kingdom.

72
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,977
We know that my brother is

73
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,390
skilled in seemingly every field.

74
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,320
He is the perfect candidate
for Crown Prince.

75
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,133
Yunnuo,

76
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,577
the matter of succession

77
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,580
is not to be discussed recklessly.

78
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,020
Father, I only fear

79
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,300
that your kingdom

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,830
might fall into traitorous hands.

81
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,620
Stop your fear-mongering.

82
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,580
Am I fear-mongering?

83
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,066
Allow me to explain.

84
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,866
Father, do you still remember
Qiao Yuanzhi?

85
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,733
He's already dead.

86
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,860
Why bring him up now?

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,977
Exactly.

88
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,620
I found it strange too.

89
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:30,066
He is supposed to be dead,

90
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,030
so why is he still alive?

91
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:36,230
Bring him in.

92
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,844
Greetings, Your Majesty.

93
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,533
Your Majesty.

94
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,590
I was deceived by traitors

95
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,200
and made a grave mistake.

96
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,500
I beg Your Majesty to grant me death

97
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,355
to appease the people.

98
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,790
Qiao Yuanzhi...

99
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,910
I have always held you in high regard.

100
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,860
And yet...

101
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,044
As a man of unmatched wisdom,

102
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,244
you let yourself be fooled

103
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,466
and committed treason
against your own country.

104
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,470
Tell me,

105
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,030
how am I supposed to spare you?

106
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,030
I...

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,670
The damage is done.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,420
There is no defending myself now.

109
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,910
I deserve execution.

110
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,030
I ask for Your Majesty's judgment.

111
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,644
From this day forward,

112
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,740
Qiao Yuanzhi no longer exists.

113
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,990
I'll find you a hidden place

114
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,022
deep in the palace.

115
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,790
Live out the rest of your days there.

116
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,333
Remember this.

117
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,511
From now on,

118
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,600
you will stay hidden
and make amends in silence.

119
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,533
Let your deeds redeem your faults.

120
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,200
May I say goodbye
to my wife and daughter?

121
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,230
This isn't just about you.

122
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,710
It's about my judgment.

123
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,022
No one else must ever know.

124
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,590
Who is this man?

125
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,230
Father,

126
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,400
this is your old friend, Qiao Yuanzhi.

127
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,533
Yunnuo,

128
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
how could I not recognize Qiao Yuanzhi?

129
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,110
Years ago,

130
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,844
I sentenced him to death by poison.

131
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,444
He can't be alive.

132
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,200
You've mistaken someone else for him.

133
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,230
Qiao Yuanzhi should've died

134
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,790
over a decade ago.

135
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,030
But this man is him.

136
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,333
I feared being accused of deceit,

137
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,911
so I verified it.

138
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,577
After much investigation,
it's been confirmed

139
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,911
this man is Qiao Yuanzhi.

140
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,888
The proof.

141
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,350
Here's a portrait

142
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,820
and identifying marks
have been verified.

143
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,155
There's no doubt.

144
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,180
A round purple scar on the right arm,

145
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,790
and a snake-shaped scar on the left.

146
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,940
Yunnuo,

147
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,422
you've really become efficient.

148
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,550
All for easing your burden.

149
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,466
Evil deeds bring their own ruin.

150
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,230
Heaven sees all.
Self-deception is futile.

151
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,060
Qiao Yuanzhi is devious by faking

152
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,180
his own death.

153
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,940
If you don't punish him today,

154
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,577
and word gets out,

155
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,622
people will think
you are protecting him.

156
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,000
Announce...

157
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,230
my decree.

158
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,377
Your Majesty!

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,355
My father served the country.

160
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,300
He made a mistake

161
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,888
and was manipulated
into exposing vulnerabilities.

162
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,350
Please, for the sake of his past service,

163
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,500
spare his life.

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,620
Father, I have something to say.

165
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,400
Qiao Yuanzhi's treason
is beyond forgiveness.

166
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,500
Qiao Manman, his daughter,

167
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,022
posed as a princess
and replaced the real bride.

168
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,866
That's a capital crime.

169
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,200
She must...

170
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:12,200
be executed.

171
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:02,844
Your Highness!

172
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,222
Your Highness!

173
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,190
Your Highness!

174
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,540
Your Highness!

175
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,755
By royal command, bring him

176
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,200
the poison.

177
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,666
Your Highness!

178
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,200
Your Highness, I beg you, please!

179
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:23,844
Your Highness!

180
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,710
I accept the decree.

181
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,950
Father!

182
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,470
Don't take it, please!

183
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,990
Your Highness, please!

184
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,755
Manman...

185
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,230
I must obey.

186
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,190
Father!

187
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,977

189
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,590
Please, spare my father!

190
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,260
I beg you!

191
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,044
Manman.

192
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,590
I've failed you.

193
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,260
You didn't.

194
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,380
I couldn't take care of you.

195
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,260
No!

196
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,710
I deserve a thousand deaths.

197
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,310
I only beg you to spare Manman,
Your Highness.

198

Father!

199
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,430
She is innocent.

200
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,422
Carry out the sentence.

Father!

213
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,000
You pretended to be Princess Aliya,

214
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,380
and deceived me.

215
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,430
You hid your father's crimes.

216
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,140
Unforgivable.

217
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,355
By royal command, bring her

218
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,444

you want to leave?

295
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,350
But Father,

296
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,740
everything you've planned for me

297
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,710
was never what I truly wanted.

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,590

you spoke of.

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,444
Even before Qiao Manman came,

301
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,470
I already wanted to leave.

302
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,230
Now that she's gone,

303
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:30,590
what reason do I have

304
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,110
to stay here?

305
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,511
Are you throwing a tantrum at me?

306
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,500
I wouldn't dare.

307
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,622
Is it that you wouldn't, or you can't?

308
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,140
How can you be so foolish?

309
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,488
You're not a child anymore.

310
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,133
Soon, you'll be sitting on that throne.

311
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,990
Once you get there,

312
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,900
you'll hold

313
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,190
the power to shape the world.

314
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,310
There'll be nothing you can't have.

315
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,380
And you'd throw that all away

316
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,111
for a mere woman?

317
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,733

325
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,950
That's not the same thing.

you to go?

331
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,740
Then, what you'll be left with

332
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,444
is my corpse.

333
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,133

No way that ruined the whole grove.

378
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,870
Besides,

379
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,430
how do you even know
that loquats are yours?

380
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,390
Fine.

381
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:48,911
The loquats in this village

382
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,977
usually have yellow-brown seeds.

383
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,540
But mine are a new variety I grafted.

384
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,340
It has black seeds. One of a kind.

385
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,780
I even picked up the pits

386
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,230
you threw away.

387
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,820
Take a look.

388
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,470
See for yourselves!

389
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,200
Still trying to deny it?

390
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:05,022
You...

391
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,060
This is extortion.

392
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,740
We thought it was wild fruit!

393
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,977
How about this?

394
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,260
Tell us the price,

395
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:13,466
and we'll pay you back.

396
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:14,230
Can you afford it?

397
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,990
This is a new variety,

398
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:17,888
meant for tribute to the court.

399
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:18,955
Every fruit is precious.

400
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,500
And thanks to you ruining my trees,

401
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,470
next year's harvest will suffer.

402
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,670
Add that to the last two years,

403
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,650
I wouldn't settle
for less than a thousand taels!

404
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,150
A thousand taels? That much?

405
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,910
Nonsense.

406
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,066
We're not paying!

407
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,230
Is that so?

408
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,670
You all saw that!

409
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,910
The Everything Guild stole
and won't pay up!

410
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,870
They are shameless!

411
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:36,950
Exactly!

412
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,500
Hey, buddy.

413
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,390
How much do you think I owe you?

414
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,222
Alright.

415
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,911
Out of respect for you,

416
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,990
I won't overcharge you.

417
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,670
Give me this much.

418
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,933
We'll call it even.

419
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,400
Father...

420
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,150
I truly apologize.

421
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:06,955
Two taels of silver, right?

422
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:08,950
Alright.

423
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,100
Only 198 more to go.

424
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,020
What?

425
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,430
You're clearly extorting us!

426
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,820
No way it's worth 200 taels!

427
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,260
It's worth what I say it's worth.

428
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,230
Fine.

429
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:26,377
Here. Take this. It's enough.

430
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,390
This?

431
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,260
Is it worth 200 taels?

432
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,670
Take it to a pawnshop, then.

433
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,100
This...

434
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:45,422
Alright.

435
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,133
I'll take a small loss this time.

436
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,540
But let me warn you,

437
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,910
if this happens again,

438
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,870
I won't let it slide!

439
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,555
Move!

440
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,630
Father, did you see how arrogant he was?

441
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,020
Father...

442
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,888
You...

443
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,340
Why so many dishes today?

444
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,300
Allow me to explain.

445
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,780
This West Lake Sour Fish

446
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,870
was a gift from Qingge
next door for Mr. Ji.

447
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,670
For me?

448
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,150
It was for my husband, Mr. Ji.

449
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,500
Even better, it's for my son.

450
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,100
The Steamed Meatballs

451
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,866
were from the Gu family
in the next village, for the clinic.

452
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,020
Nice.

453
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,666
This one's from the cutest kid
in the village, Cao.

454
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:48,977
He brought it for Manman.

455
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,630
To thank her

456
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,870
for helping him find his lost duck.

457
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,260
And this dish is...

458
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:56,430
Braised Duck.

459
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:06,644
Your Highness.

460
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,950
We must not be well-liked.

461
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,190
No one brought us any food.

462
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,150
Who else do you want food from?

463
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,950
I made this dish just for you.

464
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:16,333
Isn't that enough?

465
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes.

466
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:18,060
Your Highness, I have food now!

467
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,666
It would be the same
no matter who it's given to.

468
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,870
Let's just eat.

469
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,950
Let's eat up.

470
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,533
Dig in.

471
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,390
Manman, eat up.

472
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:25,990
Sure.

473
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,044
Father.

474
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,044
Here, Dear.

475
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,470
It's okay. I'll get you some.

476
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,260
Just eat up.

477
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,580
Why are you smiling?

478
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,230
In the future,

479
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,470
I want to have four kids with Yuetao.

480
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,340
Four? You're so greedy.

481
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,390
How many do you want?

482
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,990
Me?

483
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,820
Just one daughter.

484
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,340
One like Aliya would be perfect.

485
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,430
That won't do.

486
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,470
Your father loves kids too much.

487
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,470
He won't agree to that.

488
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,200
I wonder when Aliya will

489
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:15,755
finally get her memory back.

490
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,910
If you ask me,

491
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,340
if you truly love each other,

492
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,977
does her memory even matter?

493
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,990
What if she remembers the past

494
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,150
but forgets everything now?

495
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,020
If she forgets me...

496
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:31,577
I...

497
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,100
Forget it.

498
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,470
No use thinking about it.

499
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,540
Aliya finally cured me

500
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,190
of my gynophobia, after all.

501
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,060
I should make it up to her properly.

502
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:51,060
Yeah, but how exactly
do I make it up to her?

503
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:52,800
I have experience.

504
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,100
Go on.

505
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,111
Back when Prince Jin

506
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:57,400
was wooing Ms. Qiao,

507
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,340
he gave her clothes and jewelry,

508
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,780
did her brows,

509
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
and made firefly lanterns too...

510
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,580
And fireworks under the starry tree.

511
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,060
He basically

512
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,300
did everything.

513
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,740
Never thought Fu Chengjin
had that side to him.

514
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,710
I really need to study up.

515
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,870
I want my wife to enjoy that too.

516
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,300
Sure.

517
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,710
It's late.

518
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,430
Still no sign of Fu Chengjin.

519
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,866
Probably on a romantic stroll.

520
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,150
But I saw him this afternoon.

521
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,430
He went out alone.

522
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,740
Seriously?

523
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:38,300
Young Master, you're back.

524
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,266
Welcome back.

525
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,870
Can I ask you two a question?

526
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm pretty handsome, right?

527
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,710
And cultured, too?

528
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,740
And I have a kind heart, right?

529
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,340
Then, why no villagers

530
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,910
brought me food?

531
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,430
That's why you're upset?

532
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,888
I thought it was something serious.

533
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,710
Yes.

534
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,390
It doesn't really prove anything.

535
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,820
Still, why didn't they

536
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,933
bring me any food?

537
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,870
Why don't the villagers like me?

538
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,470
- No way.
- That's not true.

539
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,580
Wait...

540
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,400
What if Manman doesn't like me either?

541
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,820
Honestly,

542
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,190
that is a question

543
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,540
you shouldn't be asking us.

544
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,390
We're not

545
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,470
Manman.

546
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,150
You should go ask her yourself.

547
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,955
You're right.

548
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,020
I feel like

549
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,390
today made me
even happier than yesterday.

550
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:57,133
Manman, are you happy?

551
00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:59,022
Princess Aliya, are you happy?

552
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,266
How many times have I told you?

553
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,340
Don't call me that.

554
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,311
I'm not a princess.

555
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,311
Just call me Mrs. Ji.

556
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,260
Sure.

557
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,340
Mrs. Ji...

558
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,780
Are you happy?

559
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,390
Of course I am.

560
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,630
Now, I get to see Ji Mo every day,

561
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,230
eat with him,

562
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:23,644
and pick him up from class.

563
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,800
He even takes me
stargazing under the tree,

564
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,466
and dragonfly chasing by the lake.

565
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,100
Most importantly,

566
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,500
I cured his gynophobia!

567
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,540
Now, the two of us can finally...

568
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,600
You're making me sick with sweetness!

569
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,866
So, is anything going on
with you and Jiufeng?

570
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,088
The other day under the tree
at the village gate,

571
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:44,870
I saw you two...

572
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,740
Stop!

573
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,540
Shut it.

574
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,230
Shut up.

575
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,230
Come on, don't stop me now.

576
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,400
Nope, don't say a word...

577
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:01,466
Manman, why do you look so down?

578
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,577
I feel like Fu Chengjin

579
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:08,111
doesn't love me like he used to.

580
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,540
No way.

581
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,666
Come on,

582
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:15,844
he gave everything up
to stay here with you.

583
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:18,244
He even left behind
his life in the palace.

584
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:19,711
How could he not love you?

585
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:20,622
Exactly.

586
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,111
I mean, you're not wrong.

587
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,290
But after dinner today,

588
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,866
I asked him to go for a walk.

589
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,666
And he actually turned me down.

590
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,288
He said he wanted to be alone.

591
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:42,666
Maybe it's just because
you two know each other too well.

592
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,910
I don't think that's it.

593
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,020
He was fine just a few days ago.

594
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,755
Then, suddenly he changed.

595
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:53,444
Could it be

596
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,622
because you've been too busy
helping out at the clinic

597
00:30:55,622 --> 00:30:56,511
and neglecting him?

598
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,933
I don't think that's it either.

599
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,590
Then, what is it?

600
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,777
I need to ask him tomorrow.

601
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,844
This is driving me insane!

602
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,020
Look at her now.

603
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,866
It'll all be well tomorrow.

604
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,955
It's always like this.

605
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,430
Sleep.

606
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,720
(Hanyuan Hall)

607
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,670
Yunnuo, I'm sure you've heard
about the locust plague

608
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,590
in the northwest.

609
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,755
It's been troubling me.

610
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,733
I summoned you to discuss it.

611
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,466
I want your opinion.

612
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:43,500
Father,

613
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,666
in past years, Minister Ma
handled locust disasters well.

614
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,222
Perhaps he could be
sent to the northwest.

615
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,830
He is capable, no doubt.

616
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,288
But he's also morally corrupt,

617
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,390
and arrogant.

618
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,780
Wherever he goes,
people complain bitterly.

619
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,511
He won't be able to appease the people.

620
00:32:03,377 --> 00:32:04,666
With all due respect,

621
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:07,088
what's more urgent? The locusts

622
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
or public opinion?

623
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,311
How can you say that?

624
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,955
Morals come first.

625
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,222
Without virtue, ability means nothing.

626
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,740
Father,

627
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,670
this is a critical time.

628
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,622
Why stick so rigidly to rules?

629
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:31,540
You've really let me down.

630
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,333
I'll think it over myself.

631
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,955
You may go.

632
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,630
When have you ever
pinned your hopes on me?

633
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,733
Yunnuo, what's gotten into you?

634
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,190
I suppose...

635
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,888
Yunnuo must be missing Jin.

636
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,070
I miss Jin too.

637
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,222
Of course, so do you, Your Majesty.

638
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:03,600
Father, ask yourself.

639
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,955
If Brother had made
that same suggestion today,

640
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,911
would you have said no?

641
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:11,777
Would you still question his character?

642
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,555
Ever since Brother left,

643
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,133
each time you summon me to court,

644
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,933
you say it's to discuss state affairs.

645
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,355
But in the end, you just talk over me.

646
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,830
You lecture me.

647
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,955
Am I really the one at fault?

648
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,088
Yunnuo!

649
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,022
Let him speak.

650
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,200
Let him get all the resentment

651
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,622
he's held against me

652
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:37,088
off his chest. Speak!

653
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:39,844
I have work to finish.

654
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:41,466
I'll take my leave.

655
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:48,755
What's wrong with him today?

656
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,844
I'll go check on him.

657
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,644
Yunnuo!

658
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:52,160
