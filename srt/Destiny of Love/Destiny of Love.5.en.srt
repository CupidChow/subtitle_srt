(Adapted from Lin Nan's novel, Destiny of Love.)

26
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:42,400
=Episode 5=

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,220
Your Highness.

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,830
Today,

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,420
we'll start with massage therapy.

30
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,190
When I return tonight,

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,910
I'll write a few prescriptions
for you to take morning and night.

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,860
You should recover in no time.

33
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,990
Since you are taking charge yourself,

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,420
then I suppose
it will be effective in three days.

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Otherwise,

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,020
I will charge you with contempt.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,177
(I'm in serious trouble this time...)

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,070
Rest assured, Noble Consort.
It'll surely work.

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,550
If that's the case,

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,270
I'll wait and see.

41
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,510
That will be all for today.

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,140
Noble Consort,

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,790
please let us take our leave.

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,133
I'd really want to see

45
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:48,044
how you plan to cure
someone who isn't even sick.

46
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,230
Once I get something on you,

47
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,420
taking you down

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,950
would be

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,510
a piece of cake!

50
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,020
I'm definitely the smartest consort

51
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,070
in the whole harem.

52
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,670
Your Highness, if I may be blunt,

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,270
you are the only consort in the harem.

54
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,740
Don't you have anything better to do?

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,350
You talk too much.

56
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,850
(Prince Jin's Residence)

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,270
Your Highness, let me.

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,070
Alright.

59
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,822
Your Highness, I'll take my leave now.

60
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,420
Wait.

61
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,070
That acupuncture point you pressed
for Noble Consort just now,

62
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,510
what did you call it again?

63
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,900
The Baihui point.

64
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,790
But I remember

65
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,420
the Baihui point is on top of the head.

66
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,180
Well...

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,180
I meant "Hui" as in "to gather".
It gathers

68
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,990
one's essence, energy, and spirit.

69
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,377
We weren't talking
about the same acupoint.

70
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,300
I see.

71
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,140
It seems I was poorly informed.

72
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,670
Jiufeng and I have matters to discuss.

73
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,140
You may head back first.

74
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,230
Yes.

75
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,511
Jiufeng, close the door.

76
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,070
Yes.

77
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,300
Your Highness, what are you looking for?

78
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,480
(Baihui)

79
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,060
Jiufeng.

80
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,955
I have a task for you.

81
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,910
(Since you are taking charge yourself,)

82
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,470
then I suppose
it will be effective in three days.

83
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,180
Otherwise,

84
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,790
I will charge you with contempt.

85
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,710
Mr. Ji makes it sound easy,

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,350
but I know nothing about medicine.

87
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,110
Even faking it is hard.

88
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,590
If this keeps going,
I'll be exposed sooner or later.

89
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,940
But...

90
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,180
I still haven't figured out
how to open that box.

91
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,150
If I just leave now,

92
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,500
won't the trail go dead?

93
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,820
Father...

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,940
Your Highness,

95
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,710
His Highness asks for you.

96
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,470
What does he want now?

97
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,990
His Highness wants
a chat over some tea.

98
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,740
Tea?

99
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,790
Your Highness.

100
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,620
Why have you invited me for tea?

101
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,910
Father bestowed
some premium Yan tea upon me.

102
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,990
I thought I'd enjoy it with you.

103
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,620
Come, let's drink and talk.

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,500
Yan tea is a specialty of Luzhao.

105
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,470
It carries the freshness of green tea

106
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,940
and the richness of black tea.

107
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,600
It's mostly produced
in southeastern Luzhao.

108
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,990
I wonder what the southeast of Xilin

109
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,260
is known for.

110
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,860
Gourds...

111
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,670
Gourds?

112
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,990
As far as I know,

113
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,230
the southeast of Xilin is mostly desert.

114
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,060
The temperature difference is extreme.

115
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,060
But gourds prefer warmth
and shelter from wind.

116
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,990
I meant "courd",

117
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,911
a plant unique to Xilin.

118
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,230
I've never been to Xilin,

119
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,790
so I've never heard
of this so-called "courd".

120
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,740
Could you enlighten me?

121
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,800
That just means you're ignorant,
Your Highness.

122
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,422
I humbly ask to be enlightened.

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,060
Well, the courd...

124
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,444
How should I explain it?

125
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,590
It's...

126
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,940
Courd is basically

127
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,620
a medicinal herb that floats on water.

128
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,500
Is the information
you just gave accurate?

129
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,020
It is.

130
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,310
But I'm curious
how Princess Consort Jin

131
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,670
plans to treat Noble Consort.

132
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:33,910
Mother is unwell.

133
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,940
I should go visit her.

134
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,460
Prepare the carriage.

135
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,500
Yes.

136
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,990
(Military Report)

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,155
(Hanyuan Hall)

138
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,500
Mother.

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,870
Yunnuo, you're here.

140
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,350
I heard you were unwell,

141
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,820
so I came to check on you.

142
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,380
Where are you feeling the discomfort?

143
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,700
Just my usual headaches.

144
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,820
No need to worry.

145
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,550
You should focus on figuring out

146
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,580
how to win your father's favor

147
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,620
so he'll entrust you
with important tasks.

148
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,790
Your father cares
a lot about appearances.

149
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,750
Don't hold back from
saying nice things in front of him.

150
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,500
The more compliments you give...

151
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,790
like calling him wise and mighty,

152
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,190
the more he'll love it.

153
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,310
I know how to handle that, Mother.

154
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,630
Do you, really?

155
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,310
You clearly didn't
get that trait from me.

156
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,980
His Majesty has arrived.

157
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,630
Watch and learn.

158
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
Your Majesty.

159
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,790
Father.

160
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,060
At ease.

161
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
I heard you've taken ill.

162
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,630
Yes, I have.

163
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,670
But the moment you walked in,

164
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,150
I felt completely cured.

165
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,390
Your Majesty, your outfit today is truly

166
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,940
majestic, radiant, and commanding.

167
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,270
A true sovereign, through and through.

168
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,820
You walk like the wind itself.

169
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,550
The moment you stepped into the hall,

170
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,670
I felt a breeze sweep through.

171
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,700
The whole place became cooler.

172
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,940
Mother, you should get some rest.

173
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:23,019
Your Majesty, come.
I'll make some tea for you.

174
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,733
No need.

175
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,220
I just wanted to check on you.

176
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,910
Now that you are well,

177
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,430
I'm relieved
and will return to the palace.

178
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,460
I still have state affairs to handle.

179
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,740
Mother.

180
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,910
I have matters to attend to as well.

181
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,020
Please rest well, Mother.

182
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,400
So you all have official duties,

183
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,940
and I don't matter at all?

184
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,440
(Everything Guild)

185
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,030
Who is it?

186
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,670
Dear, it's me.

187
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,630
Let go of me!

188
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,220
What is it?

189
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,100
Go over there.

190
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,150
Just keep your distance.

191
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,670
A little space and I'll be fine.

192
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,270
Like this? Is this alright?

193
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,310
Yeah, now it's fine.

194
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,630
It's late. What brings you here?

195
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,220
Of course it's something important.

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,150
It's about your future and your career.

197
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,288
(Biography of Ji Mo, the Master Writer)

198
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,060
Dear,

199
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,220
I thought about it.
You're full of talent,

200
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,220
but what you lack

201
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,040
is someone to manage
your novel business.

202
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,150
So from now on,

203
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,940
I'll be your exclusive agent.

204
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,130
I'll handle it for you.

205
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,977
My exclusive agent?

206
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,488
Here, Dear.

207
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,790
Print this out.

208
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,550
Ji Mo Novel Agency Contract...

209
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,030
Come on.

210
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,190
I can do it myself. I got it.

211
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,910
Go over there.

212
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,510
I'll press it.

213
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,390
Don't worry.

214
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,740
I'll organize everything perfectly.

215
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,580
I'll make you the most famous

216
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,910
writer in all of the capital.

217
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,680
No, in all of Luzhao.
Maybe even in the entire Xilin Kingdom!

218
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,940
In all of Luzhao?

219
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,340
But...

220
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,460
Can I do it?

221
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,820
Of course you can!

222
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,460
You have to believe in me.

223
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,680
And more importantly,
believe in yourself.

224
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,910
Alright. I believe you.

225
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,660
I'll work with you all the way.

226
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,730
Let's give it our best.

227
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,550
Yes!

228
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,340
Fang...

229
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,700
Why are you so good to me?

230
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,790
What silly question is that?

231
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,940
You're my husband.

232
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,550
Of course I'm good to you.

233
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,220
But what if...

234
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,700
My husband is not "what if".

235
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,630
His name is Ji Mo.

236
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,022
Alright, Dear.

237
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,270
You keep writing.

238
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm heading off now.

239
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,220
Sleep well, Dear.

240
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,200
(Benevolent and Kind)

241
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,550
Your Highness.

242
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,270
Your Highness,
it's just as you suspected.

243
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,190
Our men in Xilin have confirmed.

244
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
This princess is a fake.

245
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,150
That is Princess Aliya?

246
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,510
Right.

247
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,370
The one in the portrait
is Princess Aliya.

248
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,510
But the one in our residence

249
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,700
is an impostor.

250
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,670
Your Highness,
how dare she pose as a princess!

251
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,860
She must have a death wish.

252
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,630
I'll go arrest her immediately.

253
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,270
Stop.

254
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,910
Keep this quiet. Do not act for now.

255
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,940
Why not?

256
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,980
Since she's a fake princess,

257
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,860
she can't be a real miracle physician.

258
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,755
If she's not a real miracle physician,

259
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,630
she won't realize my leg injury is fake.

260
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,820
Which means she poses no threat.
This is good for me.

261
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,630
If you expose her now,

262
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,100
then everyone in the kingdom

263
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,670
will search for the real princess.

264
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,660
And we'll have to
come up with a new plan.

265
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,430
Your Highness, you want me to...

266
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,380
We keep her here for now.

267
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,310
Investigate her thoroughly.

268
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,350
She may have ulterior motives.

269
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,430
Understood.

270
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,630
You fake physician,

271
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,190
you dare try to kill me?

272
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,390
I...

273
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,670
You've committed the crime of treason!

274
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,860
I'll drag you to His Majesty myself,

275
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,060
and have him cut off your head!

276
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,790
No!

277
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,940
Looks like these next three days

278
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,100
are going to be tough.

279
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,060
(She may be a fake princess,)

280
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,550
(and pose no threat to me,)

281
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,020
(but with trouble
from Noble Consort,)

282
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,790
(exposing her will only)

283
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,700
(stir up more trouble for me.)

284
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,020
(I may have to step in and help her.)

285
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,790
Your Highness?

286
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,980
Why are you here?

287
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,340
Why are you here too?

288
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,270
I was just...

289
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,330
Are you perhaps thinking about

290
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,810
how to treat Noble Consort?

291
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,450
I am the top female physician in Xilin.

292
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,930
Once I step in, recovery is guaranteed.

293
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,380
What if Noble Consort
isn't actually sick?

294
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,640
How would you treat her then?

295
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,760
Not sick?

296
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,930
Can't you tell?

297
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
I can tell.

298
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,920
Pretending to be sick
is a sickness in itself.

299
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,240
Treatment is needed.

300
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,690
True.

301
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,330
Her mental affliction does need curing.

302
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,690
Perhaps you should
fight poison with poison.

303
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,760
That would be
the real cure for her illness.

304
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:10,022

Is it pretty, Fu Chengjin?

333
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,330
I'm asking you.

334
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,066
What did you just call me?

335
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,290
Forgive me, Your Highness.

336
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,920
It slipped out on a whim.

337
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,840
It's fine.

338
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,840
It's just that no one has ever
called me by name.

339
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,290
It's getting late. I'll head back now.

340
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,570
Thank you, Aliya.

341
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,970
Aliya, do you think I can dance?

342
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,810
In Xilin, we have a dance

343
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,222
where you stay still while I move.

344
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,250
Let me show you.

345
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

346
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,650
Good morning, Your Highness.

347
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,330
The spot I'm massaging
is the Baihui Point.

348
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,970
If you get headaches in the future,

349
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,920
have a maid press it for you.

350
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,440
Does it feel good?

351
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,840
The courd is...

352
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,290
Many flowers grow on one vine.

353
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,880
Each flower bears a fruit.

354
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,250
(She's doing a pretty convincing job
pretending to be a princess.)

355
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,180
Why is my face burning up?

356
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,600
Chasing fireflies must have

357
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,570
burned a lot of energy.

358
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,250
What am I thinking?

359
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,730
I should focus on
how to deal with Noble Consort.

360
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,600
Perhaps you should
fight poison with poison.

361
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,970
That would be
the real cure for her illness.

362
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,350
(Benevolent and Kind)

363
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,270
Good morning, Your Highness.

364
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,120
Good morning.

365
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,270
Aliya.

366
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,700
You're going to the palace today
to treat Noble Consort.

367
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,120
Do you need me to come with you?

368
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,090
It's alright.

369
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,400
Are you sure?

370
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,200
I can handle it on my own.

371
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,090
I'll go with you anyway.

372
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,120
Just in case you cause
more trouble for the residence.

373
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,570
Fine.

374
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,770
I'll show you

375
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,680
how exactly I'm going to win her over.

376
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,250
I'm boiling in here! What is this thing?

377
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,730
Your Highness.

378
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,290
This is steam therapy.

379
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,900
It helps improve blood circulation.

380
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,490
Bear with it for the sake of healing.

381
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,610
How much longer
do I have to stay in this?

382
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,970
Roughly six more hours or so.

383
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,250
Six hours?

384
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,920
No way, I can't take it.

385
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,530
Let's try something else!

386
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,090
Acupuncture therapy.

387
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,050
That needle is way too long.

388
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,330
Let's not use that.

389
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,530
Thank you for the reminder.

390
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,140
For your condition,
you don't need a needle that long.

391
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,980
This is the needle

392
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,530
you should be using.

393
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,400
Princess Consort Jin...

394
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,160
is really something.

395
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,600
I was perfectly fine and
nearly got sick from her treatments.

396
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,770
Your Highness.

397
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,680
I think she is different

398
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,230
from everyone else.

399
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,530
Of course she is different.

400
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,010
If the palace had more people like her,

401
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,250
it would be absolute chaos.

402
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,330
There would be no peace.

403
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,010
But aren't you the same, Your Highness?

404
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Watch your tongue.

405
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,160
This tactic didn't work.

406
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,530
I need a new one.

407
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,090
Yes, a new approach.

408
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,120
Your Highness.

409
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Should we continue the treatment?

410
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,570
Of course not.

411
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,770
Guards.

412
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,250
Send a message for me.

413
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,650
Princess Consort Jin
is no longer needed here.

414
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,640
Yes.

415
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,970
Keep an eye on Princess Consort Jin.

416
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,880
If she gets close to Yunnuo,

417
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:25,920
inform me.

418
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,570
Yes, Your Highness.

419
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,490
(Benevolent and Kind)

420
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,090
Ms. Qiao, think of something quick!

421
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,050
We need clues to that Golden Box

422
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,440
so we can get out of here!

423
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,330
I miss my real princess already.

424
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,570
I only went to Noble Consort,

425
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,840
hoping to find the cloud pattern.

426
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,330
How was I supposed to know
she'd fake illness?

427
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,810
I nearly became
a tragic character in some drama!

428
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,920
The kind that dies right at the start.

429
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,680
My life is in danger here.

430
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,160
What do you think we should do now?

431
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,120
How about this?

432
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,400
You go win over His Highness first.

433
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,360
Make him our shield.

434
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
Just like an old saying goes,

435
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,640
"Leaning on a big tree
gives good shade."

436
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,570
Besides,

437
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,200
wasn't it him who helped us

438
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,730
with Noble Consort?

439
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,880
But, Prince Jin is
really hard to deal with.

440
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,090
Why so many "buts"?

441
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,200
Is it you who's difficult, or is it him?

442
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,050
Just make a little sacrifice
for both of us.

443
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,570
Alright?

444
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,680
Nope.

445
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,490
I'm too sleepy. My eyes are heavy.

446
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,010
Figure out how to win him over.

447
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,400
What am I going to do...

448
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,600
Actually, what Yuetao said
kind of makes sense this time.

449
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,080
(Prince Jin's Residence)

450
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,640
His Highness's favorite dish
is steamed perch.

451
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,090
Especially when it's a new recipe.

452
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,160
And he loves sweets too.

453
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,770
Right.

454
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
Like almond cakes,

455
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,330
osmanthus cakes...

456
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,770
He likes them all.

457
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,010
And mung bean cakes,

458
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,780
lotus seed soup...

459
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,330
But his favorite is almond tofu.

460
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,570
Yes! Almond tofu is his favorite!

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,230
(Imperial Kitchen)

462
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,290
Jiufeng.

463
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,250
Go take a look.

464
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:47,810
Alright.

465
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,090
Your Highness? Are you alright?

466
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,770
Your Highness?

467
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Are you alright?

468
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,880
Didn't you say
your cooking skills were amazing?

469
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,490
Wasn't that fireball just now
amazing enough?

470
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,770
Yuetao, are you sure
you delivered the message?

471
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,810
What else?

472
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,490
I strolled around His Highness's place.

473
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,511
Did I just take a stroll?

474
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:46,970
Are you sure he said he'd come?

475
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,600
He didn't.

476
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,730
But Jiufeng did.

477
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,120
His Highness didn't say
he wouldn't come.

478
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,360
I don't know.

479
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,770
He didn't say yes,

480
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,090
but he didn't say no either.

481
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,400
Yuetao.

482
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,730
You don't get it.

483
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,010
His Highness is actually super petty.

484
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,090
Don't be fooled by how regal he acts.

485
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,840
He's the type who puts on
a straight face in public,

486
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,120
but secretly holds grudges.

487
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,490
After some deep digging

488
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,490
and constant observation,

489
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,200
I can tell you, people like him

490
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,680
love keeping mental scorecards.

491
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,970
I bent over backwards
trying to please him.

492
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,050
It's tough!

493
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,340
He wouldn't even come to my stage.

494
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,160
I think the reason
I can't climb the stage

495
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,770
is because I have trouble with my legs.

496
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,250
Right.

497
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,530
Your Highness, I totally forgot.

498
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,400
You know what?

499
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,680
Next time, I'll carry you
on my back right up that stage.

500
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,470
How's that?

501
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,730
What is this?

502
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,680
The first-ever Prince Jin's Residence
Tasting Banquet

503
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,050
is officially underway!

504
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,440
The first dish is...

505
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,010
"Golden Knuckle Triumph."

506
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
"Wood Turns to Porridge."

507
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,250
"Clear Water with No Fish."

508
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,050
"Snow on Volcano."

509
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,290
"Earth-Born Lamb."

510
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,120
Your Highness, trust me.

511
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,530
These dishes

512
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,290
are named after the five elements

513
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,050
of nature.

514
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,530
Meat, vegetables, soup,
water, and eggs were used.

515
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,440
Pan-ried, roasted,
deep-fried, and braised,

516
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
blending Sichuan, Shandong, Cantonese,

517
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,570
and Huaiyang styles.

518
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Do you see
how much thought I put into this?

519
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,920
Why are you just standing there?

520
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,010
Come on, sit down and eat!

521
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,450
Your Highness,

522
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,050
this was clearly made
just for His Highness.

523
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,970
It'd be a waste for us to eat it.

524
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,680
Yeah, exactly.

525
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,770
Your Highness, you should dig in.

526
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,490
Is it good?

527
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,160
(Snow on a volcano?
More like a burst of salt.)

528
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,010
(It's so salty!)

529
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,090
Is His Highness's sense
of taste still intact?

530
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,970
If you ask me, love can
fill the stomach, not food.

531
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,360
No, it's more like
when someone drinks water,

532
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,160
only they know how salty or sweet it is.

533
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,290
Your Highness, Prince Yunnuo invites you

534
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
and Her Highness
on an outing tomorrow.

535
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,160
(Prince Yunnuo?)

536
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,810
I'm busy.

537
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,010
Turn him down.

538
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,640
Yes, I'll go right away.

539
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,090
Wait, Your Highness.

540
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,440
Your Highness, I'd like to go.

541
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,970
You want to go?

542
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
If that's the case,

543
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,490
finish everything on this table first.

544
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,680
All of it.

545
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,160
(This food tastes awful.)

546
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,840
(No way she can finish it.)

547
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,160
Your Highness.

548
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,120
There is something

549
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,090
I'm not sure if I should say it.

550
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,770
If you're not sure, then don't say it.

551
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,160
Fair. After all,
it concerns Her Highness.

552
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
It would be improper.

553
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,730
Speak.

554
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,010
I believe

555
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,360
Her Highness acted suspiciously today.

556
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,160
First, she pretended to be sweet.

557
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,530
She asked what you liked.

558
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,340
Then, she acted like she was cooking.

559
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,090
When you went near the kitchen,

560
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,290
she used that huge fireball
to try to burn you!

561
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,200
Thankfully I threw myself in

562
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,290
so you came out unharmed.

563
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,630
Come on, Jiufeng.

564
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,360
I think you're overthinking it.

565
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,290
I believe it's just that

566
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,050
her cooking skills are explosive.

567
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,010
Explosive is one way to put it.

568
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,250
Her ingredients clash with each other.

569
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,600
The cooking methods are all off balance.

570
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,810
What she made looked bad
and tasted even worse.

571
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,680
She is

572
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,290
out to poison her husband.

573
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,490
But what if her real intention

574
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,920
was just to please me?

575
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,290
Please you?

576
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,050
She defied you right to your face

577
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:03,840
just to accept the invitation
of Prince Yunnuo.

578
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,090
And then she ate
that whole table of food.

579
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,540
Is she really going?

580
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,810
After all the awful food she ate?

581
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,720
(Liuyun Mansion)

582
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,250
Your Highness.

583
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
A message from Prince Jin.

584
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,530
The outing is still on.

585
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,470
Prince Jin keeps holding gatherings.

586
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,680
He wants to fix you
with Princess Consort Jin.

587
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
Things had finally quieted down.

588
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,120
And now you're meeting them again.

589
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,600
If anyone finds out,

590
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,160
it may hurt

591
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:43,970
your reputation.

592
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,090
There's a lot of talk now.

593
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,010
Talk of what?

594
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,570
They say...

595
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,050
Prince Jin often brings his consort
to outings with you.

596
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,977
That she's very close with you.

597
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,030
If rumors spread...

598
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,050
If so,

599
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
people may start thinking

600
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,440
that Prince Jin is unhappy
with the Emperor's marriage decree

601
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,730
and is pushing
his consort toward someone else.

602
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,120
Such a disgraceful scandal...

603
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,330
If he wants to play, then I'll see
what exactly he's trying to do.

604
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,050
Your Highness, your hand...

605
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,810
It's nothing. Go get things ready.

606
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,090
Yes.

607
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,440
(Lantai Books)

608
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,030
"After Xiaohua entered
the prince's residence,

609
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,440
she was worried
someone would expose her true identity."

610
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,160
No, that's not right.

611
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,490
Dear...

612
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,770
It's so late.
Why don't come home?

613
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,570
I'm writing a story.

614
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Write it tomorrow.

615
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,920
You've done so much already.

616
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Take a break, will you?

617
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,770
Mr. Ji.

618
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:58,920
Mr. Ji.

619
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,600
Who are you?

620
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm Mr. Ji's number one disciple.

621
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,960
Why are you here so late?

622
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,800
This academy is basically my house.

623
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,230
I come and go as I please.

624
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,010
What's it to you?

625
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,720
I'm Ji Mo's lawfully wedded wife.

626
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,740
If I can't say something, who can?

627
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:18,970
What?

628
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,450
Mr. Ji?

629
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,200
When did you get married?

630
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,890
She is indeed my wife.

631
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,120
Dear, it's late.

632
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,530
Let's go home.

633
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,930
I'll make you
some tea to nourish your health.

634
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,930
A proper tonic.

635
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,410
Why are you still here?

636
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,600
Dear, let's go home.

637
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,050
The first step is always the hardest.

638
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,970
But I'm afraid

639
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,410
I won't get it tomorrow.

640
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,410
And if not tomorrow, then the next day.

641
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,940
Take two more days if you must.

642
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,600
One day it'll come together.

643
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,090
What should we do
tomorrow and the day after?

644
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,210
How about going out?

645
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,970
Work and rest go hand in hand,
and balance is key.

646
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,010
Alright.

647
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,800
Dear, did you notice?

648
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,640
You can actually
communicate with me now.

(Lantai Books)

650
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,800
Dear! What's wrong?

651
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,010
Yuetao, go pour me another pot.

652
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,530
You need to stop drinking.

653
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,240
Your belly's going to burst.

654
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,600
No, trust me.

655
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,240
My cooking is just way too intense!

656
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,890
Your voice is already hoarse.

657
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,240
Maybe we should skip tomorrow?

658
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:50,890
No way.

659
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,410
I worked so hard for this chance.

660
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,410
I must go.
