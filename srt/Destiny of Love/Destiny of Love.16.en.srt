Your Highness, you have a fever.

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,488
I'll prepare the medicine.

29
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,111
That's true.

30
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:01,630
That's true.

31
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,333
I need to get better soon.

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,470
How can I let her

33
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,460
see me like this?

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,070
Why hasn't she come yet?

35
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,110
Little Cloud.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,420
It's pouring. Why didn't you take cover?

37
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,300
I was afraid you wouldn't see me.

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,950
Did they hit you again?

39
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,270
But it's okay.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,300
I have you.

00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,288
Of course, you have me.

00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,900
You're the little brother I protect.

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,390
Will you always stay with me
and never leave me behind?

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,140
Of course.

45
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,670
I'll watch over my Little Cloud

His Majesty's birthday
is a joyous occasion.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,860
They added a special
imperial exam this year.

65
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,990
No need to wait another three years!

66
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:37,550
Make way.

67
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,990
Starting today,
you can take the imperial exam.

68
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,590
What wonderful news!

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
(Special Exam on His Majesty's Birthday)
Finally, we can sit for one this year!

70
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:45,740
(No more waiting!)

71
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,590
(The exam begins today!)
That's right.

72
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,620
If I pass the exam...

73
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,860
A bright future
is just around the corner!

74
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:50,860
It's a blessing, indeed.

75
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,710
Truly a blessing.

76
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,940
Dad, where is Fang?

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,550
Didn't Madam Zhang come by just now?

78
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,844
She said pork was cheap today.

79
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,260
Fang went out with her to buy some.

80
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,110
Dad...

81
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,990
She's a Princess of Xilin.

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,644
Yet she's living a humble life with me.

83
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,910
It pains me to see this.

84
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,350
She is a princess without her memory.

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,511
For now, she can only be a commoner.

86
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,860
No!

87
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,500
No? What do you plan to do?

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,990
You're just a teacher.

89
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,990
I'm old.

90
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,230
Can the two of us

91
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,710
turn Everything Guild
into a royal palace?

92
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,355
If not a palace,
then at least a proper manor.

93
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,940
You must be dreaming, boy!

94
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,940
Dad, stop fussing.

95
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,710
Just hear me out.

96
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,350
Alright, speak.

97
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,260
Today...

98
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,550
I heard they added an exam
for His Majesty's birthday.

99
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,380
I'd been hesitating whether or not

100
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,670
I should sit for it.

101
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,230
But, I've made up my mind.

102
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,910
I'll take the exam and I will pass.

103
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,590
Only then can I give her a good life

104
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,820
and be worthy of her.

105
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,940
Son...

106
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,150
The imperial exam is a good thing.

107
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,590
You have my full support.

108
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,710
But,

109
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,740
the exam isn't easy.

110
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,620
Scholars flood the capital

111
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,060
like an overflowing river.

112
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,860
To stand out among them,

113
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:26,860
that's no small feat.

114
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,820
It's a steep climb.

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,790
Dad. Dear.

116
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,060
I bought pork.

117
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,420
We can have a good meal tonight!

118
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,230
Wonderful!

119
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,860
Hold on.

120
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,060
One day, I'll make sure
you eat well every day,

121
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,910
with abalone, shark fin, and fish maw!

122
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,230
Abalone, shark fin, and fish maw?

123
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,470
Dad.

124
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,790
What's gotten into him?

125
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,550
He's lost his mind.

126
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,422
Abalone and all...

127
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,110
What nonsense is that?

128
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:08,900
(I look forward to our meeting.)

129
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,060
Deliver this invitation
to Manman in person.

130
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,266
Your Highness.

131
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,590
Why are you standing there? Go, now!

132
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,420
Yes.

133
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,600
(Benevolent and Kind)

134
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,710
To My Princess Consort,

135
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,710
the skies have cleared and are washed.

136
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,060
Alas, spring fades too swiftly,

137
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:41,933
and too lovely to bear alone.

138
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,940
Thus, I humbly extend this invitation.

139
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,150
Do grace me with your presence.

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,550
You will be received
with utmost sincerity.

141
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,990
From Jin.

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,180
Well? Does it sound sincere enough?

143
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,030
Not bad.

144
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:00,200
Better than the others.

145
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:01,177
And heartfelt too.

146
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,710
But...

147
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,060
Isn't the wording a bit over the top?

148
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,710
Then, what should I just write,

149
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,990
"Nice weather today."

150
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,110
"I really want to see you."

151
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,860
"Please come?"

152
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,470
That's perfect! I like it!

153
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,860
The best so far.

154
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,230
Just write it like that.

155
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,150
Trust me.

156
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,260
Trust you, my foot.

157
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,590
Get up already.

158
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,540
Deliver this invitation
to Princess Consort.

159
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes!

160
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,710
"The skies have cleared

161
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,311
and are washed..."

162
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,350
"Spring fades..."

163
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:55,844
What's this?

164
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,260
"Your presence..."

165
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,710
What is all this?

166
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,110
What Jiufeng means is,

167
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,500
His Highness said,

168
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,310
"The weather's great today.

169
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,590
He really wants to see you.

170
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,590
Please come."

171
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,710
Why not just say that?

172
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,470
Why write all this sappy nonsense?

173
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,620
Well, doesn't it show sincerity?

174
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,020
So? Will you go?

175
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:24,266
Your Highness.

176
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,666
Guihu sent an invitation

177
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,777
from Prince Yunnuo.

178
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,133
He said it must be read
by you personally.

179
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,260
Guihu is waiting outside for your reply.

180
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,190
Prince Yunnuo?

181
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,230
Tell Guihu

182
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,688
I have matters to attend
to today and can't meet him.

183
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,620
Send my apologies.

184
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,660
Yes.

185
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,260
Matters to attend to?

186
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,020
Are you seeing His Highness?

187
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,710
Well...

188
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,900
His Highness put a lot of thought
into writing the invitation.

189
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,950
I'd feel bad if I turned him down.

190
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,380
Well?

191
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,590
She...

192
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,660
Spill it.

193
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,110
She says

194
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,620
she has other matters to tend to.
She can't meet you today.

195
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,380
What matters is she tending to?

196
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,830
I don't know.

197
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,900
When I was waiting outside
for her reply,

198
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,470
a carriage was readied.

199
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,900
I asked those servants.

200
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,260
They say

201
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,244
Prince Jin is heading out.

202
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,911
Perhaps Princess Consort Jin is
going with him too.

203
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,311
Why?

204
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,740
Why?

205
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,190
Why did she choose him, not me?

206
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,590
Why is everyone so kind to him?

207
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,070
Why does Fu Chengjin always outshine me?

208
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,780
Your Highness, you're still unwell.

209
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,430
Please don't upset yourself.

210
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,380
Your Highness!

211
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,590
Go tell her...

212
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,590
I was ambushed
by an assassin and was wounded.

213
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,780
Beg her to come see me.

214
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,620
Your Highness,
your health is more important.

215
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,900
Go!

216
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:36,900
Guihu.

217
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,311
Why are you still standing there?

218
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,950
Go!

219
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,430
Yes.

220
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,866
Your Highness.

221
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,230
Prince Yunnuo was attacked

222
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,133
and gravely injured.

223
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,350
He begs you to visit.

224
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,860
Assassins?

225
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,777
Where was he wounded?

226
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,990
It's urgent.

227
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,620
You'll know once you see him.

228
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,470
Prince Yunnuo is too attached to me.

229
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,740
Guihu, you're loyal to him.

230
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,500
You understand well enough.

231
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,500
Must I say more?

232
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,140
I won't see him again.

233
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,380
Please, Your Highness, go see him.

234
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,950
You two are both stubborn as mules.

235
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,830
(Forgive me, Little Cloud...)

236
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,140
What happened?

237
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,020
Your Highness...

238
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,860
I've failed you.

239
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,590
I couldn't bring her here.

240
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,830
Why didn't she come?

241
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,620
Speak!

242
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,660
She says

243
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,780
you should summon a physician.

244
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,900
What else?

245
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,310
She also says

246
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:20,333
there's no need to meet
if your paths differ.

247
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:25,733
She won't come.

248
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,430
No. This can't be allowed to happen.

249
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,990
I get it now.

250
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,020
I haven't done enough.

251
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,830
If I invite her every day,

252
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,620
she will surely understand.

253
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,911
Your Highness!

254
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,860
She doesn't care for you.

255
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,230
She left right after to meet Prince Jin.

256
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,830
Enough!

257
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,380
Why...

258
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,900
Why?

259
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,260
I found her first!

260
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,230
Get out!

261
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,540
Leave!

262
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,660
I was the one who found you first...

263
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,310
It was me! I found you first!

264
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,710
Why?

265
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,660
I need to make two little ears...

266
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Two little ears...

267
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,860
How do I wrap it?

268
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,620
Why won't it stay in place?

269
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,466
Your Highness.

270
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,230
Why did you bring me here?

271
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,110
Jiufeng.

272
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,990
Let's go.

273
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,380
Your Highness, where are you taking me?

274
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:02,733
Your Highness?

275
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,380
What are you up to?

276
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,380
Your Highness.

277
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,190
What is this?

278
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,070
Do you know what day it is?

279
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,310
Have you forgotten?

280
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,350
Didn't you say

281
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,710
you wanted to watch fireworks

282
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,310
with someone dear on your birthday?

283
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,590
This is my surprise for you.

284
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:34,466
Do you like it?

285
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,710
I do.

286
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,950
If you like fireworks,

287
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,470
I'll light up the entire sky for you.

288
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,070
If you like firefly lamps,

289
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,740
I'll light the whole street for you.

290
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,350
If you love the trees
and grass of this world,

291
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,620
then I too will cherish every bit of it.

292
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,830
Before I met you,

293
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,190
every step I took was
to get away from this palace.

294
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,380
But after meeting you,

295
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,140
every step I took...

296
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,266
was just to be a little closer to you.

297
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,860
But...

298
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,260
But I was never part of your plan.

299
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,430
You were never an accident to me.

300
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,422
You are the surprise in my long life.

301
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,500
The one I wish
to spend the rest of my life with.

302
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,990
But I've been lying to you all along.

303
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,990
I was never Princess Aliya.

304
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
I've known that for a long time.

305
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,300
But more importantly,

306
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,711
it was you
who lit the firefly lamps for me.

307
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,150
You learned medicine for me.

308
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
You peeled lotus seeds for me.

309
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,060
And you were willing
to leave the palace for me.

310
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,260
Princess Aliya

311
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,190
was never my Princess Consort Jin.

312
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,630
The one who came to me in that palanquin

313
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,470
is my Princess Consort Jin.

314
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,060
It took me so long to find you.

315
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,820
Please don't leave me again.

(Benevolent and Kind)

326
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,866
Why have all my things
been moved to your room?

327
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,820
I had Jiufeng move them.

328
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,230
That was rather fast.

329
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,088
What did you say?

330
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,177
I said the wind outside
was quite strong.

331
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,020
It is.

332
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,540
It's making me a little dizzy.

333
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,150
If you're feeling dizzy,

334
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,390
perhaps we should sleep early.

335
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,710
I'll stay and watch you sleep.

336
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,190
Manman...

337
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,780
(She actually fell asleep...)

338
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:26,620
(Benevolent and Kind)

339
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,780
Your Highness?

340
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,390
Your Highness?

341
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,500
(Matters at court.)

342
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:15,710
(Remember to eat breakfast.)

343
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,500
This is my pet.

344
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,230
Take care of it.

345
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:31,600
Don't worry.

346
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,670
I'll take great care of it.

347
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,990
Manman, you're back!

348
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,780
Counting your coins?

349
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,810
Don't just stand there.

350
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,666
Go wash up inside.

351
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,844
The meal is almost ready.

352
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,430
Mr. Ji...

353
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,230
There's something I want to tell you.

354
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,780
Go on.

355
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,500
It's about...

356
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,390
Spit it out already.

357
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,820
As long as you didn't
expose yourself to Prince Jin,

358
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,950
it's all good.

359
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,950
Mr. Ji...

360
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,870
You really are amazing.

361
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,820
Of course I am.

362
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,020
I am never wrong!

363
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:21,260
So what you're saying is...

364
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,470
If your...

365
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,910
If your true identity is exposed,

366
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,390
you will be charged with treason.

367
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,300
But I never meant to deceive anyone.

368
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,950
Seriously, what were you thinking?

369
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,020
Even if not for yourself,

370
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,333
at least think about Ji Mo! You...

371
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,100
Ji Mo's about to take the imperial exam.

372
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,670
And me?

373
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,020
I'm getting old.

374
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:45,230
I haven't held a grandchild yet.

375
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,430
I still want to live to 180!

376
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,150
I had no choice.

377
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,540
I was forced into this.

378
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,630
Besides...

379
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,870
His Highness truly cares for me.

380
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,540
He said he knew all along,

381
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,740
and he never exposed me.

382
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,100
Whether he did or didn't expose you
doesn't matter!

383
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,060
Sure, Prince Jin might protect you.

384
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,740
But His Majesty?

385
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,022
You think he will let it go?

386
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,670
He likes Prince Jin so much...

387
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,580
Maybe he'll forgive me too?

388
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,670
Maybe it'll be fine, right?

389
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,870
Maybe?

390
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,230
Manman, use your head!

391
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,020
You lied to His Majesty!

392
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,260
That's treason!

393
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,390
Treason means death!

394
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:27,777
Ji Mo...

395
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,390
How dare you!

396
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,044
You conspired with
a criminal to deceive us!

397
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,950
Take him away.

398
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,740
Execute him!

399
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,710
No!

400
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:35,222
Father!

401
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:35,777
Your Majesty!

402
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,630
Father!

403
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:37,444
Your Majesty!

404
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,710
Qiao Manman!

405
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
Why did you have to say it?

406
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,020
You got us all killed!

407
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,710
Qiao Manman!

408
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,820
Qiao Manman is an impostor
posing as the Xilin Princess,

409
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,355
married into Prince Jin's Residence.

410
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,580
Manman, why did you confess?

411
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,710
Why did you confess?

412
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,540
She shall be beheaded,
as a warning to all.

413
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,740
No!

414
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:04,250
We promised to trust each other.

415
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,666
I must speak with him.

416
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,950
Manman! Manman!

417
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,190
Yes.

418
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,288
Take this with you.

419
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,377
Wait, Dear.
What are you doing with that?

420
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,950
What's wrong?

421
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,870
I'm just a little nervous.

422
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,580
Nervous about what?

423
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,500
It's just an exam.

424
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,430
I'm right here.

425
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,870
You'll do great.
Your name will top the board.

426
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,133
Alright.

427
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,340
Make way!

428
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,990
Excuse me.

429
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,570
(Xiufeng Academy)
Sorry, let us through.

430
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:45,500
Excuse me.

431
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,422
I'll make us proud.

432
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,400
Coming through!

433
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,780
Dear, we're finally here!

434
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,300
Here, let me wipe your sweat.

435
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,580
You're not sweating.

436
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,150
Then, drink some water.

437
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,740
I'm not thirsty, Fang.

438
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,390
Have a bite.

439
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:01,430
I'm not hungry.

440
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,020
You need energy for the exam.

441
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,580
It's fine. I'm really not hungry.

442
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,340
You're a lucky man.

443
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,300
Not everyone

444
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,710
is as fortunate.

445
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:09,430
That's right.

446
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,740
My husband is blessed.

447
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,150
What?

448
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,820
Yes, you are absolutely right.

449
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,060
Dear, keep your voice down.

450
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,990
Why should I?

451
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,190
What's there to be afraid of?

452
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,670
You're the best.

453
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,950
Give it your best today.

454
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,820
You're the best!

455
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
You really are the best!

456
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,444
I'll do my best.

457
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,430
You're the best, my dear!

458
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,710
Absolutely the best.

459
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,470
The very best.

460
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:32,590
You're peerless.

461
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,190
You're the best,

462
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,740
and you're going to top the exam!

463
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,870
Candidate Ji Mo!

464
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,950
It's your turn, Dear.

465
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,580
Good luck!

466
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,910
Don't be nervous.

467
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,300
You can do it.

468
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,100
I believe in you.

469
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,740
Alright, I'll do my very best.

470
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,990
Candidate Ji Mo!

471
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,430
Everything's ready.

472
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,100
Yes.

473
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,430
He's going in.

474
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,390
Go on.

475
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,670
Are you Ji Mo?

476
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,580
Yes, sir.

477
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,430
Good.

478
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,670
Right this way.

479
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:13,210
(Ji Mo)

480
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,740
The exam begins.

481
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,190
"What is there to fear
in being a woman..."

482
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,659
(If she finds a good man?)
Fear...

483
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,482
(Build a family...)

484
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,714
(Then, pursue one's aspirations.)

485
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:55,066
(Find the right one and build a home.
Then, pursue your aspirations.)

486
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,300
Good luck.

487
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:04,960
(Find the right one and build a home.
Then, pursue your aspirations.)

488
00:27:09,582 --> 00:27:11,730
(Benevolent and Kind)

489
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Where did you run off to?

490
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,580
You were gone all day.

491
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,710
Yuetao said you even skipped breakfast.

492
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,670
I couldn't eat.

493
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,540
What's wrong?

494
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,540
You may have accepted me,

495
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:31,950
but that doesn't mean
your father accepts me as well.

496
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,780
What if he finds out
I'm not the real princess?

497
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,100
What then?

498
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,230
Come.

499
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:38,622
Come here.

500
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,300
Sit down.

501
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,710
Look at this.

502
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,210
(Saibei Desert, Mount Tianbao,
Northlands, Luzhao Kingdom)

503
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,844
What are all these places?

504
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,020
Before I met you,

505
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,780
I had already planned
to leave these struggles behind

506
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,870
to live a quiet life in the countryside.

507
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,155
But now that I've met you,

508
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,190
we can leave together.

509
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,990
Leave the capital.

510
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,955
Follow the Northlands to the desert
and watch the sunrise.

511
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,870
Then, cross the western mountains
and reach Mirror Lake.

512
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,580
And finally, take a boat

513
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,577
(Eastern Lake)
along the eastern shore.

514
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,100
What do you think?

515
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,540
Mountains or lakes,

516
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,820
wherever you go,

517
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,955
I'll follow.

518
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,950
But your father definitely
won't be pleased.

519
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,060
He thinks so highly of you.

520
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,466
Can you convince him?

521
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,740
Do you truly not
want to be the next ruler?

522
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,060
Compared to me,

523
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,470
Yunnuo may be a bit hot-tempered,

524
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,470
but his talent and tactics

525
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,260
are on par with mine.

526
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,950
If he takes over the throne,

527
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,340
I'll have no worries.

528
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,260
Even when praising others,

529
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:57,670
you praise yourself first.

530
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,950
Manman...

531
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,150
Would you be willing to leave with me?

532
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,340
Once we leave the palace,

533
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,500
life may not be as comfortable anymore.

534
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,150
Don't forget.

535
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,190
I was never a real princess.

536
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,540
Wherever you go,

537
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,780
I'll follow.

538
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,630
We'll be inseparable.

539
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,340
Alright, I'm starving.

540
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,060
Let's go grab a bite.

541
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,870
Alright, let's go.

542
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,488
Let's go.

543
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:57,780
Your Highness,
it's time for your medicine.

544
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,500
Please, Your Highness.
Your health comes first.

545
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,870
Princess Consort Jin...

546
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:27,740
Enough.

547
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:30,844
Where is Hu Ersa now?

548
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:32,100
(Xiufeng Academy)

549
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,822
I wonder how he did on the exam.

550
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,390
Yeah, it's driving me crazy!

551
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,244
It's been way too long.

552
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,740
Miss,

553
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,540
how are you not nervous at all?

554
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,888
My husband's a walking library.

555
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,780
Why should I worry?

556
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,470
I'm just waiting
to become the top scholar's wife.

557
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,780
Is that so...

558
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,740
Dear!

559
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,100
You're out!

560
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,390
As expected from you.

561
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,777
You even handed it in early!

562
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,100
Let's talk at home.

563
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,200
What's wrong?

564
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,500
Did it not go well?

565
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,670
It's alright if it didn't go well.

566
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,230
There's always a next time.

567
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,670
You must be hungry.

568
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:11,150
We can...

569
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:12,422
Can I just have a moment alone?

570
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,340
Dear?

571
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:20,690
(Everything Guild)

572
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,260
When he walked in,

573
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,230
he just sat there in silence?

574
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,540
He's always like that.

575
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,910
Look at him.

576
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,990
Nothing like how his father used to be.

577
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,950
But I know my son.

578
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,740
He's a thinker.

579
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,100
Unlike me,

580
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,470
I am carefree.

581
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,870
No, Dad...

582
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,340
That's not what I meant at all.

583
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,710
Son!

584
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,749
Come down, quick!

585
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,150
- Dear, what are you doing?
- Don't do anything rash!

586
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,950
I was just joking!

587
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,666
What are you doing?

588
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,333
Come down!

589
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,190
It's just an exam!

590
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,230
Why are you taking it so hard?

591
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,133
What's wrong with you?

592
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,150
What are you doing?

593
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,910
No, Father! Fang!

594
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,540
I was tying my hair up for motivation!

595
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,710
Tying your hair up?

596
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,300
My son may be thoughtful,

597
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,710
but he wouldn't hang himself!

598
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,780
Even tying my hair up won't help.

599
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,260
Even stabbing my leg won't help.

600
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,470
I'm really just hopeless.

601
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,740
Son,

602
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,230
it's just one exam.

603
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,060
Is this necessary?

604
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,500
If you didn't do well,

605
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,670
then try again next time.

606
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,740
And if not that time,

607
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,390
then the time after that. Right?

608
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,910
Here, have some water.

609
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,740
Dad...

610
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
Look at me. I'm an adult.

611
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,870
I've achieved nothing.

612
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,710
Plus...

613
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,390
I'm still living off you.

614
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,230
I'm your father!

615
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,230
I feed you. So what?

616
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,500
But you can't
support me forever, Dad!

617
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,540
I...

618
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,260
Even if it's forever, I can do it.
