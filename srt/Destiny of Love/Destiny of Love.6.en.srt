(Prince Jin's Residence)

29
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,020
Brother, Princess Consort Jin,
good morning.

30
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:53,800
Morning.

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,390
Well,

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,780
what happened to your voice?

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,110
It's nothing.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,511
That's not important.

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,700
What matters is we all have fun today.

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,700
Come on.

37
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,460
(With that voice?)

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,733
(Let's see how much fun you can have.)

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,800
Stop sitting there.

40
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,140
Come on! Hurry up.

41
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:27,060
(Everything Guild)

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,670
Dear,

43
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,350
didn't Dad say we couldn't go out today?

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,350
This is our first time going out.

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,950
I don't want him to know.

46
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,270
Ji Mo,

47
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,700
where are you going?

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,950
Let's go, now!

49
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,670
Don't run, Ji Mo!

50
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,300
Move!

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,990
Ji Mo!

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,180
You lost respect for me
after getting a wife.

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,580
Unbelievable.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,230
You seemed interested in kite flying
the other day.

55
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,230
So, I made one.

56
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,790
Do you like it?

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,900
You're quite skilled, Prince Yunnuo.

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,950
Excellent painting.

59
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,830
That cloud pattern

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,620
really left an impression.

61
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,350
Glad you like it.

62
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,790
This cloud...

63
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,555
Let me show you how to fly it.

64
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,110
When it comes to kite flying,

65
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,270
I'm the expert here.

66
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,377
Jiufeng?

67
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,140
Yunnuo.

68
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,510
Your painting skills have declined.

69
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,700
That design on the kite

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,950
just looks so out of place.

71
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,700
Aliya, don't you think so?

72
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,860
Brother, you're right.

73
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,170
I did rush a bit this time.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,210
Next time, I'll paint a prettier one.

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,170
I think the cloud looks great.

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,050
Prince Yunnuo, this cloud you drew

77
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,610
must have some meaning, right?

78
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
Actually, this cloud...

79
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,520
It's just clouds chasing the moon,

80
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,370
mist over mountains,
layered clouds, and things like that.

81
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,680
Aliya, if you like it,

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,330
I can paint one for you myself.

83
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,210
How about it?

84
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh, give it a rest.

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Your clouds

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
can't compare to his.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,560
Give it back!

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Prince Yunnuo, let's go fly the kite.

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,920
All right.

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,650
Your Highness.

91
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,040
Weren't you trying
to fix those two up? So why...

92
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,040
(Why do I really feel)

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
(a bit overwhelmed with jealousy?)

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,520
Prince Yunnuo.

95
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,040
That cloud-patterned kite you made

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
looks random at first glance,

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,580
but there seems to be
a structure behind it.

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,520
Am I right?

99
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,250
You seem quite interested
in the cloud painting.

100
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,770
Just curious, that's all.

101
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,690
Here, hold it like this.

102
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,230
Your Highness.

103
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,160
Everything's going just as you planned.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,780
Push me over there.

105
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:31,450
Pull it slightly.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,330
You're doing it all wrong.

107
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,210
Do it as I do.

108
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,160
See? Sheep over there.

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,130
Let's go see them.

110
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,690
Sure.

111
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,090
Come on.

112
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Jiufeng.

113
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,090
Go buy up that whole herd of sheep.

114
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,600
You got it.

115
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,580
The scenery here is beautiful.

116
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,720
I feel instantly refreshed.

117
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,160
Dear, what kind of story

118
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,940
are you thinking of writing this time?

119
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,090
I want to write a story
about a mistaken twist of fate

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,770
that leads to love.

121
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,040
Two girls with different dreams end up

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,450
having their lives changed

123
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,210
because of an accident.

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,250
One of them I've never met.

125
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,410
I want to base her on your personality.

126
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,720
What about the other one?

127
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,130
The other one...

128
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,890
Manman!

129
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,720
Princess Aliya?

130
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,720
Fang.

131
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,570
Let's go

132
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,400
play over there.

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,480
But Manman...

134
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,250
Yuetao.

135
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,770
Didn't I tell you?

136
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,977
I'm married now.
I'm Princess Consort Jin.

137
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,755
Princess Consort Jin,

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,690
it looked like someone over there

139
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,040
was waving at you.

140
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,010
She even called you Manman.

141
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,090
You probably misheard.

142
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,360
Maybe they meant "walk slowly".

143
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,810
The sun's about to set.

144
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,570
We've been out all day. I'm tired too.

145
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,600
Let's find a place to rest.

146
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,570
Alright.

147
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,770
Dear, I didn't expect you
to run that fast.

148
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,480
Yeah.

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,090
You know,

150
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,960
exercise helps open the meridians.

151
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,600
It also refreshes the mind.

152
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,280
You're the one who told me all that.

153
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,210
I'm really happy

154
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,040
that you remember

155
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,450
everything I said.

156
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,010
Oh right, we ran into Manman today.

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,770
Why was she

158
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,250
with a bunch of people I don't know?

159
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,360
Are those all her friends?

160
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,010
Probably.

161
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,600
You know her.

162
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,040
She has lots of friends.

163
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,480
The stars are really beautiful tonight.

164
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah.

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,480
Dear, what are the names

166
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
of the brightest stars?

167
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
Those?

168
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
That's the Big Dipper.

169
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,770
When we're lost,

170
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,650
it helps guide the way.

171
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,290
In my heart,

172
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,410
you're the brightest star
in the night sky.

173
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,450
Dear, you didn't finish
the story just now.

174
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,360
You left it hanging.

175
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,960
Well then,

176
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,240
do you like that story?

177
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,170
I like every story you tell.

178
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,120
From now on, when you write a new story,

179
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,330
you must read it to me first.

180
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,210
Watch closely.

181
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,960
Don't blink.

182
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,530
Why not?

183
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,511
Because in this kind of moment,

184
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,120
in my romance stories,

185
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,840
a shooting star streaks across the sky.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,120
Seriously?

187
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,530
Dear, look!

188
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,810
A shooting star!

189
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,120
That's amazing!

190
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,600
Yeah, it's so magical!

191
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,530
Dear!

192
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,600
There's another one!

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
Do you think there will be a third one?

194
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,570
Dear,

195
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,170
you can hold my hand now.

196
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,960
Dear?

197
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,930
Dear?

198
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,480
Dear!

199
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,290
Wake up, Dear!

200
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,760
Look! A shooting star!

201
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,170
If you make a wish now,

202
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,410
your wish will come true.

203
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,050
Really?

204
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,410
Hurry! Make a wish!

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,760
You know what?

206
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,360
This is my first time

207
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,090
seeing something like this in my life.

208
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,960
When I was a kid,

209
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,000
I read a book of astronomy

210
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,720
about comets shining like day
and stars falling like rain.

211
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,210
And seeing it now,

212
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,290
it is breathtaking.

213
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,570
But comets are actually
considered bad omens.

214
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,930
They usually foretell
chaos and war across the land.

215
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,170
Can't you try to think more positively?

216
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm just stating the facts.

217
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,690
Ask Yunnuo if you don't believe me.

218
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,120
Has he ever read anything saying

219
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,570
that comets are a good sign?

220
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,210
It's true.

221
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,360
Comets are also known
as bringers of misfortune.

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,050
Whether a star is a good or bad omen
is just human belief.

223
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,760
Some say a lucky star means
a smooth path ahead.

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,840
Some say a disaster star
brings misfortune.

225
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,360
But a star is just a star.

226
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,570
How can we blame it for our fate?

227
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,810
Little star, it's not your fault.

228
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,240
Don't mind what the ignorant say.

229
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,050
You need to grow strong.

230
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,410
Shine bright.

231
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,170
That way,

232
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,210
you'll light up the whole night sky.

233
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,530
My mother told me

234
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,410
that I'm a little star too.

235
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,422
Even a little star can shine bright.

236
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,360
And you're a little cloud.

237
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,240
Once you grow into a big cloud,

238
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
you won't be afraid of anything.

239
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,270
Prince Yunnuo,
what are you thinking about?

240
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,960
I...

241
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,210
Your hand is hurt.

242
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,530
Let me dress it for you.

243
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,240
Now for a pair of little ears.

244
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
Little Cloud, look.

245
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Don't they look like little ears?

246
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,480
They do! So cute!

247
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,022
That's my signature bandaging technique.

248
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,880
(She's Little Ears.)

249
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,290
Your Highness.

250
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,090
Is your throat sore too?

251
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,530
Not at all.

252
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,600
Just stargazing.

253
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,170
("Xiaohua married the wrong prince.")

254
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,600
("At first, he kept trying
to pass her on to someone else.")

255
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,600
("But over time,)

256
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,330
(he slowly developed feelings for her.")

257
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,520
("And Xiaohua started
to warm up to him too.")

258
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,600
("But fate always has its own plans.")

259
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,810
("Another bond in Xiaohua's life)

260
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,170
(seems to be quietly unfolding too.")

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
("One is a match made by the heavens,)

262
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,600
(the other, a destined marriage.")

263
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,760
("How will Xiaohua ever choose
between the two?")

264
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,760
And then?

265
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,290
I really want to know what happens next!

266
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,450
I haven't figured that part out yet.

267
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,210
Well...

268
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,000
It's alright.
I'll think it through with you.

269
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Why did he faint again?

270
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,330
Dear?

271
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,690
Dear?

272
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,690
Dear?

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,120
What happened?

274
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,170
Why are you here all alone?

275
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,600
Everyone hates me.

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,170
My father ignores me.

277
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,240
My mother doesn't care about me.

278
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,210
Everyone else bullies me too.

279
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,760
No one likes me.

280
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,530
If no one plays with you, I will.

281
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Thank you.

282
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,450
Your hand is hurt.

283
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,340
I searched for her endlessly...

284
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,050
Only to find out she is
the Princess of Xilin.

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
Guihu.

286
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,960
Yes, Your Highness?

287
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,930
Take this and deliver it
to Princess Consort Jin.

288
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,600
Why are you standing there? Go!

289
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,360
Yes, Your Highness.

290
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,090
I wonder if you still remember me.

291
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,760
(Benevolent and Kind)

292
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,840
Well?

293
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,600
Any new clues about the cloud pattern?

294
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,330
Nothing at all.

295
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,810
Should I really give up?

296
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,980
Prince Yunnuo's man brought this over.

297
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,300
(Invitation)
He said personally

298
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,650
to give it to you directly.

299
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,880
(Tonight, Hour of Wu. Meet me
at the night market. From: Yunnuo)

300
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,690
Well?

301
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,360
Prince Yunnuo invited me
to the night market in the capital.

302
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,880
This time, I need to have
a proper meeting with him.

303
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,360
Yuetao,

304
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,010
what do men usually like?

305
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,160
The classic three-piece set.

306
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,160
Three-piece set?

307
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,250
Horses, swords, and parlors.

308
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,920
Horses, swords, and parlors?

309
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,530
The Juyi Parlor

310
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,680
is said to be where
all the beauties of Luzhao are.

311
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,290
Jiufeng told me that.

312
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,570
Your Highness,
I'll be going out tonight.

313
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,440
You may go as you please.

314
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,090
No need to report to me.

315
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,400
I was just being polite.

316
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,600
Her Highness looks so happy.

317
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,570
I wonder

318
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,490
if she's going out
with Prince Yunnuo again?

319
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
I think I even saw

320
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,400
Guihu sending her an invitation.

321
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,360
Who says I care?

322
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,250
I was just reminding you, Your Highness.

323
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,880
Flying kites by day,
night markets by night?

324
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,490
At this rate,

325
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,920
won't it be outside
of your original plan?

326
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,730
Who says it's outside the plan?

327
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,600
Everything is under control.

328
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,920
Sleep, then.

329
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,880
Sleep? It's still early.

330
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,770
Get changed.

331
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,300
Your Highness.

332
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,670
Your Highness.

333
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,200
You can't let others see you!

334
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,570
Aliya?

335
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,920
Why are you dressed like a man?

336
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,360
To take you, Prince Yunnuo,

337
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,440
to somewhere fun.

338
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,910
(Juyi Parlor)
Isn't this the Juyi Parlor?

339
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:29,880
Come on.

340
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,120
Alright.

341
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,090
Once we're in,
we'll call each other "Sir".

342
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,970
Welcome, Sirs.

343
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,030
Please come in.

344
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,670
Right this way.

345
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,570
(Fair Maiden Contest)

346
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,770
Brother Yun, relax.

347
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,600
Come on, just the two of us.

348
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:49,920
Please.

349
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,880
So?

350
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Ever been here before?

351
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,250
This way, Sirs.

352
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,810
Here, sit here.

353
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,880
Brother Yun,

354
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,440
I pulled some strings

355
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,570
to get this premium seat.

356
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,330
Great view.

357
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,250
I see.

358
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,840
Brother Yun, once the ladies come out,

359
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,780
see if anyone catches your eye.

360
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,360
You're joking.

361
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,770
The one I like is someone from my past.

362
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,030
I just don't know
if she still remembers me.

363
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,160
Didn't expect you to be
so devoted, Brother Yun.

364
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,830
(You've changed quite a bit
since we were kids.)

365
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,270
Brother Yun, can you play the pipa?

366
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I have never learned.

367
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,160
There's actually something you can't do?

368
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,810
Alright then, I'll give it a try.

369
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,730
You're in quite the mood.

370
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,400
Brother Yun,
what if I have hidden talent

371
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,120
and end up playing a masterpiece?

372
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
Bravo!

373
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,880
(She's actually playing for him.)

374
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,400
(She never played for me.)

375
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,840
Welcome to the Fair Maiden Contest!

376
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,530
Let's welcome our talented performers!

377
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,730
Aliya.

378
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,090
Have some peanuts.

379
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,920
Thank you, Brother Yun.

380
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,770
(Haven't you had peanuts before?)

381
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,120
(We have those in the residence!)

382
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,640
Careful!

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
(A man and woman
shouldn't touch each other!)

384
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,680
Now then...

385
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,300
It's too much.

386
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,850
Let's give a big round of applause.

387
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,490
Welcome Miss Wenxiu!

388
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,490
She'll be performing a fan dance for us!

389
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,440
Wonderful!

390
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,730
Amazing. Truly amazing.

391
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,610
Where is she?

392
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,640
Miss Wenxiu!

393
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,120
Fantastic!

394
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,360
Bravo!

395
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
She's stunning.

396
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,770
Brother Yun.

397
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,360
Don't you think Miss Wenxiu

398
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,200
looks a little familiar?

399
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,330
Now that you mention it,

400
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,400
she kind of does.

401
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,090
It feels like I've seen her before.

402
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,680
(They're sitting awfully close.)

403
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,770
Great.

404
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,330
Aliya.

405
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,400
I think we've seen enough here.

406
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,970
Why don't we go to the night market?

407
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,600
Sure.

408
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,970
Let's go.

409
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,880
Let's go.

410
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,730
Alright.

411
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,120
Your Highness!

412
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,250
Your Highness!

413
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,770
Hurry, before anyone sees you.

414
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,160
Alright, let's go.

415
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,120
Okay.

416
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,340
Your Highness.

417
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,870
The dress looked better.

418
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,010
Go let Miss Wenxiu out.

419
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,490
Check what needs checking.

420
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,570
I'm worried about your safety.

421
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,200
Alright, I'll be off then.

422
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,530
Okay.

423
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,530
Brother Yun.

424
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,840
Look at the pattern on this silk.

425
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,810
Isn't it unique?

426
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,640
Doesn't it look like the cloud pattern
on your jade pendant?

427
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,330
If you like these silks,

428
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,770
I'll buy them all for you.

429
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,050
No.

430
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,530
I mean this pattern.

431
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,010
This pattern

432
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,120
really looks like your cloud pattern.

433
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,730
Does that cloud pattern

434
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,330
have any special meaning?

435
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,970
It's just a cloud.

436
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,730
My mother designed it

437
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,270
to pass the time in the palace.

438
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,530
If you like it,

439
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,050
I'll give you a few more pieces.

440
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,090
Then thank you, Brother Yun.

441
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,250
Aliya, look.

442
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,050
These little trinkets are so delicate.

443
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,360
Enjoying the night market, huh?

444
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,330
Alright.

445
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,730
You two are clearly a perfect match.

446
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,600
Just what I hoped for.

447
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,200
Kids.

448
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,720
Hey, kids.

449
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,290
Kids.

450
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
You see those two over there?

451
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,320
Street stuff is more refined
than expected.

452
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,770
The three of you go over there,

453
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,840
and circle around them.

454
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,200
Break them up.

455
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,640
Here.

456
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,640
Take one each.

457
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,680
Go get some candied hawthorns.

458
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,600
Remember, break them up.

459
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,680
Go on now.

460
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,970
Let's go.

461
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,730
Candied hawthorns!
Get my candied hawthorns!

462
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,920
What's up with these kids?

463
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,490
It's nothing.

464
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
Children are always mischievous.

465
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,810
I once snuck out
of the palace as a kid too.

466
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,490
I met a friend I'll never forget.

467
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,160
Aliya, let's check out what's ahead.

468
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,730
This is Luzhao's

469
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,120
most famous makeup shop.

470
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,050
Take a look.

471
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,120
You could be interested.

472
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,330
Alright.

473
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,490
I like this one.

474
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,920
You're that excited?

475
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,880
We have these at the residence too.

476
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
(This is bad. I've been spotted.)

477
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
(What is Fu Chengjin doing here?)

478
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,920
(What do I do now?)

479
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,810
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

480
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,250
Admiring the moon.
It's beautiful tonight.

481
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,250
You're really odd, you know that?

482
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,270
The way you're dressed today
is just as strange.

483
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,440
Didn't I tell you I was coming out?

484
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,770
You, on the other hand...

485
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,600
Going out with your legs like that?

486
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,570
What if you got hurt?

487
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,640
Where's Jiufeng?

488
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,810
Exactly! I was wondering that too.

489
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,120
Why isn't he with me?
What on earth is he up to?

490
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,530
He's not even watching over me.

491
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,120
When I get back, I'm going to scold him.

492
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,010
Your Highness,

493
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,160
you're odd,
and so are the people around you.

494
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,200
Forget it. I should go
say goodbye to Prince Yunnuo.

495
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,680
Aliya.

496
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,830
Take this.

497
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,810
Your Highness?

498
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,600
Your Highness?

499
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,250
Your Highness!

500
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,730
Ghosts don't scare people to death,

501
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,880
but people do!

502
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:16,680
Enough nonsense.

503
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,160
Did you do as I told you to?

504
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,160
Princess Consort Jin is Qiao Manman,

505
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,570
the owner of Ruyi Everything Guild.

506
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,010
And the woman we met today

507
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,810
is Princess Aliya.

508
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,010
She's currently at Everything Guild.
Seems she lost her memory.

509
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,120
This situation is a bit complicated.

510
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,880
We'll need to keep digging.

511
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
(Prince Jin's Residence)

512
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Greetings, Prince Jin.

513
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,290
This is a small token from our prince.

514
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,010
Jiufeng.

515
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,160
A gift from Prince Yunnuo?

516
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,970
What are you all doing here?

517
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,440
Greetings, Princess Consort Jin.

518
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,970
A gift from Prince Yunnuo.

519
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,700
Prepared especially for you.

520
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,250
(The cloud pattern?
Prince Yunnuo meant what he said.)

521
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,570
He is very thoughtful.

522
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,530
It's a token of goodwill.

523
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,840
We appreciate the gesture.

524
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,330
Jiufeng, go help Guihu

525
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,730
and load all this onto the carriage.

526
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,290
Got it.

527
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,090
Wait.

528
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,330
You're sending everything back

529
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,200
just like that?

530
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,010
How's Guihu supposed to report back?

531
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
How about this?

532
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,120
I'll keep just this one chest.

533
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,360
Guihu,

534
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,330
send my regards to your prince.

535
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,810
I'll thank him in person.

536
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,400
Yes.

537
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,640
Visit and thank him, huh?

538
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,810
Fu Yunnuo sent so many gifts.

539
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,230
What exactly is he trying to say?

540
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,200
Do I need this kind of offering?

541
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:25,970
But Your Highness,

542
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,400
you're the one
who tried to pair them up.

543
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,400
That was then, and this is now.

544
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,440
From now on, if he sends gifts again,

545
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,440
return them all.

546
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,250
Got it.

547
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,120
Qiao Manman really has no sense at all.

548
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,440
She's not even worried
that getting close

549
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,970
to Yunnuo might expose her identity.

550
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,250
(Liuyun Mansion)
Your Highness, he refused the gifts.

551
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,650
Princess Consort Jin kept one chest.

552
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,490
Prince Jin also left a message.

553
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,270
If there's something to discuss,
talk to him, not her.

554
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,530
Did she say anything?

555
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,640
She...

556
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,600
You mean Princess Consort Jin?

557
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,440
She kept the chest
with the cloud pattern

558
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,330
and said she'd thank you in person.

559
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,920
Your Highness,
when we delivered the gifts,

560
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,250
Prince Jin was downright rude.

561
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,250
He clearly has no regard for your status

562
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:20,880
as a prince.

563
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,640
I believe we should take the initiative.

564
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,010
We can't be bullied.

565
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,840
Otherwise,

566
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,360
Prince Jin will only
take you even less seriously.

567
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,840
Yesterday, I planted people

568
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,770
among the villagers.

569
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,770
Soon, words of Princess Consort Jin
seducing you

570
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,530
will spread.

571
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,050
Then,

572
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,360
even if she's the Princess of Xilin,

573
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,490
His Majesty will secretly execute her

574
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,410
to save Prince Jin's reputation.

575
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,970
At that point,

576
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,770
Prince Jin will lose his standing

577
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,920
and the support of Xilin Kingdom.

578
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,970
Do not be rash.

579
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,570
What?

580
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,810
Your Highness!

581
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,090
We can't just let the opportunity slip!

582
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,050
Don't make me repeat myself.

583
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,020
(Everything Guild)

584
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,640
Dad? What's wrong, Dad?

585
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,133
What are you doing in broad daylight?

586
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,470
I was heading to the academy.

587
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,250
Why are you all covered up like that?

588
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,920
- Why so mysterious?
- Dad, is Fang here?

589
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,600
Fang left early this morning.

590
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,730
Last night...

591
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,770
How did I get home?

592
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,360
She carried you back on her back!

593
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,720
Did she say anything?

594
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,800
No, nothing really.

595
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,970
Look at you now.

596
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,850
Your gynophobia is acting up again.

597
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,680
You're nothing like I was in my day.

598
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,800
(Respect Teaching
and Study with Diligence)

599
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,370
Hello, everyone.

600
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,760
Let me introduce myself.

601
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
I'm Mr. Ji's

602
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,800
lawfully wedded wife.

603
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
My name is Fang.

604
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,050
Of course,

605
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,280
you may also call me Mrs. Ji.

606
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,970
Today,

607
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,570
I'm here to teach you all

608
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,120
what rules are

609
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,800
and what standards mean.

610
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,720
Miss Yuanxiang's words
are the real standards.

611
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,010
They are the rules.

612
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,580
Who do you think you are?

613
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,970
Exactly. And you are?

614
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,450
3 meters.

615
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,760
Stay at least 3 meters away from Mr. Ji

616
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,720
unless necessary.

617
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,450
0.6 meter.

618
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,720
When asking questions,
stay 0.6 meter from Mr. Ji.

619
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,160
Three times.

620
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,450
You may look at Mr. Ji
no more than three times.

621
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,600
Is that clear to everyone?

622
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,100
Why should we listen to you?
Who do you think you are?

623
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,120
If you won't listen,
then you can just stand and listen.

624
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,530
Did everyone understand?

625
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,050
Yes.

626
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Very good.

627
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,760
Stand.

628
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,410
Hello, Mr. Ji.

629
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,050
Hello, students. Please have a seat.

630
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,980
What are you doing here?

631
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,090
Why are you suddenly...

632
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,010
Class is starting.

633
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,490
"This is more than I could wish for."

634
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,600
What happened?

635
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,680
Yuanxiang, what's wrong?

636
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,410
Mr. Ji.

637
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,280
Your wife hit a pressure point.

638
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,450
Please come take a look.

639
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,200
She passed out?

640
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,970
Well, I do know a bit about acupuncture.

641
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,850
Why don't I try treating her?
