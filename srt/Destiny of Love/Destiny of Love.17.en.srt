27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,420
Dad.

28
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,030
Look at me. I'm this old already,

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,300
and I have accomplished nothing.

30
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,711
And I still have

31
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,990
to rely on you to support me.

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,110
I'm your father.

33
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,555
What's wrong with me supporting you?

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,990
But you can't support me forever.

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,311
I...

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,990
It's just forever. Of course, I can.

37
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,140
All right.

38
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:06,550
Just leave me alone for a bit.

39
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,790
Yes, let him calm down.

40
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,070
Here, Dad.

41
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,390
Here.

42
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,300
Have some tea.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,670
Thanks.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,350
You two... Get out of here!

45
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,420
Let me be alone!

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,990
But the tea...

47
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,350
Tea is...

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,110
Out!

49
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,900
Now!

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,990
Listen to me, Ji Mo...

51
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,510
Why are you packing?

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,600
What are you doing?

53
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,670
The day has finally come.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,270
What day?

55
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,390
The day I get to leave this residence.

56
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,990
Surprised? Unexpected?

57
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Help me carry those.

58
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,950
Are you running away?

59
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,110
No.

60
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm going traveling with His Highness.

61
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,830
That is running away.

62
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,670
Why don't you come with us?

63
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,700
Jiufeng's coming too.

64
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,550
All right. I'm in.

65
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,088
Won't be the first time anyway.

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:25,990
Good.

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,420
It'll be the four of us.
Roaming the world,

68
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,230
side by side.

69
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,990
Getting nice and plump together.

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,350
You're a little glutton.

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,110
Grab that for me, would you?

72
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,180
I nearly forgot.

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,270
The Everything Guild sent this.

74
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,300
(Ji Mo fainted.)

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,066
(Return to
Everything Guild immediately.)

76
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,460
Something happened at the guild.

77
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,270
I have to head back.

78
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,670
Can I go with you this time?

79
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,510
(If she finds out
about Aliya's memory loss,)

80
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,860
(things might get complicated.)

81
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,460
(Better to wait
until we're out of the palace.)

82
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:07,950
According to my calculations,

83
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,733
today's not a good day for you
to go out. You should stay and pack.

84
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:11,777
So help me pack, please.

85
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,270
Thanks!

86
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:15,733
Where are you going?

87
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,260
Something's come up at home.

88
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,422
I need to go back for a bit.

89
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,380
Your home is my home.

90
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,300
I'll go with you.

91
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:21,620
It's fine.

92
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,550
If you come,
they'll feel too much pressure.

93
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,244
I'll go alone.

94
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,590
Ji Mo!

95
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,350
I've said so much.

96
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,820
Why aren't you reacting at all?

97
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,110
Ji Mo.

98
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,420
What will your readers think of you?

99
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,590
What about the characters in your story?

100
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,740
Young man, pull yourself together.

101
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,260
Manman, stay on topic.

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,150
I'm telling you,

103
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,066
he's hopeless.
Nothing I say is getting through.

104
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,590
Manman...

105
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,620
Don't give up so fast.

106
00:04:58,733 --> 00:04:59,940
You came all the way here.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,790
You have to try
talking some sense into him.

108
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,790
Keep trying.

109
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,380
Mr. Ji.

110
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,990
Only if he still counts as human.

111
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,620
Look at him lying there.

112
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,750
Half-dead, and no spark left.

113
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:11,755
Not a shred of dignity.

114
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,940
Mr. Ji,

115
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,740
raising a son like him

116
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,500
must have been exhausting.

117
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,990
You're right, Manman.

118
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,550
Why is my life

119
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,550
so hard?

120
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,110
Mr. Ji, don't be upset.

121
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,030
Oh,

122
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,620
woe is my life...

123
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,940
What are you two doing?

124
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,710
He's already in a bad place.

125
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,300
Ease up a little.

126
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,860
Where are you going, Dear?

127
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,060
We've said so much.

128
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,260
Did anything we said
actually get through?

129
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,590
I'm not sure.

130
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,940
I wonder
how Princess Aliya is doing now.

131
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,777
Do you think she misses me?

132
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,670
Of course, she does.

133
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,710
Where are you going?

134
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,155
Back to my room.

135
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,550
Didn't you already move?

136
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Right. I forgot.

137
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,590
Oh, that memory of yours.

138
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,590
What occupies your mind?

139
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,300
Oh,

140
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,180
Jiufeng just told me

141
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,740
the kitchen made lotus seed soup
for you and His Highness.

142
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,820
I'll go get it now.

143

144
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,470
Do you like it?

145
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,470
You prepared all of this by yourself?

146
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,180
From the moment you left until now,

147
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,711
I haven't stopped.

148
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,990
How did you know I like this color?

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,860

150
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,110
You always use this color.

151
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,666
Wasn't hard to guess.

152
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,110
You're surprisingly observant.

153
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,590
This is your real surprise.

154
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,470
When I came of age,

155
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,266
Mother asked someone to give this to me.

156
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,110
She said it was meant
for my future wife.

157
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,110

that Princess Consort Jin's father
is Qiao Yuanzhi.

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,620
I plan to invite Hu Ersa to attend

188
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,470
tomorrow's imperial martial exam.

189
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,866
Do you intend to expose
Qiao Manman in front of everyone?

190
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:01,870
Even if her identity is revealed,

191
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,140
with Father's fondness for Brother,

192
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:05,288
he likely won't pursue it.

193
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,260
But if Hu Ersa stays in Luzhao,

194
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,222
they'll be constantly
watching their backs.

195
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,070
What I really want is to distract them.

196
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,800
Keep them too preoccupied to interfere.

197
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,780
Only then

198
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,430
can the real show unfold.

199
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,230
He tore up a book?

200
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,380
He is getting worse by the day.

201
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,710
Fang,

202
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,140
you're a miracle physician.

203
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,540
Do something about him.

204
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
How's this, Dad?

205
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,890
I'll give him something
to calm his nerves,

206
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,430
and then take him out for a walk.

207
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,540
Get some air.

208
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,155
You think that'll work?

209
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:14,950
It will.

210
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,310
He'll be all right.

211
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:24,290
(Folk Martial Arts Arena)

212
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,620
Impressive!

213
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,790
Today's the final day!

214
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,740
If you want to compete, sign up now!

215
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,590
Dear, we should leave.

216
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,688
Isn't that Ji Mo
from the imperial exams?

217
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,470
Want to take the martial exam?

218
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,933
With that scrawny frame?

219
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:47,090
Couldn't pass the written,
and now trying martial arts?

220
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,950
Watch your mouth!

221
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,240
You're a woman. Know your place
and stay out of this.

222
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:50,622
You...

223
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,140
Fang.

224
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,350
Don't you dare insult my wife!

225
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,600
Why don't we settle this in the ring?

226
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,870
Let's see what you've really got.

227
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,900
Fine. I'm not scared of you.

228
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,350
You're on.

229
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,860
Fine.

230
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:00,710
Let's sign up.

231
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,620
Sign us up.

232
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,780
Sign him up.

233
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,740
Let's do it.

234
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,110
Dear.

235
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,780
He is Ji Mo.

236
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,230
Ji Mo.

237
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,110
Dear, forget it...

238
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,511
Don't worry, Fang. I can do this.

239
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,900
Come on.

240
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
He passed out

241
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,470
in the exam hall

242
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,310
last time.

243
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,540
No way he can handle this.

244
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:15,500
I will read
the rules of the competition.

245
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,500
During 15 minutes,

246
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,260
there are no restrictions
on martial arts sects

247
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,380
or techniques.

248
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,990
The last person standing on the platform

249
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,780
will be this region's
martial champion candidate.

250
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,740
- Great!
- All right!

251
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,260
Prepare yourselves.

252
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,660
How dare you hit me!

253
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,350
Scram!

254
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,190
Out of my way!

255
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,830
Move!

256
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,230
Scram!

257
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,350
Dear!

258
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,990
The other men are real martial artists.

259
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,990
- Great!
- Great!

260
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,590
Come on!

261
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,710
Come at me all at once!

262
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,333
Bring it on!

263
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,310
I'll teach you a lesson.

264
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,377
Get him!

265
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,350
Dear!

266
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,620
Dear!

267
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,590
Get up!

268
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,590
Dear!

269
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,600
Brother. Princess Consort Jin.

270
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,422
What a coincidence.

271
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,950
It's been a while, Aliya.

272
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,310
I see you've been well.

273
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,740
Yes...

274
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,020
Thanks for your concern.

275
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,780
Brother, excuse us.

276
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:53,888
We'll see you later.

277
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,230
How did those two end up together?

278
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,230
No idea.

279
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,311
But with His Majesty

280
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,540
holding the martial champion selections
in the Imperial Garden,

281
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,044
and both Hu Ersa
and Prince Yunnuo getting involved,

282
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:19,311
something's definitely going on.

283
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,690
Your Highness, you must be careful.

284
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,380
Got it.

285
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,022
Adapt to every challenge as it comes.

286
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,710
Don't worry.

287
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,140
Come on.

288
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,500
(Ring)

289
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,110
- Great!
- Great!

290
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,260
Nice!

291
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,020
Get him!

292
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,310
- Fight!
- Fight!

293
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,310
Great move!

294
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,710
- Fight!
- Nice moves!

295
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,860
Great!

296
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,740
Impressive.

297
00:15:58,911 --> 00:15:59,590
- Great!
- Great!

298
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,260
Get up, Dear!

299
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,900
Dear!

300
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,140
Come on! Get up!

301
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,430
You can do it!

302
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:05,288
Time's running out!

303
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:05,860
Get up!

304
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,710
Get up!

305
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,830
Time's running out!

306
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,020
Get up!

307
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,990
Get up!

308
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Get up!

309
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,310
Hurry!

310
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,110
Get up!

311
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,830
Time's up!

312
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,110
Hurry!

313
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,230
The martial champion candidate
selected for this region is

314
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,590
Mr. Ji Mo.

315
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,710
This is ridiculous!

316
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,466
How can it be him?

317
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,860
No way!

318
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,420
How could he become a martial champion?

319
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:30,950
Right.

320
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,950
As per the rules,

321
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,500
he will enter the palace
with the other selected candidates

322
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,710
to be presented to His Majesty
this afternoon.

323
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,140
- Great!
- Congratulations!

324
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,900
What gives?

325
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:40,660
- Great!
- Great!

326
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:41,860
Great!

327
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,630
His Majesty has arrived.

328
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,910
- Long live Father.
- Long live His Majesty.

329
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,580
Be seated.

330
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,580
Everyone,

331
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,780
today's a palace banquet.

332
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,670
Feel free to relax and enjoy yourselves.

333
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,390
Let's drink together.

334
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,844
General Hu Ersa has come from afar,

335
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,066
and it has been a long time
since he last saw his sister.

336
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,500
It was not easy for them to reunite.

337
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,780
So I raise a toast to General Hu Ersa.

338
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,430
Thank you, Prince Yunnuo.

339
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,060
Wonderful dance.

340
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,670
Indeed.

341
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,340
Pretty dances and frivolous music.

342
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,150
Boring.

343
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,910
Stop it.

344
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,500
Stop!

345
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,340
In Xilin,

346
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,740
we've seen enough of this stuff.

347
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,670
So dull. So boring.

348
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,580
How disrespectful.

349
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:19,990
Indeed.

350
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,740
Your Majesty.

351
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,870
That savage Hu Ersa

352
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,340
dares to insult Luzhao.

353
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:31,820
Your Majesty.

354
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,340
I did not mean it that way.

355
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,190
I'm merely a crude man.

356
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,111
I do not understand
these refined performances.

357
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,740
I felt sleepy,

358
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:39,870
and I simply found it boring.

359
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,430
General Hu Ersa, you've come from afar.

360
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,260
We can't let you leave disappointed.

361
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,430
If you have any suggestions,

362
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,060
speak freely.

363
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,670
In the north, we are used

364
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,060
to being blunt and combative.

365
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,100
Perhaps

366
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,780
a sparring match to liven things up?

367
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,060
I'll gladly go first.

368
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,150
Sparring to entertain the court.

369
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,540
Not a bad idea.

370
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,060
We see dance performances all the time.

371
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,300
A change of pace might be nice.

372
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:23,266
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,230
General Hu Ersa.

374
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,540
I have gathered a few guards at random.

375
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,100
Allow them to help

376
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,470
loosen your joints a little.

377
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,780
Very well.

378
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,540
Your Highness.

379
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,990
Those don't look like normal guards.

380
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,580
Who are they?

381
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,670
Tian. Di. Xuan. Huang.

382
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,870
Father's four most elite covert guards.

383
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,260
Covert guards?

384
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,990
The kind that lurks in the dark?

385
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,150
Once they fight, no one survives.

386
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,990
That's rather...

387
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,230
Intense.

388
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,870
But Hu Ersa did ask for a fight.

389
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,377
No need for them to hold back now.

390
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,820
That's brutal?

391
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,340
That's Tian.

392
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:36,177
Cute name, huh?

393
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,150
His Tianshan Hand-Breaker

394
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,710
is vicious beyond imagination.

395
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,100
Anyone who's fought him

396
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,644
usually dies only after managing
to utter one last word.

397
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,500
What word?

398
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,670
"No."

399
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,820
That's Di.

400
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,500
His Soul-Hooking Technique

401
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,990
messes with the mind.

402
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,500
One glance

403
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,060
and you're trapped in an illusion.

404
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:00,910
Sounds like some kind of sorcery...

405
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,780
Really?

406
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,990
Xuan is the real mystery.

407
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
They say his martial arts

408
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,430
weren't passed down from a master.

409
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:12,060
He invented them himself
by meditating on the Tao Te Ching.

410
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,910
Is he even human at this point?

411
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,670
He sounds like a deity.

412
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,870
The real deity is Huang.

413
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
He wrote his own martial arts manual.

414
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,780
It's said that the manual
caused chaos and bloodshed

415
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,060
throughout the martial world.

416
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,820
Father's covert guards are terrifying.

417
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,300
And he sent all of them

418
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,780
just to deal with Hu Ersa.

419
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,910
Seems like the legend
is about to be shattered.

420
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,740
And that tells us...

421
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,580
Tell us what?

422
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,480
It tells us to believe
none of what you hear.

423
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:04,533
Only what you see.

424
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

425
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,230
Not a single one held their own.

426
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,950
Would anyone else care to give it a go?

427
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,100
Well...

428
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,150
This is unexpected...

429
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,470
- Father.
- Father.

430
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,780
Today is the final selection round
for the martial champion.

431
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,670
Why not let the candidates

432
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:52,540
show us

433
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,230
what they've got?

434
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,710
Sounds interesting.

435
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:00,470
Candidates for martial champion

436
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,111
must be the best of a kingdom.
Surely their skills are unmatched.

437
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,870
Your Majesty.

438
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,060
I would be honored to spar with them.

439
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,020
Very well.

440
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,060
As General Hu wishes.

441
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

442
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,870
Summon the martial champion candidates!

443
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

444
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,990
Long live His Majesty.

445
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,888
What's he doing here?

446
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,430
Rise.

447
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

448
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,230
Let the match begin!

449
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,390
Martial champion candidate Ji Mo, enter.

450
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,990
I'm Ji Mo. Nice to meet you.

451
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,390
(At this rate,)

452
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,300
(not only will His Majesty
be humiliated,)

453
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,230
(Ji Mo might actually die.)

454
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,390
What's wrong, Aliya?

455
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,190
Princess Consort Jin?

456
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:51,377
What's the matter with her?

457
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,044
Father.

458
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,710
She fainted from heatstroke.

459
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:55,622
We should continue the match tomorrow.

460
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,580
Very well.

461
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,110
Let's end things here for today.

462
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,639
The duels shall resume tomorrow.

463
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,590
Have the imperial physician
tend to her at once.

464
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,180
(Everything Guild)

465
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,340
What's going on, Fang?

466
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,990
What was Ji Mo doing
at the martial exam?

467
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:16,133
I took him out for fresh air.

468
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:18,330
We happened to run
into the martial champion selection.

469
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,430
He acted on impulse and stepped up.

470
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,190
But right after he got on stage,
he fainted.

471
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,340
When he awoke,

472
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:27,060
everyone else was already on the ground.

473
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,540
And just like that, he won.

474
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:33,422
Your Highness.

475
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,630
What happens if my brother

476
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:36,920
doesn't attend the final trial?

477
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,888
According to the law,

478
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,190
skipping the palace trial

479
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,780
means exile to the borderlands.

480
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,940
He'd be banned
from ever entering the capital again.

481
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,870
Father's covert guards

482
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,644
are that powerful,

483
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:49,740
and they couldn't even
land a hit on Hu Ersa.

484
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:52,400
Ji Mo doesn't know
the first thing about martial arts.

485
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,777
How is he supposed to fight?

486
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,870
You have a point.

487
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,950
So what do we do now?

488
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,910
How about

489
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,910
we just make a run for it?

490
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,230
No way! I'm not going anywhere.

491
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,780
Fine.

492
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:12,977
You won't leave.

493
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,260
You could always fake being sick.

494
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,580
No. I'm going to fight.

495
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,910
I want to live for my wife.

496
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,630
I want her to know
that loving me was not a mistake.

497
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,230
In that case, stay alive for me.

498
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,333
You're literally walking
into death right now!

499
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,300
Stop!

500
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:30,666
There's still time.
We can figure things out.

501
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,230
If I have to live hiding and running,

502
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,780
I'd rather die an honorable death.

503
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,930
You are hopeless at everything.

504
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:39,770
But you sure know
how to get yourself killed.

505
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,780
I heard everything you just said.

506
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,230
Stubborn boy.

507
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,470
Mr. Ji, he's beyond me.

508
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,755
If he insists on going,
knock him out again.

509
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,800
Let's go, Your Highness.

510
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,780
Don't just look at me.
Take him back to his room.

511
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,820
He's too heavy.

512
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,688
I'll do it then.

513
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,933
Ugh, this is driving me crazy.

514
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,950
With everything going on,

515
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,450
he still insists on playing the hero.

516
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,977
So this is the kind of environment
you grew up in.

517
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,910
You must be disappointed.

518
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,260
I am not some proper noble lady,

519
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,500
nor a delicate little flower.

520
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,155
Just an ordinary girl from the streets.

521
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,230
Not at all.

522
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,990
You're unique.

523
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,910
Your Highness.

524
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,060
You really don't care about who I am?

525
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,060
Of course not.

526
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,500
Who you are doesn't matter.

527
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,430
What matters is that I like you.

528
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,670
I like you very, very much!

529
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,500
Ji Mo has
no martial arts foundation at all.

530
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,540
How could someone like him

531
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,630
even be allowed
into the martial champion finals?

532
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,670
Is Luzhao out of capable people?

533
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,580
If Luzhao really had no one left,

534
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Xilin would have

535
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,710
seized our kingdom long ago.

536
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,580
And you wouldn't have needed
a marriage alliance.

537
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,580
So, he must have some kind of backing?

538
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,430
He is Qiao Manman's cousin.

539
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,390
No wonder Qiao Manman and Fu Chengjin

540
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,540
kept stalling for the time

541
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,340
during the match.

542
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,500
Of course.

543
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,100
If he got accidentally hurt by you,

544
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,580
all their scheming

545
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,950
would be ruined.

546
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,470
But letting a fragile scholar

547
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,822
become the martial champion...

548
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,990
Prince Jin must be out of his mind.

549
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,300
Out of his mind?

550
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,100
If Ji Mo becomes the martial champion,

551
00:29:57,911 --> 00:29:59,488
and everything else is arranged well,

552
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,190
then it is just a matter of time.

553
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:05,150
Then why not let me
expose Qiao Manman's real identity?

554
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,390
You're tempting fate by risking this.

555
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,300
We must not expose Qiao Manman.

556
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,820
In fact,

557
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,100
we should give them a push.

558
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,020
Have you lost your mind too?

559
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,950
You know what Fu Chengjin wants,

560
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,177
and you're helping him get it?

561
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:21,444
That's like digging a well
when they're dying of thirst.

562
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,933
That may be so.

563
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,230
But who can be certain who will end up

564
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,470
drinking from it?

565
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,870
Drink what?

566
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,260
Oh, thank you.

567
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,580
There we go.

568
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm tired.

569
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,511
All right.

570
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,910
When he wakes up again,

571
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,470
I'll hit him over the head again.

572
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,340
You know medicine.

573
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,311
Can you do something to keep him asleep
for a full day and night?

574
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,470
He is still my son.

575
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,580
I can't keep bashing him with a stick.

576
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,390
I'll try.

577
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,230
Why did you prick me?

578
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,950
I'm sorry, Dad.

579
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,540
But I have to respect Ji Mo's decision.

580
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,580
- Long live Father.
- Long live His Majesty.

581
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,260
Rise.

582
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,390
Be seated.

583
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,710
The match begins now.

584

585
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,470
Ancestors,

586
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,190
please protect my husband
and bring him back safely.
