=Episode 22=

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,488
You've worked hard.

28
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,377
Bought so many things
so early in the morning.

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,400
Not at all.

30
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,111
This is our wedding.

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,000
It must be what you imagined.

32
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,160
Ms. Qiao.

33
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,555
Someone's here for you.

34
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,890
Greetings, Prince Jin
and Princess Consort Jin.

35
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,020
I'm no longer Prince Jin.

36
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,711
No need for formalities.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,888
Please sit.

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,866
Prince Jin, please.

39
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:32,222
It's good
that Princess Consort Jin is alive.

40
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,444
If His Majesty knew you and Her Highness
were getting married,

41
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,688
he would be glad.

42
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,100
Are my father, mother

43
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,930
and everything in the palace all right?

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,450
Everything's fine,

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,820
but His Majesty's health

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,666
isn't as good as before.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,260
My father is old.

48
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,490
He can let Yunnuo

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,222
take care of some matters.

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,050
His Majesty wants to do so too.

51
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,380
It's just

52
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,844
that this is a big deal.

53
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,020
Prince Yunnuo is shrewd.

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,860
His Majesty is worried.

55
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,820
Yunnuo is shrewd,

56
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,444
but he's not bad by nature.

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,300
With guidance,

58
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,100
he'll achieve great things.

59
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,300
Human nature
is complex and ever-changing.

60
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,511
Prince Yunnuo is now
in charge of the state affairs.

61
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,140
However, under his leadership,

62
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,533
Luzhao Kingdom is increasingly unstable.

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,444
There are disasters everywhere.

64
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,980
The locust plague is out of control.

65
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,260
Refugees are homeless.

66
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,533
Prince Jin.

67
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,860
His Majesty

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,769
hopes you can return to the palace

69
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,800
and assist him.

70
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,980
This is my home.

71
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,088
Please tell His Majesty.

72
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,244
Prince Jin...

73
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,380
I've made up my mind.

74
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,177
Mr. Eunuch,

75
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:46,933
take care.

76
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,488
If you want to visit Father and Mother,

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,866
I'll go back with you.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,580
Will Father think

79
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,200
you refuse to go back

80
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,380
because of me?

81
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,444
Mother keeps to herself
and rarely goes out.

82
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,822
I share the same thoughts as Mother's.

83
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,244
Father should understand.

84
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,890
All this is my choice.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,311
You have nothing to do with it.

86
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:33,660
(Liuyun Mansion)

87
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,960
The eunuch you asked us
to keep a close eye on

88
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,222
left the palace.

89
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,740
We followed him

90
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,620
to a place

91
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,140
called Yinyi Village,

92
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,844
where he met Prince Jin.

93
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,600
What else?

94
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,533
Princess Consort Jin was also there.

95
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,955
No, Qiao Manman.

96
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,800
She's not dead

97
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,466
and is preparing for a wedding.

98
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,822
Prince Yunnuo misses Qiao Manman.

99
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,088
If he knew Qiao Manman was still alive,

100
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,422
he would be elated.

101
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,977
You're very good
at guessing what Master wants.

102
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,688
You've taught me well.

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,177
Mr. Guihu...

104
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,711
Now that His Highness is in power,

105
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,444
he mustn't be distracted
by that woman again.

106
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,850
Your Highness, we just received news

107
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,733
that His Majesty sent an eunuch
to secretly meet Prince Jin outside.

108
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,580
How loving.

109
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,422
Even if Brother isn't in the capital,

110
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,488
Father misses him day and night.

111
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,530
I'm

112
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,330
by his side every day,

113
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,333
yet he only criticizes me.

114
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,422
Since we found out
Fu Chengjin's whereabouts,

115
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:56,133
should we kill him
to eliminate all future troubles?

116
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,020
If something happens to Brother

117
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,844
and the news reaches the capital,

118
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,044
it will only be unfavorable to me.

119
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,422
What do you plan to do?

120
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,200
Where's the eunuch
who delivered the message?

121
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,511
He's on the way back.

122
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,000
Send him on his way then.

123
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,140
I understand.

124
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:13,933
Keep a close eye.

125
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,450
If any palace servant or eunuch

126
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,866
sends a message to Prince Jin,

127
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,355
kill all of them

128
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,888
without mercy.

129
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,888
Yes.

130
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:28,010
(Hanyuan Hall)

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,888
- Is this how you do your job?
- Your Majesty!

132
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,690
The tea I usually drink is only 70% hot.

133
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,590
- You're getting more useless.
- I deserve to die.

134
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,955
All right, stop wiping.

135
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,777
What time is it now?

136
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,355
Why isn't Prince Yunnuo here yet?

137
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,488
Prince Yunnuo has arrived.

138
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,800
Greetings, Father.

139
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,850
Greetings?

140
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,733
Yunnuo.

141
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,511
You're really filial.

142
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,955
I'm fearful.

143
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,770
All these memorials

144
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,777
are urging me

145
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,355
to name a crown prince
as soon as possible.

146
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,700
You're in your prime and healthy.

147
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,888
You have no problem
in handling state affairs.

148
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,530
It may be because you intend
to name a crown prince,

149
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,260
so the ministers thought
of going along with Heaven's will.

150
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,580
Going along with Heaven's will?

151
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you think
that naming you as the crown prince

152
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,088
is going along with Heaven's will?

153
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,422
Father.

154
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,400
Why not?

155
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,260
Brother has gone.

156
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,000
If I'm not Heaven's will,

157
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,820
who is?

158
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,500
How dare you?

159
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,288
Father.

160
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,977
Take good care of yourself.

161
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,844
By the way,

162
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,740
didn't you ask me here today

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,177
to discuss the locust plague
in the northwest?

164
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,090
I've told you before.

165
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,530
Minister Ma has performed very well

166
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,466
in disaster relief in previous years.

167
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,266
He's qualified for this task.

168
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,930
I told you

169
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,400
this person has poor character

170
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,050
and can't be entrusted
with important tasks.

171
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,377
Have you forgotten?

172
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,860
Father, don't worry.

173
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,500
He is now handling this matter
in the northwest.

174
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,355
Sharing Father's worries

175
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,690
is my responsibility.

176
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,290
Minister Li is incompetent
in dealing with disaster relief.

177
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,890
I've sent someone to behead him

178
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,777
to comfort the people.

179
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,140
You...

180
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,200
By the way, Father,

181
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,777
I've sent Imperial Censor Jin

182
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:11,666
to handle the flood in the northeast.

183
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,555
You have nothing to worry about.

184
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,890
You've reached the age of retirement.

185
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,530
I'll take care

186
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,155
of everything in this palace.

187
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,260
Eunuch Gao.

188
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,740
Send Father
to Empress Yun's palace to rest.

189
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:28,888
Father isn't feeling well.

190
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,020
If anyone breaks in without permission

191
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,290
and disturbs Father and Empress Yun,

192
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,311
all will be

193
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,140
killed without mercy.

194
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,977
You...

195
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
You monster!

196
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,810
Monster.

197
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,866
Your Majesty.

198
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,844
Your Majesty.

199
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,530
Your Majesty.

200
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,650
Your Majesty!

201
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,020
Monster...

202
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,770
Your Majesty.

203
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,733
Summon the imperial physician!

204
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,410
Monster...

205
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,933
Summon the imperial physician!

206
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,410
Fu Yunnuo, what are you trying to do?

207
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,690
Since Prince Jin left,

208
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,222
you've been avoiding me.

209
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:23,266
What do you want to do?

210
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,500
Guihu.

211
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,570
If I hadn't stopped you here today,

212
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,533
I don't know when I could see you again.

213
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:33,200
What? Do you want to burn the bridge
after crossing it?

214
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,688
General, what are you talking about?

215
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,050
After Brother left,

216
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
there was much to deal with
in the palace.

217
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,260
Don't play tricks with me.

218
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,355
I helped you get to where you are now,

219
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,740
but you have no intention

220
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,022
of helping me ascend the throne.

221
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,460
Aren't you just casting me aside

222
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:47,577
after using me?

223
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,020
Don't think I don't know

224
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,340
that you're in charge of the palace now.

225
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:55,022
It's only a matter of time
before you get to the top.

226
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,140
While others fought,

227
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,860
you simply reaped the benefits.

228
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,980
Given your current situation,

229
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,690
who are you to make requests?

230
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,980
You haven't seen me for a long time,

231
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,666
so I came here to remind you.

232
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,380
I have my own plans.

233
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,100
You have nothing to worry.

234
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,690
I shall wait for your good news.

235
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,770
Your Highness.

236
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,555
What do you plan to do with him?

237
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,930
He's useless.

238
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,410
It's a waste of food to keep him.

239
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,000
Everyone.

240
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,500
Refugees are about to enter our village.

241
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,170
Usually,

242
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,740
you all have ideas of your own.

243
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,380
We want to ask you for advice

244
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,140
to see what we should do now.

245
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,050
Chief, these refugees

246
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
just want food.

247
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,533
Let's give them some of our food,

248
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,770
and they'll leave.

249
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,530
Good idea.

250
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,244
Our village is not rich to begin with.

251
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,410
We can't afford to give out extra food

252
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,740
to the refugees.

253
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,622
Chief, I'll send people
to guard the village entrance.

254
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,844
They won't be able to get in.

255
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,530
This can only
solve the problem temporarily.

256
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,690
Our village is small,

257
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,500
but there are so many refugees.

258
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,488
I'm afraid we can't withstand them.

259
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,810
If one of them gets the plague,

260
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,620
our entire village

261
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,460
will be in crisis.

262
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:41,822
It's a pity that Young Master
has gone to the neighboring village.

263
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:42,711
Otherwise,

264
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,260
he'll know what to do.

265
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,170
What? Him?

266
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,650
What can he do?

267
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,690
He can't carry or lift a thing.

268
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,133
What are you talking about?

269
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,260
Chief, you can't say that.

270
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,380
That's because you don't know him.

271
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,810
If he were here,

272
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,220
he could easily solve this.

273
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,050
Chief.

274
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,890
Chief, we have a problem.

275
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,290
The refugees have entered here.

276
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,100
What? They are here?

277
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh my gosh. You can't even
defend the entrance.

278
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,460
Well...

279
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,060
What if they're infected
with the plague?

280
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:10,733
Don't worry!

281
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,770
I've settled down the refugees
at the entrance.

282
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,930
Who allowed you

283
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,290
to let the refugees in?

284
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:16,930
Yes.

285
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,244
Chief.

286
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,290
Please ask the villagers

287
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,170
to provide food to help the refugees.

288
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,410
Our village isn't rich.

289
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,690
We can't give much food to refugees.

290
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,990
Each household
only needs to provide 31.25 Kg of rice.

291
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,777
31.25 Kg?

292
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,000
Would that be enough?

293
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,688
You're just stalling for time.

294
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:35,688
We won't fall for it.

295
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll write a letter as proof.
31.25 Kg of rice is enough.

296
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,355
I won't ask for more.

297
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,733
Chief, if you don't provide food,

298
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,044
the refugees will rob us.

299
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,890
Not only will we lose our food,

300
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,888
but more people will also die.

301
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,066
There are refugees
rioting outside the village.

302
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,410
Everyone, please consider carefully.

303
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,050
Think about your families.

304
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,777
These 31.25 Kg of rice
can not only help the refugees

305
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,600
but also save us.

306
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,290
Will 31.25 Kg of rice be enough?

307
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,777
A gentleman keeps his promise.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,149
I'll write a letter as proof.

309
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,044
What about the plague?

310
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,244
What do we do about the plague?

311
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,329
Refugees with the plague have been isolated
on the mountain outside the village.

312
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,330
They won't descend the mountain
before recovering.

313
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,400
Please don't worry.

314
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,340
Aliya.

315
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,755
I will have to trouble you

316
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,266
to treat the refugees on the mountain.

317
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,930
No problem, leave it to me.

318
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,479
It's just 31.25 Kg of rice.

319
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,770
Our family is willing to give it.

320
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,769
I'll give 31.25 Kg of rice.

321
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,644
I'm willing too.

322
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,422
I'm willing too.

323
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:35,866
Me too.

324
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,740
All right.

325
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:37,930
In that case,

326
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,220
I'll trust you for once.

327
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,140
As the village chief,

328
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,466
I'll give them 62.5 Kg.

329
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,930
That's all. Only these 62.5 Kg.

330
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,733
Thank you, Chief.

331
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,444
Thank you all.

332
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,650
Mr. Fu, in that case,

333
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,930
I'll ask the villagers to prepare.

334
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,050
Chief.

335
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,980
We'll all go with you.

336
00:14:59,570 --> 00:14:59,890
Sure.

337
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,890
Here. This way, Chief.

338
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,570
Let's go.

339
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,050
Let's go back and prepare.

340
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,100
Father.

341
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,460
Look. I'm right, aren't I?

342
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,822
Fu Chengjin does have many ideas.

343
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,690
I never doubted him.

344
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,170
What bothers me

345
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,460
is His Highness
shouldn't stay in this village

346
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,688
for the rest of his life.

347
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,140
But isn't this what he always wanted?

348
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,890
His Highness
was once burdened by his past,

349
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,620
but now...

350
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,620
Manman.

351
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,044
His Highness has great ambitions.

352
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,740
If one day

353
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,860
he made up his mind

354
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,340
to face his true feelings,

355
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
you must keep him company.

356
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,170
Because a wise ruler

357
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,444
is exactly
what Luzhao Kingdom needs now.

358
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,530
Father, don't worry.

359
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,530
No matter what decision he makes,

360
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,530
I will trust him

361
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,911
and accompany him to the end.

362
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,020
Let's go.

363
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,020
It's overwhelming.

364
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,860
But we only have this little food.

365
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,800
The refugees will finish eating it soon.

366
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,690
What about the future?

367
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,333
We can't go on like this.

368
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,140
As soon as we serve the porridge,

369
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,688
the refugees start fighting over it.

370
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,050
The weak didn't even have food to eat.

371
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,644
What should we do then?

372
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,220
What's this?

373
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:38,666
Where did you get so many steamed buns?

374
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,400
I asked the villagers
to help steam them.

375
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,000
Why did you throw the steamed buns
into the porridge?

376
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,355
There's a shortage of food now.

377
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,844
Adding steamed buns to the porridge

378
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,530
can prevent refugees from overeating

379
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,020
and suffering indigestion.

380
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,290
On the other hand,

381
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,740
it can keep the refugees full

382
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,380
when food is scarce.

383
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,460
The food will then last longer.

384
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:04,970
I'll leave these to you first.
I'll go get some more.

385
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,444
All right.

386
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,511
Let's go.

387
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,955
Come here.

388
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,511
Young Master, I'll get the steamed buns.

389
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,420
Mr. Qiao.

390
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,330
I was too harsh on you before.

391
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Now it seems

392
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,266
you truly care for the people.

393
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,700
Mr. Qiao.

394
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,355
I'm part of the people myself.

395
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,770
You shouldn't be here.

396
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,180
You know that very well.

397
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:52,911
I won't return to the palace.

398
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,260
Mr. Qiao.

399
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,500
The life I desire

400
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,777
is this free and easy life.

401
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,290
What do you think

402
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,155
this barrel can hold?

403
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,740
Barrel is just a name.

404
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,666
If it holds water, it's a water barrel.

405
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:18,533
If it holds grain, it's a grain barrel.

406
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,900
As for what you want to put in it,

407
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,711
you'll find out sooner or later.

408
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,860
(Liuyun Mansion)

409
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:47,177
Your Highness.

410
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,660
News from the disaster area.

411
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,200
Minister Ma
failed to relieve the disaster.

412
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,420
He embezzled disaster relief funds,

413
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,777
causing public resentment and riots.

414
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,844
Your Highness, the people are restless.

415
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,688
If this goes on, the ministers in court
will also be unsettled.

416
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:06,288
It'll be unfavorable
to your ascension to the throne.

417
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,422
Your Highness!

418
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:11,444
Are you thinking about that woman again?

419
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,570
Guihu.

420
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,977
Have I not disciplined you for too long?

421
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,740
Even if I'm out of line, I'll speak up.

422
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,980
It's urgent.

423
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,570
You mustn't let a woman

424
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,420
ruin everything.

425
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:29,288
Send a message to Minister Ma.

426
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,290
Tell him

427
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,850
that news of the riots and disaster

428
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,700
must not reach the capital.

429
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,290
When necessary,

430
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,266
he may take drastic actions.

431
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,500
Everyone, get up.

432
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,330
Kind people have brought us food.

433
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
- Darling.
- Here.

434
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,940
Hurry and thank them.

435
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,900
Take the bowls first.

436
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,570
Here.

437
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,260
Here.

438
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,980
Here is porridge.

439
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,888
Be careful, it's hot.

440
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,180
Thank you very much.

441
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:52,288
Be careful, it's hot.

442
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,333
Here, take your time.

443
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,333
Come again if you need more.

444
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,577
Everyone, take your time.
Sit down and drink slowly.

445
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,711
Drink slowly. Be careful of the heat.

446
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,420
Look.

447
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,900
All these refugees can survive

448
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,940
because of you.

449
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,850
I didn't expect

450
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,622
so many refugees
to come to Yinyi Village.

451
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,180
This northwest locust plague

452
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,220
is much worse than I thought.

453
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,777
(Minister Sun, reading this letter
is like us meeting in person.)

454
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:24,880
(The northwest locust plague
is serious.)

455
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,479
(Refugees lost their homes.)

456
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,130
(To control
the number of starving people,)

457
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,377
(opening the granaries
to provide grain is necessary.)

458
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:33,050
(Remember to add some steamed buns)

459
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,777
(into the rations for disaster victims.)

460
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,644
(Firstly, it can control
the refugees' eating pace,)

461
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,600
(preventing them from dying suddenly
due to overeating.)

462
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,500
(Secondly,
it can make the ration last longer.)

463
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,349
(The number of refugees
increased dramatically.)

464
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,750
(Something fishy must be going on
between the higher and lower ranks.)

465
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:50,666
(You must contact
senior cabinet officials)

466
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,111
(to impeach the person in charge.)

467
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,770
(Chengjin.)

468
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,888
Young Master.

469
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,355
How are the wedding preparations going?

470
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,700
Everything is ready.

471
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,466
We're just waiting for the day.

472
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,020
All right.

473
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,222
Deliver this immediately.

474
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:13,810
(To Minister Sun)

475
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,420
Sure.

476
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:21,570
(Yinyi Village)

477
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,090
Thank you for saving us, Mr. Fu.

478
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
It's only right to do so.

479
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,770
Mr. Fu.

480
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,850
Mr. Fu.

481
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,740
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

482
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,530
All thanks to you,

483
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,700
we all survived.

484
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,290
Yes.

485
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:33,940
Mr. Fu.

486
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,570
You gave us a second chance at life.

487
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,370
It's only right for me to do so.

488
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,810
You should thank

489
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,050
Yinyi Village's chief

490
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,980
and villagers.

491
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,940
We couldn't have done it without them.

492
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,610
Thank you.

493
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,290
Thank you, Chief.

494
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,770
No, sorry for not taking better care.

495
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,260
Thank you.

496
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,330
Look, they love you very much now.

497
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,460
And they love Fu Chengjin,

498
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,330
not Prince Jin.

499
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,370
Don't mention it.

500
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

501
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,155
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

502
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,850
Everyone, silence.

503
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,330
I heard Mr. Fu and Ms. Qiao

504
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,570
and Mr. Ji and Ms. Aliya

505
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,260
will soon marry

506
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,844
in Yinyi Village.

507
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,022
Congratulations, Mr. Fu.

508
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,260
Good.

509
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,050
Thank you.

510
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,130
Everyone, please enjoy the drinks

511
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,420
on the wedding day.

512
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,850
Please enjoy.

513
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,050
- Sure.
- Sure.

514
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,570
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

515
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,844
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

516
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,220
Bow to each other.

517
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,850
Off to the bridal chamber!

518
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,660
Good job.

519
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Just do this on the wedding day.

520
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,130
Come here.

521
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,370
Don't just stand there.

522
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,555
You two should rehearse too.

523
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,090
Come on.

524
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,570
Here.

525
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,420
Hold this.

526
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,577
Here, cross the saddle.

527
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,370
It represents peace and longevity.

528
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,020
Hurry up.

529
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,260
Hurry. Don't just smile like a fool.

530
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,500
Say something.

531
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,900
All right.

532
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,133
Bow to heaven and earth.

533
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,888
Bow to your elders.

534
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,754
♪Looking down at eyes
that gaze into the distance♪

535
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,570
Bow to each other.

536
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:41,991
♪Time keeps moving on♪

537
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,431
♪Whose footprints are left behind?♪

538

Off to the bridal chamber!

539
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,610
Hold the wedding night here!

540
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,330
Jiufeng, what are you talking about?

541
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,977
What do you mean by that?

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,266
Hold the wedding night here?
How can we stand here?

543
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,050
Let's leave.

544
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,460
Go.

545
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,888
Go.

546
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,500
Today's scene

547
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,333
has been repeated many times in my mind.

548
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,180
The steps we need to take...

549
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,133
How we decorate the venue...

550
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,020
I want to give you

551
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,800
a perfect wedding.

552
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,220
Looks like

553
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,888
it's about to come true.

554
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,940
I, Qiao Manman,

555
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,500
must have accumulated
three lifetimes of fate

556
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,622
to meet you in this life.

557
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,570
It is me, Fu Chengjin,

558
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,800
who accumulated three lifetimes of fate

559
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,050
just to meet you in this life.

560
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,530
​​Your Highness,
news from the disaster area.

561
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,909
Military suppression
made the disaster victims riot.

562
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,133
Prince Jin asked Jiufeng
to send a disaster relief plan.

563
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,460
Some areas have calmed down.

564
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,500
Fu Chengjin...

565
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,420
He sent a disaster relief plan?

566
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,020
I've set him free,

567
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,044
but he's still restless.

568
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:58,244
Everyone in the palace said

569
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,888
Prince Jin was wise and intelligent.

570
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:01,111
He's the chosen one.

571
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,180
Now,

572
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,810
the ministers' favor

573
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,222
are leaning toward Prince Jin.

574
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:13,900
(To Prince Yunnuo)

575
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:28,940
Guihu.

576
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,530
How dare you hide from me

577
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,088
the fact that Qiao Manman is alive?

578
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:41,088
You should prioritize the bigger picture

579
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,711
and make a decision as soon as possible.

580
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,755
All right.

581
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,370
Make a decision.

582
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,660
All right.

583
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,700
Lead your men to Yinyi Village

584
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,810
and kill everyone

585
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,222
except Qiao Manman.

586
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,610
Also,

587
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,333
make sure

588
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,288
to bring Qiao Manman back alive.

589
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,044
Yes.

590
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,177
Qiao Manman isn't dead.

591
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,740
She isn't dead.

592
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,022
She's still alive.

593
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,155
She's still alive.

594
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,133
We'll storm right in later.

595
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,700
Ji Mo, block the door.

596
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,420
I'll distract them.

597
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,740
What are you doing here?

598
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,810
Last night,

599
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,940
I found Aliya

600
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,530
sneaking out of the village.

601
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,810
Last night,

602
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:40,419
I found that Manman took a lot of money

603
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,444
and sneaked into the house.

604
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,700
Last night,

605
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,044
I found two people

606
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,220
doing something

607
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,180
behind our backs.

608
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,050
Aren't you curious about what they did?

609
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,700
They're keeping something from us.

610
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,900
- Yes.
- That's right.

611
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,220
Yes.

612
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,500
Let's go in

613
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,555
and expose their conspiracy.

614
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,711
- Let's go.
- Okay.

615
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:03,644
Let's go.

616
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,533
Did you bring it?

617
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,460
Don't worry.

618
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,555
My stuff is definitely good.

619
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,740
I've brought everything you want.

620
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:28,090
What about mine?

621
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Don't worry. I always run my business

622
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,290
with integrity.

623
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,400
Don't move.

624
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:45,660
Hands on your head. Sit tight.

625
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,330
Hand over the illicit goods!

626
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,850
Hand over the illicit goods.

627
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,460
No.

628
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,370
Hand it over.

629
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,290
No.

630
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,570
Don't take it.

631
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,777
Give me back my things.

632
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:58,980
You...

633
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,940
Jiufeng, take it.

634
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,090
Give me.

635
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,020
- Here.
- Give me.

636
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,570
Take it.

637
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,044
Give me. Give it back.

638
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:04,660
Give it back!

639
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,130
Here.

640
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,570
Over here.

641
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,533
Give it back!

642
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,711
What's going on?

643
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,644
What are you doing?

644
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,810
You tore the red veil.

645
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,940
Manman, isn't it just a veil?

646
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,160
Was all this necessary?

647
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,660
What do you know?

648
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,460
This is the auspicious veil

649
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,644
I worked very hard to find.

650
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,933
It's called Together Forever.

651
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,460
You've tore it apart.

652
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,900
How unlucky.

653
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,900
It's torn apart. Just sew it up...

654
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,940
Easy for you to say.

655
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,977
It's sewn with gold and silver thread.

656
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,377
It also has double-sided embroidery.

657
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:48,155
The front side
shows love between a man and a woman.

658
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:49,911
The back side
shows respect for each other.

659
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,610
Who else in our village

660
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,460
has such exquisite craftsmanship?

661
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,155
You found something so good for them.

662
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:00,022
What about ours?

663
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,180
Ours is called Eternal Love.

664
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,020
It's here.

665
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:03,980
Don't worry.

666
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,850
That's good.

667
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,370
Ji Mo.

668
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,530
What do we do? What a pity.

669
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,810
The veil is torn.

670
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,090
- Yes.
- What do we do?

671
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,570
What do we do?

672
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,610
Get off.

673
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,260
You three, get out.

674
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,850
Ji Mo too. Hurry up!

675
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,420
Manman.

676
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,500
Get out.

677
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:23,700
All of you, get out.

678
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,220
Manman...

679
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,850
What should I do? My Together Forever...

680
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,740
How about you

681
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,740
let me try?

682
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,610
Yuetao, can you fix it?

683
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,220
I didn't master acupuncture

684
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:51,488
when learning it from Aliya,

685
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,980
but I did learn how to sew.

686
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,740
This...

687
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,511
This is a bit difficult,

688
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,260
but I'll try my best.

689
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,511
I'll give it a try.

690
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,466
But the wedding
is the day after tomorrow.

691
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,090
It's all right. Don't worry.

692
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,711
Leave it to me.

693
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,660
You two just need to marry off

694
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,220
looking glorious and gorgeous.

695
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,610
Yuetao, you're so nice.

696
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,530
If you want to thank me,

697
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,111
just prepare more dowry for me

698
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:31,911
when I get married.

699
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,460
Yuetao, you have no shame.

700
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:42,333
One servant with two masters.

701
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,755
You haven't even married Jiufeng,

702
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,500
yet you're already
helping him save money.

703
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,330
Any opinions?

704
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,244
It's me.

705
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,770
You scared me.

706
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,530
Instead of sleeping,

707
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,530
why are you here?

708
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,088
Don't you have something to do tomorrow?

709
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,777
I'm here to keep you company.

710
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:26,900
Yuetao.

711
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,177
You look really pretty today.

712
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,290
I know.

713
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:33,850
I look good every day.

714
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,850
I mean

715
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,020
you look especially good today.

716
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,460
Yuetao.

717
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,570
After the other two couples' weddings,

718
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,570
should we

719
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,733
hurry up too?

720
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,260
What for?

721
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,810
Just hurry up.

722
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,940
Hurry up.

723
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,050
Don't burn it.

724
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,500
It took me a lot of effort to sew it.

725
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,610
What do I do if you burn it?

726
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,911
I asked you
to keep the candle away from me.

727
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,622
Why are you sitting so far from me?

728
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:25,866
Do you think I'll bite?

729
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,570
Come closer.

730
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,290
Come closer.

731
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,330
Don't look at me.

732
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,850
I'll look.

733
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,155
Look carefully then.

734
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,555
I have to hurry and sew the veil.

735
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,000
Or they don't get to use it later.

736
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:29,279
It doesn't matter
if they don't get to use it.

737
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,755
All that matters is we have one.

738
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,690
We have one?

739
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,180
Are you going to sew it?

740
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,088
I'll do it.

741
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,955
It'll definitely be ugly.

742
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,650
I won't use it.

743
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,900
I will sew it beautifully.

744
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,444
It will be beautiful.

745
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,266
I'll make a huge veil.

746

Forget it.

747
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,133
Mr. Qiao, morning.

748
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,733
Your Highness.

749
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,650
Manman is still asleep.

750
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,222
Let her sleep a little longer.

751
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,380
Mr. Qiao.

752
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,340
Prince Jin no longer exists.

753
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,288
I'm just Fu Chengjin.

754
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,911
Forget it.

755
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,066
You and Manman are getting married soon.

756
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,422
I have some words of advice.

757
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,755
Mr. Qiao, go ahead.
