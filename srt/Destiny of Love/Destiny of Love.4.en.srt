=Episode 4=

27
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:44,710
(Benevolent and Kind)

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,550
That is how it all happened.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,270
Who would've thought Prince Yunnuo
would run right into me

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,340
in the garden?

31
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,700
You didn't blow your cover, did you?

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
I don't think so.

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,940
Prince Yunnuo seemed
like an upright character.

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,550
I doubt he'd overthink it.

35
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,780
Right.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,910
Only you could come up with something

37
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,479
as shady as crawling through a dog hole.

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,110
If we could just walk out
the front gate,

39
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,444
who would choose the dog hole?

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,990
Right.

41
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,350
Did you find that dog hole?

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,020
Of course.

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,830
Where is it?

44
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,888
Even if I told you, you wouldn't know.

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,230
Don't worry.

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,550
It is well-hidden and completely safe.

47
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,933
We will leave through it tomorrow.

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,180
Tomorrow?

49
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,550
Don't waste time.

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,822
We're leaving now! Come on!

51
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,670
Let's go.

52
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,110
Come in.

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,620
I'm taking you
to meet an important guest.

54
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,350
I understand
you're not fond of dressing up,

55
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,422
but for the sake
of our residence's reputation,

56
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:05,900
I need you to make an effort.

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,270
I will personally do your makeup today.

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,860
What?

59
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,790
You are doing my makeup?

60
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:14,860
You know how to do makeup?

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,860
What is so hard about it?

62
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,180
(Did he find out something about me?)

63
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,110
Perfect.

64
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,510
Dress her.

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,977
Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,740
Yunnuo, sorry to keep you waiting.

67
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,710
Greetings, Brother.

68
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,350
No need to be so formal.

69
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,350
To welcome you,

70
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,777
I specifically asked
your sister-in-law to get dressed up.

71
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,820
You are too kind.

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,710
Yunnuo, please have a seat.

73
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,790
Thank you.

74
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,820
Aliya, you sit too.

75
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,470
Is that really all right?

76
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,500
We are all family here.

77
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,860
No need to be so stiff.

78
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,860
Please, sit.

79
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,990
Aliya,

80
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,860
he is my second brother.

81
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,590
Fu Yunnuo,
Second Prince of Luzhao Kingdom.

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,110
Say something.

83
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,860
Prince Yunnuo.

84
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,380
There is no need to be so reserved.

85
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:28,155
Didn't we just see each other earlier?

86
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,060
It seems like we did.

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,940
Your makeup today
is something else indeed.

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,550
What a surprise.

89
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,670
Thank you.

90
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,030
All the better.

91
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,820
Since you have already met,

92
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,940
let's get straight to the point.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,060
The most important thing

94
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,230
for a family is to really

95
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,620
understand one another.

96
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,670
So, let me properly

97
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,940
introduce you both.

98
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Aliya, Princess of the Xilin Kingdom.

99
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,740
16 years old, and 1.6 cm.

100
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,350
She weighs almost 50 kg.

101
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,500
50 kg?

102
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,500
You lying...

103
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,350
Speak truthfully.

104
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,710
Did I underreport your weight?

105
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Yunnuo,
Second Prince of the Luzhao Kingdom.

106
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,710
Handsome and refined,

107
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,670
with a gentle personality

108
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,620
and well-versed
in literature and history.

109
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,380
You flatter me.

110
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,790
I'm certainly not as learned as you.

111
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,620
Even Father has praised

112
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,710
your poetry.

113
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,620
I have looked into it.

114
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,820
The Grand Tutor
at the Academy of Literary Studies

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,180
says your writing is exceptional.

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,620
You even achieved a level of talent
exceeding that of Zi Jian.

117
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,060
He is immensely talented.

118
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,710
(What is he up to?)

119
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,990
(What does he mean by all this?)

120
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,350
(Yunnuo must be her ideal husband.)

121
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,300
(Don't be too grateful now.)

122
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,180
(These two are laying it on
way too thick.)

123
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,910
I do not know much about literature,

124
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,420
so I will leave you two

125
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,030
to your chat.

126
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,500
Please carry on.

127
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,620
I will take my leave.

128
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,380
Aliya!

129
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,940
Yuetao, pack up! We're leaving!

130
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,940
He has an unusual sense of makeup.

131
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,620
Yunnuo,

132
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,670
I have something very important
to entrust to you.

133
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,380
What exactly is this important matter?

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,790
A lifelong matter.

135
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,470
Brother, you mean a lifelong matter?

136
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,260
Yes.

137
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,910
(Since you two did not see
each other's strengths just now,)

138
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,150
(I will give you another chance
to connect.)

139
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,030
Much better.

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,350
Is everything packed?

141
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,710
All done.

142
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,740
Come on! Let's go!

143
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,180
Your Highness, what now?

144
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,860
I am taking you
to a gathering of royal heirs.

145
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,780
A gathering?

146
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,900
Isn't it just you
and your younger brother?

147
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,590
I am not good at socializing.

148
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,380
I'd rather not embarrass you.

149
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,990
We are married.

150
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:45,070
Going together is not embarrassing.
It is expected.

151
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,350
Besides, this gathering only happens

152
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,830
once a month.

153
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
Aliya, let's get going.

154
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,740
Brother.

155
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,860
Princess Consort Jin.

156
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,488
We've been waiting for you, Yunnuo.

157
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,990
Our very first Luzhao
royal heir gathering

158
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,950
shall begin now.

159
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,860
The first?

160
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,950
Yes, it is the first,

161
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
but from now on,

162
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,190
we will hold one

163
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,430
every month

164
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,190
to strengthen our bonds.

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,733
Yunnuo, what do you think?

166
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,540
(Say no! Turn him down!)

167
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,470
If you think it is a good idea,

168
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
then I suppose
I have no choice but to agree.

169
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,020
Good.

170
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,900
I will host

171
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,540
today's gathering.

172
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,590
We are graced with excellent weather.

173
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,310
Let's fly kites.

174
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,860
Fly kites?

175
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,950
Your Highness, I do not know how.

176
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,830
I will head back. You all have fun.

177
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,990
Hold on.

178
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,088
Yunnuo knows how to fly them.

179
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,780
Yunnuo, my legs are not in great shape.

180
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,380
I will leave it to you to teach
Princess Consort how to fly a kite.

181
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,260
(He wants me to fly a kite with her?)

182
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,230
(What exactly is he trying to do?)

183
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,830
I feel chilly all of a sudden.

184
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,500
Jiufeng,

185
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,900
take me to the carriage
so I can put on an extra layer.

186
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,711
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,900
(Flying a kite?)

188
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,470
(As if I am in the mood for that!)

189
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,350
(That guy gives me nothing but trouble!)

190
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,260
Brother is usually swamped
with state affairs.

191
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,660
If he is taking the time
to host a gathering today,

192
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,470
it must be for your sake.

193
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,190
Your bond with Brother seems strong.

194
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,350
Well, we're married,
so we just live life together.

195
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,310
You are being modest.

196
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,740
Father has high regards for Brother

197
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,950
and he usually has a mountain of duties.

198
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,260
It is rare for him to relax.

199
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,260
I doubt he's that busy.

200
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,830
From what I see, he just eats, drinks,

201
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,660
and sleeps around the residence.

202
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,780
Let's just get to kite-flying.

203
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,822
All right.

204
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,140
Here, you hold the kite.

205
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,222
I will get it up in the air in a moment.

206
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,780
The kite's frame is broken.

207
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,110
Perfect.

208
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,660
You spotted the problem instantly

209
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,260
and fixed it so skillfully.

210
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,780
I imagine your medical skills
must be just as precise.

211
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,740
Surely Brother's chronic leg condition

212
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,780
would be easy for you to treat.

213
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,190
Well, we will see.

214
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,740
Depends on how serious it is.

215
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,380
By the way,

216
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,950
how did he get this injury?

217
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,470
It's said Brother was caught in a fire
when he was a child.

218
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,222
After that, he
was unable to use his legs.

219
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,990
Father searched the entire kingdom
for the best physicians,

220
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,644
but none could cure it.

221
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,740
Hurry!

222
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,350
There's a fire!

223
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,020
Move!

224
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,830
Quickly!

225
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,310
(No wonder...)

226
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,260
All right. Let's fly the kite.

227
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,740
Sure.

228
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,710
(They make a fine pair.)

229
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,540
(Once I leave the palace,
I can rest assured.)

230
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,470
You have to fly the kite
against the wind for it

231
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,620
to soar higher.

232
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,260
Your Highness,

233
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,540
Prince Yunnuo and Her Highness
seem to be getting along well.

234
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,350
(If Yunnuo inherits the throne one day,)

235
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,260
(then Luzhao and Xilin can co-exist)

236
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,990
(in peace and harmony for generations.)

237
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,590
Want to give it a try?

238
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,500
All right.

239
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,430
When will you start
treating Brother's condition?

240
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,020
I'll do it.

241
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,830
Well...

242
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,666
His Highness's injury
has lasted so long.

243
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,780
To treat it properly,
I need to identify the root cause first.

244
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,380
(She is being tight-lipped
about his treatment.)

245
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,350
(She is guarding something from me.)

246
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,230
(This guy never stops talking.)

247
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,860
(If he keeps asking,)

248
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,777
(I might not be able
to deflect anymore.)

249
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,780
Prince Yunnuo!

250
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,990
Oh no, the kite string snapped!

251
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,190
Looks like we can't fly it anymore.

252
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,260
Prince Yunnuo, I'll take my leave then.

253
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,990
(What was Brother's real purpose)

254
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:11,000
(for throwing
this last-minute gathering?)

255
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,111
Aliya, why did you stop flying the kite?

256
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,590
The string broke.

257
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:18,000
There is nothing to fly anymore.

258
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,990
Let's return.

259
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,710
No way.

260
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,590
Our royal heirs' gathering includes

261
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,733
more than just one activity.

262
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:25,511
You have to stay for the whole thing.

263
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,740
What else?

264
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,540
Archery.

265
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,780
Archery?

266
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,780
Nice shot!

267
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,780
Yunnuo never misses.

268
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,977
As expected of Luzhao's best archer.

269
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,740
Aliya, what do you think?

270
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,860
Prince Yunnuo's accuracy is amazing.

271
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,422
It is like watching Hou Yi himself.

272
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,230
That's too high praise.

273
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,380
Not at all.

274
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,380
Yunnuo is not only accurate,

275
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,666
but he is also fast and powerful too.

276
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:08,990
His arrows can pierce
through the toughest targets.

277
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,310
Don't you want to see him do it?

278
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:10,990
I really don't...

279
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,190
Oh, don't be shy now.

280
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,900
Yunnuo, show her a trick shot.

281
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,111
(That cloud pattern...)

282
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,140
Marvelous!

283
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:51,950
Your Highness, are you okay?

284
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,600
Are you hurt?

285
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,355
I got such a huge tear!
How can I be all right?

286
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,780
Why are you holding a gathering out here

287
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,500
in the middle of nowhere?

288
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,780
Even the jade pendant got ruined.

289
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
What a shame.

290
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,430
(Could the cloud pattern
be connected to Prince Yunnuo?)

291
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,290
(Prince Jin's Residence)

292
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,310
What? You are not running away anymore?

293
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,830
Not anymore.

294
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:35,444
My mother left me an important
Golden Box before she passed away,

295
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,540
and Prince Yunnuo's jade pendant

296
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,350
has the exact same cloud design as it.

297
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,950
I finally found a clue.

298
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,900
I can't leave now.

299
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,540
But...

300
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,900
Your Highness.

301
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:53,777
Come here.

302
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,140
You are hurt.
Why have you not treated it yet?

303
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,430
Sit.

304
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,950
Jiufeng.

305
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,300
You got injured saving me.

306
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,190
I will make sure to repay that debt.

307
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,500
Your Highness,

308
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,190
I married you.

309
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,555
Of course,
your safety is what I care about most.

310
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,710
Aliya...

311
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,990
Your Highness, I'm fine.

312
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,910
But could you agree

313
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,820
to one small request?

314
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,020
Say it.

315
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,111
Your Highness,

316
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,340
would you allow me to come and go freely

317
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,340
from this residence from now on?

318
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:09,740
Okay.

319
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,260
(Finally!)

320
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:16,470
(I can return
to Everything Guild again!)

321
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,540
(Everything Guild)

322
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,540
Ji Mo!

323
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,340
Mr. Ji!

324
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,990
Strange. Where's everyone?

325
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,390
I've missed this place.

326
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,260
There's no place like home.

327
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,950
Even the air is nice and homey here.

328
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,190
With all this,

329
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,190
Everything Guild could run three years
without taking an order.

330
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,710
Oh, right.

331
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,740
Mother,

332
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,340
I finally found a lead
on the Golden Box you left me.

333
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,710
I found the same cloud pattern

334
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
that's on the box.

335
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,740
Rest assured.

336
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,340
I will follow the clues,

337
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,580
open the box,

338
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,300
and find Father.

339
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,755
It has been so long
since I was last here.

340
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,580
Look at all this dust.

341
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,540
Thank you.

342
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,780
Who are you?

343
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,780
(Aliya?)

344
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,580
(I thought
she had already escaped the capital!)

345
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,990
Thief! How dare you sneak in here!

346
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,990
No...

347
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,230
I'm not a thief!

348
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,511
- Stop right there, you thief!
- Don't you remember me?

349
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,780
- I'm Ms. Qiao! Qiao Manman!
- Stop!

350
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,955
- Quit running!
- Stop this!

351
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,190
Why are you making such a racket

352
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,740
in the middle of the night, Fang?

353
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,540
There's a thief!

354
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,190
Manman.

355
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,580
Mr. Ji.

356
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:37,155
Where on earth have you been
the past couple of days?

357
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,870
You had me worried sick!

358
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,740
Manman...

359
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,870
Mr. Ji...

360
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,390
Where have you been, Manman?

361
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,644
Let me have a look at you.

362
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,190
Look at me.

363
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,060
You've lost weight.

364
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,470
I've lost weight, Mr. Ji.

365
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,390
I've lost so much weight.

366
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,600
- Manman...
- You have no idea how tired I've been.

367
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,580
I told Ji Mo to go find you,

368
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,688
but he just refused...

369
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,710
I didn't let his ears
have a moment of peace.

370
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Why shouldn't he go look for you, right?

371
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,060
You never came back,

372
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,230
so I kept worrying
something bad had happened.

373
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,710
Ji Mo found Aliya by the river.

374
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,990
Looks like she hit her head

375
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,950
and lost her memory.

376
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,780
To avoid drawing attention,

377
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,910
I kept her here.

378
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,950
Manman!

379
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,950
It was the safest option.

380
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,470
Manman!

381
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,540
Where have you been all this time?

382
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,866
You had me worried sick!

383
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,780
Mo,

384
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,190
I've missed you so much...

385
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,222
Keep your distance.

386
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:34,580
Stay there and explain yourself.

387
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,100
Fine.
I'll tell you everything from the start.

388
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,910
(Everything Guild)

389
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,990
So you accidentally ended up
marrying into Prince Jin's Residence?

390
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,910
And you escaped this time?

391
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,260
Of course.

392
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,430
Manman managed to get out

393
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,230
and even brought back all that treasure.

394
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:53,300
Why don't we just run off

395
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,470
for good?

396
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,740
No, we can't.

397
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,977
Do you remember the Golden Box
my mother left me?

398
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,950
Of course.

399
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,500
You could never figure out

400
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,580
how to open it, right?

401
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,430
That was before.

402
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,340
I saw the exact same cloud pattern

403
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,670
on Prince Jin's
younger brother's jade pendant.

404
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,740
It's a clue.

405
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,470
I think I'm close to opening the box

406
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,755
and finding my father.

407
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,190
I know finding your father

408
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,670
has been your life's mission,

409
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,870
but your identity could be exposed
at any moment.

410
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,990
You could lose

411
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,580
your life too.

412
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,060
Don't worry.

413
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,100
I'll take care of myself.

414
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,780
Manman,

415
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,600
you've been through so much.

416
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,740
Father,

417
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,950
give her a pat for me too.

418
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,150
Manman, you've been through a lot.

419
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,340
Mo, you are being so dramatic.

420
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,955
What would you do

421
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,950
if a princess

422
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,060
insisted on sticking by your side, huh?

423
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,400
Think about how you're going
to get out of Prince Jin's Residence!

424
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
Why the sigh?

425
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,844
Prince Jin has a leg condition
that limits his mobility.

426
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,390
One of the purposes

427
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,577
of this arranged marriage

428
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,670
is to heal his leg.

429
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,300
In that case, treat it.

430
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,540
Oh, right. You don't know medicine.

431
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,555
Just act like
you know what you're doing.

432
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,710
Grab his leg,

433
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,540
pretend to massage it
with a serious face,

434
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,020
and then prescribe some tonics.

435
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,060
As long as you don't kill him,
what is the harm?

436
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,910
Mr. Ji,

437
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,340
when you put it like that,

438
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,950
it does make sense.

439
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:53,030
(Benevolent and Kind)

440
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,670
Really?
Princess Aliya is safe and sound?

441
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,100
She's at Everything Guild right now.

442
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,500
The sooner we leave,

443
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,340
the sooner you can see your princess.

444
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,827
(I can't let Yuetao find out
Aliya lost her memory.)

445
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,390
(She would lose it.)

446
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,670
All right. As long as I get
to see Her Highness soon,

447
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,990
I will do whatever you say.

448
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,340
Deal.

449
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,230
Your Highness,
someone is here to see you.

450
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,422
I'm not seeing any guests.

451
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,133
Understood. I will relay your message
to Princess Consort Jin.

452
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:43,710
Wait.

453
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,060
Did you just say Princess Consort Jin?

454
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,060
Yes, it's her.

455
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,580
Let her in.

456
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,622
Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,230
Is your wound serious?

458
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,340
It's just a scrape.

459
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,290
You are the cherished daughter
of Xilin's Emperor.

460
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,590
A royal through and through,
yet you are so unpretentious.

461
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:07,950
You're quite different
from the nobles here in the capital.

462
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,990
Is that so?

463
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,260
By the way,

464
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,540
Prince Yunnuo,
I want to ask you something.

465
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,150
Go ahead.

466
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,950
Last time during archery,

467
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,710
I noticed your jade pendant

468
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,260
had a unique pattern.

469
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,190
I was wondering
which painter designed it.

470
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,300
It was not designed by a painter.

471
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,670
My mother created it.

472
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,710
The Noble Consort?

473
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,780
Correct.

474
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,150
Why are you interested in that pattern?

475
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,910
I just thought

476
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,630
it looked special.

477
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,822
I was curious, that's all.

478
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,780
(Could the Golden Box my mother left me)

479
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,200
(be connected to Noble Consort?)

480
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:49,800
(Hanyuan Hall)

481
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:20,200
Your Highness, Princess Consort Jin
went to visit Prince Yunnuo.

482
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:23,000
Are you certain?

483
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,990
Absolutely.

484
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,100
I see.

485
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,670
Continue to keep a close eye on her.

486
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,020
You're dismissed.

487
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,020
Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,500
Your Highness,

489
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,100
is something wrong?

490
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,990
That Princess from Xilin,

491
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
Prince Jin's new consort,

492
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,580
turns out to be far more scheming
than I expected.

493
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,622
What do you mean, Your Highness?

494
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:48,577
I don't understand.

495
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,150
She keeps getting close to Yunnuo.

496
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,260
She must be up to something.

497
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,910
Your Highness,
are you overthinking it?

498
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,780
Why would a foreign princess want

499
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,870
to harm Prince Yunnuo?

500
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,670
Don't forget.

501
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,430
She is not only a foreign princess,

502
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,580
but she's also Prince Jin's new consort.

503
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,990
She is clearly spying on Yunnuo
for Fu Chengjin.

504
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,260
I already have a plan to deal with her.

505
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,100
Go.

506
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,580
Bring Princess Consort Jin
into the palace.

507
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,950
I want to meet her myself.

508
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,820
What are you sighing for?

509
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,430
Do as I say!

510
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,020
Yes, Your Highness.

511
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,730
(Prince Jin's Residence)

512
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:42,844
Greetings, Prince Jin.

513
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,230
Princess Consort Jin.

514
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:47,290
The Noble Consort has summoned
Princess Consort Jin to the palace.

515
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,870
The Noble Consort wants to see me?

516
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,670
Yes.

517
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,100
Tell them I'll be right there

518
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,060
after I freshen up!

519
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:56,630
Yes, Your Highness.

520
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,190
Perfect.

521
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:04,444
(I was just looking for a chance
to meet her.)

522
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,190
I had better get ready quickly.

523
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,020
Can't keep the Noble Consort waiting.

524
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,060
Your Highness.

525
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,355
Why would Noble Consort

526
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,244
suddenly summon Her Highness?

527
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:19,290
It's clearly not for something trivial.

528
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,990
Something must be going on.

529
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,430
I should go see for myself.

530
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,340
Jiufeng.

531
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,060
Why is she not here yet?

532
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,470
Right...

533
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,670
Princess Consort Jin has arrived.

534
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,020
You're here, Princess Consort Jin.

535
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

536
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,780
Your Highness,

537
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,710
you truly are as stunning as they say.

538
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,580
Your beauty is enough
to put flowers to shame.

539
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,020
Not only do you have

540
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,870
a silver tongue,

541
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:58,470
your sense of style is just as sharp.

542
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,020
Your Highness,

543
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,630
you are not just beautiful.

544
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,910
You also have exquisite taste.

545
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,060
I heard from Prince Yunnuo

546
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,910
that you created
a unique cloud pattern yourself.

547
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,780
You are truly amazing!

548
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,950
Might I be fortunate enough
to learn from you someday?

549
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,820
You are exaggerating.
It is nothing special.

550
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,150
Very well. As you wish.

551
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,150
Enough flattery.

552
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,190
Lately, I have been suffering
from terrible headaches.

553
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,990
I heard you're a divine physician
from Xilin.

554
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,580
Maybe you could take a look at me?

555
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,910
(She's so unpredictable.
What is she trying to do?)

556
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,190
Are you unwilling?

557
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,870
Yes.

558
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,150
Not at all.

559
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,430
Then, attend to my illness.

560
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,580
Well...

561
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,150
Your Highness,

562
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,044
I came in such a rush today.

563
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,580
I did not bring any of my tools.

564
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,540
It's fine.

565
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,390
I have prepared everything for you.

566
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,710
Bring them in.

567
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,580
Princess Consort Jin,

568
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:28,230
will you start with acupuncture

569
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,670
or with the pulse?

570
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,150
Prince Jin has arrived.

571
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,540
You never come here.

572
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,710
This is a rare occasion.

573
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,870
Aliya just arrived in Luzhao.

574
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,260
I was afraid she might not know
our customs and unintentionally

575
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,644
offend you, so I came along.

576
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,822
If you and Aliya have
no important matters to discuss,

577
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,710
then allow us to take our leave

578
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,990
and return another day
to pay proper respects.

579
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,190
Oh, this headache of mine
has returned again.

580
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,150
A good physician has compassion.

581
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,710
But she seems heartless enough

582
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,710
to let me suffer in pain.

583
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,740
Your Highness, perhaps we should summon

584
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,688
the imperial physician to treat you.

585
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,820
No physician can compare to her.

586
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,470
I am in agony right now,

587
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,630
and Prince Jin, you keep making excuses.

588
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,230
Are you perhaps
holding a grudge against me?

589
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,870
I only worry
that Xilin's medical practices

590
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:47,933
may differ from ours,

591
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,630
and your health could suffer.

592
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,260
It might be safer to leave it
to our own physician.

593
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,580
The imperial physician
has already tried.

594
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,710
This headache is an old condition.

595
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,190
They said it cannot be cured.

596
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,390
Right now, my only hope lies

597
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,100
with Princess Consort Jin.

598
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,950
Your Highness.

599
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,910
Even if I treat you, it would be my
first time diagnosing the issue.

600
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,710
I know nothing of your medical history.

601
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,820
I worry that it might make things worse.

602
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,580
You keep making excuses.

603
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,577
Could it be that you do not actually

604
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,950
know medicine at all?

605
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,950
(Did she figure something out?)

606
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,422
(I have to fake my way through this.)

607
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,100
Your Highness,

608
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,990
of course, I will treat you.

609
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:45,022
Allow me to take your pulse.

610
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,266
Much obliged.

611
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:55,333
(She just wants
to give you a hard time.)

612
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:57,330
(You can't cure her)

613
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,333
(even if you're the best physician
in the world.)

614
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:14,355
Your Highness's illness

615
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:19,822
is neither serious nor trivial.

616
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,422
What is your remedy, then?

617
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:29,600
As the saying goes,

618
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,488
when there is no flow, there is pain.

619
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:36,169
Most headaches are caused
by blocked meridians

620
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,844
and stagnant qi and blood.

621
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,555
Let me give you a massage
to provide some relief.

622
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:48,288
Proceed.

623
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:03,733
Your Highness.

624
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:06,479
Right now, I'm massaging

625
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,755
the Baihui Point for you.

626
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,169
If your headache flares up again,

627
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,422
have the maid
to massage it for you.

628
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:15,266
(The Baihui Point?)

629
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,466
Does it feel better?

630
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:22,777
Your technique is quite good.

631
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,949
Oh, but my head

632
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,755
still hurts very much.

633
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,133
Your Highness.

634
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,511
Today, we'll start with massage therapy.

635
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:43,149
When I return tonight,

636
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,619
I'll write a few prescriptions for you

637
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,929
to take morning and night.

638
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,466
You should recover in no time.

639
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,529
Since you are taking charge yourself,

640
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,000
then I suppose
it will be effective in three days.

641
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:55,777
Otherwise,

642
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,622
I will charge you with contempt.
