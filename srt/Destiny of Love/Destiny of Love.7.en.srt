=Episode 7=

27
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,020
Greetings, Mr. Ji.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,460
Hello, students.

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,420
Please have a seat.

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,260
Why are you here?

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,220
What are you doing...

32
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,270
Just start the lesson!

33
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,980
Did Mr. Ji assign homework yesterday?

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,110
He did.

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,190
Then, what are you waiting for?

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,020
Come on.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,260
Here you go.

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,870
Keep 0.6 meter apart.

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,980
Very good.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Return to your seats.

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,980
Dear, what are we learning today?

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,080
We're covering the "Airs of the States"
from the "Book of Songs".

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,780
Has everyone memorized it?

44
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,880
"The ospreys call on islets fair."

45
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,860
"A gentle maiden dwells there.
A fine match for the gentleman..."

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,630
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

47
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,420
I came to help keep things in order.

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,580
"Water plants grow wild and free,
drifting left and right."

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,090
"Graceful and fair the lady..."

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,420
Yuanxiang, what's wrong?

51
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,370
- Mr. Ji!
- She fainted!

52
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,840
Your wife hit a pressure point.

53
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,940
Come take a look!

54
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:07,710
- Yuanxiang.
- Pressure point?

55
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,780
Are you all right?

56
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,190
She passed out?

57
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,820
Well, I do know a bit about acupuncture.

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,590
Why don't I try treating her?

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,430
I'm all right now.

60
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,050
Just skipped breakfast

61
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,310
and got a bit dizzy, that's all.

62
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,310
No need to trouble yourself.

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,580
Dear, you keep teaching.

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,590
I'll head home first.

65
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,750
Goodbye, students.

66
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,310
I'll get him next time.

67
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,590
Let's continue with class.

68
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,350
(Liuyun Mansion)

69
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,310
Your Highness.

70
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,711
Noble Consort brought a female physician
from Imperial Hospital

71
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,680
to see His Majesty.

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,177
His Majesty seemed very pleased
after meeting her.

73
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,930
What's this physician's background?

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,100
From what I hear,

75
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,870
her name is Bilian.

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,820
Her skills are average,

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,910
but she's got some looks.

78
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,780
Good.

79
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,780
Prepare the carriage.

80
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,740
I'm going to the palace.

81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,620
(Hanyuan Hall)

82
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,140
Prince Jin requests an audience.

83
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,950
Jin, I found a skilled physician

84
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,460
in the palace for you.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,430
She should be able

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,870
to help with your leg.

87
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,510
Father,

88
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,380
Aliya is doing her best to treat me.

89
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,790
When it comes to medicine,

90
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,340
precision beats variety.

91
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,177
Father,
you shouldn't trouble yourself for me.

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,890
How can I not?

93
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,580
At first, I thought

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,940
marrying her

95
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,380
would be a great help to you.

96
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,700
But it has been a while now!

97
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,140
Your legs still have not improved!

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,870
Father,

99
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,310
I do feel more strength
in my limbs than before.

100
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Did Princess Consort Jin say

101
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,020
when you will be able to stand again?

102
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:31,755
That is not something to rush.

103
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,860
There is no such thing as a miracle drug

104
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,270
that works overnight.

105
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,310
Prince Jin,
His Majesty is deeply concerned for you.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,500
How can you disregard
his good intentions?

107
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,020
Summon the female physician.

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,500
Summon the female physician, Bilian.

109
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,750
Greetings, Your Majesty, Prince Jin,
Prince Yunnuo, and Noble Consort.

110
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,980
Rise.

111
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,140
(The beauty trap, a classic strategy.)

112
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,460
(Once she enters Prince Jin's Residence)

113
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,822
(under the pretense of treatment,)

114
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:19,510
(everything will be under my control.)

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,710
Wait!

116
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,710
Father,

117
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,977
Aliya has already prepared
herbal medicine for me.

118
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,540
Acupuncture may not be necessary.

119
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,750
Your Highness, you might not know this.

120
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,670
Acupuncture treats from the outside

121
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,990
for internal issues.

122
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:42,910
It won't conflict with the medicine
Princess Consort Jin is giving you.

123
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:44,022
May I try?

124
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,630
Bilian is one of the best

125
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,990
when it comes to acupuncture.

126
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,340
You have nothing to worry.

127
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,110
It can't hurt to try.

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,220
He moved!

129
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,577
Did you see that, Your Majesty?

130
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,500
How do you feel, Jin?

131
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,230
I barely felt anything.

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,140
Father, maybe your eyes
are playing tricks on you.

133
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,380
Your Majesty, look! He moved again!

134
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,670
It is working!

135
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,340
Acupuncture is amazing.

136
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,230
I saw it with my own eyes this time.

137
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,950
Bilian,
if you can cure Prince Jin's leg,

138
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,430
I will grant you

139
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,580
whatever you wish.

140
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:39,640
Why not let Bilian move
into Prince Jin's Residence?

141
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,550
She can care for him day and night,

142
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,750
and treatment may be

143
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,520
even more effective.

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,444
I don't think that's appropriate.

145
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,380
Excellent idea.

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,155
Bilian, you and Princess Consort Jin...
Internal and external treatment.

147
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,100
Take good care of this matter.

148
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,580
Looks like Prince Jin's legs

149
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,940
will recover very soon.

150
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,340
(Liuyun Mansion)

151
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,870
Mother planned all of this

152
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,870
just to stop Brother from being cured.

153
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,940
Still, she is doing it for me.

154
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,020
Now that Bilian is about
to move into Brother's residence,

155
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,866
send someone to keep an eye on her,

156
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,200
discreetly.

157
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,190
Do not let anything happen
to Princess Aliya.

158
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,050
Yes, Your Highness.

159
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,310
(Little Ears, please stay safe.)

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,340
(Benevolent and Kind)

161
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,430
Bilian entering the residence

162
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,340
is clearly Noble Consort's doing.

163
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,740
She's targeting us.

164
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,540
Looks like we need to speed up

165
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,580
and carry out our escape plan.

166
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,070
We're good to go,

167
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,355
but the fake Princess Aliya's going
to be a problem.

168
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,780
Where is she?

169
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,070
- She...
- Didn't I tell you

170
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,740
to keep an eye on her?

171
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,100
Why do you always let her wander off?

172
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,620
I sent someone
to check Prince Yunnuo's residence.

173
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:09,980
She was not there.

174
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,620
No matter where she went,

175
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,860
it has been half a day already.

176
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,270
How has she still not come back?

177
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,940
Your Highness, you miss her, do you?

178
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,340
Who said I miss her?

179
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,520
I just don't want her causing trouble

180
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,180
for our residence.

181
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,210
So,

182
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,450
where is she?

183
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,910
She's here!

184
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,060
She's here!

185
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,190
Princess Consort Jin is back?

186
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,070
No.

187
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,733
The female physician, Bilian, is here
under the imperial decree.

188
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,180
(Already?)

189
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,460
Move all these things

190
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,390
into the room closest to His Highness.

191
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,580
These are all valuable medical tools,

192
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,340
so be careful with them.

193
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,950
Lift this one gently.

194
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,910
Got it?

195
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,630
You.

196
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,030
Give this meal plan to the cook.

197
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,570
(Prince Jin's Meal Plan)
Later, all of His Highness's meals

198
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:04,980
must follow this exactly.

199
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,070
Also, prepare a full schedule
of His Highness's daily routines for me.

200
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,150
Yes.

201
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,740
(What is going on?)

202
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

203
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,310
By His Majesty's command,

204
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,620
I'm here to treat His Highness's legs.

205
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,720
(Treat his legs?)

206
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,340
Your Highness is as stunning

207
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,550
as the rumors say.

208
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,530
No need to be so formal with me.

209
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,700
After all, you are helping me out.

210
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
You are performing my duties for me.

211
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,940
Thanks for your compliment.

212
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,790
I only want to do my part

213
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,030
for His Highness and for you.

214
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,580
I can see that.

215
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,100
You have certainly gone all in.

216
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,430
After that last treatment,

217
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,430
have your legs
shown any improvement, Your Highness?

218
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,940
I have been thinking about it.

219
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,510
No real change.

220
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,410
Why not have Bilian take my pulse?

221
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,630
Yes, Your Highness.

222
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,350
Wait.

223
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,100
Perhaps my consort
wants to take my pulse?

224
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,390
You already have Bilian, right?

225
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,510
I am busy.

226
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Your Highness.

227
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,660
Jiufeng.

228
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,940
Let's go.

229
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,270
Fu Chengjin brought a female physician

230
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,100
into the residence.

231
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,430
So annoying.

232
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,310
He didn't even bother to tell me.

233
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,260
He has no regard for me at all.

234
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,390
Who's next? Lvlian? Honglian?

235
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,755
How am I supposed to handle them?

236
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,860
Things are about to get difficult again.

237
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,700
What have you in such a bad mood?

238
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,500
Prince Yunnuo, what are you doing here?

239
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,340
I found some more cloud-pattern designs

240
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,730
and had someone bring them over for you.

241
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:09,422
Really?

242
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,340
Prince Yunnuo, you're the best!

243
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,410
Please, sit.

244
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,250
Let's sit and talk.

245
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,110
Prince Yunnuo, from now on,

246
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,580
if you find anything with
cloud patterns, just send them over.

247
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,120
I'll buy them all, no matter the price.

248
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,760
I want to do this for you.

249
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,850
How can I accept payment?

250
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
If you like them,

251
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,540
I will find you more.

252
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,300
As long as it makes you happy.

253
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,950
That pattern means so much to me.

254
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
Then, I promise

255
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,020
I'll do my best.

256
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,000
Yunnuo, you're here again.

257
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,940
Yunnuo is a busy man.

258
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,020
No need for you to trouble yourself
with Aliya.

259
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,500
The gifts were not for you.

260
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,080
Who are you to refuse them on my behalf?

261
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,380
If you want cloud patterns,

262
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,540
I will gather every last one
in the world for you.

263
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,860
I am not feeling well.

264
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,900
I can't be a good host.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,400
Aliya is going to treat me,
so she can't handle any visitors.

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,511
See yourself out, Yunnuo.

267
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,200
Prince Yunnuo, let me walk you out.

268
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,060
Aliya is going to treat me.

269
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,080
You're coming with me.

270
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,420
Jiufeng.

271
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,300
Allow me to treat you too,
Your Highness.

272
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:24,380
That won't be necessary.

273
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,250
I...

274
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,060
How could you just agree to this?

275
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,380
I had no choice at the time.

276
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,711
Bilian coming here
was Noble Consort's doing.

277
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,980
She used Father's good intentions.

278
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,360
I couldn't turn them down.

279
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:44,340
This just proves
you don't trust my medical skills.

280
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,860
You seem nervous.

281
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,100
I...

282
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,620
I'm just afraid of Noble Consort.

283
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,740
Did you forget how she gave me
a hard time last time?

284
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Of course, I'm nervous.

285
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,900
Besides,

286
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:05,600
you could have at least discussed it
with me first, right?

287
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,340
I am your rightful consort, after all.

288
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,580
Now you remember your title?

289
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,140
If you want
the authority of Princess Consort Jin,

290
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,980
you should fulfill the duties
that come with it.

291
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,380
What?

292
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,500
What did you think
I was going to do just now?

293
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,780
What are you thinking?

294
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,133
I'm thinking I want to kill you.

295
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,820
(This won't do.)

296
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
(If they find out
I don't actually know medicine,)

297
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,900
(my identity will be exposed.)

298
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:01,410
(I need to make a trip back
and figure something out.)

299
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,020
(Everything Guild)

300
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Mr. Ji.

301
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,180
Your story

302
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,740
is quite entertaining,

303
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,260
but it's still missing something.

304
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,490
People these days
love romance and drama.

305
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,940
What you wrote is too plain.

306
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,300
It won't sell.

307
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,180
But no need to worry.

308
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,540
I'm here

309
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
to help guide your writing.

310
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,380
From now on,

311
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,610
I'll take charge

312
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,180
of your “life experiences.”

313
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,360
I was wondering who it could be.

314
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:38,488
Turns out it's you,
clinging like a stubborn plaster.

315
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,180
What are you trying to do
to my husband?

316
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,150
You again?

317
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,210
Mr. Ji, get this woman out of here!

318
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,620
Or I'm not going to talk business
with you anymore!

319
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,100
Well...

320
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,460
You can discuss the money
and publishing with me.

321
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,940
I'm my husband's agent.

322
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,260
He just writes the books.

323
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,380
Talk to you?

324
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Then, I think we're done here.

325
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,980
What's wrong? Scared?

326
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,220
Fine, let's talk.

327
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,540
I'm not afraid of you.

328
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,780
Come on. Let's talk.

329
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,340
(Everything Guild)

330
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,820
(Signed by Yuanxiang and Fang)

331
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,690
Mrs. Ji.

332
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,670
You have enlightened me.

333
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,220
Thank you for being
so reasonable and persuasive.

334
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
Good girl.

335
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,090
It's a good thing you know your mistakes
and are willing to change.

336
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,820
Rest assured,

337
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,680
I will tell my father

338
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,890
and give you full cooperation.

339
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,500
And Mr. Ji?

340
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,100
Mr. Ji is the past now.

341
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,060
You're the one
who has my full attention.

342
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,460
Right.

343
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,140
Mrs. Ji.

344
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,580
Good. Very good.

345
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,650
I'll excuse myself now.

346
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,820
Mr. Ji, I'm taking my leave.

347
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,140
Thank you so much for your help.

348
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,280
I'd like to...

349
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,490
prepare a meal for you.

350
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,700
Anyone can cook.

351
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,260
I don't need you to cook for me.

352
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,940
He's still acting all shy.

353
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,740
My leg...

354
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
(Everything Guild)

355
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Relax.

356
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,500
Gently.

357
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Ow...

358
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,510
Fang, what happened?

359
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,120
Yuanxiang twisted her leg.

360
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm treating it.

361
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,160
Relax.

362
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,210
Don't tense up.

363
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,070
Relax.

364
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,100
All done.

365
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,940
Try standing up.

366
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,020
My leg is fine again!

367
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,970
(As expected
from a Xilin miracle physician.)

368
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,580
You're incredible, Mrs. Ji!

369
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,290
Fang,

370
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,780
I want to learn this too!

371
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,540
You want to learn how to fix legs?

372
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,420
Oh...

373
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,500
It hurts...

374
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,340
It hurts?

375
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,200
Did my shock therapy actually work?

376
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,780
Do you feel something here? Here?

377
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,580
I meant I fell down
and now my back and butt hurt!

378
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,100
Guess my home remedy didn't work.

379
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,050
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

380
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,060
Sorry.

381
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,220
I'll help you up right away.

382
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,800
Here, let me help you up.

383
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,700
Looks like that trick was useless.

384
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:27,780
I better use the method Aliya taught me.

385
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,500
(Benevolent and Kind)
It really hurts.

386
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,420
Shouldn't you at least help me up first?

387
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,100
Fang.

388
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,780
Dear.

389
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,940
(Fang's so good to me.)

390
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,800
(How can I keep lying to her)

391
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,260
(about us being a married couple?)

392
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,670
(But if I tell her the truth,)

393
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,180
(will I break her heart?)

394
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,730
Dear, what brings you here so late?

395
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,533
Is there something you want to tell me?

396
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,540
There's something
I've been meaning to say.

397
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,410
I really admire your courage.

398
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,660
The way you stood up for me
when those female students

399
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,560
got out of hand...

400
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,770
I'm very grateful.

401
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,180
But the truth is, I...

402
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,650
I...

403
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,660
I...

404
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,220
Don't mind me.

405
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,460
I just need to relieve myself.

406
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,460
Fang,

407
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,800
I've been wanting to tell you.

408
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,340
I really admire your courage.

409
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,860
You were not afraid of all those girls

410
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,820
and protected me.

411
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,070
I...

412
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,030
I...

413
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,260
What? Let me go first.

414
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,500
I'm not done yet.

415
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,060
My thing is important. Don't interrupt.

416
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,430
Fang, listen.

417
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,090
The truth is, we're not actually...

418
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,660
You know he has gynophobia...

419
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,480
Listen to me, my sister-in-law!

420
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,770
Wait.

421
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,180
What did you just call me?

422
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,000
Sister-in-law.

423
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,500
Manman.

424
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,940
The night is cold.

425
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,219
Let me take you back to your room,
and we can talk there.

426
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,100
All right.

427
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,460
- Come on.
- Let's go.

428
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,780
- Go.
- What did you call me again?

429
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,620
Sister-in-law.

430
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,520
Say it one more time.

431
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,710
- Sister-in-law.
- Let's go.

432
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,550
One more time.

433
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,650
Sister-in-law!

434
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,620
(Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach)

435
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,740
Come here!

436
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,900
Come here, you!

437
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,020
Stop right there! My goodness...

438
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,380
Renying,

439
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,460
Shuitu,

440
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,620
Qishe,

441
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,780
Yutang,

442
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,940
Zhongting...

443
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,500
(Acupoint Chart)

444
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,940
Please don't be mad.

445
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,060
Maybe we can continue tomorrow?

446
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,900
I can't memorize so much all at once.

447
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,650
Very well.

448
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,050
Come to me again tonight,

449
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:29,490
and I'll teach you the next part.

450
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,133
Thank you, my sister-in-law.

451
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:34,390
Make sure you revise what I taught you.

452
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,420
I will.

453
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
I'll be leaving now.

454
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,860
This is so weird.

455
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,650
I don't remember anything else,

456
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,110
but I can draw out the acupoint map

457
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,870
and recognize the herbs
with my eyes closed.

458
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,060
What am I forgetting?

459
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,630
I've got it.

460
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,340
(Prince Jin's Residence)

461
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,460
Princess Consort Jin
still has not returned.

462
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,500
She's getting more and more unruly

463
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,620
by the day.

464
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,244
She is Princess Consort Jin
and this is Prince Jin's Residence.

465
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,300
She snuck out not long ago.

466
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,660
I gave her the benefit of the doubt,

467
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,733
hoping she would improve.

468
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,940
And now what?

469
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,960
Staying out all night?

470
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,460
And you!

471
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,460
You don't even know where she went.

472
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:32,580
Please calm down, Your Highness.

473
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,590
I was wrong.

474
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,700
Pass on my message.

475
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,133
Once she returns,
she is confined to the residence.

476
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,220
No food for her either.

477
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,466
Let's see if she dares
to stay out all night again.

478
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,100
Your Highness.

479
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,580
Her Highness has returned.

480
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,200
Where did she spend the night?

481
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,840
She went to the Everything Guild.

482
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,079
She stayed up the whole night

483
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,990
learning from a physician
to help cure your leg.

484
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,730
She actually cared about me...

485
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,690
I'm so sleepy...

486
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,820
Yuetao, hurry and...

487
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,940
Oh, everyone's here.

488
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,700
All gathered, huh?

489
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,300
You were out all night.

490
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,740
You must be starving.

491
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,700
Jiufeng, tell the kitchen

492
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,260
to make matsutake chicken stew

493
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,270
and black bean steamed ribs for her.

494
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,090
Right away.

495
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,180
I've been busy all day.

496
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,220
I'm really worn out.

497
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,970
I should head back and rest, okay?

498
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,090
Come on, Yuetao.

499
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
Your Highness, the dishes...

500
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:54,920
Have the kitchen prepare them.

501
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,300
I'll get going.

502
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,180
(Looks like she took my words to heart)

503
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:05,000
(and is seriously studying medicine.)

504
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,740
(Benevolent and Kind)

505
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,540
Aliya, there's something I want
to discuss with you.

506
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Now that Bilian has moved
into the residence,

507
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,700
to keep up appearances and avoid gossip

508
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,900
about our marriage,

509
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,240
we should continue living together.

510
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,820
This time, you sleep on the daybed.
I'll take the bed.

511
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,900
Of course, if you behave yourself,

512
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,820
I might consider...

513
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,580
What was that for?

514
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,420
Nothing.

515
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,022
Just heard something I didn't like.

516
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,650
So? Can you feel that?

517
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,620
Of course not.

518
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,020
Well?

519
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,900
Stop messing with it.

520
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,140
There's no feeling anyway.

521
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,660
What exactly are you doing?

522
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,600
How about now?

523
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,969
You've got to feel something now.

524
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,980
Still nothing!

525
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,670
Then, why did you yell?

526
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,570
Because I care, okay?

527
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,470
Even if I can't feel them,

528
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,500
they're still my legs.

529
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,488
You can't just treat them
like they're nothing.

530
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,020
Guess the stimulation
isn't strong enough.

531
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,740
Yuetao! Get me a stick!

532
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,940
I know.

533
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,530
You're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?

534
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,355
What are you talking about,
Your Highness?

535
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,740
Now that Bilian is here,

536
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,580
I've got to put
in a little extra effort.

537
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,060
Where are you going, Your Highness?

538
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,190
To have Jiufeng move your stuff in here.

539
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,310
The needles are still in your legs!

540
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,940
What's going on here?

541
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,180
Excuse me.

542
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,260
Make way, please.

543
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,340
- Excuse me.
- Who is that?

544
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,850
Excuse me.

545
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,580
Who's that?

546
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,700
Indeed.

547
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,320
Take your medicine according to this.

548
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,170
Thank you.

549
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,066
Payment there,
and pick up your medicine here.

550
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,300
Dear, you're back.

551
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,700
I saved some food for you.

552
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,911
Go eat before it gets cold.

553
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,110
All right.

554
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,180
Mo.

555
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,260
Mo.

556
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,220
Come here.

557
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,180
Take these together.

558
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,240
Thank you.

559
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,820
This girl is amazing.

560
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,380
Have you ever seen
Everything Guild this packed

561
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,580
since it opened?

562
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,540
Never.

563
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,060
Just look at this!

564
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,180
Look at it!

565
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,100
You know what it feels like
to count money

566
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,530
until your hands cramp up?

567
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,280
Let me give you a taste.

568
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,100
It's addictive!

569
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,620
Father,

570
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,540
I'll enjoy

571
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,580
this feeling with you.

572
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
But when we're done,

573
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,940
we still have

574
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,260
to give the money back.

575
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,940
Of course.

576
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,980
I mean,

577
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,300
at my age,

578
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,111
how could I take advantage
of a young girl?

579
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,140
Father, didn't you just say
you wouldn't take advantage?

580
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,500
I didn't.

581
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,350
Then...

582
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,380
This guild is huge.

583
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,540
There are overhead costs.

584
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,620
We've got to pay for stuff.

585
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,580
And besides,

586
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,020
I deserve my wages, don't I?

587
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,190
Even if I don't use it,

588
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,380
it's money

589
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,060
I'm saving for Manman.

590
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,480
Manman's still

591
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,390
in Prince Jin's Residence.

592
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,100
If her identity

593
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,420
gets exposed one day,

594
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,460
she'll need to run.

595
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,980
And to run, you need money.

596
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,250
So, I'm saving it for her.

597
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
I can never

598
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,260
stop worrying about you two.

599
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,940
(Maybe Fang can cure)

600
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,580
(my gynophobia.)

601
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,020
- Take these on time.
- Thank you.

602
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,580
(If I can recover,)

603
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,660
(maybe we can really be together.)

604
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,660
(Prince Jin's Residence)

605
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,660
Your Highness, you can do this too?

606
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,120
I studied under a famous painter
when I was younger.

607
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,900
I don't think that famous painter

608
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,450
taught you this

609
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,420
to paint handkerchiefs for Her Highness.

610
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:43,580
Well, I am glad he taught me well.

611
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,933
Otherwise,
I could never paint something like this.

612
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,420
Right.

613
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:49,500
Get some people together
and go catch fireflies.

614
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,020
The more, the better.

615
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,220
Trying to win Her Highness over, huh?

616
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,300
I thought...

617
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,540
You thought what? Stop thinking.

618
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,620
Just go!

619
00:30:58,688 --> 00:31:00,533
And don't come back
if you don't catch enough.

620
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,540
On it.

621
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,100
Your Highness.

622
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,430
Greetings, Your Highness.

623
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,380
What is it?

624
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,450
I'm merely concerned
for your health.

625
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,940
I wanted to check your pulse.

626
00:31:11,977 --> 00:31:12,933
What do you mean?

627
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:15,311
Are you trying to curse His Highness
into falling sick?

628
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,240
I wouldn't dare.

629
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,822
There's nothing wrong with me
that needs your treatment.

630
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:19,688
You may leave.

631
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,800
Please, Your Highness,

632
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,444
consider the kind intentions
of His Majesty and Noble Consort.

633
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,933
His Majesty cares deeply for you,

634
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,250
and Princess Consort Jin has been

635
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,980
treating your legs for quite some time

636
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,977
without much improvement,

637
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,220
hence they sent me
to give you more thorough care.

638
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,300
Are you suggesting

639
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,580
your skills are better

640
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,980
than Xilin's

641
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,940
best physician?

642
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,800
That the Princess Consort
of Prince Jin's Residence

643
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,620
is no match for you,
a no-name female physician?

644
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:43,930
That's not what I meant.

645
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,370
I'm merely following the orders
of His Majesty and Noble Consort.

646
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,430
Are you using His Majesty
to threaten me?

647
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,100
I misspoke.

648
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,360
Let this be a warning to you.

649
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,140
I don't care
whose orders you're following.

650
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,380
Once you're inside my residence,

651
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,560
you follow my rules.

652
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,880
Princess Consort Jin
is the mistress of this residence.

653
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,866
If you ever make me or her unhappy,
then whether it's

654
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:07,220
dismemberment, flogging, poison,
or strangled to death with silk,

655
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:08,660
no one will be able to save you.

656
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:09,549
Now, get out of here!

657
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,300
Yes, Your Highness.

658
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,240
Bilian, what are you doing here?

659
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:18,220
Your Highness,
allow me to deliver the medicine.

660
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,180
Oh, it's hot!

661
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,810
Why didn't you warn me,
Your Highness?

662
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,580
Hot?

663
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,466
I left it out to cool.
How's it still hot?

664
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,480
Yuetao, just leave it and take Bilian

665
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,100
to put some ice on her hand.

666
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,510
Your Highness, you have a heart of gold.

667
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,700
Come on, then!

668
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:41,866
Or does it not hurt anymore?

669
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,740
This medicine is so bitter.

670
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,420
Since when is medicine not bitter?

671
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,380
Just drink it already.

672
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:03,620
If you don't, I'll force it down.

673
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,770
Go ahead.

674
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,940
Do it.

675
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,300
I'll feed you.

676
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,140
There.

677
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,100
I finished the medicine.

678
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,300
Peel a mandarin orange for me.

679
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,220
No way.

680
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,180
Why not?

681
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,700
It will take up space
in your stomach.

682
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,711
You've still got
four more bowls of medicine to go.

683
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:51,740
Four bowls?

684
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,710
Your Highness.

685
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,920
Fresh batch just arrived.

686
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,380
You've got to be kidding me.

687
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Not at all.

688
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,740
Your Highness,

689
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,300
preparing your medicine
took a lot of time and effort.

690
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,380
It took me ten hours

691
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,140
and ten taels of silver.

692
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:12,533
Please drink them now. Come on.

693
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,660
Here.

694
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,220
Let's take a break.

695
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,780
It's too bitter.

696
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,780
If you do...

697
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,770
But it's so bitter...

698
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,420
I'm so sorry!

699
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,340
Did I burn you?

700
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,340
No.

701
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,870
My legs can't feel anything.

702
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,530
Yuetao, get some burn ointment!

703
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,380
On it!

704
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,755
- Jiufeng, bring a basin of cold water!
- Right away!

705
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,600
Are you all right?

706
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,640
I'm so sorry.

707
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,777
I didn't mean to do that.

708
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,540
You must be in so much pain...

709
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,780
Your Highness. Maybe it's better if
Her Highness stops treating your legs.

710
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,020
At this rate, she's going to ruin
your perfectly healthy legs.

711
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
No, she must continue.

712
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,666
If she ruins them,
she can fix them again.

713
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,340
That's not worth

714
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,180
the risk.

715
00:34:55,244 --> 00:34:57,000
The palace already sent
a female physician.

716
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,060
That means

717
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,290
they're suspicious of her.

718
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,940
Even if it's just for show,

719
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,644
we have to let her continue treating me.

720
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,500
Besides,

721
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,040
she doesn't even know
I'm faking my condition,

722
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,780
yet she stays up late,

723
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,060
giving her all to make medicine for me.

724
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,580
And if she wants
to go out again tonight...

725
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,540
Don't stop her.

726
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,100
Pretend you didn't see anything.

727
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:20,110
Not only should we let her go,

728
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:21,790
make sure she's protected in secret.
