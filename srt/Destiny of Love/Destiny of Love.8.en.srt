Don't stop her.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,300
Understood.

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,550
Don't sleep tonight.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,350
I trust you the most.

Let's get something to eat
once we finish our rounds.

34
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,820
Sure. What should we eat?

35
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,070
Let's think about it.

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,980
You two.

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,870
Come here.

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,380
The residence is secure.

39
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,030
Supper's on me tonight.

40
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,177
- Thanks, Feng.
- Thanks, Feng.

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,150
(If I go through the main gate,
Aliya won't have to wait too long.)

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,910

about locking me up during the day.)

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,910

(The heavens do favor the studious.)

46
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,190
She left.

48
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,070
Your Highness,

49
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,470
why did you ask me to go to such lengths

50
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,310
for Her Highness?

51
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,820
I paid a visit
to Everything Guild myself.

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,660
I learned from her brother that...

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,220
Who's that this late at night?

54
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,500
What do you want?

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,420
Well...

56
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,066
Do not be alarmed, Mr. Ji.

57
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,430
I heard that Everything Guild
solves all sorts of worldly troubles.

58
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,070
I came

59
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
in search of help.

60
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,910
My sister manages the guild.

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,310
She's not here right now.

62
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,380
But if you tell me your issue,

63
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,470
I'll pass it along

64
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,910
when she returns.

65
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,870
That would be most appreciated.

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,430
Weren't you the one who needed help?

67
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,622
Why were you the one
asking me all the questions?

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,670
I'm tired.

69
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,990
I still have to continue tomorrow.

70
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,550
Better head back early

71
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:48,070
so I can get a bit more sleep.

Dear, you're here.

94
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,430
What are you doing, Fang?

95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,070
I'm giving myself acupuncture.

96
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,940
I can see that,

97
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,630
but why?

98
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,670
Stimulating certain brain points helps

99
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,940
with memory recovery.

100
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,870
Did anything come back?

101
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,940
I...

102
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,550
I remember myself

103
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,990
in red,

104
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,550
running through a forest.

105
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,180
Anything else?

106
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,660
Oh, right.

107
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,900
These vernacular stories.

108
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,020
I've read them. More than once.

109
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,460
You're my agent.

110
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,688
Of course, you've read them.

111
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,700
I remember...

112
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:23,750
Actually, I don't remember anything at all.

113
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,190
But these books all feel familiar.

114
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
And then?

115
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,070
That's it.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,644
Maybe I should try a few more needles?

117
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,890
I'll just add a few more.

118
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,740
Fang!

119
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,960
What are you doing to yourself?

120
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,020
You've turned yourself into a porcupine!

121
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,100
- What's going on?
- Dad.

122
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,555
She's trying to recover her memory.

123
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,470
Recover her...

124
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,310
You mustn't do that!

125
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,190
What I mean is,

126
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,700
physicians can't treat themselves.

127
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,700
Don't worry, Dad.

128
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,260
I know what I'm doing.

129
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,070
Feel anything?

130
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,190
Are any memories coming back?

131
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,900
I think

132
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,550
I feel something.

133
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,870
What do you feel?

134
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,510
My head...

135
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,190
- Fang!
- Fang!

136
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,777
What's wrong?

137
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:21,310
(Everything Guild)
Dad, what's wrong with her?

138
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,150
Quickly!

139
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,800
From now on, you keep an eye on her.

140
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,666
No more of this
memory-recovery nonsense.

141
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,820
Dad.

142
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,990
Why are you so afraid of her

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,250
remembering the past?

144
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,180
I'm not.

145
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,370
You silly child.

146
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm just worried about her health.

147
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,190
You saw her, right?

148
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,390
Covering her whole head

149
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,320
in needles like that.

150
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,520
She even fainted!

151
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,755
What's more important?

152
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,500
Regaining her memories or staying alive?

153
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,820
(Benevolent and Kind)

154
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,640
Your Highness, do you feel anything?

155
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,430
No, I don't.

156
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,720
That's all right. I'll use more force.

157
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,180
Still nothing.

158
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,650
Nothing.

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,420
Still? That doesn't hurt?

160
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,390
Not at all.

161
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,540
I...

162
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,240
Well? That had to hurt, right?

163
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,100
Still nothing.

164
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
Your Highness,
surely you felt that one...

165
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,030
Give me a hand, Yuetao.

166
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,230
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,340
Come on.

168
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,110

Nothing.

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,700
Nothing?

174
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,300
I get it now.

175
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,580
I must have gotten the angle
and pressure wrong.

176
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,270
Don't worry. I have another way.

177
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,550

Come on!

179
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,540
Here we go.

180
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,220

183
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,910
But it's not hot today.

184
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,190
Do you feel anything now, Your Highness?

185
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,860
No...

186
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,550
I... I really don't feel anything.

187
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,190
Well, you should, Your Highness.

188
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,580
Three.

189
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,310
Maybe a tiny bit.

190
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,790
Really? How about now?

191
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,750
Yes, I'm feeling it.

192
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh, thank goodness!

193
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,310
I'm exhausted.

194
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,180
Finally!

195
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,340
I need some water.

196
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,860
Why did you guys stop? Continue.

197
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,310
You still want to continue?

198
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,340
Well...

199
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,220
Your Highness!

200
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,790
Healing takes time.

201
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,510
We have to look at the long term.

202
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,910
Your Highness.

203
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,990
- I...
- Your Highness.

204
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,300
I know

205
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
it's not about a moment.

206
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,220
It's about every moment.

207
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,860
We have to keep going.

208
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,670
Let's continue the treatment.

209
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,060
Hang in there, Your Highness!

210
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,430
Give me a hand.

211
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,660
There we go.

212
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:33,960
- Jiufeng, hurry up!
- You guys...

213
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,150
Hurry, Jiufeng!

214
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,030
Aren't you all tired?
I'm already exhausted.

215
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,900
Not in the slightest.

216
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,960
- Anything for you to get better.
- We should rest...

217
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,400
We don't mind a little fatigue.

218
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:43,150
I need to relieve myself!

219
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,790
Is that a coffin?

220
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,270
Why are you sitting on a coffin?

221
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:56,310
What are you talking about?

222
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,860
This is a special table
for Guasha therapy.

223
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,770
Guasha therapy?

224
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,740
What about the cloud pattern?

225
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:08,111
You really think
you're some miracle physician now?

226
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:10,266
Bilian's already moved
into the residence.

227
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,580
If I don't hurry up
and heal Prince Jin's legs,

228
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,430
how can I stay here?

229
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,150
True.

230
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:18,860
I pay my respects to Your Highness.

231
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,340
I believe there may be some issues

232
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,820
with the prescription I wrote
for His Highness today.

233
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,311
I was hoping Your Highness
could offer some guidance.

234
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,030
Bilian.

235
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,510
If you think your prescription is flawed,

236
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:37,950
you should keep that to yourself.

237
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,610
Don't come here trying to show off.

238
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,760
I would never dare.

239
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,070
I upset you, Your Highness.

240
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
It was my mistake.

241
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:46,750
But everything I have done
for His Highness's recovery

242
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,580
is out of concern for his health.

243
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,350
You cannot just ignore his condition.

244
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,550
Is it really me ignoring his health?

245
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,510
Or is it you trying
to climb your way into power

246
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,890
by cozying up to him?

247
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,580
All right.

248
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,550
I must prepare
today's Guasha treatment for him.

249
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,660
Leave.

250
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,390
Do not bother me again.

251
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,180
Yes, Your Highness.

252
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,580
Oh, and from now on,

253
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,310
stop trying all these tricks
to get close to him.

254
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,390
I will look after his health.

255
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,030
Is that clear?

256
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,110
Please excuse me.

257
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,860
Was she crying just now?

258
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,310
Did I go too far?

259
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,550
She just wants you to feel guilty.

260
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,430
She showed up

261
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,390
first thing in the morning to annoy me.

262
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,000
How should I deal with her?

263
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,980
Deal with her?

264
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:06,980
Kick her out of the residence!

265
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,910
Your Highness.

266
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,070
I think Her Highness
has feelings for you, too.

267
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,630
Let's go.

268
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,340
What is this, Aliya?

269
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,180
Your Highness.

270
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,430
Let's try Guasha therapy today.

271
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,220
Guasha therapy?

272
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,630
Your Highness.

273
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,500
I suspect the root of your leg issue

274
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,390
might not be in the leg itself.

275
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,220
By treating a few key pressure points
with this stone,

276
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,340
clearing toxins
and promoting blood flow,

277
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,220
we might find the real cause.

278
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,510
Jiufeng. Yuetao.

279
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,630
Don't just stand there.

280
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,430
Undress His Highness.

281
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,580
I have to get undressed?

282
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,790
Of course.

283
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,580
How are you feeling, Your Highness?

284
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,390
I feel surprisingly
refreshed and clear-headed.

285
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,940
Aliya.

286
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,100
This therapy

287
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,180
must be exhausting.

288
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,510
Should we

289
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,740
let Bilian help?

290
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,630
No.

291
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,310
Why let her come for no reason?

292
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:31,111
(She just doesn't want
anyone else getting close to me.)

293
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,910
Your Highness.

294
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,190
I've prepared your medicine for today.

295
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,300
Let me feed it to you.

296
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,270
It's too hot.

297
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,030
Blow on it for me first.

298
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,940
Yes, Your Highness.

299
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,660
What was that for?

300
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,180
Nothing.

301
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:10,844
Take your time with your medicine.

302
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,150
I'll be going now.

303
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,360
- Your Highness.
- Leave.

304
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,980
But the medicine...

305
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,820
I said,

306
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,270
leave.

307
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,730
Yes.

308
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,220
I'll leave the medicine here for you.

309
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,540
Did I overdo it?

310
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,870
Not at all.

311
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,590
(Elegance and Refinement)
Her Highness is starting to care.

312
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,510
What we want is for her anger

313
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,740
to burn even hotter.

314
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:51,460
Although, Your Highness,

315
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,940
she looked rather unfazed just now.

316
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,110
My medicine.

317
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,230
Right away.

318
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,260
(Still Waters Run Deep)

319
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,755
Your Highness, as you instructed,

320
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:03,155
I've had someone
watching over Princess Aliya discreetly.

321
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:03,940
She's been visiting

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,155
a place called Everything Guild
quite frequently.

323
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,430
We looked into it.

324
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,088
Everything Guild has a reputation.

325
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,360
They specialize in solving
all kinds of personal troubles.

326
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,100
You mean
she's got problems she needs solved?

327
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,990
I would not dare assume.

328
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,140
But every time she goes,

329
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,644
she consults with a woman
about medical knowledge.

330
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,900
What woman?

331
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,510
She's been treating difficult illnesses
at the guild lately.

332
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,750
They say she's cured
quite a few unusual cases.

333
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,900
There's even a line
to get a consultation.

334
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,380
Prepare the carriage.

335
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,100
We're going to meet her.

336
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,750
Understood.

337
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,780
(Benevolent and Kind)

338
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,860
Bilian.

339
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,420
You prepared everything on this table.

340
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,288
You should sit and enjoy it with us.

341
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,790
I do not dare.

342
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,470
I'm telling you to sit.

343
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,311
What is there to be afraid of?

344
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,688
Thank you, Your Highness.

345
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,990
Then, I will sit.

346
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,580
Speaking of effort,

347
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,510
Jiufeng,

348
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,288
you've been His Highness's guard
for years and protected him.

349
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,550
You should be rewarded too.

350
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,340
Come sit next to me.

351
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,790
I shouldn't, Your Highness...

352
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,030
Why not?

353
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,430
Come and sit.

354
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,030
Jiufeng!

355
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,060
You too, Yuetao.

356
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,470
After serving us both for so long,

357
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,900
you must be tired.

358
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,070
No need to stay standing.

359
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,190
Join us.

360
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,190
Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,270
(Is she mad or just jealous?)

362
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,580
Bilian, these are garlic chives.

363
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
Have some.

364
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,844
Thank you, Your Highness.

365
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,340
May I, Your Highness?

366
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,620
Do you not know that garlic chives
upset the stomach

367
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:08,219
and have male-stimulating properties?

368
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,550
They are not suitable for women.

369
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,540
Bilian.

370
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,590
As a fellow physician,

371
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,710
you should know that, right?

372
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,270
I do,

373
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,711
but I dare not refuse
His Highness's kindness.

374
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,950
If you were going to eat it anyway,

375
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,580
what was the point of asking me

376
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,844
that question just now?

377
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,710
I was wrong.

378
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,510
I upset you, Your Highness.

379
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,111
I should not have said anything.

380
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
Good.

381
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,270
Give the chives to Jiufeng instead.

382
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,900
Eat up, Jiufeng.

383
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,470
(A little help, Your Highness?)

384
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,550
Thank you, Your Highness.

385
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,620
(Jiufeng's trick actually worked.)

386
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,310
Everyone, carry on eating.

387
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,620
Bilian, this beef brisket is delicious.

388
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:01,620
Have some to keep up your strength.

389
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,955
Thank you, Your Highness.

390
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,750
(Something must be wrong
with Fu Chengjin's head today.)

391
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,790
This brisket looks good.

392
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,750
Have more of it, Yuetao.

393
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,340
You too, Jiufeng.

394
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,990
(Looks like she is jealous.)

395
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,300
Bilian.

396
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,900
This fish is my favorite dish
in the residence.

397
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,790
You have worked hard these days
treating my legs.

398
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,140
Eat more of this fish.

399
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,030
Be careful of the bones.

400
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:31,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

401
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,180
(Oh, no. Did I go too far?)

402
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,580
Your Highnesses...

403
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,420
Please don't be upset.

404
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,750
It's all my fault.

405
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,070
I know I am slow

406
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,070
and unworthy
of Your Highness's kindness.

407
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,750
But if eating this upsets Her Highness,

408
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,420
then I'd rather kneel here

409
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,030
until the meal is over.

410
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,230
Bilian.

411
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,380
If you want to kneel, go ahead.

412
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:11,860
I'm done with this meal.

413
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,420
Let's go, Yuetao.

414
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,310
(She likes me a lot.)

415
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,270
Jiufeng, I'm full too.

416
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,340
Let's go.

417
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,510
(What is wrong with these people?)

418
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,030
Back-shu points...

419
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,900
Back-shu points...

420
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,580
Under the spinous process
of the 12th thoracic vertebra...

421
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,470
Two finger-widths
to the left and right...

422
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:06,820
She doesn't even know
how to do acupuncture?

423
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,660
Why is she studying
a basic acupuncture chart?

424
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,070
She doesn't seem like someone

425
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,420
who knows medicine at all.

426
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,420
(Ginseng. Veratrum. Right herbal base.)

427
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,580
(But that is too much ginseng.)

428
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:43,750
(No real physician
would make a mistake like that.)

429
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
(Everything Guild)

430
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,870
Boil and take this daily.
It will definitely help.

431
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,066
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

432
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,190
Let's go.

433
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,990
Please be seated, Sir.

434
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,270
Manman!

435
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,580
What are your symptoms?

436
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:09,950
Miss. I've been feeling tightness in my
chest and shortness of breath lately.

437
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,580
Could you take a look at me?

438
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,030
You are perfectly healthy.

439
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,140
No treatment is needed.

440
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,100
Actually, I came here today

441
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,340
to see you about a personal matter.

442
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,620
Personal?

443
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,510
Do you want something

444
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,550
to boost your virility?

445
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,130
No.

446
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,660
I came here specifically for you.

447
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,230
For me?

448
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,780
You look familiar.

449
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,180
I saw you when I was flying kites

450
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,510
with Princess Consort Jin.

451
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,180
What does that have to do with you?

452
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,460
Are you two close?

453
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,550
Why should I tell you?

454
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,830
You seem quite skilled.

455
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,000
May I know who taught you?

456
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,620
You do not require my services.

457
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,870
Please leave.

458
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,710
You misunderstand.

459
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,780
I just wanted to...

460
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,750
Sir.

461
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,820
Please.

462
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,710
(What is with this guy?)

463
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,300
(Every day,)

464
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,577
(I'll get all kinds of people.)

465
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,740
(Everything Guild)

466
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,900
Dear.

467
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,990
Dear.

468
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,820
Why are you asleep here?

469
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,860
Are you all right, Dear?

470
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,030
Fang.

471
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,140
I want to do something for you too,

472
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,380
but

473
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,190
I'm not good enough.

474
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,300
The only thing

475
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,310
I can do now

476
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,990
is write stories.

477
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,510
Dear,

478
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,620
your fear of women is psychological.

479
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,860
You cannot rush through it.

480
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:13,620
If we work on it together,

481
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,900
we will get through it.

482
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,750
Look at this.

483
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,860
(Ji Mo's Treatment Plan)

484
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,590
I have put together

485
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,288
a comprehensive treatment plan for you.

486
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,420
What are you doing?

487
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,900
We are supposed to be
doing therapy, right?

488
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,030
Exactly.

489
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,990
And I am your treatment plan.

490
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,950
The treatment means

491
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,860
closing the distance between us.

492
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,950
And what does the treatment involve?

493
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,860
Well...

494
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,380
I'll poke your face
with a finger in week one.

495
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,750
We'll hold hands

496
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,990
and go for a walk in week two.

497
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,510
Hug in week three.

498
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,180
As for week four...

499
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:05,777
I'll keep that a secret for now.

500
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,300
I'll head back now.

501
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm not going to make it to week four.

502
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,950
You're here, Dear.

503
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,620
Fang.

504
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,340
I think we should skip
this whole therapy thing.

505
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,430
Absolutely not.

506
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,860
Come here.

507
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,270
I will do it myself.

508
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,200
- Sit.
- Alright.

509
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,660
Now, look into my eyes.

510
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,380
Don't move.

511
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:06,070
One, two, three, four.

512
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,750
Very good.

513
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,070
Keep it up.

514
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,180
Five, six.

515
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,380
Relax your head and shoulders.

516
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,340
Focus on your breathing.

517
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,580
Once you focus on your breath,

518
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,530
you will start to feel the blood
and energy flow through your body.

519
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,900
Now,

520
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,510
close your eyes.

521
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,900
I feel much better.

522
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,550
We should call it a night!

523
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,670
Wait!

524
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,030
We have not even started yet!

525
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,750
Fang, what are you...

526
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,620
You tried to dodge treatment.
You are a dead man.

527
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,540
No... It's just that things have been
really busy at the academy.

528
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,820
You're still making excuses.

529
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,900
Now, onto treatment method number two.

530
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,030
There's a second method?

531
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,340
Are you sure this is treating me

532
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,900
and not just traumatizing me further?

533
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,820
Are you questioning my medical skills?

534
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,340
I'm warning you.

535
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,550
Do not doubt my abilities.

536
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,300
(Serene Breeze and Scenic Splendor)

537
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:01,460
Princess Consort Jin is all name
and no substance.

538
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,230
His Highness must be lonely.

539
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,750
Noble Consort is right.

540
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:09,755
(Blissful Passion)
I'll warm His Highness's body and heart.

541
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,270
Your Highness,
I've prepared your medicine.

542
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,790
Just leave it there.

543
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,820
Yes, Your Highness.

544
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,950
You've been overworking yourself lately.

545
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:27,422
I worry you might forget
to take your medicine.

546
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,270
Might I stay and serve it

547
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,470
to you personally?

548
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,820
I see it's too stuffy for you.

549
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,900
Bilian.

550
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,550
Why not take that entire outer robe off?

551
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,270
Yes, I understand.

552
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,750
I have no regrets.

553
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,070
No regrets, truly?

554
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,060
Jiufeng.

555
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,670
Your Highness.

556
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,820
She thinks it is too hot here.

557
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,860
Take her to the garden to cool off.

558
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,710
And get someone to keep an eye on her.

559
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,310
Do not let her come back

560
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,300
for at least two hours.

561
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:11,390
Perfect. The mosquitoes
have been bad lately.

562
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,710
Someone needs to feed them.

563
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,840
Come along.

564
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
Your Highness...

565
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,540
Your Highness!

566
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,820
Your Highness.

567
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,311
It's time for your medicine.

568
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,750
Aliya.

569
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:28,911
Do I have to take this medicine
every single day?

570
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,010
It is unbearably bitter.

571
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,670
Your Highness.

572
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,980
Bitter medicine works best.

573
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,270
Drink it. I am watching you.

574
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,510
Aliya,

575
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,100
this was just delivered by Bilian.

576
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,540
She specifically told me

577
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,750
this cannot be taken
with other medicines.

578
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,100
I will just drink this one first...

579
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,670
There.

580
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,711
Bilian's medicine is gone.

581
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,420
Now can you take your real medicine?

582
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,340
Why do I feel so warm all of a sudden?

583
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,710
Why did you stop?

584
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,488
Continue. Finish them all.

585
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,100
Why are you

586
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,790
looking at me like that?

587
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,990
I'm watching you take your medicine.

588
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,470
Three more bowls to go. Come on.

589
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,340
What are you doing?

590
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,340
I'm not sure why,

591
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,950
but my heart's been racing

592
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,470
after I took that medicine.

593
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,510
And I feel gorgeous.

594
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,060
What do you think?

595
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,140
You look

596
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,620
exquisite.

597
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,710
Thanks.

598
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,844
A gentleman can't prey
on another's moment of weakness!

599
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:04,955
A gentleman can't not prey
on another's moment of weakness.

600
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,300
You can just marry me.

601
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,550
I...

602
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,830
We're already married, aren't we?

603
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,580
You are my consort.

604
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,220
No, I'm not.

605
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,830
I'm Manman.

606
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,070
Bilian.

607
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,660
