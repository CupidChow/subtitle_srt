=Episode 2=

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,830
Your Highness, I was wrong.

28
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,940
Can you please spare me?

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,550
There are still three days left.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,990
I promise, you won't get married, okay?

31
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,140
What?

32
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,244
What nonsense are you talking about?

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,630
In Xilin,

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,300
if you don't get married before you die,

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,860
you'll become a lonely ghost.

36
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,470
Your Highness, that's not what I meant.

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,190
Then what do you mean?

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,140
I mean...

39
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,670
Look.

40
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,270
If you kill me,

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,700
you'll only get a corpse.

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,180
But if you let me go,

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,390
what if I succeed?

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,580
More friends, more paths to survival.

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,390
Your Highness, I know,

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,300
you're determined
not to marry Prince Jin.

47
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:23,644
Don't worry.

48
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,066
I, Qiao Manman,
will definitely help you with this.

49
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,070
Just give me a chance,

50
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,020
and I promise

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,460
to go through fire and water

52
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,866
to help you complete this task.

53
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,460
Fine.

54
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,580
I'll give you another chance.

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,390
Originally,

56
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,420
I was going to use 100,000 taels of gold

57
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
as hush money.

58
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:45,740
Not killing you.

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,860
100,000 taels of gold.

60
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,390
Hush money?

61
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,580
Yuetao,

62
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:52,700
see the guest out.

63
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,460
Alright.

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,390
Ms. Qiao, please get up.

65
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:57,140
Your Highness, 100,000 taels of gold.

66
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,050
Why don't you give me 10,000
as a deposit first?

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,180
Farewell.

68
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,444
Your Highness.

69
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,169
Your Highness.

70
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,900
Isn't this the fish
you sent to His Majesty

71
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:18,644
a few days ago?

72
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,070
Why...

73
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Father probably thought

74
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,460
this fish wasn't a valuable species,

75
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,950
so he returned it.

76
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:27,070
How could His Majesty...

77
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,860
Recently, Prince Jin casually drew
a painting and sent it into the palace,

78
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,270
and he treasured it.

79
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,070
You painstakingly
searched for this fish.

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,270
Prince Jin is my brother.

81
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,230
It's only natural for my father

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,733
to care for his disabled son.

83
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:48,230
It thought it was valuable,

84
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,180
but in the end,

85
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,830
it was not welcomed.

86
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,550
We always had to find a way to live.

87
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:13,650
(Respect Teaching and Diligent Learning)

88
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,580
What did you do last night?

89
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,550
I sketched a portrait of the teacher.

90
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,380
Sit properly, and put it away quickly.

91
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,180
Stand up.

92
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,380
Good day, Teacher Ji Mo.

93
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:44,470
Good day, students.

94
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,500
Please sit.

95
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,800
Today, we are going to learn

96
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,380
"The Analects".

97
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,350
Students!

98
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,860
You shall not violate
the rules of the academy.

99
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,910
What rules?

100
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,550
The desk and the podium

101
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,790
must be kept 3 meters apart.

102
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,150
The academy is run by my family.

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,230
My rules

104
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,380
are the academy's rules.

105
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,180
Alright.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,260
Yuanxiang,

107
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,620
sit down.

108
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,260
We'll continue with the class.

109
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,380
No...

110
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
(Qiao Manman,)

111
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,466
(look at the mess
you've gotten me into!)

112
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,800
(Everything Guild)

113
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,060
Ji Mo.

114
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,500
Mr. Ji.

115
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,710
Mr. Ji.

116
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,755
Stop shouting, I'm here.

117
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,150
Where did you go?

118
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,420
Where else could I go?

119
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,740
There's no customer here.

120
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,860
So I took a nap.

121
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, right, I have something to tell you.

122
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,060
No, you listen to me first.

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,150
I'm in trouble.

124
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,177
You've known about Pei Er's matter?

125
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:25,977
It's not that.

126
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,300
I failed to
break off the engagement.

127
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,190
Prince Aliya is getting married
in three days.

128
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,860
I've already promised her,

129
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,260
so I can't back out now.

130
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,860
No, wait.

131
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,300
What did you say? Pei Er?

132
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:40,910
What happened to Pei Er again?

133
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,790
Things are truly unpredictable.

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,133
I didn't expect that Madam Pei

135
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,711
would actually be interested in Pei Er.

136
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,300
Now that Pei Da passed away,

137
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,380
there are no obstacles.

138
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:50,420
Not only did she take your money,

139
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,620
but she also exposed your entire plan.

140
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,910
I've told you.

141
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,350
Don't take this order.

142
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:56,488
But you wouldn't listen.

143
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,990
What are we going to do

144
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,288
when Pei Er comes looking for us?

145
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,670
With a wife like this,

146
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,355
no wonder Pei Da prefers to be dead.

147
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,110
Then tell me,

148
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,590
what should we do next?

149
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,740
How about we run?

150
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,350
Run?

151
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,600
You're going to abandon Everything Guild
that your mother left for you?

152
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,670
We can come back
when everything is settled.

153
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,088
Under heaven,
everything is His Majesty's land.

154
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,820
You've offended the royal families
of two countries at the same time.

155
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,030
Ms. Qiao, you're truly skilled.

156
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,180
Where else can we run to?

157
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,350
So, what you're saying is,

158
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:36,088
I have to take care of this anyhow,
right?

159
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,230
I didn't say anything.

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,110
Forget it.

161
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,420
You're useless at critical moments.

162
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,022
You're nothing compared to Ji Mo.

163
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,110
Still counting on Ji Mo?

164
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,844
For such a small amount of money,

165
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,990
you knew he had gynophobia,

166
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,230
but you still arranged for him
to teach at a girls' academy.

167
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,910
He gets sick as soon as
he goes to the academy.

168
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,990
He is half-dead every day.

169
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,260
I think his illness

170
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,470
probably can't be cured.

171
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,250
(Respect Teaching and Diligent Learning)

172
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,590
Teacher Ji Mo,
why are you in such a hurry?

173
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,711
Where are you going?

174
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,470
Teacher Ji Mo,

175
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,380
where are you going?

176
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,044
Teacher Ji Mo, where are you going?

177
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
What... What are you doing?

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,790
Class is over.
Of course, I'm heading home.

179
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,300
Don't rush, Teacher Ji Mo.

180
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,150
I didn't quite understand

181
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,940
today's lesson.

182
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,260
How about

183
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,620
you explain it to me properly?

184
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,470
Exactly!

185
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,380
Let's do it together.

186
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,230
What's wrong with explaining it again?

187
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,470
Teacher Ji Mo, don't decline.

188
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,990
Let's go.

189
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,260
So much trouble.

190
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,950
What's so scary about having a meal?

191
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,260
You're going too far!

192
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,070
I'll fight you!

193
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,430
Run!

194
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,540
Don't run!

195
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Stop chasing me!

196
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,230
Stop chasing me!

197
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,560
(Everything Guild)
That's how things are.

198
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,666
Let's hear everyone's opinions
and pool our wisdom.

199
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,133
Are there any good ideas?

200
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,140
Well, there's a way.

201
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,780
You have a way?

202
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:00,830
You're a grown-up now.

203
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,711
Still being chased by a group of
female students all over the street.

204
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,470
Mr. Ji, can you stop interrupting?

205
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,070
Fine.

206
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,350
Hurry up and tell me.

207
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,380
This matter is a bit complicated.

208
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,140
Let me explain it to you first.

209
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,780
This bowl represents the Xilin Kingdom.

210
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,710
This bowl represents Luzhao Kingdom.

211
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,310
This is Her Highness.

212
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,780
This is you.

213
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,466
Now they're all mixed up.

214
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,350
Can you still tell

215
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,860
which one is you
and which one is Her Highness?

216
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,430
How can I tell?

217
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,140
Ji Mo! Ji Mo!

218
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,990
What does this mean?

219
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,540
He is so smart.

220
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,500
As long as the method is right,

221
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,620
I can secretly switch her.

222
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,620
(Ningyuan Inn)

223
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,220
(Topographic Map of Luzhao Kingdom)

224
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,933
There are only three routes
from here to Prince Jin's Residence.

225
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,990
I will find a way

226
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,710
to block

227
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,688
(Topographic Map of Luzhao Kingdom, Inn)
the other two routes.

228
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,830
Hurry up!

229
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,380
Three, two, one. Start crying.

230
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,620
Let's go.

231
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,660
(Royal weddings)

232
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,977
(emphasize auspicious times
and auspicious locations.)

233
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,020
According to my arrangement,

234
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,260
they will definitely take this path.

235
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,970
(Topographic Map of Luzhao Kingdom)
The path to our success.

236
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:49,310
Once I force the wedding procession
onto this only path,

237
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:51,830
I will prepare another palanquin
and park it beside you.

238
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,540
(Tea)

239
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,110
(Then,)

240
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,830
(I will find someone to create chaos.)

241
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,230
Old Ji is right.

242
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,830
Smash the palanquin!

243
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,830
Yes!

244
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,540
Robbery! Run!

245
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,740
Your Highness.

246
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:06,422
Your Highness.

247
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,044
You'll get out of the palanquin

248
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,660
and get into the one I prepared.

249
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,620
Then,

250
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,020
you can go far away.

251
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,430
Far,

252
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,470
far away.

253
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,900
Far? You wish!

254
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,590
When they reach Prince Jin's Residence,

255
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,555
there's no bride
getting out of the palanquin.

256
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,470
Then we're exposed!

257
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,860
Who said there's no bride?

258
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,140
We are switching.

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,540
The original bride is not there,

260
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,911
we'll have to substitute
with a new bride.

261
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:34,155
So, Yuetao, you are the new bride.

262
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,740
I will put on the wedding dress
and wait for you on that road.

263
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,500
Your Highness, you get into
the palanquin and leave.

264
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,622
We'll see how the chaos goes,

265
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,590
and we shall have a short moment.

266
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,830
Yuetao, you'll put on my wedding dress

267
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,020
and get into the palanquin.

268
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,830
And I will disguise myself
as someone creating chaos and escape.

269
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,710
And, Yuetao, you won't have
to worry about not getting married.

270
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,310
And you'll marry a big shot.

271
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,110
This method might work.

272
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,260
But Prince Jin saw you previously.

273
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,430
Don't worry.

274
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:01,900
I was employed by Your Highness

275
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,620
to cancel the engagement.

276
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,549
If Yuetao can't make it
at the Prince Jin's Residence,

277
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,530
she can always return to Xilin
to visit her parents

278
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,780
on the pretext of missing them.

279
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:11,140
Well, it's a long journey home.

280
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,230
If anything happens
on your way back home...

281
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,900
You don't have to return
to Luzhao Kingdom again.

282
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,140
Ladies,

283
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,140
is my plan perfect?

284
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,230
Ms. Qiao,

285
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,620
if I manage to escape this time,

286
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,760
I will definitely repay you handsomely
in the future.

287
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:31,844
Don't worry, Your Highness.

288
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,110
Everything is under my control.

289
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,990
(Three Days Later)

290
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:44,326
(Inn)

291
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,020
Your Highness,

292
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,310
is Ms. Qiao reliable?

293
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,710
She won't break her promise, right?

294
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:05,590
Yuetao, stop talking.

295
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,900
I'm already nervous.

296
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:08,590
We've already come this far,

297
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,990
so we have to believe her.

298
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,230
Okay.

299
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,540
Yuetao, hurry and get down.

300
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:14,800
Let me know when we're there.

301
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,780
Alright.

302
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,500
(Tea)
Put on a good show later!

303
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,780
Make sure to mess it up for me.

304
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,900
No problem!

305
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,230
Hey.

306
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,500
And you too.

307
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,260
Thanks.

308
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,620
Everyone gets a share.

309
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,620
Will there be any danger?

310
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,070
Danger?

311
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,590
How can there be danger?

312
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,500
Listen,

313
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,900
they definitely won't take action.

314
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,110
If they do,

315
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,140
you run.

316
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Okay?

317
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,070
You look energetic.

318
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,140
Congratulations, Prince Jin.

319
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,500
Congratulations.

320
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,110
Thank you.

321
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,311
Congratulations, Prince Jin.

322
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,777
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

323
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,310
Prince Jin,

324
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,310
the original wedding route is blocked.

325
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,620
I knew it.
Make sure to keep Her Highness safe.

326
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,044
Someone will try to harm Her Highness
on her way here.

327
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,380
Get to Her Highness now.

328
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,620
If anything happens,

329
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
kill them.

330
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,540
Yes.

331
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:14,500
Thank you. Come to Everything Guild
to find me anytime you need.

332
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,140
Thank you.

333
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,590
Come. Hurry up.

334
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,780
(Tea)
Get moving.

335
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,577
Hurry up. Let's go.

336
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,430
Coming. Let's go.

337
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,660
Yuetao.

338
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,830
Where are we now?

339
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,911
Your Highness,
the tea stall is right in front.

340
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,900
Stop.

341
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,350
Stop.

342
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,020
What is it?

343
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,100
Her Highness is thirsty.
She wants some water.

344
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,070
We're almost there.
Why does she want to drink now?

345
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,590
Hu Ersa,

346
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm thirsty.

347
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,800
Do you want me to die of thirst?

348
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,020
Hurry up.

349
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,244
How is it?

350
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,990
Just as we agreed. Don't worry.

351
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,500
Everything is under my control.

352
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,660
Old Ji is so unreliable.

353
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,333
Why aren't the people he sent here yet?

354
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,350
Long live Your Majesty!

355
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,900
Long live Father!

356
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:29,780
Rise.

357
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,430
Thank you, Your Majesty.

358
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,310
Thank you, Father.

359
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,590
Everyone, today is not a court session.

360
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,140
It's Jin's wedding day.

361
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,900
Please be my guest.

362
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

363
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,350
Prince Jin.

364
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,310
Why do you look sad?

365
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,310
Today is your wedding day.

366
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,070
Is there anything unsatisfactory

367
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,860
about this marriage arranged by Yunnuo?

368
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,020
Father, everything is perfect.

369
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:01,644
This is a gift from your mother

370
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,070
to you and Princess Aliya.

371
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,540
One lifetime, and one pair of people.

372
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,230
I wish for us to be
truly matched in virtue,

373
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,733
and to walk hand-in-hand together
through life.

374
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,540
Mother!

375
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,500
Go away.

376
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,390
Mother!

377
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,300
Mother!

378
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,060
Jin!

379
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,390
Jin!

380
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,740
Jin!

381
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,230
Jin!

382
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:27,990
Jin!

383
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,470
Jin!

384
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,710
Jin!

385
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Mother's skill

386
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,230
is incredible.

387
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,060
Father.

388
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,470
Please rest in the main hall.

389
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,100
Cheer up.

390
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,740
Old Ji is right.

391
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,390
Smash the palanquin!

392
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,100
Yes!

393
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,866
Someone is trying to snatch the bride!

394
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,710
Someone is trying to snatch the bride!
Robbery!

395
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,150
Robbery!

396
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,377
Someone is snatching the bride!

397
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,430
Do you know whose palanquin is this?

398
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,430
How dare you.

399
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,540
Who cares!

400
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,910
Everyone, grab your weapons!

401
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,340
Hurry up!

402
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,430
Take the clothes. Run quickly!

403
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,500
Ms. Qiao...

404
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,155
I guess there's a misunderstanding.

405
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,740
We'll settle the score
with that girl another day.

406
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,060
Run.

407
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,190
Quick! Go!

408
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,020
Let's go.

409
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,133
Hurry up and get ready to leave.

410
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,533
We can't miss the auspicious time.

411
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,260
Hu Ersa is here.

412
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,260
Ms. Qiao, is this part of your plan?

413
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,222
No. I didn't expect Pei Er
to be such a coward.

414
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:07,822
He ran before the fight even started.

415
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,500
Exactly. Thanks to the General.

416
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,780
Do something!

417
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,260
I'm thinking.

418
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,910
Again!

419
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,260
Run.

420
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,230
Run.

421
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,910
Are these your people too?

422
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,820
Yes.

423
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:29,540
These are my people.

424
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,260
How can there be two brides?

425
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,020
Are these your people too?

426
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:41,466
Kill them both.

427
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,780
Your Highness, are you okay?

428
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,820
Your Highness, run...

429
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,230
Run.

430
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,870
Ms. Qiao.

431
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,260
Thank you so much.

432
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,950
I will definitely
repay you in the future.

433
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,190
Yuetao, take care.

434
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,630
Your Highness, run!

435
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,950
Ms. Qiao.

436
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,670
Ms. Qiao.

437
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,288
Protect Her Highness!

438
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,100
Ms. Qiao.

439
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,910
Quickly help me
to the carriage and change.

440
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:56,020
Let's get changed.

441
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:31,630
Protect Her Highness!

442
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,230
Yes!

443
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,540
Hurry up!

444
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,500
Ms. Qiao, get up and get changed.

445
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,644
We're running out of time.

446
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,300
Wake up!

447
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,990
Aliya.

448
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,820
Aliya, are you okay?

449
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,150
Aliya.

450
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,740
General Hu, Her Highness is okay.

451
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:03,430
What are you doing inside?

452
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:05,990
I'm protecting Her Highness.

453
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,340
Okay.

454
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,430
Thank you, Yuetao.

455
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:10,466
Get out of the palanquin.

456
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,488
We're ready to set off.

457
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:11,780
Okay.

458
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,150
What to do?

459
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,540
What to do?

460
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,580
What to do?

461
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,430
General Hu.

462
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:23,777
Encountering such a thing

463
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:24,820
during a wedding day

464
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:26,020
is inauspicious.

465
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,150
Shall we return to the Inn

466
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,820
to rest?

467
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,422
We're not in a hurry, so choose
another day to hold the ceremony.

468
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,300
Another day?

469
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,470
I wonder if this is
Prince Jin's intention

470
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,580
or His Majesty's.

471
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,190
Are you trying to
humiliate the Xilin Kingdom?

472
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,100
General Hu,

473
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,340
you misunderstood.

474
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,150
Well then,

475
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,580
let's set off.

476
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:58,990
Go.

477
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:22,310
(Prince Jin's Residence)

478
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,060
Ms. Qiao.

479
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,430
Ms. Qiao.

480
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,630
Wake up.

481
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,340
We're almost there.

482
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:37,610
(Prince Jin's Residence)

483
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,060
You're not well.

484
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,340
Let me help you

485
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,230
to get Her Highness.

486
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,950
Thank you, Yunnuo.

487
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,824
♪It's destined that we cannot be close♪

488
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,723

494
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,990
Finally, I got rid of those people.

495
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:23,340
I didn't expect Ms.Qiao
to be so brave and resourceful.

496
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,390
I finally escaped.

497
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,190
Why isn't Manman here yet?

498
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,020
According to the plan,

499
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,780
she should be here.

500
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,150
I wonder

501
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,780
how are Yuetao and Ms. Qiao now.

502
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,020
Are you talking about Manman?

503
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,780
Buddy!

504
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,260
Buddy!

505
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,870
Buddy, wake up.

506
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,020
Buddy!

507
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,910
Help!

508
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,910
Help!

509
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,500
You're awake.

510
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,780
Buddy, you're awake.

511
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,670
Are... Are you okay?

512
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Who are you?

513
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:17,222
I'm Ji Mo, from Everything Guild.

514
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,580
Aren't you talking about Manman?

515
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,230
Manman?

516
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,670
Who's that?

517
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,910
Buddy!

518
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,540
(The aftereffect of
Xilin Kingdom's drug)

519
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,670
(is so strong.)

520
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,990
(Prince Jin?)

521
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,190
(Oh no!)

522
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,022
Your Highness, what are you doing?

523
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,470
To drink nuptial wine.

524
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,230
After that,

525
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,190
we'll get undressed and go to bed.

526
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,230
I'm having some trouble with my legs.

527
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,430
Can you...

528
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,630
No.

529
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:54,709
I haven't even said
what I'm going to do.

530
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,500
See no evil,

531
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,060
hear no evil,

532
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,780
and speak no evil!

533
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,630
Evil?

534
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:58,870
Um...

535
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,060
Your Highness.

536
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,060
According to our customs,

537
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,190
we don't use cups for nuptial wine.

538
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,600
We drink from the pot.

539
00:28:11,822 --> 00:28:13,260
(I've been out since I was seven.)

540
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,109
(I wouldn't boast about other things,)

541
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,644
(but I've never been afraid of anyone
when it comes to drinking.)

542
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,150
(As long as I put you down,)

543
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,100
(everything will be easy.)

544
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,250
(Everything Guild)

545
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,260
Dad!

546
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,150
Help me.

547
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,740
You're back.

548
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,430
Dad!

549
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,230
Oh, my son.

550
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,020
Who is this you're carrying?

551
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,580
Where did Qiao Manman go?

552
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,630
I have no idea.

553
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,730
Don't worry about it for now.

554
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:35,720
Dad, take a look at him.

555
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,470
This...

556
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,020
Put him down.

557
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,670
Over here.

558
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,260
I'm holding him.

559
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,670
Let go.

560
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,580
Amazing.

561
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,260
Your gynophobia is cured.

562
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:53,950
You actually carried a woman back.

563
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,820
Woman?

564
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,020
Son.

565
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,580
Aliya.

566
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,500
Oh my God.

567
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,990
This isn't bringing a woman back.

568
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,300
This is bringing back

569
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,910
a Princess!

570
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,950
If you're here,

571
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,780
then where is Manman?

572
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,500
No, I can't drink anymore.

573
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,630
I can't drink anymore.

574
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,780
Don't come over.

575
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,100
Go away!

576
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
What are you doing?

577
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,580
I bought a new dagger
and I wanted to show you.

578
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,710
What is wrong with you?

579
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,150
You are crazy.

580
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:47,230
Aliya, please forgive my rudeness.

581
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,300
Actually, I know what you
were thinking when we met

582
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:51,511
during the Lantern Festival.

583
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:52,820
Neither of us intended to marry,

584
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,470
but now we can only make the best of it.

585
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,260
I will find a way to help you leave
when I have the chance.

586
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:01,444
(Although he said
we'd make the best of it,)

587
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,580
(he's treating me as the real princess.)

588
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,910
(If I'm exposed,)

589
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,577
(and he calls off the marriage,)

590
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,430
(I'll be the one who got beheaded!)

591
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,870
Since we must share a room now,

592
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,340
please take note of the following.

593
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,340
First,

594
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,780
it's not my fault to be this handsome,

595
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,190
but it is your fault
if you fall in love with me.

596
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,088
So, please, don't fall in love with me.

597
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,710
Next,

598
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,820
we must have our own space

599
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,933
and respect each other.

600
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,639
After the maid leaves the residence,

601
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,880
we'll sleep in a separate room.

602
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,060
Last but not least,

603
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,670
you'll sleep on the couch
and I'll sleep on the bed.

604
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,500
Get up now.

605
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,511
Hey!

606
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:39,266
Aliya!

607
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,500
Aliya!

608
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,820
Aliya!

609
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,355
Your Highness.

610
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,200
I had the chance
to force Her Highness to return.

611
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,060
But Jiufeng came with a team of men

612
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,533
and ruined the plan.

613
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,711
Please punish me, Your Highness.

614
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,020
Luckily Brother

615
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,150
protected Princess Aliya this time.

616
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,780
Otherwise, Mother
would have made a grave mistake.

617
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:23,311
I will send people
to investigate again tomorrow.

618
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:24,230
She is out there.

619
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,022
There's nothing you can do.

620
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,710
Things happen.

621
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,260
Let it be.

622
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,710
I'm incompetent.

623
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,990
I'll take twenty strokes

624
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,190
as punishment.

625
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,060
Fifty.

626
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,910
Yes.

627
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,870
What exactly happened

628
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:50,733
when I asked you to escort Her Highness?

629
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,300
I have no idea.

630
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,266
When I arrived, there was already
a group of people in black.

631
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,950
And there was someone

632
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,580
as strong as me.

633
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,430
They failed.

634
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,950
Twice.

635
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,190
The mastermind knew

636
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,100
that we were prepared.

637
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:12,155
They will not come after
us again so easily.

638
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,540
It seems that for now,

639
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,230
we can only wait and see.

640
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:20,780
(Benevolent and Kind)

641
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,150
No way.

642
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,300
I must escape.

643
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,622
Otherwise, my identity will be exposed
sooner or later.

644
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,540
Who are you?

645
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,990
How did you get in

646
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,340
without a sound?

647
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:46,044
Where is Yuetao?

648
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Yuetao.

649
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,190
I'm here.

650
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,955
Yes, Your Highness.

651
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,340
I'm Chuncan.

652
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,710
I'm the Head Maid in the palace.

653
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,390
His Majesty is worried that you might

654
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,000
not adapt well to
the Luzhao Kingdom.

655
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,580
So he arranged for me to come here

656
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,950
to help out with you.

657
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,177
Head Maid?

658
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,830
You may call me Madam Chuncan

659
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,990
just like His Highness.

660
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,660
His Highness has done showering.

661
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,270
Your Highness,
you may bathe and change too.

662
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:35,533
Madam Chuncan.

663
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:37,879
How's the Prince Jin's Residence
on a usual day?

664
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,590
How many people are there?
How many guards?

665
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,660
Because of His Highness's leg problem,

666
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,700
he is a very reserved person.

667
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,990
So there aren't many maids

668
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
or guards in Prince Jin's Residence.

669
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,540
However,

670
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,540
there was an accident
on your route yesterday.

671
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,310
His Majesty is worried about the safety.

672
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,390
So he added a large number of guards,
temporarily.

673
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,060
(It seems escaping)

674
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:01,950
(the Prince Jin's Residence
won't be easy.)

675
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,430
Your Highness, don't worry.

676
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,100
I've arranged

677
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,470
everything for you in the Residence.

678
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:12,000
You are the divine physician
of Xilin Kingdom.

679
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,060
You married His Highness

680
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,620
and helped to treat his legs.

681
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,700
This is truly a blessing for him.

682
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,830
(I don't know anything about medicine.)

683
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,990
(Divine physician?)

684
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,750
(Treating His Highness's legs?)

685
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,750
Am I dressing up

686
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,350
to meet His Majesty?

687
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,830
Her Highness, His Majesty is usually
busy with his official duties.

688
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:35,310
You can't meet him without a summons.

689
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,060
After the third day of marriage,

690
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,910
you can enter the palace
and meet His Majesty.

691
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,580
You're now married
into the royal family,

692
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,990
you should address
His Majesty as Father.

693
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,100
Right, on the third day,

694
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,500
General Hu Ersa
will depart for Xilin Kingdom.

695
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:54,270
At that time, both you and His Highness

696
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,020
will see him off.

697
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:58,050
Besides the gift
prepared by His Highness,

698
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,140
do you want to review

699
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,470
and add some items?

700
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,910
Hu Ersa...

701
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,700
