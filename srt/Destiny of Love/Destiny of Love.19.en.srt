=Episode 19=

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,580
(Prince Jin led his troops
to the southern front)

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,830
(and risked his life
to defend our homeland.)

29
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,670
(The world may have its limits,)

30
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,580
(but longing knows no end.)

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,300
(It's all because our love runs deep.)

32
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,580
(When I return home,
I'll see my beloved again.)

33
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:16,960
(Liuyun Mansion)

34
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,377
Your Highness.

35
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,111
Your Highness.

36
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,510
I've found out that Qiao Manman's mother

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,088
was Empress Yan's cousin in Xilin.

38
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,550
She was the betrothed

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
to Qiao Yuanzhi.

40
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,666
But Qiao Yuanzhi was
deceived by Xilin spies

41
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,180
and committed treason.

42
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,244
His Majesty personally
issued the death sentence.

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,444
But for old time's sake,

44
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,180
he secretly imprisoned him in the palace.

45
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:49,066
Manman's cloud-marked locket

46
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,990
must've been a gift
from Empress Yan to her mother.

47
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,111
If that's the case,

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,177
let's just go with the flow.

49
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,022
We'll let them reunite.

50
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:03,217
(Hanyuan Hall)

51
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,733
Manman.

52
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,044
It's been a while.

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,860
Fate must have brought us together.

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,950
Your Highness,

55
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,888
I'm your sister-in-law.

56
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,555
Please watch how you speak.

57
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,670
But the girl I've been thinking about

58
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,022
is not my sister-in-law.

59
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,088
Your brother is
risking his life in battles.

60
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,830
Yet, you have time to flirt with me?

61
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,177
Manman, my brother
is both smart and strong.

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,420
He will make it through

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,577
and come back safely.

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,550
But you

65
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,911
are all alone in his residence

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,230
with no guards by your side.

67
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,444
That really worries me.

68
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,110
That's kind of you.

69
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:44,950
Our residence is heavily guarded.

70
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,900
You need not worry.

71
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,180
Manman.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,590
Your Highness,
I have an urgent matter to tend to.

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,666
Please step aside.

74
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:55,950
Goodbye.

75
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,670
(This bamboo dragonfly...)

76
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,740
(It's not quite the same
as the ones His Highness carries.)

77
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,910
(This place is so secluded.)

78
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,180
(Why are there
so many bamboo dragonflies?)

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,420
(Could someone be living here?)

80
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,590
Sir.

81
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,755
I just found this outside.

82
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,740
Did you make it?

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,500
(The scar...)

84
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,300
Manman, just wait a little longer.

85
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,910
I'll fix the bamboo dragonfly soon.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,820
Then, you can play with it again.

87
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,180
Dad, your hand...

88
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,940
Good girl.

89
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,644
Dad, let me dress it for you.

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,740
Alright.

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,940
Good child.

92
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Little girl, this isn't
a place you should be.

93
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,977
Leave, now.

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,940
Sir!

95
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,622
How did you get that scar on your hand?

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,977
I got it long ago
while making bamboo dragonflies.

97
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,940
I can make them too.

98
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,670
I often hurt my hands making them.

99
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,500
You know how to make them too?

100
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,500
My father taught me when I was little.

101
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,740
Sir.

102
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,488
Who did you use to make them for?

103
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,590
My daughter.

104
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,044
When she was still very young,

105
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,670
I had to leave her.

106
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,755
So...

107
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,670
Do you miss her?

108
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,977
Of course I do.

109
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,620
I had no choice but to leave her
to keep her safe.

110
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,820
Now, I've lost my freedom.

111
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,230
I can't go looking for her.

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,511
I wonder if she and her mother are well.

113
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,133
I failed both of them.

114
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,420
Sir.

115
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,244
Do you know Qiao Yuanzhi?

116
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,990
I'm Qiao Manman.

117
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,380
Qiao Yuanzhi is my father.

118
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,466
You're Qiao...

119
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
You're really Manman?

120
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,860
Manman...

121
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,260
I am Qiao Yuanzhi.

122
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,150
I am your father!

123
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,260
Dad, I knew I didn't mistake you.

124
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,820
Dad,

125
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,940
why are you here?

126
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,670
Why didn't you come home?

127
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,620
I've been searching
for you for years, Dad!

128
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,888
It'll be fine.

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,670
Let me open the door. We'll go home.

130
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,500
Manman!

131
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,620
Listen to me.

132
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,230
I'm not allowed to leave.

133
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,790
Don't tell anyone

134
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,550
you came here.

135
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,333
Why not, Dad?

136
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,180
Let's go home, please.

137
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,777
My girl, listen to me.

138
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,466
You need to leave.

139
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,888
Don't worry, Dad.

140
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,844
I'll find a way to bring you home.

141
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,460
(Everything Guild)

142
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,755
Manman, you're back!

143
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,940
Manman!

144
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,380
What happened?

145
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,822
Did someone bully you?

146
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,500
Who did it? I'll settle the score!

147
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,660
Mr. Ji.

148
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,230
I found my father.

149
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,190
What? You found your father?

150
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,533
How is that possible?

151
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,230
It's really him!

152
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,260
Your father is alive!

153
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,620
So where is he now?

154
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,200
Why didn't he come home with you?

155
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,644
He's locked away
in a small room in the palace.

156
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,540
He kept warning me

157
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:08,133
not to tell anyone I saw him.

158
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,590
Mr. Ji, what's really going on here?

159
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,222
Your father, Qiao Yuanzhi,

160
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,190
was the greatest mind in Luzhao.

161
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,800
He led the Six Ministries.

162
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,590
That's why we never told you

163
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,740
the truth about your past.

164
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,500
Your father is a convict.

165
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,350
Your mother hid the truth
to protect you.

166
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,740
As for the Golden Box,

167
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
your father left it to you
as a keepsake.

168
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,020
But,

169
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,955
you actually found him.

170
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,155
Even though he's still alive,

171
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,111
he's been confined all these years.

172
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:04,990
It must've been so hard on him.

173
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,620
Manman, don't be so upset.

174
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,830
His Majesty probably spared his life

175
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,740
due to his remarkable talent.

176
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,070
Manman.

177
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,740
Since you've found him,

178
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,088
we need to figure out
how to get him out of there.

179
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:26,280
(Everything Guild)

180
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,540
Fu Chengjin.

181
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,660
I found my father.

182
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,470
But I can't rescue him.

183
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,830
If only you were here...

184
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,380
I peeled all the lotus seeds for you.

185
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,950
Then, help me

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,470
wrap them up with those four.

187
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,470
Got it.

188
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:00,622
This one's the most important.

189
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:01,888
Alright.

190
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,500
What's wrong?

191
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,110
It's nothing.

192
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,500
I've just been
feeling a bit anxious lately.

193
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,190
Be careful, alright?

194
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,111
Your Highness.

195
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,830
Come in.

196
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,133
Your Highness.

197
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,111
Guihu says Prince Yunnuo
wants to see you.

198
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,540
Tell him I'm not going.

199
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,020
Guihu also said

200
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,470
if you refuse,

201
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,380
I must say it's about the man
who makes the bamboo dragonflies.

202
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:34,911
He insists that you go.

203
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,660
You may leave now.

204
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,190
Yes.

205
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,310
Yuetao, I have a bad feeling.

206
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,177
I need to go.

207
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,488
I'll go with you.

208
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,822
Manman, you're here.

209
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,230
Prince Yunnuo, just get to the point.

210
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,230
You said this was about

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,310
the man who makes
the bamboo dragonflies.

212
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,111
What exactly do you mean?

213
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,377
Someone from the past wants to see you.

214
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,620
Manman!

215
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,190
Manman!

216
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,733
Move!

217
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,470
You...

218
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,310
Princess Consort Jin is tired.

219
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
Let her get some rest.

220
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,780
I...

221
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:31,866
Your Highness.

222
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,950
Isn't it improper to keep Qiao Yuanzhi

223
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,244
in the residence
with Princess Consort Jin?

224
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:37,844
I don't think so.

225
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,190
Manman's biggest wish
since she was a child

226
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,066
was to see her father.

227
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,020
I did what Fu Chengjin

228
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,155
failed to do.

229
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,140
Then, what is

230
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,377
our next step?

231
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:57,600
Fu Chengjin cares deeply for Manman.

232
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,666
I'm going to marry her.

233
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,711
If that news reaches the southern front,

234
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,830
as the commander,

235
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:04,620
he can't return without Father's decree.

236
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,022
But if he returns,
we can charge him with treason.

237
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,350
I'd like to see

238
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,310
how far he's willing to go for Manman.

239
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,590
Dad...

240
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,590
Manman!

241
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,470
Dad!

242
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,266
Dad!

243
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,177
Let me take a look at you.

244
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,590
Dad, come here and sit down!

245
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,660
Just sit, please.

246
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,540
Sit down.

247
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,044
They didn't hurt you, did they?

248
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,900
Prince Yunnuo treated me with respect.

249
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,200
The others wouldn't dare act out of line.

250
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,310
But they're using me
as leverage against you.

251
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,020
I'd rather die in that case.

252
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,070
Dad,

253
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,422
don't say that.

254
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,860
Once Prince Jin returns,

255
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,110
we'll figure something out.

256
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,422
Tell me about this Prince Jin.

257
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,710
He's wise and broad-minded.

258
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,733
He treats me well.

259
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,310
He always protects me.

260
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,430
Then,

261
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,430
I can die without regrets.

262
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,230
Dad...

263
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,780
It took me ages to find you.

264
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:35,066
Stop talking about dying all the time.

265
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,830
Prince Yunnuo brought me here.

266
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,488
Sooner or later, people will find out.

267
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,780
But I get to see you before I die.

268
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,540
I have no more regrets.

269
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:57,800
Dad.

270
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,230
You have to believe me.

271
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,380
We'll be alright.

272
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,860
Good girl.

273
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,955
Manman,

274
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,070
how have you been lately?

275
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,380
You're missing Manman.

276
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,911
I've never missed anyone
this much before.

277
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,070
I believe Manman is missing you too.

278
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,844
Fate works in strange ways, doesn't it?

279
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,900
I fell for the fake princess,

280
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,400
while the real princess
fell for her brother.

281
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,860
Round and round it goes.

282
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,990
We're one big family now.

283
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,710
Then, I should thank you

284
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,950
for not marrying Aliya.

285
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,140
We need to win this battle.

286
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,710
Aliya is waiting for you to return too.

287
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,070
(Your Highness, I miss you.)

288
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,866
Your Majesty.

289
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,310
General Hu, have a seat.

290
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,990
May I ask why I've been summoned?

291
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,600
It's nothing urgent.

292
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,466
I just wanted to chat with you

293
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,244
about Princess Aliya.

294
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,866
I'll get straight to the point.

295
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,900
Let's not waste time.

296
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,990
I'm sure you've realized by now

297
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,755
the current
Princess Consort Jin isn't Aliya.

298
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,155
General Hu, there's no need to worry.

299
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,150
I don't intend to punish anyone.

300
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,577
As for the matter of the false princess,

301
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,630
I didn't notice.

302
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:19,500
I just want you to know

303
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,710
that everything I promised Xilin

304
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,488
will be delivered.

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,230
Please, when you return,

306
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,780
give this to your lord.

307
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,190
Once he reads it...

308
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:34,990
(To the Lord of Xilin)

309
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,430
He'll understand exactly what I mean.

310
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,340
And you continue to indulge
the false princess?

311
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,933
What's the harm in that?

312
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,780
Let the next generation
create their own fortune.

313
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:54,000
I've no interest
in worrying about everything.

314
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,230
Why should you cross the line,
General Hu?

315
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,260
Come on, drink.

316
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,222
General, why are you so angry?

317
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:29,022
Fu Chengjin has been
at the front lines for months,

318
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,300
and in all that time,

319
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,390
you've made no move at all.

320
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,111
You've even taken Qiao Manman in.

321
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,230
What are you up to?

322
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,580
General Hu Ersa,
your sources are impressive.

323
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,340
Even a secret like that

324
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,844
couldn't elude you.

325
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,150
Spare me the talk.

326
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,622
Fu Chengjin is winning
on the front lines.

327
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,260
When he returns,

328
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:50,000
he'll be named crown prince.

329
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:51,060
When that happens,

330
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,955
will there still be
a place for you at court?

331
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,950
I think

332
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,740
you've let lust cloud your judgment!

333
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,100
The palace has been
full of happy news lately.

334
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,066
Even my father is overjoyed.

335
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,260
But joy and sorrow

336
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,711
can both cut deep.

337
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,670
What if

338
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,540
bad news comes from Prince Jin's side?

339
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,150
I wonder if my father

340
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,500
can handle the shock.

341
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:21,870
You mean "what if"...

342
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,910
Exactly.

343
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,333
There's no telling
what could happen to him.

344
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,540
As the saying goes,

345
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,260
"The winner takes the throne."

346
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:31,990
If he doesn't make it to the end,

347
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,390
everything he's built

348
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,488
is just paving the way for you and me.

349
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,740
Very well.

350
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,950
Looks like partnering with you

351
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,740
won't leave me disappointed.

352
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,150
I was too rash.

353
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,230
I'm just a rough man.

354
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:53,740
Don't take it to heart.

355
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,630
Come.

356
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:58,300
(Liuyun Mansion)

357
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,666
What's going on?

358
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,190
What happened?

359
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,190
What's going on?

360
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,990
It's nothing.

361
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,260
He didn't do anything.

362
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,670
He just tried to force me to marry him.

363
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,740
Marry him?

364
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,630
Is he out of his mind?

365
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,260
In the end, he's just a pitiful.

366
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,777
Pitiful?

367
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,710
You pity him?

368
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,933
Why don't you pity yourself for once?

369
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,355
I've made up my mind.

370
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,780
I'd rather die than marry him.

371
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,630
Yuetao.

372
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,910
If anything ever happens to me,

373
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,630
take care of Everything Guild for me.

374
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,060
Don't say that.

375
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,990
You will be safe.

376
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,780
I mean what if!

377
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:49,060
Everything is ready.

378
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,260
Let's go.

379
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,190
Go where?

380
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,630
You'll see.

381
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,150
Trust me. That's a big surprise for you.

382
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,620
(Everything Guild)

383
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:25,880
(Everything Guild)

384
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,230
What do you want?

385
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,260
Be patient.

386
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,430
I'm here

387
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,100
to restore your true identity,

388
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,430
and propose to you, my future consort.

389
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:41,780
Come.

390
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,222
Princess!

391
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,470
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:04,333
I didn't tell you she has amnesia
so you wouldn't worry.

393
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:05,088
What's going on?

394
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,844
Who's there?

395
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,780
Yuetao.

396
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,470
Do you recognize this young lady?

397
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,190
Mr. Ji.

398
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,740
I'm Fu Yunnuo, Second Prince of Luzhao.

399
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:22,755
I've known Qiao Manman
since we were kids.

400
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,060
I came today to formally propose

401
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,400
to Ms. Qiao,
Head of the Everything Guild.

402
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,100
Well, this...

403
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,230
I am...

404
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,711
Don't worry, Mr. Ji. I'll handle this.

405
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,870
Alright.

406
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,822
Fu Yunnuo,
what nonsense are you spouting?

407
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,044
I'm your sister-in-law.

408
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:44,100
Sister-in-law?

409
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,230
My sister-in-law is known far and wide

410
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,630
as Princess Aliya of Xilin.

411
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:51,540
Which happens to be

412
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,630
this amnesiac girl standing right here.

413
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,580
If you were my sister-in-law,

414
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,340
you would've committed treason.

415
00:22:57,488 --> 00:22:58,311
Why you...

416
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:00,977
Miss, you've lost your memory,

417
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,044
so you still don't know

418
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,020
you're actually the Princess of Xilin.

419
00:23:05,377 --> 00:23:06,866
The real Princess Consort Jin is you.

420
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,060
I'm not some princess.

421
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,780
I'm Ji Mo's wife.

422
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,000
That's not really up to you.

423
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,740
Guihu.

424
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,155
Bring out the betrothal gifts.

425
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,470
Double the guards.

426
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,133
Keep her family safe.
They are my future in-laws.

427
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:27,920
Yes, Your Highness.

428
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,020
Let's go.

429
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,977
You will like the next place.

430
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:39,266
If you want to protect Everything Guild,

431
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,340
coming with me

432
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,580
is the wiser move.

433
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:44,340
Manman!

434
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,150
Manman, do you remember that?

435
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:57,555
You saved me

436
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,600
when I tried to end my life here?

437
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,020
I...

438
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,100
That was a long time ago.

439
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:05,444
I barely remember.

440
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,060
You don't remember?

441
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,866
Then, you must remember

442
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,933
that before you moved,

443
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,060
you tied a red cloth to that old tree.

444
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:14,780
You made me the little ears knot.

445
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,300
Little Ears?

446
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,950
Will you tie it for me again?

447
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,190
Prince Yunnuo.

448
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,820
Why can't you just move on?

449
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,710
Life's full of moments where fate

450
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,066
ends up disappointing.

451
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,044
Why can't we just learn to let go?

452
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:45,333
Manman.

453
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,933
We met because it was fate.

454
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,100
We were bound to meet again.

455
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,500
The battle is nearly over.

456
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,155
We'll be heading home victorious soon.

457
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,340
In just a few days,

458
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,866
the outcome will be sealed.

459
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,670
So Manman won't have
to make bamboo dragonflies

460
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,340
to send here.

461
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,950
Report!

462
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:27,470
Your Highness! Prince Yunnuo locked
Princess Consort Jin in Liuyun Mansion.

463
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,300
He is forcing her to marry him.

464
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:37,555
I underestimated him.

465
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,466
The southern front is
thousands of miles away.

466
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,910
If word still got out,

467
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,630
Fu Yunnuo must have

468
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,800
leaked it.

469
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,470
I have to return at once.

470
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,300
Your Highness, don't act recklessly!

471
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,740
You hold military command right now.

472
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,755
You're on the front line.

473
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,190
Leaving without orders

474
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,100
is a capital offense.

475
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,950
No one can know I'm leaving.

476
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,780
Not a single word can get out.

477
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,911
If the enemy knows,

478
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:02,133
they'll strike hard.

479
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,533
The outcome would be dire.

480
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:04,822
I'll leave and return quickly.

481
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,266
Your Highness...

482
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,230
If this moment

483
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,230
is truly a deadlock

484
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,190
where no one leaves,

485
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:14,044
then what does that mean?

486
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:17,190
(It means something in the capital)

487
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,400
(matters more
to Fu Yunnuo than this war.)

488
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,870
(He is trying to trap me right here.)

489
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,700
(Everything Guild)

490
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,844
You went to propose at Everything Guild,

491
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:30,200
which only proves
Qiao Manman isn't Princess Aliya.

492
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:31,950
She's still a traitor's daughter.

493
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,950
Please, think this through.

494
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:35,711
Don't risk everything for her.

495
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,910
A future

496
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,630
without her

497
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,644
would be meaningless.

498
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,820
I'll marry her openly

499
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,088
and never let her suffer.

500
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:52,240
(Everything Guild)

501
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,733
Mr. Ji, what do we do now?

502
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,910
Manman was taken by Prince Yunnuo

503
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,466
and it's not looking good.

504
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,260
I'm worried about Ji Mo too.

505
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,470
The frontlines are dangerous.

506
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:07,288
Princess Aliya.

507
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,190
Do you remember
the blessing ritual from Xilin?

508
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,000
Let's try it.

509
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:15,340
You really don't remember a thing.

510
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,955
Alright,

511
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:18,990
you taught me before.

512
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,950
Let's get what we need.

513
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,066
Come on.

514
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,111
Mr. Ji!

515
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,540
You actually came back!

516
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:33,060
What if Prince Yunnuo finds out?

517
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,670
Let's talk in private.

518
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,340
Mr. Ji, what exactly happened?

519
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,470
Qiao Manman reunited with her father.

520
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,500
Prince Yunnuo used him.

521
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,060
And now, he's locked Manman up.

522
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,990
Just the other day,
he even showed up here

523
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,066
with a full betrothal gift.

524
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,260
He wanted to marry her.

525
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,500
Can you believe this?

526
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,150
Prince Jin, you must do something.

527
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,190
Please save Qiao Manman!

528
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,910
Don't worry, Mr. Ji.

529
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,260
I'll keep Manman safe.

530
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:54,870
Alright.

531
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,020
I must go now.

532
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,020
The palace

533
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:04,820
feels more deserted by the day.

534
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:11,933
Who's there?

535
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,500
Guards!

536
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,711
It's me.

537
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,500
Prince Jin?

538
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,470
What are you doing here?

539
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,670
Aren't you supposed to be at the front?

540
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,990
Shouldn't you be the one

541
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,950
answering that, Noble Consort?

542
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,540
How should I know why you're here?

543
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,780
In that case,

544
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,780
why don't we talk about
my dear brother, Yunnuo?

545
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,740
Did you know

546
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,500
he has my consort locked up

547
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,230
in his own mansion?

548
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,060
What?

549
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,430
He would go that far for a woman?

550
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,670
Does he care nothing for family or duty?

551
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,390
I feel the same as you.

552
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,430
I don't want
to see him spiral any further.

553
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,630
If you will work with me,

554
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,100
I can get you
what you've always wanted.

555
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,910
So, you know what I truly desire?

556
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
I don't want the throne.

557
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,340
And Luzhao only has two princes.

558
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,950
Help me,

559
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,977
and I'll disappear.

560
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:06,300
Why should I believe you?

561
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,020
Qiao Manman isn't the Princess of Xilin.

562
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,666
I'll stake both our lives on that.

563
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:15,060
All you need to do is convince Yunnuo

564
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,950
to bring Qiao Manman and Qiao Yuanzhi

565
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,470
into court with him,

566
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,630
and expose the truth in public.

567
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Very well.

568
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,190
As long as Yunnuo isn't harmed,

569
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,300
I'll do it.

570
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,150
I prepared all of this just for you.

571
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,820
Do you like it?

572
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,888
Don't worry.

573
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Tomorrow at court,

574
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,350
I'll plead with Father for mercy.

575
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:00,555
For you and your father.

576
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,066
Get some rest.

577
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,190
(Manman, wait for me.)

578
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,710
(Hang in there.)

579
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,950
(I know I can't meet you right now,)

580
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,230
(but I'll get you out of here for good.)

581
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,022
I thought it was him...

582
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,990
Your Highness, news from the front.

583
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,020
Prince Jin is returning with the army.

584
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,430
So what?

585
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm marrying Qiao Manman,
Head of Everything Guild.

586
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,260
His return

587
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,500
won't change anything.

588
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,955
Make sure the wedding is flawless.

589
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:21,500
Yes.

590
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:22,800
Your Highness!

591
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,355
Your Highness!

592
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,844
Noble Consort asks you
to come to the palace.

593
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,711
All right.

594
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,600
Mother.

595
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,910
Yunnuo.

596
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,300
You've lost weight these past few days.

597
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:43,155
I've been busy with state affairs.

598
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,500
You need not worry.

599
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,670
State affairs?

600
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,100
Is hiding Princess Consort Jin
in your mansion

601
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,488
part of state affairs too?

602
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,950
Since you already know,

603
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,990
I won't hide it anymore.

604
00:32:00,444 --> 00:32:01,511
I'm not hiding

605
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,177
but marrying her.

606
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,190
You...

607
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,300
She's your sister-in-law!

608
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,000
Don't worry, Mother.

609
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,710
The one I'm marrying
is Ms. Qiao from Everything Guild.

610
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,150
She's not the real princess.

611
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,711
The real princess is
the true Princess Consort Jin.

612
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,580
No matter who she is,

613
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:18,230
she entered Prince Jin's Residence,

614
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,444
took the vows, and married him.

615
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:20,800
She is Princess Consort Jin.

616
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:22,355
You'd better send her back right now.

617
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,088
Forgive me, but I can't do that.

618
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,777
What did you say?

619
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,390
Say it again.

620
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,260
My answer

621
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,430
will still be the same

622
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,630
no matter what.

623
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,555
You...

624
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,990
Don't think I won't die right here!

625
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,466
Mother.

626
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,820
Why can't you just support me for once?

627
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,222
Yunnuo,

628
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,190
I know you suffered a lot growing up.

629
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,000
That's partly my fault too.

630
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:54,500
But her background is unclear.

631
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,020
She's the daughter of a criminal.

632
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
A fake princess.

633
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,150
How can I not worry?

634
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,470
If you insist on marrying her, fine.

635
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,430
Go ask His Majesty

636
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,780
to clear her name.

637
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,260
Then, I'll say no more.

638
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:12,466
But if you don't,

639
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,910
I'll go straight to your father

640
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:16,066
and have both her
and her father arrested!

641
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,390
Forget marrying her.

642
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:18,977
You can't even save her life!

643
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:21,244
Mother, please don't be mad.

644
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,577
It's bad for your health.

645
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,866
As for your request,

646
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,644
I'll give it careful thought.

647
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,390
If His Majesty agrees to clear her name,

648
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,540
I won't stand in the way.

649
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,100
But, His Majesty has
to be informed of everything.

650
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,222
I understand.

651
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,710
I think Noble Consort
was a bit extreme today.

652
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,630
It is normal.

653
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,150
Will you tell

654
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,577
His Majesty about her
being a traitor's daughter?

655
00:33:58,155 --> 00:33:59,977
Let's go along with my mother's plan.

656
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,910
After all, in this palace,

657
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,311
she's the only one truly on my side.

658
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,340
If His Majesty finds out,

659
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,910
things could spiral fast.

660
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,733
Sometimes, it's all or nothing.

661
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,270
I can bring it up to His Majesty,

662
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,177
then I can save her.

663
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,470
Let's head back.

664
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,311
