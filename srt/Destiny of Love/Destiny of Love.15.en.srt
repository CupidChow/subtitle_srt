27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,830
Even if he passes out today,

28
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,780
I'll wake him up with silver needles.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,780
I don't believe

30
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,670
this fear of women is incurable.

31
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,750
Dear.

32
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,670
Come quick!

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,700
Fang, what...

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,350
Sit.

35
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,110
Fang, why did you ask me here

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,350
at this late hour?

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,950
I need to prepare
for the academy's homework.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,270
I'm eager to learn too.

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,140
Mr. Ji.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,830
Would you like to teach me?

41
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,700
I just remembered that,

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,270
besides homework,

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,390
I haven't finished my stories yet.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,700
If I don't finish it,

45
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:48,100
Yuanxiang will be on my back again.

46
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,800
I need to go now.

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,888
I'll teach you next time.

48
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:58,700
(Chenning Palace)

49
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,950
(Why isn't there anyone here?)

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,140
(This must be what Jiufeng meant)

51
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,180
(by the deep palace
Her Majesty locked herself in.)

52
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,350
Where's Her Majesty?

53
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,350
Madam?

54
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,830
Madam?

55
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,230
Does Her Majesty live here?

56
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,620
Who are you?

57
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,288
I'm Princess Consort Jin.

58
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:06,190
I have something
to discuss with Her Majesty.

59
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,790
You're the Princess from Xilin?

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,140
(Her Majesty locked herself away.)

61
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,670
(How does she know everything?)

62
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,420
I heard you healed Prince Jin's legs.

63
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,590
Yes.

64
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,500
How did you know?

65
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,355
I just heard it somewhere.

66
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,380
Could it be you're the Empress?

67
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,180
I'm just a maid.

68
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,180
Her Majesty is dead.

69
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,300
(She's clearly the Empress,)

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,030
(and she still cares about Prince Jin.)

71
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,860
(Why claim she's dead?)

72
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,740
You...

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,180
You're really not her?

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,940
Why are you looking for Her Majesty?

75
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,350
Here's the thing.

76
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,533
His Majesty's birthday
is around the corner.

77
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:01,755
This year, we're hosting
his birthday banquet.

78
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,230
I want it to be a birthday
he'll never forget.

79
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,790
They say

80
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,590
His Highness
and Her Majesty don't get along.

81
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,590
But I know

82
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,470
deep down he still misses his mother.

83
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,740
So I thought this could be a chance

84
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:17,990
to bring them together.

85
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,022
What's Prince Jin's opinion?

86
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,380
He...

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,420
Well...

88
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,110
His Highness acts like he doesn't care.

89
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,155
But I can feel that deep down,

90
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
he really wants to see his mother.

91
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,940
He grew up without her care.

92
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,940
He really had it rough.

93
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,740
Oh right!

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,110
When we were preparing
for the birthday banquet,

95
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,500
there was almost an accident.

96
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,620
I have a feeling this birthday
is filled with hidden dangers.

97
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:55,590
It's alright.

98
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,790
I've always been loyal to Her Majesty.

99
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,790
If anything's wrong,
feel free to tell me.

100
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
(She refuses to admit her identity,)

101
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,790
(but she still worries
about His Highness.)

102
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,740
(Maybe I should provoke her a little.)

103
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,990
I'll tell you, then.

104
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,710
Ever since I married His Highness,

105
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,300
he's been sick every three days

106
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,910
and gets ambushed every four.

107
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,820
It's like living on the edge.

108
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,820
Some people even tried to use me

109
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,030
to cause him trouble.

110
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,590
I can take it.

111
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,860
But His Highness...

112
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,350
is constantly being put on the spot.

113
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,910
And he's without
his mother's protection.

114
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,977
They say a child without a mother
is nothing but worthless.

115
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,550
Isn't His Highness pitiful?

116
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,620
(Looks like this trip wasn't in vain.)

117
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
(I don't believe there's no mother)

118
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:56,822
(who doesn't love her child.)

119
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,550
Madam,

120
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,260
I've been out a while,

121
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,688
so I should head back.

122
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,590
We'll

123
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,620
meet again.

124
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,820
Jin.

125
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,500
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,340
(Respect Teaching and Diligent Learning)

127
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,380
Hurry up.

128
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:55,688
Let's go.

129
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,740
Come on!

130
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,710
Slow down.

131
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,670
Let's go.

132
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,852
(Liuyun Mansion)

133
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,300
Let's go!

134
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,710
- His Majesty.
- Father.

135
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,230
May you always be blessed
with fortune and longevity.

136
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,260
Everyone,

137
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,190
let us raise a toast together.

138
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:08,511
Wonderful!

139
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,380
Everyone, rise.

140
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,555
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Father.

141
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,260
The teacher and students of the academy
shall present a poem in celebration.

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,750
On this auspicious day, sunlight bathes
the crimson gates of the palace.

143
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,540
Not fog nor mist, but emerald light
graces the forbidden gardens.

144
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
The scene is both lovely and serene.

145
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,110
Banners flow with the gentle breeze.

146
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,070
Fragrance fills the golden hall.

147
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,350
All nations come to celebrate,
and all officials bow and dance.

148
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,990
All people rejoice.

149
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,860
Blessings are as endless
as the mountains and rivers.

150
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,950
Like a rainbow
gliding through jade waters,

151
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,740
lightning flies through the sky.

152
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,620
Shao music is played,
celebrating harmony and peace.

153
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:01,260
Year after year,
the dragon and phoenix chariots return.

154
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,110
Springtime fills
the grand peach banquet.

155
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,590
Peace across the realm.

156
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,020
May Your Majesty

157
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
live as long as heaven and earth.

158
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,900
May Your Majesty

159
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,110
live as long as heaven and earth.

160
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:19,990
Excellent!

161
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,111
Very good!

162
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,990
You shall all be rewarded!

163
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:25,355
Take your seat.

164
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,310
Your Majesty.

165
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,500
Next is
the Princes' presentation of gifts.

166
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,200
Very well.

167
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,070
A gift from Prince Jin's Residence.

168
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,860
He thinks my man

169
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,410
will be hiding in secret corners
of the Imperial Garden,

170
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:12,777
so he's guarding them carefully.

171
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,110
But little does he know

172
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,088
that my man

173
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,022
(At a quarter past the Si hour,)
will be hiding inside

174
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,150
(Prince Jin presents his gift...)
the gift from Prince Jin's Residence.

175
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,470
Assassin!

176
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,260
Alright. You all may leave.

177
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,900
They must know

178
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,830
we'll guard every corner thoroughly

179
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,230
to keep Father safe.

180
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,020
So what we're most likely to overlook

181
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,380
is the gift itself.

182
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,470
What a grand scene
of Magu offering the birthday peach.

183
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,066
Magu offers the birthday peach.

184
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,430
Looks like Prince Jin
really put thought into it.

185
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,350
He did.

186
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,933
- Absolutely.
- Indeed.

187
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,140
Such a huge peach.

188
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,355
Let me take a look.

189
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,140
Nice.

190
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,260
How splendid!

191
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,710
I like it a lot.

192
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,688
That's right.

193
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,950
Her Majesty has arrived.

194
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:07,133
Why is she here?

195
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

196
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,780
(Her Majesty really came.)

197
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,577
Your Highness,

198
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,830
this is the only thing I can do for you.

199
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,260
I hope you will stop

200
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,830
dwelling on the unhappy past.

201
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,020
You have to look ahead.

202
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,470
Jin.

203
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,540
Jin, I...

204
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,710
Mother, why don't you stay

205
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,422
and celebrate Father's birthday with us?

206
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,844
There will be more time
to spend together after this.

207
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,950
I entered the banquet

208
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,400
without an imperial decree.

209
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,266
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

210
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,470
I told you so.

211
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,620
In this palace,

212
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,900
as long as you wish,

213
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,000
you may come and go as pleased.

214
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,422
I left the palace today

215
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,311
because I heard things have been tense
at Prince Jin's Residence.

216
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,422
Even Princess Consort Jin
was kidnapped from the residence.

217
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,911
Did you know of this, Your Majesty?

218
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,350
Is that true, Jin?

219
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,860
Father,

220
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,830
it was just a false alarm.
Nothing to worry about.

221
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,740
Prince Jin is kind.

222
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,260
Don't let others take advantage of that.

223
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,422
Sit with me, Yan.

224
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,244
Greetings, Lady Yan.

225
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,660
Everyone,

226
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,470
the banquet continues.

227
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,800
Please have a seat.

228
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,260
You came here today

229
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,377
for Jin, right?

230
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,990
What if I say yes?

231
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,620
Over the years,

232
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,620
I've owed him far too much.

233
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,044
This is the first time he's organized
a birthday banquet for you.

234
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,777
I was afraid something might happen.

235
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,590
If I say no,

236
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,860
Your Majesty may believe

237
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,710
I came because I missed you.

238
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,780
I wouldn't dare assume that.

239
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,660
We first met

240
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,380
on a rainy spring day like this.

241
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,200
It was my first day in the palace,

242
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,800
and I didn't know you.

243
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,200
I saw you holding an umbrella,

244
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,110
so I ordered you to hold it for me.

245
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,830
I still remember

246
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,740
you said,

247
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,710
"This trivial attendant
can't read the room at all.

248
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,110
If I get drenched,

249
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,860
who will marry your prince?"

250
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,110
How bold I was,

251
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,660
not knowing the man I met that day

252
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,230
was to be my husband.

253
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,955
On our wedding night,

254
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,950
you said the exact same words.

255
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,910
I never expected

256
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,800
after all these years,

257
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,422
you'd still remember.

258
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,300
So do you.

259
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,755
By the way, I forgot to ask you.

260
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,288
After all this time in the palace,

261
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,260
have you ever lacked food or clothing?

262
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,466
You're asking what you already know.

263
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:27,910
Although I lived in seclusion,

264
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,230
I knew very well

265
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,430
you sent your men
to watch over me all the time.

266
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,230
I understand

267
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,111
your kind intentions.

268
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,060
In that case, you need
not stay there anymore.

269
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,088
You can just...

270
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,044
What I mean is,

271
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:49,133
at least allow me to visit you
once in a while.

272
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,400
Look over there.

273
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,190
Back then, I burned that place down

274
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,390
until only ruins remained.

275
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,990
Even though you rebuilt the palace,

276
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,630
the burn marks still haven't
faded after all these years.

277
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,644
The rope can wear through the wood.

278
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,755
The water can wear down the stone.

279
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,020
If enough time passes,

280
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,100
even deep scars can be smoothed away.

281
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:43,422
Today, I saw your second son.

282
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,870
That child

283
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,444
is named Yunnuo, I think.

284
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,780
I wonder if he has suffered criticism

285
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,888
at such a young age like my Jin.

286
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,755
He even had to go through
a blood test to confirm kinship!

287
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,533
Yan...

288
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,780
I still haven't made peace

289
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,710
with what happened back then.

290
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,910
Since I'm not going to open the gate,

291
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,400
there's no need for you
to worry about me.

292
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,688
Treat Jin well and that will be
more than enough for me.

293
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,288
Take care, Your Majesty.

294
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,511
What a bunch of good-for-nothing!

295
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,377
Why didn't they do a final inspection?

296
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,300
Guihu.

297
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,577
Since I dared to come,

298
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,060
it meant I came prepared
to leave safely.

299
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,066
If you don't want
to cause Prince Yunnuo trouble,

300
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,733
you better not make a move.

301
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,150
Guihu.

302
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,150
You may go.

303
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,230
Now.

304
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,711
Your Highness.

305
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,400
Why must you do this?

306
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,777
What do you mean?

307
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,466
Why did you hide an assassin

308
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,466
in the gift we prepared?

309
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:46,111
Luckily, Prince Jin found out in time.

310
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,150
He didn't report it to Father

311
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:49,780
only to spare you the shame.

312
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,500
But in the end, you still chose

313
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,044
to side with Fu Chengjin.

314
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,060
What else?

315
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,060
Should I side with you

316
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,740
and help you frame Prince Jin?

317
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,311
Manman.

318
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,580
I never meant to hurt you.

319
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,666
If I hadn't held back,

320
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,888
would I be in such a pathetic state now?

321
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,020
You think he wasn't aware of all this?

322
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,230
Even I could see the flaws.

323
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,977
He's ten times sharper than I am.

324
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,400
How could he not notice?

325
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,020
He's the one
who truly wants to protect you.

326
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,950
So you mean

327
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
he's clever and capable,

328
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,230
and I'm just incompetent?

329
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,670
I...

330
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,060
Ever since I was little,

331
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,670
Father has always favored him.

332
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,020
He gets everything with ease

333
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,000
as if it's nothing.

334
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,670
Yet he acts like he doesn't even care.

335
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,466
Do you know how I feel?

336
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,190
Have you never considered

337
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,777
for whose sake
he has run away from all this?

338
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,400
There are only two princes in Luzhao...

339
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,044
Stop it!

340
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,955
I don't believe it.

341
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,822
And I don't care what he does.

342
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,022
I just want to take back everything

343
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,670
that was supposed to be mine,

344
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,670
including you!

345
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,800
If you don't leave today,

346
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,800
I can't promise something like this
won't happen again.

347
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,230
Prince Yunnuo,
stop it before it's too late.

348
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,100
But it's you who made me into this!

349
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,580
(Back then, Father never loved me.)

350
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,060
(Hurt and upset, I ran from the palace.)

351
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,390
(The world had treated me cruelly.)

352
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,230
(I then met you.)

353
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,100
(You told me I had to stay strong.)

354
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,540
I wanted you to be strong

355
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,630
so you could face life head-on.

356
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,260
I never wanted Little Cloud to grow up

357
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:34,500
only to cast a dark shadow.

358
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,710
If I had known

359
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,288
my words would turn you into this,

360
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,630
I would rather never have met you.

361
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,740
Manman.

362
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,111
But I can't turn back now.

363
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,060
A lifetime, one true love.

364
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,740
May our vows match our virtue,

365
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,333
and may we walk hand in hand...

366
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:55,422
Mother!

367
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,020
Go away!

368
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:03,866
Mother!

369
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,222
Mother...

370
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,470
Jin.

371
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,820
Jin!

372
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,190
Jin!

373
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,820
Jin!

374
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,577
Jin.

375
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,933
Jin.

376
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,288
Jin!

377
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,933
Your Highness.

378
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,733
Your Highness.

379
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,422
My mother hasn't stepped out
of the palace in over ten years.

380
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,020
Why did she appear at the banquet today?

381
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:07,755
Forgive me, Your Highness.

382
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,911
It was me who told Her Highness

383
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:11,266
about you and Her Majesty.

384
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,430
But she only meant well.

385
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,190
I thought my mother had
already forgotten about me.

386
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,100
Your Highness, now that you're here,

387
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,622
you should go pay Her Majesty a visit.

388
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,150
Another day.

389
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,422
Your Majesty.

390
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,133
Have some hot tea to warm yourself.

391
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,950
Your Majesty.

392
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,022
I just saw Prince Jin at the door.

393
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,950
Your Majesty.

394
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,470
You and His Highness share a deep bond.

395
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,990
I bet

396
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,555
he must have always missed you.

397
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,266
I saw Jin today at the birthday banquet.

398
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,777
Judging by his reaction,

399
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,950
he still hasn't forgiven me.

400
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:53,840
(As Harmonious
and Nourishing as the Wind)

401
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,844
How's the preparation?

402
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,169
Your Highness, the carriage
is ready for Her Highness.

403
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,190
The umbrella is there too.

404
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,280
She won't get wet at all.

405
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:06,133
Don't worry.

406
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,300
How can I not worry?

407
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,540
Once she gets home safely,

408
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,244
there's still one more thing.

409
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,430
She once said

410
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,822
she's never celebrated her birthday.

411
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,555
I'll throw her a birthday banquet.

412
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,733
Great idea, Your Highness.

413
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,600
But do you know
what Her Highness likes?

414
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,644
She once said

415
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,266
she loved fireworks the most.

416
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,177
Good thing His Highness
got us the carriage and umbrella.

417
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,000
Otherwise,

418
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,670
we'd be soaked to the bone by now.

419
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,066
I understand His Highness' kind gesture.

420
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,710
Since you do,

421
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,933
shouldn't you stop hiding your identity?

422
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,500
I know.

423
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,300
If I tell the truth,
he will protect me for sure.

424
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,500
I'm just afraid that by then,

425
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,444
my fate won't be his to decide.

426
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,190
Once I find the clue
and open the Golden Box,

427
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,244
I'll tell him everything.

428
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,950
But now,

429
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,555
I can't turn
to Prince Yunnuo for help anymore.

430
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,390
Your help

431
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,190
is right next to you.

432
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,400
Why would you ask
for Prince Yunnuo's help?

433
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:32,444
About the Golden Box,

434
00:29:32,444 --> 00:29:34,111
you should ask His Highness for help.

435
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:50,533
Your Highness.

436
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:53,066
I'll have someone
get you a change of clothes.

437
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,740
No need.

438
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,990
What happened today,

439
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,400
and what she said,

440
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,288
makes me no different from a stray dog.

441
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:05,288
Your Highness,

442
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,866
there's still time.

443
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,910
We can make new plans.

444
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,780
Even so,

445
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,755
you must never harm her.

446
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,911
Your Highness,

447
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,822
you saw it yourself today.

448
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,260
Princess Consort Jin
only has eyes for Prince Jin.

449
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:19,688
She'll never love you back.

450
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:20,422
She will!

451
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,177
We've known each other for years.

452
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,755
How could my brother ever compare?

453
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,222
She just doesn't know yet.

454
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,111
She doesn't know how good I'd be to her.

455
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,822
She has no idea.

456
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,540
Your Highness.

457
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,377
I'll make her see, then.

458
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,540
She just needs to see, right?

459
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,377
Then...

460
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,755
Then

461
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,422
she won't fall for Prince Jin anymore.

462
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,866
Your Highness, you have a fever.

463
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,955
I'll go prepare your medicine now.
