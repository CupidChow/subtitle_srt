89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,860
get me a glass of water.

92
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:15,977

93
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,670
You let it out and

94
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,550
finished your water.

95
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,933

96
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,150
Thank you.

97
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,910
Do you think a princess's life is easy?

98
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,820
How could I not know your pain?

99
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:06,940
Don't worry.

100
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,350
To me,

101
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,333
you'll always be a princess.

102
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,030

105
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,790
What happened?

106
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,620
Last night, did His Highness...

107
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,260
I had too much drink.

108
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,820
Then...

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,590
Don't tell me you were the one who...

110
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,820
Don't be ridiculous.

111
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,550
I drank too much and blacked out.

112
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,710
The last thing I remember
before blacking out was...

113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,990
Are you alright?

114
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,990
What's there to worry about?

115
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,940
You scared me.

116
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,910
You call that not worrying?

117
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
It was super awkward!

118
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,550
I think I talked
a lot of trash about him.

119
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,260
I even gave him a lecture!

120
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,860
I acted

121
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,740

Does it smell nice?

134
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
It does.

135
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,470
It smells like osmanthus.

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,540
I know what it is.

141

You're thinking about His Highness.

142
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,950
Stop it, what are you talking about?

143
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,380
I am not thinking about him!

144
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,780
Don't deny it.

145
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,710
I knew it.

146
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,310
Women in love
really do lose a few brain cells.

147
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,990
You used to be so sharp.

148
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,740
Now look at you. Totally love-struck.

149
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,590
Fine.

150
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,780
In that case,

151
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,900
I hope you never end up like me.

152
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,800
Don't fall in love. Don't get married.

153
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,900
Keep your head clear.

154
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,830
Don't curse me!

155
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,190
If I end up single forever

156
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,020
as an old spinster,

157
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,780
that'd mean...

158
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,470
You'd die a lost soul
with no one to bury you.

159
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,830
Honestly, I've been meaning to ask.

160
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,577
Do you still want to leave?

161
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,830
Of...

162
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,140
Of course...

163
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,260
Of course not.

164
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,540
If we stay in the residence too long

165
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
and get exposed,

166
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,830
we could be executed.

167
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,470
Don't worry.

168
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,933
I won't drag you down with me.

169
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,140
That is not my concern.

170
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,470
Come on, it's obvious.

171
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,260
You want to stay.

172
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:19,710
You're already too attached to him.

173
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,830
No, I'm not.

174
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,660
Don't be so quick to deny it.

175
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,950
I'm not blaming you.

176
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,540
What I'm saying is...

177
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,140
If you really want to stay,

178
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,950
you need to tell His Highness the truth.

179
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,860
I can tell

180
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,950
His Highness really cares about you.

181
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,540
Besides,

182
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,310
His Majesty adores him too.

183
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,070
Honestly,

184
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,590
it doesn't matter who you are.

185
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,190
He can keep you safe.

186
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,780
Plus,

187
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,740
his legs are all better now, right?

188
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,350
So, does it really matter

189
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,466
who you are?

190
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,190
But what about you?

191
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,740
I have my own plans.

192
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,900
We have each other

193
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,190
in this big residence.

194
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,710
We've always looked out for each other.

195
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,860
If you won't even tell me

196
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,780
what's on your mind,

197
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
how am I supposed
to help you figure things out?

198
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,950
Yuetao...

199
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,620
You're seriously the best.

200
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,540
Listen,

201
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,470
I'll help you find a good man to marry.

202
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,990
I think Jiufeng is great.

203
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,710
I'll ask around for you.

204
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:37,310
Why don't you worry
about your own problems first?

205
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,230
When are you telling him the truth?

206
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,110
The truth?

207
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,900
I can't.

208
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,860
I'm scared.

209
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,660
Scared of what?

210
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,230
You're overthinking it.

211
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,110
If you ask me,

212
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,844
he's only going to like you more.

213
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,070
Or perhaps

214
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,590
I can have Jiufeng
sound him out for you?

215
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,140
Forget it.

216
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,590
This is my mess.

217
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,710
I'll figure it out myself.

218
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,377
Alright then.

219
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,830
Who is it?

220
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,900
More of this childish nonsense again.

221
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,333
It's nothing.

222
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
It has to be him.

223
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,470
It's Prince Yunnuo.

224
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,470
What did he want?

225
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,860
Did he find a lead on the cloud pattern?

226
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,310
No, I have to head out.

227
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,540
I'll come with you.

228
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,260
No.

229
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,190
I'll go on my own.

230
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,710
Don't run off so fast!

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,830
What if His Highness asks
where you went?

232
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,110
What am I supposed to tell him?

233
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,110
Princess Consort Jin!

234
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,066
Princess Consort Jin!

235
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,140
Your Highness! Your Highness!

236
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,110
Bad news! Her Highness is in trouble!

237
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,710
What?

238
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,190
Just now, I...

239
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,430
Her Highness and I received

240
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,533
a note from Prince Yunnuo.

241
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,422
He asked to meet her.

242
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,780
I followed her to the gate,

243
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,288
and saw a group of people
force her into a carriage!

244
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,470
They headed toward South Avenue.

245
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,620
Yuetao, go to Liuyun Mansion.

246
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,860
Confirm with Prince Yunnuo.

247
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:20,330
Got it.

248
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:20,990
Jiufeng, let's go.

249
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,470
Yes!

250
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,140
Where are we heading?

251
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,140
There are only
three paths to South Avenue.

252
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:26,990
With a carriage,

253
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,688
they won't take
the crowded Qingshi Alley.

254
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,430
And Water Street is too narrow.

255
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,070
That leaves just one route.

256
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,070
Who are you people?

257
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,950
Trying to run?

258
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,380
Listen here.

259
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,990
I am Princess Consort Jin.

260
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,355
If you lay a finger on me,
you'll regret it.

261
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,590
Princess Consort Jin?

262
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:10,230
You're Princess Aliya, aren't you?

263
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,470
You're the target.

264
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,230
Kill her.

265
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,470
Wait! Hold on!

266
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,500
Hear me out!

267
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,860
You're about to die.

268
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,190
What's left to say?

269
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,110
Actually...

270
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm not Princess Aliya.

271
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,260
I'm just a stand-in.

272
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,710
A stand-in?

273
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,710
Seriously?

274
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,190
Then talk.

275
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm from Everything Guild.

276
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,540
I was hired to take her place.

277
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:55,950
If you don't believe me,

278
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,310
come with me to Everything Guild.

279
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,620
If you kill the wrong person,

280
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,990
how are you going to report back, right?

281
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,380
Look at me.
Do I look like a princess to you?

282
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,190
Guys.

283
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,900
Let's kill the impostor first

284
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,710
before we kill the real princess.

285
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,780
Do it!

286
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,444
Stop right there!

287
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,500
Stop!

288
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,620
What took you so long?

289
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,430
They wanted me dead!

290
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,310
I was terrified.

291
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,380
I'll make sure they pay

292
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,620
for their crime tenfold.

293
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,190
Stay here for now.

294
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,390
(His legs just healed recently.)

295
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,430
(How is he already so good)

296
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,100
(in combat?)

297
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,100
Aliya.

298
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:11,355
Aliya.

299
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,150
Prince Yunnuo.

300
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:12,688
Don't worry.

301
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,777
I'll take care of this.

302
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,990
What happened today

303
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,780
is likely just the beginning.

304
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,390
More people might get caught up in it.

305
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:19,870
You should stay away from Brother.

306
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:21,466
Listen,

307
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,470
stay here.

308
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I'll go check it out.

309
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:53,910
Your Highness.

310
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:56,060
Why didn't you leave any of them alive?

311
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,910
Let's go home, Aliya.

312
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,820
Brother.

313
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:08,300
Someone used my name
to abduct your wife today.

314
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,190
I'll come and apologize in person.

315
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,580
Understood.

316
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,820
Let's see if you dare run off again.

317
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,340
I won't.

318
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,060
(Benevolent and Kind)

319
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:37,066
The kidnapping was probably
someone from the palace.

320
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:37,950
No doubt about it.

321
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,060
This whole incident

322
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,740
seemed to target Her Highness.

323
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,470
But the real target was you.

324
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,870
And Prince Yunnuo left no witnesses,

325
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,430
as if afraid to be questioned.

326
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:50,733
And what about Aliya?

327
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,190
She'll figure out

328
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,780
that I was faking my leg injury.

329
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,990
You really think so?

330
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,390
If she does find out,

331
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,670
you'd better think this through.

332
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,670
You know women.

333
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,430
What they hate most
is being kept in the dark.

334
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,230
If you still won't tell her the truth,

335
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,540
we'll only get dragged
deeper into this mess.

336
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,580
In the end, no one's getting out.

337
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,100
But, if she learns too much
about royal affairs,

338
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,670
won't it scare her?

339
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,740
Your Highness,

340
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,540
why are you so hesitant?

341
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,870
What?

342
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,190
Besides,

344
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,780
Her Highness is so brave.

345
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,430
She won't be scared at all.

346
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:39,820
Just take her away already.

347
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,911
We have two Resurrection Pills anyway.

348
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,910
If she's willing...

349
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,100
She definitely is!

350
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,710
She will be, right?

351
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,470
Are you alright?

352
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,340
Yes.

353
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,500
It's not serious.

354
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:56,822
I'll recover in a few days.

355
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,100
I must say, His Highness's
martial arts are impressive.

356
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,780
It's only been days since he recovered.

357
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:02,820
But those moves?

358
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,430
He is as strong as Prince Yunnuo.

359
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,670
Yeah.

360
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,870
It's only been a few days.

361
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,100
How did his skills improve this much?

362
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,430
Even if you had 20 years,

363
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,644
you still wouldn't master it
with your talent.

364
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:20,260
It's alright.

365
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:21,820
His Highness will protect you.

366
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:26,866
What's wrong?

367
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,060
Are you traumatized?

368
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,390
(With a fake miracle physician
like me by his side,)

369
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,820
(what trouble
will we face in the future?)

370
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,870
Do you know what time it is?

371
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,500
A prince entering the palace
at night gets punished.

372
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,870
Your father sometimes rests here.

373
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,060
What if you bump into him?

374
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,740
Father is always busy.

375
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,630
He rarely stays in the harem.

376
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,390
You...

377
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,710
You're right.

378
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:18,950
He's too busy.

379
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:20,300
Not coming to the harem

380
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,390
is perfectly understandable.

381
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,500
He still loves me...

382
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,870
Mother.

383
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,290
An attempt on Princess Consort Jin's
life is a serious crime!

384
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,020
Please, from now on,

385
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:30,044
don't be so extreme again.

386
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,820
What are you talking about?

387
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,820
I didn't...

388
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,230
Fine.

389
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,780
I did it.

390
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,500
But that Aliya is beyond redemption.

391
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,150
I...

392
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,820
The Aliya you said is beyond redemption

393
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,950
is now the darling
who cured Brother's legs.

394
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,500
Not just your father,

395
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:48,230
she's the darling
in your heart too, right?

396
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:49,950
As for her,

397
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,470
you need not worry.

398
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,340
I'll get rid of her.

399
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,740
But please, stop the underhanded tricks.

400
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,670
What if I insist on killing her?

401
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,670
Mother.

402
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,230
Today,

403
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,990
if I hadn't been there,

404
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,580
the assassins you sent

405
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,540
would've been caught
alive by Fu Chengjin.

406
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,190
Aliya

407
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,060
would be safe,

408
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:15,740
and you'd be in trouble.

409
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,230
Rest well, Mother.

410
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,060
I'll leave now.

411
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:37,500
(Hanyuan Hall)

412
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,790
Letting Prince Jin's Residence
host your birthday banquet?

413
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,933
On what grounds?

414
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,780
Exactly.

415
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,020
The imperial decree has been delivered.

416
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,820
Any objections?

417
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,340
Of course...

418
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,630
But that would be unreasonable...

419
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,870
Logically speaking,

420
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,710
your birthday banquet

421
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:02,711
should naturally
be organized by the Empress.

422
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,260
But over the years,

423
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,340
Empress Yun has stayed
out of the spotlight.

424
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,910
Therefore,

425
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,260
I handled everything on my own.

426
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,910
And now, all of a sudden,

427
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,100
you want to hand it
over to someone else?

428
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,470
What's the issue?

429
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,300
It's my birthday banquet.
Shouldn't I decide?

430
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,470
Of course you should.

431
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,190
I'm just concerned

432
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,820
Prince Jin and Princess Consort Jin
are still young.

433
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:29,340
What if something slips their minds

434
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,820
and it offends you, Your Majesty?

435
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,140
Whether it turns out perfect or not,

436
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,390
it still comes from
the heart of our children.

437
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,150
That is not what I meant.

438
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,990
You know what kind of person I am.

439
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,150
I have never cared

440
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,430
about power and position.

441
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,470
I simply want
to ease your burdens.

442
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,820
Alright.

443
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,060
Going forward,

444
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,190
I should get to know you better.

445
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,780
Your Majesty, I just think we should

446
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,150
let Yunnuo and Jin co-host the banquet,

447
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,580
with me guiding them.

448
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:00,630
That should keep things
from going wrong.

449
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,020
Yunnuo has actually been preparing

450
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,820
for your birthday

451
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,670
for quite some time now.

452
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,060
Though he was born of a concubine,

453
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,740
he is still your own flesh and blood.

454
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,060
You can't keep showing favoritism.

455
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,150
If you do this,

456
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,300
how are we supposed
to carry ourselves in the future?

457
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,780
Alright.

458
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,540
We'll do as you say.

459
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:36,740
Your Majesty,

460
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:37,910
please try this.

461
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,100
I made these pastries myself.

462
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,933
I'm not hungry.

463
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,377
I have work to finish.

464
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,150
Take another look at the decree.

465
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,540
No.

466
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,488
(Imperial Decree)
Just take another look.

467
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,260
I said I don't want to.

468
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,740
Get that decree away from me.

469
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,820
What are you worried about?

470
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,150
I'm afraid I'll mess it up.

471
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,911
Noble Consort might give me a hard time.

472
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,870
Tell me, what's the worst
that could happen?

473
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,910
At most, we get beheaded.

474
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,230
Or worse, a slow

475
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,466
or clan execution.

476
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,870
Are you stupid?

477
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,710
You will die too.

478
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:39,590
In Luzhao, we have
a Three Exceptions Policy.

479
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,990
And I just happen to fall under it.

480
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,100
I won't be implicated.

481
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,670
Anyway, just think of it like

482
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,580
planning a birthday
for an elder at home.

483
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,822
It's not that hard.

484
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,060
Don't tell me you've never
celebrated birthdays?

485
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,910
We're just common folks.
What birthdays?

486
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,230
What I mean is,

487
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:07,190
just thinking about how the folks
don't celebrate birthdays,

488
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,990
and yet, I'm a princess,

489
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:10,911
so how could I celebrate
in good conscience?

490
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,670
If it were your birthday,

491
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,950
what would you do?

492
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,580
I'd spend it with my family.

493
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,670
We'd watch fireworks together.

494
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,910
Watching fireworks with family...

495
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,500
There's someone who means a lot to me.

496
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,910
He promised to watch fireworks with me,

497
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,100
but he never came back.

498
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,755
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

499
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,740
You have celebrated so many birthdays.

500
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,670
Tell me,

501
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,780
how do you celebrate here?

502
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,950
With palace etiquette...

503
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,150
Just the dishes alone,

504
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,155
especially for
Father's birthday banquet,

505
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,990
they must follow the protocols.

506
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,100
Do you have a signature dish

507
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,100
you can actually serve?

508
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,500
Don't look down on me.

509
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,500
I'll show you

510
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,060
what I'm really made of.

511
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,020
(This dish)

512
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,260
(has been around since ancient times.)

513
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,820
(It's a festive delicacy you must have.)

514
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,670
(It looks like winter snow,)

515
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:21,990
(tastes like a gentle hearth,)

516
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:23,533
(and has a layered texture.)

517
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,990
(The dough)

518
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,190
(needs to be gently kneaded
with inner strength,)

519
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:30,710
(finding that perfect balance
of firmness and softness,)

520
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,390
(so the texture turns out chewy.)

521
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,390
(The filling)

522
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,990
(must be pounded repeatedly)

523
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,910
(until the aroma melts on your tongue)

524
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,390
(and lingers long after.)

525
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,230
(Poets have praised its beauty.)

526
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,260
(With sweet-scented
osmanthus and walnuts inside,)

527
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:48,630
(the glutinous rice is washed till
it glows like pearls in well water.)

528
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,340
It's just tangyuan.

529
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,430
What's so complicated?

530
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,100
Have you ever made tangyuan?

531
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,150
You've never done anything yourself,

532
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,422
so it's easy for you to talk.

533
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,910
What's so hard about it?

534
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,870
Teach me.

535
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,470
I bet I can make it better than you.

536
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,340
What?

537
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,740
Show me the steps.

538
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:26,910
Be clear.

539
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,500

♪No matter how time may change,
I'll give you the greatest love♪

560
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,332
♪This autumn♪

561
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:34,218
♪I promise to love you forever♪

562
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,000
Your Highness.

563
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,340
Try it.

564
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,580
I think I kneaded
the dough a bit too hard.

565
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,870
Now my hands are sore.

566
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,740
Are you that delicate?

567
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,910
Now you can't even lift a spoon?

568
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,820
Well, I don't usually do much work.

569
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,230
Eat slowly. It's hot.

570
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,133
Is it good?

571
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,244
You have some too.

572
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,630
I'm being serious.

573
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,300
So,

574
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,300
do you think it is possible

575
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,390
that we could actually pull off
Father's birthday celebration?

576
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:29,910
Honestly, his birthday
is the same every year.

577
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,870
No good or bad to it.

578
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,020
Plus, the Ministry
of Rites always helps.

579
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,020
Nothing goes wrong.

580
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,060
And it just goes by like that.

581
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,100
Doesn't sound that hard after all.

582
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:45,250
(Prince Jin's Residence)

583
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,400
Your Highness.

584
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,044
Come in.

585
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,910
Prince Yunnuo sent you this invitation.

586
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,200
What does it say?

587
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:07,540
He invited me
to the teahouse for an opera.

588
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,150
Go. Why hesitate?

589
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:12,430
You could also
ask about the Golden Box.

590
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:15,990
Alright.

591
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:22,488
This way, please.

592
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,670
Prince Yunnuo.

593
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,470
Welcome.

594
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,710
Sit.

595
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:27,870
Yes.

596
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,977
Prince Yunnuo.

597
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,888
Why invite me

598
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,820
for this opera?

599
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,950
Remember when we picked lotus pods?

600
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:40,630
I said I had something to tell you.

601
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,622
But you were busy
treating Brother's legs.

602
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,580
Now that all that is taken care of,

603
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
let's talk about us.

604
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Let's talk as we watch.

605
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,580
I wrote this opera.

606
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,933
I hope you don't mind.

607
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,500
I can't believe the actor is this young.

608
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,840
Prince Yunnuo,

609
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,150
you really put thought into this.

610
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,470
Look closely.

611
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,870
The sky is dark and the rain is near.

612
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,580
(Yiyun Parlor)
Just like my heart, unloved and dim.

613
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,670
Nonsense.

614
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,910
The skies clear up in no time.

615
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,390
And I always keep you in my thoughts.

616
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,020
That little girl is
really sweet to the boy.

617
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,260
Why didn't you say you were hurt?

618
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,340
If I didn't, it means it's nothing.

619
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,430
But, you're still hurt.

620
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,340
What more is there to say?

621
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,710
You're not allowed to dodge.

622
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,910
Well?

623
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,430
There are even two Little Ears.

624
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,060
(Little Ears?)

625
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
(Two kids?)

626
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,630
(Why does this look so familiar?)

627
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,820
Look, Little Cloud.

628
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,044
Don't they look like
a pair of little ears?

629
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,500
They do! They are lovely!

630
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,870
This is my one-of-a-kind
bandaging technique.

631
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,060
(How does he know about my childhood?)

632
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:16,870
