Forget it.

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,288
Your wedding with Manman is approaching

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,300
and here's a reminder for you.

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,866
Just say it, Mr. Qiao.

31
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,300
As her father,

32
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,830
I only hope
that you can treat Manman well.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,550
If she ever makes you upset,

34
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,311
you can either get rid of her
or file a divorce.

35
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,700
However, if you dare hurt her,

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,230
no matter if you're Fu Chengjin
or Prince Jin,

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,844
I will not let you get away with it.

38
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,288
Do you understand?

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,266
Don't worry, Mr. Qiao.

40
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,510
I will remember your words.

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,740
All right, you should go now.

42
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,688
Sure, Mr. Qiao.

43
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,580
Dad.

44
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,400
What's the matter, Dad?

45
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,270
Open it.

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,460
Wait...

47
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,700
Wait...

48
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,133
That's a lot of money.

49
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,270
Well,

50
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,420
I've saved up

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,420
nearly my whole life.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,533
Originally, I... I planned
to leave part of it

53
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:24,466
for Qiao Manman.

54
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:25,550
But now that Manman

55
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,955
has found herself a good husband.

56
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:27,688
Thus,

57
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,620
I'm leaving it all to you.

58
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,270
You will use it for your wedding.

59
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,044
No, wait...

60
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,580
I know.

61
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,790
I know you've got your pride.

62
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,230
But with this money,

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,990
you and Aliya can finally
live a happy life together.

64
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:42,888
Isn't that right?

65
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,230
Dad, I can't take this money.

66
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,333
You've worked your whole life
to save it.

67
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:48,590
What do you mean you can't take it?

68
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,510
Isn't my money

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,830
yours too?

70
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,270
If you don't take it,

71
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,900
I won't be at ease.

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,422
Mo.

73
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,000
You've really
made something of yourself.

74
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,270
Time sure flies,

75
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,420
doesn't it?

76
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,270
In the blink of an eye,

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,180
you've grown up.

78
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,820
And now you're getting married.

79
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,300
It makes me happy.

80
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,420
And your late mother...

81
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,470
She'll be happy for you too.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,670
Dad, don't say that.

83
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,890
When you say things like that,
it makes me sad too.

84
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,550
Don't be sad, Dad.

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,230
I'm not sad.

86
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,955
I just worry about this.

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,060
If something happens bad to me

88
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,177
I owe your late mother an explanation

89
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,860
when I meet her in heaven.

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Dad, what are you saying?

91
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,990
You always call yourself tough.

92
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,420
You said you'd live to 180.

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,860
Fine...

94
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,820
Cut back on reading and get some rest.

95
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:01,222
All right, I'm off now.

96
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,420
Well...

97
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,060
Use this money

98
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,910
wisely.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,533
Only spend it where it really counts.

100
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,260
That was such a nice nap.

101
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,710
Here, time to eat.

102
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,350
Sure.

103
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,755
Where's Yuetao?

104
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,620
Don't even ask.

105
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:43,177
Yuetao was worried her embroidery
wouldn't be good enough.

106
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,533
She worked on it all night.

107
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,600
Now she's caught a cold.

108
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,180
She's still sewing out front.

109
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,533
No matter what I said,
she wouldn't stop.

110
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,790
No way, I've got to go check on her.

111
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,200
You eat on your own.

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,940
Wait...

113
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:03,488
(Sun Rises, Moon Endures)

114
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:09,990
Yuetao.

115
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,820
Yuetao.

116
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,860
Get some rest. Stop it already.

117
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,550
Be gentle.

118
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,955
This double-sided embroidery

119
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,940
is fragile and hard to stitch.

120
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,420
If you mess it up,

121
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,155
my whole night's work will go to waste.

122
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,790
Thank you, Yuetao.

123
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,470
All my life,

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,820
I thought it was hard

125
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,150
to meet someone you truly love.

126
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,820
However,

127
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,333
we both found our loved ones.

128
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,740
So we should hold on tight.

129
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,590
Our Yuetao here

130
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,155
just can't wait to get married!

131
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,150
All right, I get it.

132
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,470
I'll go propose to Jiufeng right away.

133
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,940
As soon as our wedding's over,

134
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,350
we'll help arrange yours.

135
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,910
Princess Aliya...

136
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,910
Why are you blushing, Yuetao?

137
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,550
I... I'm not. I...

138
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,060
Liar.

139
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,620
Still denying it, huh?

140
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,620
Come on, tell us about it.

141
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,177
When did you and Jiufeng get together?

142
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:17,590
We didn't...

143
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:18,777
You're really something else.

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,620
Drop the act already.
Just tell us already!

145
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,350
Come on!

146
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:21,910
No!

147
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,990
Say it or we'll tickle you!

148

Spill it!

355
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,190
Retreat.

356
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,666
I'll ask you one more time.

357

Where is Qiao Manman?

358
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
Speak!

359
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,022
She's dead from being blown to bits.

360
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,340
Even if Princess Consort Jin survived,

361
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,910
she'd never forgive Your Highness.

362
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,100
No way...

363
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,990
I want her alive.

364
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,990
I just want her to live!

365
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,100
But...

366
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,630
You've destroyed the last bit of hope

367
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,630
I had to live.

368
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,430
Scram.

369
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,580
Get out!

370
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,020

371
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,740

376
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,470

377
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,190
Who are you?

378
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:54,533
It's me.

379
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,780
I'm your husband, Dear.

380
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,733
Dear.

381
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,190
Outrageous!

382
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,822
I'm a princess. How dare you touch me!

383
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,580
Dear.

384
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,933
You've regained your memory?

385
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,540
Yuetao.

386
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,910
Yuetao!

387
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,990
Yuetao!

388
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,540
Are you all right, Yuetao?

389
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,888
Princess Aliya...

390
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,266
Please save her, Princess Aliya!

391
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,820
Please save her...

392
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,688
I beg of you. Please save her.

393
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,780
Please save her!

394
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,910
Why are you shaking your head?

395
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,990
Please save her!

396
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,470
You'll be all right, Yuetao.

397
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,540
You'll be fine.

398
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,100
Yuetao.

399
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,155
Don't be silly.
Stop putting her on the spot.

400
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,300
You'll be all right.

401
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,870
I used to think

402
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,820
that getting married
was the most important thing

403
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,580
in a woman's life.

404
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,710
But only today did I realize

405
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,488
it's because
you meet someone you truly love.

406
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,390
Thankfully, I met him...

407
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,390
You'll be all right.

408
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,470
I don't want to die with regrets.

409
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,820
Yuetao.

410
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,740
I've got you a bridal veil.

411
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,580
I don't want to become a wandering ghost.

412
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,111
I haven't gotten married yet...

413
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,870
I'll marry you!

414
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,020
Yuetao.

415
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,580
I've made you a bridal veil.

416
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,670
I've got us both this veil.

417
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,044
First... First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

418
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,260
Second...

419
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,470
Second,

420
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,630
bow to the parents.

421
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,430
You may now bow to each other.

422
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,990
Enter the bridal chamber now.

423
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,020
Wake up, Yuetao!

424
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,540
Yuetao!

425
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,630
Yuetao...

426
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,950
Yuetao!

427
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,955
Let me put on your veil.

428
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,540
We're married now.

429
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,950
We're married.

430
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,470
We're now married.

431
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,540
We're married.

432
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,300
We're married now.

433
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,230

434
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:37,230

(Tomb of Beloved Father Ji Kui)

436
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,020
If I had

437
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,630
stayed in the capital,

438
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,390
would they all still be alive?

439
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,990
Our villagers.

440
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,870
Our families.

441
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,950
We wouldn't have ended up this way.

442
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,580
I...

443
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,300
I've failed you all.

444
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,422
I'm sorry...

445
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,580
Dad...

446
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,390
Dad...

447
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,500
Yuetao...

448
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,190
Yuetao...

449
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,470
I'm so sorry...

450
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:41,020
(Tomb of Beloved Father Ji Kui
Tomb of Beloved Father Qiao Yuanzhi)

451
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,920
(Tomb of Beloved Wife Yuetao)

452
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,430
Barrel is just a name.

453
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,822
If it holds water, it's a water barrel.

454
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,955
If it holds grain, it's a grain barrel.

455
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,430
As for what you want to put in it,

456
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,511
you'll find out sooner or later.

457
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,260
Your Highness, don't overthink it.

458
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,910
My father once told me this.

459
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,470
If you care about the people,

460
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,470
then go do what must be done.

461
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,340
If I want to go back,

462
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,990
will you come with me?

463
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,670
Wherever you are,

464
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:06,777
I'll be there.

465
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,710
We're husband and wife,

466
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:10,955
so we'll go through thick and thin.

467
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,230
That day, I finally made it
to the riverbank.

468
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,540
But I accidentally hit my head.

469
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,910
I don't remember

470
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,910
what happened after that.

471
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,780
But I remember always admiring you.

472
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,710
And I remember

473
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,390
you were always the one
I wanted to marry.

474
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,670
If I had just agreed
to marry Prince Jin back then,

475
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,710
perhaps none of this tragedy
would've happened.

476
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,470
It's not your fault.

477
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:27,044
I'm going back to Xilin
to ask Father for reinforcements.

478
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,230
Will you

479
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,870
come with me?

480
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:49,710
(Yinyi Village)

481
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,622
Aliya.

482
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,780
Please be careful

483
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:54,288
on your way to Xilin.

484
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,555
Wait for me in the capital.

485
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,430
Aliya!

486
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,020
Take care.

487
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,260
Dear!

488
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,060
Dear!

489
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,670
Wait for me, Dear!

490
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,580
Dear!

491
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,340
Wait for me, Dear!

492
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,644
That's probably the boldest thing
Mo has ever done.

493
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,190
May his wish come true.

494
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,580
Come on. We should head out too.

495
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:48,420
(Yinyi Village)

496
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:50,730
(Everything Guild)

497
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,820
Your Highnesses.

498
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,260
Word of your survival is out.

499
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,630
Prince Yunnuo must have heard by now.

500
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,710
I wonder how Ji Mo and Aliya are doing.

501
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,230
I hope the letter reached them safely.

502
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,740
If they can return in time,

503
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,511
everything will go much smoother.

504
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,470
Otherwise,

505
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,150
I have another plan.

506
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,020
However,

507
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,422
it'll mean some hardship for you.

508
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,190
Your Highness,

509
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,600
I'll stand with you no matter what.

510
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,150
Your Highness.

511
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,190
Your Highness.

512
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,500
It's Manman.

513
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,340
It's Manman. She's here.

514
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,150
Manman.

515
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,630
- Your Highness.
- Manman.

516
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,260
Your Highness.

517
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:39,888
You're here, Manman.

518
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,260
Your Highness.

519
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,100
You're alive, Manman.

520
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,666
You're really alive.

521
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,500
You're alive.

522
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,190
What's wrong, Your Highness?

523
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,100
Go away!

524
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,600
Yes, Your Highness.

525
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:02,711
Your Highness.

526
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,266
You've already challenged His Majesty.

527
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,150
There's no turning back now.

528
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,444
At this critical moment,

529
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,511
you must not let your guard down.

530
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,470
Manman is gone.

531
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,950
What use

532
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:17,911
is the throne to me now?

533
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,311
Your Highness.

534
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,990
Even if not for yourself,

535
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,155
think of Noble Consort.

536
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,990
Her?

537
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,740
She never cared for me.

538
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,060
All she ever cared about was my father.

539
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,470
Your Highness.

540
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:41,133
We've found
Princess Consort Jin's whereabouts.

541
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,260
What did you say?

542
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,100
Is that true?

543
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:48,466
Yes, Your Highness.

544
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,190
She... She's still alive?

545
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,910
Yes, according to our investigation,

546
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,540
she's at the Everything Guild.

547
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,266
That's wonderful!

548
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,150
I knew it.

549
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,260
I knew Manman was still alive.

550
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,710
She's still alive.

551
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,500
Well...

552
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,390
Prince Jin is there too.

553
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,500
He... He's alive as well?

554
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,311
Should we capture them all at once?

555
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,670
No.

556
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,580
Don't act just yet.

557
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,990
You may leave.

558
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes, Your Highness.

559
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:30,390
Your Highness.

560
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,020
Guihu.

561
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,580
You may go too.

562
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,020
Do you no longer trust me?

563
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,300
Leave now.

564
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,666
I've followed you since I was young.

565
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:49,533
And I've risked my life for your sake
due to your trust in me.

566
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,977
Now that I no longer have your trust,

567
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,100
I might as well die.

568
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,933
Indeed, you deserve to die.

569
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:56,622
You disobeyed my orders

570
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,190
by going after Manman.

571
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,020
You then lied,
saying she died in the explosion.

572
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,910
I trusted you.

573
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,500
Yes.

574
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:07,333
I treated you like a close confidant.

575
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,990
But even you don't care how I feel.

576
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,666
Your Highness.

577
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,260
I did all this for your own good.

578
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,311
Everyone says it's for my good.

579
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,755
It's for my sake, huh?

580
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,630
But who's the one who covets the throne?

581
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,990
Is it you or me?

582
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,288
Don't you dare threaten me with death.

583
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,950
You better stay alive.

584
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,580
If not,

585
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,190
I'll make your life a living hell.

586
00:32:47,822 --> 00:32:49,822
No one's to approach
the Everything Guild.

587
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:57,160
(Everything Guild)

588
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,422
Your Highness.

589
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,740
Why don't I go with you?

590
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,870
No need.

591
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,780
I'll meet him alone.

592
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,340
Jiufeng.

593
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:08,400
You must protect Manman well.

594
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:10,622
Don't worry, Your Highness.

595
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,670
Manman.

596
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,022
You must be extra careful.

597
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,266
I'll wait for your return.

598
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,580
Wait for me.

599
00:33:59,088 --> 00:33:59,540
Brother.

600
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,230
It's been so long.

601
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,670
Today, we must catch up with each other.

602
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,533
Where is Father?

603
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
Father has been unwell these days.

604
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,220
I've taken over all state affairs.

605
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,430
As for our meeting today,

606
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,444
let's not bother him with it.

607
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,620
So, what did you

608
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,390
call me here for?

609
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,022
Brother.

610
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:25,422
Life in the wild must be hard
with plain food and little comfort.

611
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,311
You're used to the finer things.

612
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,777
I was worried
you wouldn't be able to endure it.

613
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,555
I invited you over for a gathering

614
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,888
because I cared about you.
