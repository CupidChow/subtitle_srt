27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,940
(Benevolent and Kind)

28
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,830
This way, Your Highness.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,710
Who is Hu Ersa?

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,470
Princess Aliya's cousin.

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,820
He insisted on

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,470
putting you in the carriage that day.

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,700
What?

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,580
Won't he expose me
the moment he sees me?

35
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,470
This is bad news.

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,540
Morning, Your Highness.

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,380
Greetings to Your Highness.

38
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,590
Good morning, Your Highness.

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,940
Sit.

40
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,500
Please enjoy your meal.

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,590
(I'll meet His Majesty in three days.)

42
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,070
(How am I supposed
to deal with Hu Ersa?)

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,620
Aliya.

44
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,380
Does the food not suit your taste?

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,700
That's right.

46
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,980
I tossed and turned all night
and kept kicking off the quilt.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,350
I caught a chill last night.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,940
Now my head feels foggy.

49
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,990
I have no appetite.

50
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,910
(That is a blatant lie.)

51
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,510
(She even said it)

52
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,844
(in front of Madam Chuncan.)

53
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,311
(Is she using Madam Chuncan
to threaten me?)

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,190
Indeed.

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,430
You did sleep
rather restlessly last night.

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,822
You nearly made me
catch a chill as well.

57
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,350
In that case,

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,870
you should go back and rest.

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,940
I...

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,910
(He won't even let me eat.)

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,377
(I'll settle the score with you)

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
(once Madam Chuncan
is back to the palace.)

63
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,220
Your Highness!

64
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,350
(Finally, some peace and quiet.)

65
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,540
What should I do?

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,070
Alright, we'll be seeing
Hu Ersa in three days.

67
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,070
If he recognizes me,

68
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,540
neither of us will survive.

69
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,030
I haven't even married yet.

70
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,540
If I die unmarried,

71
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,030
I'll become a restless ghost.

72
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,500
That will not be your fate.

73
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,620
I have an idea.

74
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,310
What idea?

75
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,430
Play sick.

76
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,630
They surely won't make a sick person

77
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,590
meet His Majesty.

78
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,630
Play sick?

79
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,500
That could work, but...

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,380
You can hide for a while, not forever.

81
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,030
What do we do afterward?

82
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,140
Let's get through this first.

83
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,260
After that...

84
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,390
we'll make a run for it.

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,760
Alright.

86
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,660
Yuetao.

87
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,790
Can you get me some food?

88
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,190
Even with my waist bound this tightly,

89
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,990
my stomach's still growling.

90
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,550
You really think
you're the princess now.

91
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,310
You're ordering me around?

92
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,070
That wasn't an order.

93
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,430
I was asking nicely.

94
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,300
Fair enough.

95
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,190
This is all I have. Make do with it.

96
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,820
His Highness is coming!

97
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,900
Hurry!

98
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,630
What is wrong with you?

99
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,750
(She was clearly sneaking food in here.)

100
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,940
Her Highness is fine.

101
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,340
(Very well...)

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,580
Aliya, it seems you're very ill.

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,550
Jiufeng, summon
an imperial physician at once.

104
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,740
Yes, Your Highness.

105
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,244
Her Highness means there is no need.

106
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:36,700
She is well-versed in medicine.

107
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,555
There is no need
to trouble the physicians.

108
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,990
It seems she is quite ill.

109
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,190
- Jiufeng!
- I shall summon the physician now!

110
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
Hurry and help me change!

111
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,030
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,910
We are doomed.

113
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,100
We are doomed.

114
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,790
Relax.

115
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,510
It's alright.

116
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,990
They have gone to summon the physician.

117
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,550
When the physician arrives later,

118
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,700
and sees you are fine,

119
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,177
you won't be able to fake illness.

120
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,750
We are surely done for.

121
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,580
Don't worry.

122
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,550
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

123
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,070
"Cross that bridge when we come to it"?

124
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,711
(Wedding)
What are you doing sitting here?

125
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,230
You have served your princess for years.

126
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,430
Surely you've learned
a bit about medicine?

127
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,460
Of course I have.

128
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,950
What can you do, then?

129
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,190
I can do all sorts of things.

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,580
I boil herbs, decoct medicine,
hold the syringe, wash the syringes...

131
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,710
That's it?

132
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,150
That's it.

133
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,820
Don't expect too much from a maid.

134
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,780
Alright?

135
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,390
We are done for.

136
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
We are toast.

137
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,260
Sir, this way.

138
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,590
What do we do now?

139
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,240
Quick, block the door!

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,100
Alright!

141
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,950
What do we do? Think of something!

142
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,870
You guys really got me into trouble!

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,430
What do we do?

144
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,630
Why are the doors shut
in broad daylight?

145
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,070
Well, Her Highness is unwell.

146
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,110
She must not catch a draft.

147
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,230
(A draft? A cold! That's it!)

148
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,340
One, two!

149
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,940
One, two!

150
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,780
I brought the physician. Open the door!

151
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,820
Seriously? What are you doing?

152
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,900
Catching a cold and a fever.

153
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
I must work up a sweat to bring it out.

154
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,310
- Hurry, will you?
- Come on, quick!

155
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,422
Don't keep His Highness
and the physician waiting.

156
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:25,380
Coming!

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,070
Sir, we leave it to you.

158
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,070
As you command.

159
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,990
Your Highness, I shall take your pulse.

160
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,870
(She is really playing the part.)

161
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,790
(She even lay down.)

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,870
(When the physician
finds nothing wrong with you,)

163
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,580
(let's see how you explain yourself.)

164
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,940
Please, Your Highness.

165
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,700
(She clearly is not ill,
so why pretend to be?)

166
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,380
Sir...

167
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,380
I must be terribly ill, right?

168
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,990
(It is best
not to meddle in royal affairs.)

169
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,990
What is it, Sir?

170
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,630
Could it be
that Her Highness is not ill?

171
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,790
(I should go along with Her Highness.)

172
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,380
Your Highness.

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,550
Her Highness is indeed gravely ill.

174
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,950
Her pulse...

175
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,220
rises and falls like the tide,

176
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,750
raging and turbulent.

177
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,630
(She is not pretending?)

178
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,990
Sir,

179
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,790
you must treat Her Highness properly.

180
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,870
Yes, Your Highness.

181
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:36,150
There's no need for that.

182
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,670
I can handle it myself.

183
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,444
Let's not trouble
the imperial physician.

184
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,430
I know you are skilled in medicine,

185
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,980
but you heard the physician.

186
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,430
Let him take a look.

187
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,460
No, wait!

188
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
What are the needles for?

189
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Your Highness,

190
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,070
this affliction of wind

191
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,860
is caused by qi deficiency
and wind invasion.

192
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,740
The lungs govern qi.

193
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,980
Qi deficiency lets in the wind.

194
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,666
Wind harms qi, causing a cold or fever.

195
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,460
Cold causes syncope,
and fever causes vexation.

196
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,044
It harms the lungs. It must be
treated with decoction, compress,

197
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,580
and acupuncture.

198
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,340
Rest assured, Your Highness.

199
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,500
I only need to apply
the needle to your Ashi point.

200
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,550
Three inches deep.

201
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,220
You shall recover shortly.

202
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,310
Three inches?

203
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,670
Wouldn't that kill me?

204
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,790
Do not worry, Your Highness.

205
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,670
I know precisely what I am doing.

206
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,820
Stay back!

207
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,790
Look!

208
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,030
Her Highness is about
to suffer a fit of madness!

209
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,620
Quick, hold her down!

210
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,580
Jiufeng!

211
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,340
Subdue her!

212
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,620
No!

213
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,820
Do not worry, Your Highness!

214
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:36,130
(Benevolent and Kind)

215
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,070
I'm the one being poked.
Why are you yelling?

216
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,620
(Her Highness's strength is monstrous.)

217
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,070
Your Highness...

218
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
It pains me that you are in pain.

219
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,030
But still...

220
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,150
Your Highness, your leg

221
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,460
shouldn't feel any pain, right?

222
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,150
My leg?

223
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,460
Of course it feels no pain.

224
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,430
Jiufeng.

225
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,310
Let's leave.

226
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,150
Let us not get in the way

227
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,860
of Her Highness's treatment.

228
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,150
Wait.

229
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,270
Though I feel no pain in my leg,

230
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,390
Sir,

231
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,030
could you help me
remove this silver needle?

232
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,910
I am incredibly sorry for this!

233
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,940
I deserve punishment!

234
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,600
(Quiet and Composed)

235
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,980
Your Highness, they are gone.

236
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,310
Your Highness, does it still hurt?

237
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,700
Of course not.

238
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,940
My leg went numb.
I need to ease it out.

239
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,150
Let's go.

240
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,110
Your Highness.

241
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,460
Shall we continue the treatment?

242
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,230
Never mind, Sir.

243
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,670
I'm already healed.

244
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,820
What?

245
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,150
But I have yet
to perform the acupuncture.

246
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,340
I already told you.

247
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,670
A healer can treat herself.

248
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,310
If you don't believe me,

249
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,940
you may take my pulse.

250
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,030
Your Highness, your medical skills

251
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,860
are truly extraordinary.

252
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,620
In the blink of an eye,

253
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,980
you recovered without medicine.

254
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,670
It is unheard of!

255
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,030
Your Highness,
the physician just reported

256
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,980
that Her Highness has fully recovered.

257
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,740
He even praised Her Highness,

258
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,622
saying her medical skills
are outstanding.

259
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,510
He says she is peerless
among all that he's seen.

260
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,270
Is she really that skilled?

261
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,940
Then, we'd better
keep our distance from her,

262
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,220
in case she starts to notice something.

263
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,670
Your Highness, the water is ready.

264
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,466
You may bathe now.

265
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:29,860
Alright, you may go now.

266
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,670
Stand guard outside.

267
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,620
Don't worry.

268
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,500
I shall remain right outside vigilantly.

269
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,460
I won't move an inch.

270
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,950
Enough.

271
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,860
If you keep talking,
the water will turn cold.

272
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,270
I'll be going.

273
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,790
You're sure the plan is sound?

274
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,340
Of course it is.

275
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,940
My plan is foolproof.

276
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,190
Foolproof?

277
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,580
More like it's full of holes.

278
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,577
Might as well
rename the shop "Everything Fails."

279
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,460
Stop running your mouth.

280
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,510
Listen up.

281
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,860
Your job is to distract Jiufeng.

282
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,510
I'll make His Highness fall ill.

283
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,580
With our powers combined,

284
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,100
success is guaranteed.

285
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,700
But let me be clear,

286
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,340
I'm not very good at acting.

287
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,980
If I mess it up later,

288
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,940
you mustn't fault me.

289
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,780
Yuetao,

290
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,820
you must believe in yourself.

291
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,340
The most important thing
in acting is conviction.

292
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,500
My foot...

293
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,580
It hurts!

294
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,620
What happened?

295
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,700
It hurts so much!

296
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,950
Are you alright?

297
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,910
It hurts!

298
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,220
My foot...

299
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,390
I can't walk.

300
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,350
Let me get it treated.

301
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,790
Did I tell you to wait outside?

302
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,070
Why are you back in here?

303
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,510
Standing guard outside?

304
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,030
What if you need something?

305
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,510
I can't respond quickly.

306
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,740
What are you doing here?

307
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,740
Where is Jiufeng?

308
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,190
Jiufeng? Jiufeng!

309
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,500
Yuetao hurt her foot.

310
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,580
Jiufeng walked her back.

311
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,110
Your Highness...

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,550
This morning,

313
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:32,222
you were so concerned
for my well-being.

314
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,860
Now is the time I repay that kindness.

315
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,580
Great skin!

316
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,190
What exactly are you trying to do?

317
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,620
What could I possibly do?

318
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,460
I merely

319
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,390
prepared some decoction
for you.

320
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,888
To strengthen and nourish the body.

321
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,911
I have no need for that.

322
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,390
Leave now. Get out!

323
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,910
Your Highness, don't be shy.

324
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,870
It hurts so much!

325
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,700
I'm in so much pain!

326
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,620
Your Highness...

327
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,820
Take your time with the bath.

328
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
I'll take my leave now.

329
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,860
My neck...

330
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,620
Jiufeng!

331
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Yuetao!

332
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,190
Well? How did it go?

333
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,150
Did it work?

334
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,910
It worked!

335
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,550
There was a small mishap,

336
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,860
but I pulled it off in the end.

337
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,350
A mishap?

338
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,820
What kind of mishap?

339
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,820
Anyway, I mixed the cold concoction

340
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,030
into the bathwater.

341
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:49,270
Weren't you supposed to make him sick?

342
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,670
It sounds like you tried
to murder your husband!

343
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,220
Watch what you're saying!

344
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,100
Don't worry. He's fine.

345
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,940
Oh right.

346
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,550
Did you bring me food?

347
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,220
All I've had is
half a bun since yesterday.

348
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,711
And you smacked it out of my hands.

349
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,350
Another bun?

350
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,070
I'm sick of buns!

351
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,070
Be grateful for it.

352
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,740
Stop being picky.

353
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,550
Aliya, should you
not give me an explanation?

354
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,630
Your Highness.

355
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,030
I only meant to add
some decoction for you.

356
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,910
I never imagined

357
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,100
it would leave your neck like this.

358
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,030
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,990
I didn't mean it.

360
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Jiufeng, Yuetao,

361
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,390
you two go rest for now.

362
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:43,288
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,580
Your Highness,

364
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,030
allow me to send you back.

365
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,750
Princess Aliya.

366
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,820
There is something
I wish to discuss with you.

367
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,350
Alright.

368
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,510
Go ahead, Your Highness.

369
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,830
Two days from now
is the third-day return.

370
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,711
We shall meet Father
and the envoy from Xilin.

371
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,100
But I injured my neck just now.

372
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,180
It would be disrespectful
to appear like this.

373
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,870
Shall we postpone
the visit to the palace?

374
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,910
What do you think?

375
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,870
Sure.

376
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,270
I mean, what a pity...

377
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,820
I won't get to see
my cousin one last time.

378
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,420
But still, I can't let you

379
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,990
appear in court in such a state.

380
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,180
You are truly considerate,
Princess Aliya.

381
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,180
I am most comforted.

382
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,060
Let's go.

383
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,111
(Never thought a mistake
would turn out so well.)

384
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,380
Your Highness, don't touch it!

385
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,070
Your Highness!

386
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,870
Your Highness...

387
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,710
Your Highness! Are you alright?

388
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,710
Are you hurt?

389
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,870
Sorry,

390
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,990
I didn't mean to.

391
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,820
You just touched
a spore of the luoying grass.

392
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,220
If it touches your skin,
your face will swell like a pig's head.

393
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,310
Could you please

394
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,030
help me up before you start talking?

395
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,780
Of course.

396
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,750
Yes.

397
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,430
Come on.

398
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,820
(You made me fall.)

399
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,466
Come on.

400
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:28,860
(Now let's see
how you like falling down!)

401
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,580
Your Highness, let me help you up!

402
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,580
Well...

403
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
It was an accident.

404
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,470
Your hand was too weak to pull me up.

405
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,710
You didn't hold on properly.

406
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,950
Your Highness,
your neck is normal again.

407
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,380
You're right.

408
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,770
(Benevolent and Kind)

409
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,790
What are you doing?

410
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,660
Sleeping.

411
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,500
You're a man.

412
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,100
Shouldn't you give up the bed for me?

413
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,380
But I can't move my leg.

414
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,550
I can't give it up.

415
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,990
Where am I supposed to sleep?

416
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,110
Why you...

417
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,790
I shouldn't help you.

418
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,390
I should've

419
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,620
let it stay crooked forever!

420
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,470
(Could Princess Aliya
be taking a step back?)

421
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,260
(Regardless,)

422
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,911
(today's encounter proves
her medical skills are formidable.)

423
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,660
(If she stays here too long,
she will become a great threat.)

424
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,215
(Everything Guild)
(Carriage Repairs and Cleaning)

425
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,350
Dad, she's been unconscious all night.

426
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,620
I'll fetch a physician.

427
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,220
I...

428
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,070
What is it, Dad?

429
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,350
How many times must I tell you?

430
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,220
She's fine.

431
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,150
I have roamed
the martial world for years.

432
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,020
Sick or not,

433
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,088
I can tell with a glance.

434
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,311
I know medicine.

435
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,060
Should we at least notify her family?

436
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,710
How many times have I told you?

437
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,500
She is

438
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,030
a girl Qiao Manman
brought from the village.

439
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,950
Her name's Fang. She's here to help.

440
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,020
But judging from her demeanor,

441
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,422
she doesn't seem like a villager.

442
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,020
Don't look down on village folk.

443
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,910
Besides,

444
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,430
do you really think your father

445
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,950
talks nonsense and makes things up?

446
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,460
Yes...

447
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,950
How dare you say yes!

448
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,220
How dare you!

449
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,390
That's not what I meant.

450
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,220
I didn't mean that.

451
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,870
Go back to your room and hit the sack.

452
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,980
Get up early tomorrow.

453
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,740
Go find Qiao Manman.

454
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,900
That's what matters.

455
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,630
Alright.

456
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,590
Hurry up, then!

457
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,900
Silly child.

458
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,220
You're such a fool.

459
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,266
How could I possibly
tell you she's a princess?

460
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:23,950
If I told you,

461
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,711
you could slip up
and get Manman in trouble!

462
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:29,990
(Benevolent and Kind)

463
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,270
Bring me water.

464
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,660
Water...

465
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:44,950
Water...

466
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,180
Your Highness, why are you yelling?

467
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,830
I need my sleep!

468
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,190
I want water. Bring me water!

469
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,550
You can't get your own water?

470
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,460
I'm warning you. Stop yelling.

471
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,510
I'm going back to sleep.

472
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,550
You're burning up.

473
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,220
You definitely caught a cold.

474
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,180
This is...

475
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,100
(Seems like he's really sick.)

476
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,380
(No way!)

477
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,950
(Could I really be this lucky?)

478
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,820
Jiufeng!

479
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,820
(Hanyuan Hall)

480
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,870
Greetings, Father.

481
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,630
I have come to inform you

482
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,500
that this afternoon,

483
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,110
I will welcome the envoy from Xilin

484
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,466
for an important discussion.

485
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,620
Alright.

486
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,350
Yunnuo.

487
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,500
These past few days,

488
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,590
I've been busy handling
the tributes from the envoys

489
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,660
and haven't checked on you.

490
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,340
How is your hand? Has it healed?

491
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,590
Yes, it is.

492
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,820
Thank you for your concern.

493
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,260
Good.

494
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,660
Your Majesty!

495
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,800
A message from Prince Jin's Residence.

496
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:04,590
Prince Jin has caught a severe cold.

497
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,790
He may not be available
for the return visit tomorrow.

498
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,070
A severe cold?

499
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,070
Yes.

500
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:10,950
Yunnuo.

501
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,500
Cancel the meeting with the envoy.

502
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,460
I will go visit Jin.

503
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,110
Father.

504
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,150
The meeting concerns

505
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,950
the alliance between Xilin and Luzhao.

506
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,260
Canceling it abruptly

507
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,900
might affect future relations
between the two kingdoms.

508
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,070
I must ask Father to attend personally.

509
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,060
Your Majesty.

510
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,590
Prince Jin specifically asked me

511
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,820
to tell Your Majesty
not to worry about him.

512
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,300
He insists that national affairs
must be the priority.

513
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,380
I believe

514
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,230
if Your Majesty visits Prince Jin,

515
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,860
he will surely rise to greet you,

516
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,350
which would hinder his recovery,

517
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,540
and he would be upset

518
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,550
for failing to live up
to Your Majesty's kindness.

519
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,990
Jin is truly thoughtful.

520
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,180
Curse Prince Jin.

521
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,111
He's earning more favor
from His Majesty.

522
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,860
He'd even go as far as missing
the third-day return visit.

523
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,000
Plus, how could His Majesty

524
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,270
treat you this way?

525
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,100
Who do you think you are?

526
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,577
You dare criticize my father?

527
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,660
My deepest apologies.

528
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,020
Get up.

529
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:12,260
Brother feigning illness

530
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,270
is nothing new.

531
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,150
Go to the palace

532
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,466
and find a trustworthy physician

533
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,350
to stand by for him.

534
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,220
Yes.

535
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,230
Hu Ersa departs in two days.

536
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,820
Prepare some gifts for him.

537
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,070
Hu Ersa

538
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,660
is Princess Aliya's cousin.

539
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,230
And not a close one.

540
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,510
A cousin who's eager
to claim the Xilin throne.

541
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:35,340
Assign someone to watch Hu Ersa.

542
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,990
Keep track of his every move.

543
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,340
This man is ambitious.

544
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,844
We can't let him spark trouble.

545
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,166
Yes.

546
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,050
(Everything Guild)

547
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,270
Miss, you're awake.

548
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,070
Come on, time for breakfast.

549
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,870
Here, eat up.

550
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,110
Come on.

551
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,710
This place feels so unfamiliar to me.

552
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,510
It's like I've never been here before.

553
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,230
Am I really from here?

554
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,820
How could that be?

555
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,710
You're part of Everything Guild.

556
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,510
Then, why don't I remember anything?

557
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,100
I don't remember Manman.

558
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,660
I don't remember Ji Mo.

559
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,140
I don't even remember you.

560
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,660
Are you lying to me?

561
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,340
(Manman is still missing.)

562
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,380
(I have to keep her here for now.)

563
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,900
I did lie to you.

564
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,420
Fault me and yell at me if you want.

565
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,780
But,

566
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,950
you are Ji Mo's lawful wife

567
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,270
and my daughter-in-law,

568
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,510
Fang.

569
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,540
My name is Fang?

570
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,670
And Ji Mo is my husband?

571
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,820
Later on, your relationship fell apart.

572
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,580
It fell apart?

573
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,110
Ji Mo even

574
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,420
thought about divorcing you.

575
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,910
Once he brought that up,

576
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,180
you felt terribly wronged.

577
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,910
Therefore,

578
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,060
you acted on impulse.

579
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,088
Because of that impulse,

580
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:00,170
you jumped into the river.

581
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:01,180
After you jumped in,

582
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,140
you lost consciousness.

583
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,820
And then, you lost your memory.

584
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,060
Ji Mo is my husband?

585
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,230
How could I possibly argue with him?

586
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,900
He's so good-looking.

587
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,870
Why would I argue with him?

588
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,500
Fang?

589
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,620
What are you mumbling about?

590
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,310
Did you understand everything?

591
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,470
Yes, I did.

592
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,950
However, I do have one question.

593
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,910
Ask away.

594
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,140
Since we're husband and wife,

595
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,820
does that mean
we're supposed to sleep together?

596
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,820
(Prince Jin's Residence)

597
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,270
This Princess from Xilin

598
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,750
has been quite active lately.

599
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,830
Looks like she's trying
to avoid meeting Hu Ersa.

600
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,980
There must be

601
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,820
some bad blood between them.

602
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,220
Your Highness?

603
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,350
Your Highness?

604
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,910
Your Highness! You can't do this!

605
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,590
You can't do this!

606
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,670
Jiufeng, let go of me!

607
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,460
I can do it!

608
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,740
I can stand up!

609
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,666
- Let me go!
- Your Highness!

610
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,020
You can't move your legs.

611
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,950
Just rest for now.

612
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,150
Let go of me! Let go!

613
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,688
Let go!

614
00:27:06,688 --> 00:27:07,444
Your Highness!

615
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,870
Take it easy!

616
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,510
Don't push yourself too hard.

617
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,460
Right.

618
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,070
This is good
for treating cold and fever.

619
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,790
Jiufeng,

620
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,580
stay and help him.

621
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,660
I'm leaving.

622
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,180
Don't bother coming back.

623
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,430
Can I return to Xilin now?

624
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,860
Madam Chuncan has left the residence.

625
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,750
You may move out of my chamber now.

626
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,420
As you wish.

627
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:01,055
(Everything Guild)

628
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,820
Father, what is it?

629
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,660
Bad news.

630
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,780
Fang

631
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,030
has been emotionally unstable lately.

632
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,030
I just went up to bring her breakfast,

633
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,911
and she was thinking of ending her life.

634
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,950
What?

635
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,500
She is her parents' flesh and blood.

636
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,150
How could she be so irresponsible?

637
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,150
I'll go talk to her.

638
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,510
Hold on!

639
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,500
Hold on. Get back here.

640
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,820
What is it this time, Dad?

641
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,390
Don't panic just yet.

642
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,950
Hear me out first.

643
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,630
Right now, her emotions

644
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,750
are already under control.

645
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,260
Why was I able to calm her down?

646
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,220
Because I told her

647
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,670
you're her husband.

648
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,630
What?

649
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,590
I had to give her
something nice to hold on to

650
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,230
while she's lost her memory.

651
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,670
Father, how could you lie to her?

652
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,950
That is clearly not true!

653
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,180
Saving a life is more important
than telling the truth.

654
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,830
Now that she's calm,

655
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,630
don't mess it up.

656
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,350
But...

657
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,950
But what?

658
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,100
What's there to argue?

659
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,300
This is actually very simple.

660
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,350
If one day

661
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,390
Fang sees you

662
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,820
and calls you husband,

663
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,710
you just play along with it.

664
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,700
When she calls you husband,

665
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,990
just say hey.

666
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,300
See? All taken care of.

667
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,260
But...

668
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,550
Fine.

669
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,030
That's more like it.

670
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,340
Alright. Go on with your day.

671
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,470
All of you are exasperating.

672
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,460
Princess Aliya

673
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,180
is getting weirder by the day.

674
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,310
Your Highness,

675
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,900
that's the perfect way to put it.

676
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,510
But I think

677
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,870
if she weren't strange,

678
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,550
she wouldn't be worthy
of being a princess.

679
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,420
Go on, explain.

680
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,660
Please take a look.

681
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,980
They say in the western land,

682
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,510
there's a curious princess
as lovely as a flower.

683
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,500
Kind and adorable.

684
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,910
She loved playing with butterflies.

685
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,500
But then,

686
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,460
she pricked her finger
on a spindle by accident.

687
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,510
She fell into a deep sleep.

688
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,780
Luckily, a handsome
foreign man saved her.

689
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,990
They fell in love and eloped together.

690
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,350
Next page.

691
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,110
In the western land...

692
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,540
Hold on.

693
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,500
There was a...

694
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,110
Now that you mention it,

695
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,460
Princess Aliya

696
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,550
doesn't seem so strange after all.

697
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,020
Still, she's a divine physician.

698
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,830
We really should think of a way

699
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,870
to keep her away from me.

700
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,430
So, Your Highness,

701
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,710
what are you planning?

702
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,350
They say there's a medicine
that can fake death.

703
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,470
The Resurrection Pill.

704
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,590
If I can get my hands on it,

705
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,030
I'll be able to disappear for good.

706
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,630
Princess Aliya will then
be sent back to Xilin,

707
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,300
growing old in solitude.

708
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,470
That's quite pitiful too.

709
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
She saved my life.

710
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,711
And she came to marry
for peace between nations.

711
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,460
If I fake my death,
she might end up alone forever.

712
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,900
I should probably help her
find a new home instead.

713
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,270
The home I want?

714
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,590
Exactly.

715
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,670
I'll do my best to avoid that path.

716
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,060
During this whole fake marriage act,

717
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,540
I'll make sure not to
let our vibes sync too much

718
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,660
in case you fall for me
and can't help yourself.

719
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,100
Your Highness,
you're seriously overthinking this.

720
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,350
When it comes to my taste in men,

721
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,790
I like to keep it pretty simple.

722
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,830
Handsome, gentle, refined,
and well-read.

723
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,700
Those go without saying.

724
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,470
But the most important thing is
he must be physically agile.

725
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,910
None of which, unfortunately,

726
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,510
has anything to do with you.

727
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,030
Handsome, gentle, refined, well-read...

728
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,230
Physically agile...

729
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,180
Sounds familiar.

730
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,550
Wait, it looks familiar.

731
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,990
Your Highness, look here.

732
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,100
This is a popular tabloid in town.

733
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,950
It contains commentary on the elite

734
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,550
of our Luzhao Kingdom.

735
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,790
The description
of Prince Yunnuo in here

736
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,070
matches exactly what she just said.

737
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,910
But it also says

738
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,660
he is not favored by His Majesty
and has no accomplishments.

739
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,740
His future is uncertain.

740
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,380
Turns out that people
really do see things clearly.

741
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,710
What does it say about me?

742
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,310
It does mention you.

743
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,710
Here it is.

744
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,030
Prince Jin is

745
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,420
of noble status.

746
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,100
Go on.

747
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,310
Noble status.

748
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,910
That's it.

749
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,700
What garbage book is that?

750
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,070
Burn it.

751
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,100
His Majesty really does play favorites.

752
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:42,310
Father worries
about my brother's health.

753
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,500
He's concerned.

754
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,620
And that's only natural.

755
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,790
But, you're also his son.

756
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,140
I was out of line.

757
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,340
I shouldn't gossip.

758
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,790
I'll go take my punishment.

759
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,910
Forget it.

760
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,020
Your Highness.

761
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,990
So what should we do next?

762
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,620
Right now,

763
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:02,350
my brother is claiming to be ill.

764
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,550
As his younger brother,

765
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,340
I should pay him a visit

766
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,180
to show my concern.

767
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,830
Prepare some tonic.

768
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,660
Tomorrow, we'll pay him a visit.

769
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,150
We should check on him
and his wife,

770
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,660
and take a look around the manor

771
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,620
to see what secrets lie within.

772
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,740
Yes, Your Highness.

773
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:20,250
(Benevolent and Kind)

774
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,820
Is there seriously not even
a dog hole in this huge residence?

775
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,380
I wonder how things
are going on Yuetao's end.

776
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,260
Who are you?

777
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,990
Prince Yunnuo?

778
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,900
I am Princess Consort Jin.

779
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,380
Princess Consort Jin?

780
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,070
Your sister-in-law.

781
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,510
(She's the one who saved my brother
at the Lantern Festival.)

782
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,750
Princess Consort Jin.

783
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,740
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

784
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,460
Princess Consort Jin.

785
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,220
You dropped your coin pouch.

786
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,470
That's quite a bit of silver

787
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,950
to be carrying around.

788
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,070
Better to have more than less, right?

789
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,300
Is that so?

790
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,910
I think what you meant to say was,

791
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,780
"More skills are better than none."

792
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,660
Correct.

793
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,060
"More skills are better than none."

794
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,470
You're well-versed in idioms.
I really admire that.

795
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,350
I'll take my leave now.

796
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,220
(This princess from Xilin...)

797
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,300
(acts nothing like a normal person.)

798
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,470
(She really is quite intriguing.)

799
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:11,600
(Prince Jin's Residence)

800
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,790
Your Highness.

801
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,550
Prince Yunnuo showed up uninvited.

802
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,790
What do you think he's here for?

803
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,910
Why he came doesn't matter.

804
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,390
What matters is the timing.

805
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,190
What do you mean?

806
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,750
Princess Aliya

807
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,270
is into men like Yunnuo.

808
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,580
Handsome and elegant.

809
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,620
Gentle and refined.

810
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,910
Well-read and cultured.

811
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,030
And physically agile.

812
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,020
Since that's her type,

813
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,666
and I'm bound
to leave the palace anyway,

814
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:34,660
why not help them along?

815
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,190
Your Highness.

816
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,260
She's still your wife.

817
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,230
Jiufeng.

818
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,230
This marriage is fake.

819
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,350
If it doesn't affect

820
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,866
the alliance between our nations,

821
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,910
why not entrust her to my brother?
