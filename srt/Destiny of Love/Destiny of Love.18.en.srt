00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,400
=Episode 18=

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Wait, General.

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,910
Have you ever heard
of "a little effort goes a long way"?

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,990
Never figured you knew
about things like that.

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,600
Hold on!

31
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,580
What now?

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,140
General.

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,030
You clearly agree

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,580
with what I said.

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,140
You must know

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,140
my sect doesn't make a move lightly.

37
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,600
Why don't we make this the challenge?

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,300
Let me convince you fair and square.

39
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,670
This way,
neither of our kingdoms will lose honor.

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,866
What do you say?

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,070
All right. I'm not afraid of you.

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,911
So how do we do this?

43
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,580
You're famous

44
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,580
for your strength.

45
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,990
Today,

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,270
I'll use just one finger

47
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,390
to stop you from standing up.

48
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,180
Do you believe it?

49
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,620
Are you here to fight,
or to make me laugh?

50
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,070
Are you scared, General?

51
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,044
Scared? Of you?

52
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,510
Go ahead.

53
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,670
- Great!
- Well done!

54
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,577
Indeed.

55
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:25,955
Again!

56
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,140
Do it.

57
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,955
Why can't I stand up?

58
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,444
When a person wants to stand,

59
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,790
they need to lean forward,

60
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,600
shifting their center of gravity,

61
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,230
so they can push off

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,420
with their legs.

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,180
But that forward force is small

64
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,377
and hard to control.

65
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,866
Finger pressure is much easier
to control.

66
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,400
If the forehead
is pressed with a finger,

67
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,400
it blocks the forward lean,

68
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,420
and without that,
you simply can't stand up.

69
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,150
You're so clever!

70
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:31,230
This can't be.

71
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,260
This is impossible!

72
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,230
Luzhao truly has talents
in every corner.

73
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,060
Never thought

74
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,350
I'd lose to a mere commoner.

75
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,060
Excellent.

76
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,590
General Hu possesses
unmatched martial skills,

77
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,377
yet he still humbly admits defeat.

78
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,911
Luzhao and Xilin will surely remain
strong allies for generations to come.

79
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,329
Ji Mo's performance pleases me.

80
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,650
From this moment forward,
he is named the Martial Champion.

81
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,844
Thank you, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

83
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,190
(Everything Guild)

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,150
Here we go!

85
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,622
Here.

86
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,420
You're elated, Dad.

87
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,820
Of course.

88
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,820
My son is the Martial Champion.

89
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,022
Also, Qiao Manman and Prince Jin
will be here soon.

90
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,619
I need to prepare more dishes!

91
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,422
- Dad. Stay grounded.
- Hurry up!

92
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,222
Fang.

93
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,670
I wonder.

94
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,030
Prince Jin is a man
of important stature.

95
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,180
Is this meal

96
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,150
a little too simple?

97
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,060
Not at all, Dad.

98
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:06,600
You're right.

99
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,230
Let me break it down for you.

100
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:10,177
No matter how important Prince Jin is,

101
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,940
he has married Manman.

102
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,060
That makes me his father-in-law.

103
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,300
When he greets me, he'll have to say,

104
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,711
"Greetings, Father-in-law.

105
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,470
Please accept a bow

106
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,150
from your humble son-in-law."

107
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,820
Now that's respect!

108
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,670
Greetings, Father-in-law.

109
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,644
Please accept a bow
from your humble son-in-law.

110
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:33,466
Your Highness, please accept a bow

111
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,790
from this humble commoner.

112
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,977
That's not necessary.

113
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,955
You raised Manman,
and I am forever grateful.

114
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,710
There's no need to go that formal.

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,550
We're all familiar with each other now.

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,555
Let's just keep things casual.

117
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,180
Right. Casual's best.

118
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,550
I was just running my mouth.
Please don't take it seriously.

119
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,150
Come, come! Do sit down.

120
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,110
Let's all sit.

121
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,644
I raise a toast to you, Your Highness.

122
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,990
You not only saved my husband's life,

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,940
but also helped him earn honor.

124
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,470
I'm beyond grateful.

125
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

126
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,550
Me too.

127
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,180
Count me in too.

128
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,590
Together.

129
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,300
Here, here.

130
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,350
Ji Mo's mother

131
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,155
passed away too soon.

132
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,150
All these years,

133
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,740
I've been both father and mother to him.

134
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,350
But it's all been worth it.

135
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,740
As they say,

136
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,044
what you give comes back eventually.

137
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,910
My Ji Mo...

138
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,420
My son, Ji Mo,
is now the Martial Champion!

139
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,670
And

140
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,470
I'm blessed
with a wonderful daughter-in-law.

141
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,260
She is so filial.

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,190
And Manman.

143
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,350
Even though you're not
my daughter by blood,

144
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,020
after all these years,

145
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,310
you're just like one to me.

146
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,740
Dad...

147
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,140
Don't mind me.

148
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,620
I just want all of us

149
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:46,540
to be safe and sound.

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,230
That's true happiness.

151
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,020
Safe and sound.

152
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,500
Fu.

153
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,430
Fill up your cup!

154
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,620
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

155
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,140
Wait.

156
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,570
Do you know the finger-guessing game?

157
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:02,288
Let's do a round.

158
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,900
It's simple. You throw this shape.

159
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:04,310
Dad.

160
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,070
If I get it right,

161
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,190
I win.

162
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,070
If I get it wrong, then we both...

163
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,780
Dad.

164
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,660
I'm not drunk.

165
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,350
Yes, you are.

166
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,070
I'm just happy.

167
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:11,830
It's your bedtime.

168
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,470
I'm not drunk.

169
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,140
Let's go.

170
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,020
Come on.

171
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,239
Enjoy yourselves.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,660
All right.

173
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,110
Enjoy.

174
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,830
Finding a familiar face
in a distant land.

175
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:20,000
Relief at last with rain
after endless drought.

176
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,950
The joy of seeing your name
atop the exam list.

177
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,470
A blissful night in the wedding chamber.

178
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,470
Mr. Ji is having

179
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,470
the best day of his life.

180
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,350
Do you want to make him even happier?

181
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,780
How do you do that?

182
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,070
Well, I don't think

183
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,070
we can do anything

184
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,540
about the first two lines.

185
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,110
But there is something

186
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,822
we can help with.

187
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,950
Seeing your name atop the exam list?

188
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,470
Ji Mo's already the Martial Champion.

189
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:00,590
What else?

190
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,540
And the blissful night...

191
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,733
I knew you were up to no good.

192
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,430
Qiao Manman, I'm just being filial.

193
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,666
Don't you understand?

194
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,860
I can't believe I lost to a scholar.

195
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,540
What a disgrace.

196
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,977
Isn't this exactly what we wanted?

197
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:28,733
The process was just different.

198
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,911
There's no need to dwell on it.

199
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,260
As you said,

200
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,260
Ji Mo is on Fu Chengjin's side.

201
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,310
Now, he's the Martial Champion.

202
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,590
Doesn't that just hand
Fu Chengjin even more power?

203
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,110
Ji Mo is only the beginning of our plan.

204
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,660
What do you mean?

205
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,740
Tomorrow, I'll submit a memorial

206
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:54,733
recommending Ji Mo
for a post in the south.

207
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,590
The southern border
has been restless lately.

208
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,310
His Majesty has been stressing about it.

209
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,860
Since Ji Mo defeated you,

210
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,140
I'll be following Father's wishes

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,830
by sending him south.

212
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,977
It will go smoothly.

213
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,660
Good.

214
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,977
That's a brilliant move.

215
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,260
When the army is strong,
attack the general.

216
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,590
When the general is strong,
attack his weakness.

217
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,430
But what about Qiao Manman?

218
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:33,190
I have plans for her.

219
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,350
Plans of your own?

220
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,070
Fine.

221
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,350
Make your plans.

222
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:42,900
Plan away.

223
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,430
Fu Chengjin.

224
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,230
I have something to tell you.

225
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,260
Go ahead.

226
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,430
Ms. Fang

227
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,740
is the real Princess Aliya.

228
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,590
The one you were supposed to marry.

229
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,311
So what?

230
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,900
The person I love

231
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,990
is you.

232
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,900
I want to run away with you,

233
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,377
to a place where it's just the two of us.

234
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,710
No...

235
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,110
No way...

236
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,466
Are you trying to back out?

237
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,620
No.

238
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,500
We have to bring

239
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,230
Yuetao, Jiufeng, Mr. Ji,

240
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,590
and the others with us too.

241
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,350
Right.

242
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,070
There's something important

243
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,380
I want to do with you.

244
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,470
Come on, Your Highness!

245
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,590
Take off your shoes.

246
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,540
My shoes?

247
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,380
Take them off and get into bed.

248
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,110
Come on.

249
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,470
Come!

250
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,140
Come closer.

251
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,990
Help me draw the bed curtains.

252
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,933
Your Highness.

253
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,710
Once we do this together,

254
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:22,350
there'll be nothing left between us.

255
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,110
There'll be no more secrets between us.

256
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,590
I will be honest with you,

257
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,430
love you, and protect you.

258
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,660
You can open your eyes now.

259
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,140
This is what I wanted to do with you.

260
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,310
Your Highness.

261
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,590
The reason I'm showing you this now,

262
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,540
no more secrets,

263
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,310
is because I truly like you.

264
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,230
You are the only person

265
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,110
I've ever had feelings for.

266
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,950
Do you know that?

267
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:22,990
I do.

268
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,540
My mother left me this box.

269
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,044
Inside, there are clues about my father.

270
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,430
All these years

271
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,140
I've carried it with me,

272
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,140
hoping I could open it one day.

273
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,260
But I never figured out how.

274
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,350
Without that,

275
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,590
I never knew what happened to my father.

276
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,990
You opened that so easily!

277
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,620
I'd seen a similar cloud pattern

278
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,909
at my mother's place before,

279
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,830
so I just opened it.

280
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,970
(To My Beloved Wife)

281
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,830
Want me

282
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,540
to help?

283
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,070
No.

284
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,990
I want to do it myself.

285
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,210
(To My Beloved Wife)

286
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,260
(I don't know
when I might see you again.)

287
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,710
(If I don't return on the 15th,)

288
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,950
(take Manman and run far, far away.)

289
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,830
(Take good care of our daughter.)

290
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,111
(If there is a next life,)

291
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,020
(may we meet)

292
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,900
(and never part again.)

293
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,070
(My mother)

294
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,230
(waited her whole life.)

295
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,230
(She hoped and hoped,)

296
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,660
(until sorrow took her.)

297
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,310
(In the end,
she never saw my father return.)

298
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,777
(As it turns out...)

299
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,260
(he's already gone.)

300
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:08,810
(Prince Jin's Residence)

301
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:11,340
Have you thought this through?

302
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,430
I plan to leave with His Highness.

303
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,020
He never really liked it here anyway.

304
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,190
But His Majesty
values Prince Jin so highly.

305
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,300
Would he allow that?

306
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,740
His Highness says he has a way.

307
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,150
Something about a cunning escape?

308
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:29,190
I don't quite get it.

309
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,820
But I trust him.

310
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,870
You said

311
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:40,060
you'd bring me and Jiufeng too, right?

312
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,820
Still thinking about Jiufeng
at a time like this?

313
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,470
I'm doing this for His Highness.

314
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,950
Those two

315
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,955
are practically inseparable.

316
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:53,111
Your Highness.

317
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,190
Come in.

318
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,870
A letter from Prince Yunnuo.

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,311
Just throw it away.

320
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,430
The messenger said I must tell you

321
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:06,155
it is a matter of life and death.

322
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,490
Your Highness,
I think you should take a look.

323
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,820
What if it is something serious?

324
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:23,190
What's wrong?

325
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,100
Yuetao.

326
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
I need to head out.

327
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,300
You just got my invitation

328
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,820
and you're already here.

329
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,430
Why did you do this?

330
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,244
Why did you suggest Ji Mo be sent south
to suppress the rebellion?

331
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,190
Even if I hadn't,

332
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:41,390
someone else would have.

333
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,910
Father had already made up his mind.

334
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,060
Besides,

335
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,500
Ji Mo is the one who defeated Hu Ersa.

336
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:49,630
Now that the south is in chaos,

337
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,150
isn't sending him to restore order

338
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,190
the most logical choice?

339
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,340
You set us up.

340
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,300
You did this on purpose.

341
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,580
You're indeed clever.

342
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,780
However, the plan is already in motion.

343
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,910
The imperial decree

344
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,390
cannot be overturned.

345
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:09,430
Your Highness!

346
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,990
It's fine.

347
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,100
I upset her.

348
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,710
It's only fair

349
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,533
I let her express her frustrations.

350
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:19,644
Your real target is Fu Chengjin.

351
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,288
Why are you dragging Ji Mo into this?

352
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,100
It's fine.

353
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,990
Take your time.

354
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,820
Think it over

355
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:28,060
carefully.

356
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,666
There's still time to change everything.

357
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:33,244
Listen carefully.

358
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,580
Not a chance!

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,755
Your Highness.

360
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,533
If Princess Consort Jin
figures out the connection,

361
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,311
will it interfere with your plan?

362
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,088
You have to understand.

363
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,480
The one thing in this world
that is truly irreversible

364
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,622
is not an imperial decree.

365
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,100
It is the heart.

366
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,500
Even if they guess the truth,

367
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,340
Father's will is not something

368
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,244
they can overturn.

369
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,000
His Majesty favors Prince Jin.
What if...

370
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,000
Then he never should have
approved my proposal.

371
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,060
Since he did,

372
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,260
it means
he has already made his calculations.

373
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,300
Your Majesty.

374
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,630
The Martial Champion is but a scholar.

375
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,390
Sending him south to suppress rebellion
is no small matter.

376
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,230
I fear...

377
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,100
I never expected him
to actually quell the rebellion.

378
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,300
He is just bait.

379
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,540
Yunnuo, on the other hand,

380
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,910
is getting better

381
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,340
at reading my thoughts.

382
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,260
Your Majesty.

383
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,710
Prince Jin requests an audience.

384
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,020
The fish has taken the bait.

385
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

386
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,630
Jin.

387
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,630
What have you got there?

388
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,540
Father.

389
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,990
These are some pastries.

390
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,060
I hope they are to your liking.

391
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,044
Let me have a try.

392
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,190
I enjoy them very much.

393
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,060
Where did you acquire
such delicious pastries?

394
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,910
Father.

395
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,222
Aliya and I made these.

396
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,533
Princess Consort Jin is something else.

397
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,540
She got my legitimate eldest son

398
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,044
to cook in the kitchen with her.

399
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,670
I have always

400
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,111
appreciated the domestic life.

401
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,150
Jin.

402
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:57,511
You are the legitimate eldest prince
of the Luzhao Kingdom.

403
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,066
What you like is not always

404
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,200
what you get to do.

405
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,133
Just as sometimes,

406
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,390
even if you dislike something,

407
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,511
you still have to do it.

408
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,190
I understand.

409
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,577
Sit down, Jin.

410
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,990
Jin, since you're here,

411
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,670
I will be direct.

412
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,430
Right now, we are short of a commander
on the frontlines.

413
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:33,580
I want to send you there.

414
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:35,990
Father.

415
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,540
That's a responsibility

416
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,470
I may not be able to shoulder.

417
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,910
Jin.

418
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,540
How can you not understand
my good intentions?

419
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,470
If you go to the front
and make a name for yourself,

420
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,710
the position of crown prince

421
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,950
will be yours without question.

422
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,190
With what you just said,

423
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,260
I feel even less able
to accept the task.

424
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,390
Jin.

425
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,390
I have long known

426
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:22,100
Princess Consort Jin's true identity.

427
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,150
And

428
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,300
I am fully aware of the relationship
between her

429
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,340
and the new Martial Champion, Ji Mo.

430
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,150
Please don't punish her.

431
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,540
If there is blame to bear,
let it fall entirely on me.

432
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,260
Jin.

433
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,500
I say this

434
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,190
not to punish them.

435
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,022
If I were to do so openly,

436
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,780
others with ulterior motives
would use it against you.

437
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,155
They'd accuse you
of deceiving the ruler.

438
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,470
You are the only son
of Yan and me.

439
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,022
I will not allow anyone to put you
in a position of guilt or shame.

440
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:22,000
Your thoughtfulness humbles me.

441
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,950
I am deeply grateful.

442
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,230
If you are grateful,

443
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,340
listen to me.

444
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,950
Go to the southern front.

445
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,340
Don't worry.

446
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,100
Once you leave,

447
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,333
I will ensure your consort's safety,

448
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,488
and I will keep this secret for you.

449
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,870
If I go

450
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,390
to the south,

451
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,355
may I make one request?

452
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:56,020
Name it.

453
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:58,470
Could Ji Mo be spared from going?

454
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,200
No.

455
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,533
Given his relationship
with Princess Consort Jin,

456
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:05,822
he would surely be willing to help you.

457
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,430
With him accompanying you,

458
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,910
I can be at ease.

459
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,340
But Father...

460
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,300
Say no more.

461
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,430
I've made my decision.

462
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:26,230
Jin.

463
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,430
Do you think I am forcing you?

464
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,300
I dare not.

465
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,910
Jin.

466
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,950
I have always recognized
your strategic mind.

467
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,580
If you can return from this

468
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,630
with military merit,

469
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,911
you will be the crown prince.

470
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:04,844
And only then

471
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,100
can you truly protect

472
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,990
the person you want

473
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,580
to protect.

474
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,630
I understand

475
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,300
your intentions.

476
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,190
I will go to the south

477
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,622
and I will give it my all.

478
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,630
That's my son.

479
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,230
Go.

480
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,990
I take my leave.

481
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:13,530
(Everything Guild)

482
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,670
It's just a little far,

483
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,060
and a little desolate.

484
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,470
We'll return once the war is over.

485
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,100
I'd count my blessings
if you could return in one piece.

486
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,430
You're normally
the most optimistic of us.

487
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,910
Why are you so pessimistic today?

488
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,020
Because it was Fu Yunnuo

489
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:38,355
who submitted the memorial
suggesting you be sent south.

490
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,888
I'm worried he'll stir up trouble.

491
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,670
I didn't expect
Fu Yunnuo to be so calculating.

492
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,780
This is all my fault.

493
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,340
I provoked him.

494
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,670
Everything happened because of me.

495
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,740
I should have listened to Manman

496
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,300
and not joined
that Martial Champion Selection.

497
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,177
You would've died
even if you hadn't gone.

498
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,190
I said those things

499
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,533
in the moment of heat.

500
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,230
All of this was fate.

501
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,780
So what do we do now?

502
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:10,666
We can't defy the imperial decree.

503
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,177
For now, we assume the post.

504
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,990
Knowing Fu Yunnuo's mind,

505
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,470
I worry there might be some trap
waiting in the south.

506
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,430
Even so,

507
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:25,888
we can only adapt
and overcome the obstacles as we go.

508
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:30,820
Your Highness.

509
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,820
Is there really no other way?

510
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,870
Can you plead with Father

511
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,580
not to send Ji Mo?

512
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,540
Father has already seen
through your identity,

513
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
and Ji Mo's and Aliya's as well.

514
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,088
Yet, he never said a word.

515
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,470
The reason he did that

516
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,710
was to force me to accept the throne.

517
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,500
This is not something

518
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,888
that pleading can solve.

519
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,190
Father is too shrewd.

520
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,870
Don't worry

521
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,540
about Ji Mo.

522
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,670
He is smart and capable.

523
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:03,100
And with me by his side,

524
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,260
I will keep him safe.

525
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:14,780
But you...

526
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,711
I'm more worried about you.

527
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,430
Don't worry.

528
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,910
I'll stay in the residence.

529
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,933
I won't go anywhere.

530
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,100
I'll be fine.

531
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,260
Even though Father promised
to keep you safe,

532
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,555
you must still

533
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,300
be careful.

534
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,340
Got it.

535
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,650
(Benevolent and Kind)

536
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,430
Yuetao.

537
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,311
Help me get that pair of boots
His Highness wears often.

538
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,870
(Bamboo dragonflies symbolize safety.)

539
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,540
(I hope you stay safe and sound
your whole life.)

540
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,470
Why are you still awake this late?

541
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,500
What are you making?

542
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,780
Bamboo dragonflies.

543
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,020
What brought this about?

544
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,020
For safety.

545
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:50,340
My father taught me how to make them.

546
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,910
I made a lot of them.
Bring all of them with you.

547
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,500
I'll wait for your safe return.

548
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:04,430
I'll come back safe.

549
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,880
(Prince Jin's Residence)

550
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,740
Manman.

551
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,990
Come with me.

552
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,580
I haven't finished these.

553
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:33,555
Where are we going?

554
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,950
You'll know when we get there.

555
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,622
Come on.

556
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:43,870
We're here.

557
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,470
Ready?

558
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,390
Do you like it?

559
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,470
I do.

560
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,710
Manman.

561
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,150
If I'm not by your side,

562
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,200
who'll protect you?

563
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,390
I'm Princess Consort Jin.
Who'd dare harm me?

564
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,066
It's you I'm worried about.

565
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,577
The battlefield is merciless.

566
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,300
You must be extremely careful.

567
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,340
I'm more afraid of those

568
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,820
with sinister motives,

569
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,150
who might use your identity against you

570
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,340
in front of Father.

571
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,644
If something happens to you,

572
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,630
and I'm left all alone,

573
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,780
I'd rather die on the battlefield.

574
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,190
Don't ever say such things.

575
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,780
Your Highness.

576
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,060
You must return safely.

577
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll be waiting for you
at our residence.

578
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,910
The bamboo dragonfly symbolizes safety.

579
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,150
With so many of them,

580
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,740
they will keep us safe.

581
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,111
Your Majesty.

582
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:35,340
Prince Jin invited you

583
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,230
to the Imperial Garden
for some family time.

584
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,311
Why did you go but never show up?

585
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,020
That was no attempt
to enjoy time with me.

586
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,333
Did you not hear what he said

587
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,780
while flying the bamboo dragonflies

588
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,780
in the Imperial Garden?

589
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,500
Prince Jin said

590
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,300
they would bring safety
to Princess Consort Jin.

591
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,430
He didn't say that for her to hear.

592
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,340
It was meant for me.

593
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,230
He is heading to war,

594
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,644
and he is worried others
might try to harm her.

595
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,790
So he deliberately released

596
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,310
the bamboo dragonflies there

597
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,500
as a subtle message.

598
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,790
He cares about her

599
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,200
more than he cares about me.

600
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,500
Send more guards

601
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,910
to protect her, discreetly.

602
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:37,066
Yes, Your Majesty.
