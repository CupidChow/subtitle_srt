Is it ready?

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,660
I'm almost finished with this one.

30
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,266
It's ready.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,830
Hurry up!

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,111
Be careful! It's hot!

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:04,860
Well?

34
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,550
Is it good?

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,390
It's sweet!

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,030
You sure know
how to roast a sweet potato.

37
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:09,955
It's good, isn't it?

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,066
I'll get going.

39
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:31,333
What's the matter?

40
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,777
Have a sweet potato.

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,790
You've been rather distracted lately.

42
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,700
Yuetao.

43
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,390
What do you think will happen

44
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,044
if His Highness's legs can't be healed?

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,700
Hey!

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,420
You're worrying about his legs

47
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,510
instead of your pretty little head?

48
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,020
You've already fallen in love

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,488
and you're in denial.

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
No, I'm not.

51
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,300
We need to cure his legs

52
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,670
so we can stay safely in this residence.

53
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,020
Besides,

54
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,580
I've yet to open the Golden Box

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,550
my mother left me,

56
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,030
and I still haven't found my father.

57
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:16,444
I can't just give up yet.

58
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,740
If only Princess Aliya were here.

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,230
She'd definitely be able
to cure His Highness.

60
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:29,400
You could return to Everything Guild

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,244
and ask Princess Aliya
to examine him herself.

62
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:36,480
(Everything Guild)

63
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,800
Smells great.

64
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,830
Mr. Ji.

65
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
You scared me.

66
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,350
You didn't make a sound at all.

67
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,150
Did you spend all the money
I gave you again?

68
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:53,900
No.

69
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,390
No?

70
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,350
Then why are you drying radish again?

71
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,140
You can get those anywhere.

72
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,711
You young people just do not get it.

73
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,111
Can what is sold outside compare

74
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,460
with what you make yourself?

75
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,580
You are just stingy.

76
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,200
You can't bear to part with your money.

77
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:13,755
Who are you calling stingy?

78
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,460
Wait.

79
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,470
Why are you not
at Prince Jin's Residence?

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,800
What are you doing back here?

81
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,311
I came to see you, of course.

82
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,940
Came to see me?

83
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,620
Do you think I don't know you?

84
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,866
You don't come knocking
unless you want something.

85
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,088
Spit it out. What is it?

86
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,820
I really did come to see you.

87
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,230
And also, to praise your idea.

88
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,177
What's the good news?

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,800
You will never believe it!

90
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,740
Yesterday, Prince Jin stood up!

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,790
Just like this.

92
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,260
Didn't last long though.

93
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,990
If he actually manages to recover,

94
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,150
I deserve some credit, right?

95
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,910
Of course!

96
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,710
Mr. Ji.

97
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:01,230
Here's what I'm thinking.

98
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,180
Mr. Ji.

99
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,060
There's something

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,420
I need you, Ji Mo, and Fang

101
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,860
to help with.

102
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,380
Of course.

103
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,266
Just say the word.

104
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,350
See,

105
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,710
I want to bring Prince Jin here

106
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,600
and have Fang take a look at his legs.

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,260
After he stood up that one time,

108
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,030
he stopped making any progress.

109
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,820
He's a prince.

110
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,288
And you want to bring him here?

111
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,590
Manman.

112
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,180
You need to think this through.

113
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,420
If he comes here

114
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,180
and recognizes Aliya,

115
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,230
we'll all lose our heads!

116
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,670
No.

117
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,380
I promise you, he has never seen Aliya.

118
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,244
Here's what we'll do.

119
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,444
You guys help me act out a little scene.

120
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:47,670
As long as we don't slip up,

121
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,733
he won't suspect a thing.

122
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,030
Mr. Ji.

123
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,110
Look,

124
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,260
if I can't cure him,

125
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,860
my head's already hanging by a thread.

126
00:05:59,550 --> 00:05:59,990
Right?

127
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,550
Besides,

128
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:05,400
I haven't opened

129
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,550
the Golden Box.

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,910
I still haven't found my father.

131
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,030
Will you really just stand by

132
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,150
and watch me die in that palace?

133
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,230
Woe is me...

134
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,500
Manman.

135
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,670
You make a good point.

136
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,030
So, you're in?

137
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,230
Of course not.

138
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,300
But...

139
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,790
Why not?

140
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,820
Didn't you just say
everything I said was right?

141
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,620
Are you helping me or not?

142
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,110
Oh,

143
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,844
you're such a stubborn old man!

144
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,090
(Prince Jin's Residence)

145
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,350
Is there something on my face?

146
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,577
What are your plans tomorrow,
Your Highness?

147
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,066
That depends on you, doesn't it?

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,910
So, you'll go along with whatever I say?

149
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,022
Just tell me what you want.

150
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,590
Here's the thing.

151
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,670
After I came to Luzhao Kingdom,

152
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,150
I happened to meet a miracle physician.

153
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,670
And?

154
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,030
Well,

155
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,110
she may not be quite as good as me,

156
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,670
but she's skilled and kindhearted.

157
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,309
I want to take you to see her

158
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,333
and see if there are
other treatments worth trying.

159
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,300
Your concern is touching.

160
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,733
I can't possibly rain on your parade.

161
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,180
Let's eat.

162
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,710
Mo, can you stop shaking your leg?

163
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,550
I'm just anxious.

164
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,380
Why are they not here yet?

165
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,670
You act like
you've never seen a prince before.

166
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,150
What's there to be nervous about?

167
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,670
Stop that right now.

168
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,030
Father.

169
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,133
Why are you shaking too?

170
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm curious
what my brother-in-law looks like.

171
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,860
What kind of miracle physician

172
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,020
only sees patients this late at night?

173
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,155
You don't get it.
This miracle physician doesn't like

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,840
treating people during the day.

175
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:55,740
Too noisy, too crowded.

176
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,470
That's why we had to come
in the middle of the night.

177
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,844
Just follow my lead

178
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,310
when we get there.

179
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,660
Still, with the dark sky and no moon,

180
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,860
it feels more like a good time

181
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,710
for murder than medicine.

182
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,990
Shut up.

183
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,609
(Everything Guild)

184
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,350
We're here.

185
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,990
Your Highness, this is the place.

186
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,155
I'll let them know we're here.

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,590
(Everything Guild? Is she not worried
about blowing her cover?)

188
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,190
Mr. Ji!

189
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,710
Mr. Ji!

190
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,020
Coming!

191
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,540
All right.

192
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:31,190
(Everything Guild)

193
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,140
Princess Aliya,
we've been expecting you.

194
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,190
And this must be Prince Jin.

195
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,860
A refined young man indeed.

196
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,540
My respects to you, Your Highness.

197
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,733
No need for formalities.

198
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,350
Um...

199
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,230
Let me introduce you.

200
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,860
This is Mr. Ji

201
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,710
from Everything Guild.

202
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,950
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ji.

203
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,470
Mr. Ji.

204
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,350
Is Ms. Fang around?

205
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:55,860
- She is...
- My dear sister!

206
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,260
You're back!

207
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,540
I couldn't hold her back.

208
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,860
Well...

209
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,266
We're sworn sisters.

210
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,470
I see you've adjusted to life

211
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,444
in Luzhao quite well.

212
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,830
You flatter me.

213
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,733
Let's chat inside.

214
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:19,230
Come in.

215
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,590
So, this is the husband
you've told us about?

216
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:30,066
Nice to meet you, my brother-in-law.

217
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,740
Ms. Fang.

218
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,380
Please examine his legs.

219
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,830
Please be seated.

220
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,900
(Will she realize that my legs)

221
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,822
(are actually perfectly fine?)

222
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,500
I heard

223
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:13,830
your injury came from a fire

224
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,140
when you were young?

225
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:16,710
Yes.

226
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,020
Muscles and bones are firm.
Meridians are open and flowing.

227
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,430
It's not a bone-related issue.

228
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,590
By all logic,
you shouldn't be in this condition.

229
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,230
Strange.

230
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,830
Strange how?

231
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,990
(Am I the one
who's going to have my cover blown?)

232
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,230
Judging by the pulse,

233
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,688
there is a restless internal heat
moving through his body.

234
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,377
Heat toxins are flaring up
in both the upper and lower burners.

235
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,844
But it is manageable.

236
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,529
Find lotus seeds
harvested in early autumn

237
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,729
and have him eat the plumule raw.

238
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,860
They will clear out the toxins
and suppress the fire.

239
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,140
(She really is skilled.)

240
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,740
(I mustn't stay here any longer.)

241
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,133
What about his legs?

242
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,710
His legs are mostly fine.

243
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,500
It's likely psychological trauma

244
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,710
caused by a childhood injury.

245
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:14,644
And matters of the heart

246
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,955
require heart-based treatment.

247
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,111
The lotus seeds can also help
to calm the mind.

248
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,430
They are good for his health.

249
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,590
But...

250
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,430
I'm running out of time.

251
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,533
Don't lose hope.

252
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,590
With time and persistence, it will work.

253
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,990
Princess Aliya.

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
We kept our humble business

255
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,350
open until this hour just for you.

256
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,990
Shall I prepare some refreshments

257
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,310
for a midnight bite?

258
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,740
I appreciate it, Mr. Ji.

259
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,780
But it seems

260
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,977
there is no clear problem
with my legs after all.

261
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,310
It's late.

262
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,350
We shouldn't keep them up, Aliya.

263
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,430
We should head back.

264
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,900
All right.

265
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,600
Okay.

266
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,110
I'll be back another time.

267
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,266
Don't just stand there!
Send our guests off!

268
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Take care!

269
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,020
These kids are taking years
off my life...

270
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,822
Your Highness,

271
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,990
you see, Ms. Fang
is a very good physician.

272
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,260
She's just not quite right in the head.

273
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,711
I've decided.

274
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,244
Starting tomorrow,
I'll look for lotus seeds.

275
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,590
I'll find every last lotus seed
in the capital

276
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,860
and purge the fire from your body.

277
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:59,120
(Liuyun Mansion)

278
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,590
The Everything Guild
has been refusing visitors.

279
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,500
There's definitely
something strange going on.

280
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,977
(Ji Mo and his father Mr. Ji...)

281
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,980
(Qiao Manman and Ji Mo
are as close as real siblings...)

282
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:09,888
Your Highness.

283
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:12,577
We should just bring someone in
from Everything Guild

284
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,470
for questioning.

285
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:15,590
That won't be necessary.

286
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,155
I already have a plan.

287
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,533
Keep watching them.

288
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,800
Don't act on your own.

289
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,580
That reminds me.

290
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,822
What has Princess Consort Jin
been up to?

291
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,555
She's searching all over
for early autumn lotus seeds

292
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,022
to use in Prince Jin's treatment.

293
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,230
Lotus seeds harvested in autumn?

294
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,300
Where have you been? His Highness
has been looking for you all day.

295
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,070
I was...

296
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,600
Why do you have so many lotus pods?

297
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:48,830
These?

298
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,710
These are for treating his legs.

299
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,755
But these aren't enough.

300
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,711
I still need more.

301
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:56,644
I think it's plenty.

302
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,266
Call it a day.

303
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,110
His Highness said

304
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,422
it gets dark earlier in autumn,

305
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,977
so you shouldn't stay out so late.

306
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,020
Why do you keep staring at me?

307
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:28,047
It's late, but you still have

308
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,540
the candles lit.

309
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,311
How am I supposed to sleep
with all this light?

310
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,740
This is my room.

311
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,350
If you are tired,

312
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,111
go to sleep in yours.

313
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,430
Even though we have separate rooms now,

314
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,860
considering how hard

315
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,020
you've been working

316
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,470
to treat my legs,

317
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,990
I suppose I can stay a little longer
just this once.

318
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,590
Well, you're still up.

319
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,190
And I've already peeled all of these.

320
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,177
Why don't you try them?

321
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,830
I refuse.

322
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:03,666
They're too bitter.

323
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,844
They're really not.

324
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,740
Try them.

325
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,020
I said no.

326
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,780
Fine.

327
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,500
I'll prove to you
that they aren't bitter.

328
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:29,860
See?

329
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,860
I'm not lying.

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,040
They're not bitter at all.

331
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,244
I'm not falling for that.

332
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,911
You're acting just like a child.

333
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,480
A grown man who can't handle bitterness.

334
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,070
Come on. I'll feed you.

335
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,311
Open wide.

336
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,660
Open.

337
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,266
That wasn't so bad, right?

338
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,466
It was awful.

339
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,660
Maybe I just happened
to pick a bad one.

340
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,830
I'll pick another one.

the alchemist made a request.

372
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,533
They want you to come in person
to retrieve the pill.

373
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,630
This way, please.

374
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:09,044
All right.

375
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,230
I'll see you off here.

376
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,710
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

377
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,977
Why are you standing there?

378
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,955
Go on in.

379
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,060
Father.

380
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,870
Is Fang home?

381
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,244
Where else would she be?

382
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,288
No.

383
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,511
That's not what I meant.

384
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,630
The academy is hosting

385
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,300
a gathering.

386
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,870
That's great.

387
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,870
I want to...

388
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,740
I want to invite Fang to come with me.

389
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,020
Mo!

390
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,755
Look at you finally growing up!

391
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,688
You're finally getting it!

392
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,950
You must invite her yourself.

393
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,780
Go on!

394
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,540
I know,

395
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,020
but...

396
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,622
I'm scared.

397
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,260
Mo.

398
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,244
It's just a few words.

399
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,500
What are you so afraid of?

400
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:00,950
I...

401
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,780
I can't do it for you.

402
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,060
That wouldn't make her happy.

403
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,355
You're right.

404
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,800
I guess I won't invite her.

405
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,260
Fang!

406
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
- Dad! You...
- Fang.

407
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,444
He has something to tell you.

408
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,580
What is it?

409
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,430
Nothing.

410
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
"Nothing"?

411
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,688
Don't you have something important

412
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:23,400
to tell her?

413
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:26,044
Give him some encouragement.

414
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,300
Man up.

415
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,950
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

416
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,630
I...

417
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,870
I...

418
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,430
I'm going inside.

419
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,500
Let's talk another time.

420
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,910
Can I help you?

421
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,430
I'm here to get a prescription filled.

422
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,311
A prescription?

423
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,260
Sorry. We're closed for the day.

424
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,340
I heard
there's a female miracle physician here.

425
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,630
I told you.

426
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,990
We're closed for the day.

427
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,500
Hold your horses!

428
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,340
Please stay outside.

429
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,630
You walked in without permission.

430
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
That's trespassing.

431
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,866
Trespassing. Understand?

432
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,870
Pardon my intrusion.

433
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,390
Sir.

434
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,780
Miss.

435
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,060
Do you have my order of lotus pods?

436
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,150
I'm sorry, Miss.

437
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,500
This is all I have left.

438
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,400
I'll still take them.

439
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,288
Thank you.

440
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,822
If you manage to get more,
please save them for me.

441
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,230
I will.

442
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,150
Allow me.

443
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,340
I'll take that.

444
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,244
Aliya.

445
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,190
Prince Yunnuo.

446
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,711
What a coincidence.

447
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,710
What are you doing here?

448
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,777
I'm buying lotus seeds
for your brother's treatment.

449
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,190
Fresh lotus seeds harvested after autumn

450
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,470
are hard to come by.

451
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,390
I happen to know a place

452
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,977
that might have exactly what you need.

453
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,190
Would you be willing

454
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,060
to come with me?

455
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,780
Of course!

456
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,340
You are a real lifesaver!

457
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,222
Let's go, then.

458
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,177
All right.

459
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,540
Prince Yunnuo.

460
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:16,800
Look at all these lotus pods!

461
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,780
This is amazing!

462
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,777
I'll take you down there to pick some.

463
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,190

if we paddle a little further,

468
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,177
we can start picking them.

469
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,777

Coming, Your Highness!

493
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,950
Deliver these
to Prince Jin's Residence please.

494
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,260
Right away.

495
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,020
Thank you.

496
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,260
What a shame it is the wrong season.

497
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,577
Otherwise, this whole pond
would be blooming beautifully.

498
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,260
Between the lotus blossoms and the pods,

499
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,020
I think I like the pods better.

500
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,150
If you like them,

501
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,020
I can...

502
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,740
It's raining.

503
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:20,377
We should find shelter, Prince Yunnuo.

504
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,230
Wait.

505
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,244
Let's go.

506
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,630
I saw Prince Yunnuo
and Princess Consort Jin

507
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,280
running in the rain, picking lotus pods.

508
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,100
What? Running in the rain
and picking lotus pods?

509
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,190
What is it about Princess Consort Jin

510
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,950
that has Yunnuo so smitten?

511
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,910
That girl...

512
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,060
How long until the deadline
His Majesty gave?

513
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,430
Just a few days left.

514
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,990
No matter.

515
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,333
Let her have her fun for now.

516
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,000
I refuse to believe she is untouchable.

517
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,333
What is Your Highness planning to do?

518
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,770
I heard Prince Jin
has shut himself away recently.

519
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,200
No word has come out
of the residence either.

520
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,970
And the deadline is nearly here.

521
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,570
If his legs cannot be healed,

522
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,160
dealing with Princess Consort Jin

523
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,730
will be as easy as squashing a bug.

524
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,570
Your Highness,
everything is within your grasp.

525
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,200
(If you can't heal Prince Jin,)

526
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,850
(then your identity matters little.)

527
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,740
(You will be guilty
of deceiving His Majesty,)

528
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,200
(and I will make sure
the punishment sticks.)

529
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,750
(Everything Guild)

530
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,250
What a beautiful day.

531
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,980
The sun is shining,
and the sky is clear.

532
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,920
(He's been acting strange
these past couple of days.)

533
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,810
(Always holding something back.)

534
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,360
The water is clear...

535
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:14,920
I...

536
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,440
What is it?

537
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,330
I...

538
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,650
I'm leaving then.

539
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,570
Wait, Fang!

540
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,650
Please stay.

541
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
Put that down.

542
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,010
Catch!

543
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,200
What's this?

544
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,330
That's a bamboo sound tube.

545
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,360
A bamboo sound tube?

546
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,090
Put it up to your ear.

547
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,360
I...

548
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,440
I wanted to invite you
to the academy gathering.

549
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,360
I know

550
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,400
this is kind of a weird way to do it,

551
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,290
but...

552
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,070
I'd love to.

553
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,600
Thank you.

554
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,720
What was that?

555
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,640
Thank you.

556
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
I can't hear you.

557
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,050
Thank you, Fang!

558
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,410
All right, then.

559
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,330
I guess I can go with you.

560
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,810
So,

561
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,090
where are we going to dance?

562
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,570
We'll be doing some simple dances

563
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,530
at the academy.

564
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,120
I see.

565
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,850
I need to get back to my writing.

566
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,490
See you later.

567
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,010
"Will you come with me?"

568
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,970
"I will."

569
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,330
Why has His Highness
not been around lately?

570
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,580
His Highness is away for a few days

571
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,980
to attend to some important affairs.

572
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,600
Important affairs?

573
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,340
He can't move very well on his own.

574
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,880
If it were really that important,

575
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,270
why would he not bring you along?

576
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,880
He isn't avoiding Her Highness, is he?

577
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,920
That's impossible.

578
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,440
He likes her too much

579
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,490
to avoid her.

580
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,200
Because her treatment methods
are a little...

581
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,870
A little what?

582
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,840
Well...

583
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,266
I'll show you.

584
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,290
I get it.

585
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,570
I know these moves too.

586
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,200
First move.

587
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,090
Grab the wrist,

588
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,200
then twist.

589
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,560
Second move.

590
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,520
Put them in a chokehold.

591
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,500
I know all these moves.

592
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,630
You've got it all wrong.

593
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,290
Come here.

594
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,920
Pull me.

595
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,920
Grab my arm.

596
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,840
Grab my wrist.

597
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,970
Pull me over.

598
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,600
Hard.

599
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,210
That's right.

600
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,530
And spin.

601
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,570
This is new to me.

602
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Move!

603
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,230
Why did you put your hands all over me?

604
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,880
I did no such thing.

605
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:58,680
Liar!

606
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,970
If word gets out
that you touched me like that,

607
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,050
I'll never get married!

608
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,830
I'll become some lonely wandering ghost!

609
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,840
Who says you won't get married?

610
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,920
You're so annoying!

611
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,210
You don't know anything!

612
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,440
(What's her problem?)

613
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,730
Come here.

614
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,330
Thank you.

615
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Why isn't she here yet?

616
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,600
She's the girl I mentioned.

617
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,600
Her?

618
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,810
Who are you going to pick
as your dance partner?

619
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,920
He isn't here yet.

620
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,300
What are you doing, Mr. Ji?

621
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,580
How are you going to make Mrs. Ji happy

622
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,680
if you're so skittish?

623
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,810
Take it.

624
00:30:59,290 --> 00:30:59,840
Fine.

625
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,730
What... What is that for?

626
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,250
Mr. Ji.

627
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,530
When she shows up,

628
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,490
give her this bouquet.

629
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
She'll love it.

630
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,920
Are you sure?

631
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,090
Of course.

632
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,120
I have never failed

633
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
in romance.

634
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,840
Mr. Ji.

635
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,730
If you do disappoint Mrs. Ji,

636
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,880
next time I see you,

637
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,530
I'll get a whole swarm of girls
to chase you down!

638
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,770
Next up, free dance.

639
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,740
- Great!
- Wonderful!

640
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,770
Come on, Mr. Ji!

641
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:02,920
Hurry!

642
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,360
What beautiful flowers!

643
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,810
Would...

644
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,810
Would you dance with me?

645
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,330
