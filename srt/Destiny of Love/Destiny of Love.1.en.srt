We're going to be late.

we can arrive in 15 minutes.

Xilin's envoy is paying tribute today.

35
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:11,260

review the memorial

Brother.

You're late.

43
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
Is that so?

44
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,950
Why didn't you go in?

45
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,030
I think the time is just right.

46
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,910

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,230
can ever surprise you.

Mr. Pei, look.

71
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,940
There are more surprises here.

72
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,780
Please follow me.

73
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,260
Please look.

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,700
We have a wide range of services
and great capabilities.

Nothing is beyond our reach,
just beyond your imagination.

76
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,070
I believe

77
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,755
you must have heard of it
a long time ago.

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,950
Here. This way, please.

79
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,940
I wonder

80
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,500
why you came to Everything Guild

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,420
this time, Mr. Pei?

82
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,700
My eldest brother is gone.

83
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,020
So a funeral?

84
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,420
No.

85
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,860
My eldest brother

86
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,100
left a son behind,

87
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,780
but he's still young.

88
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:16,740
Wouldn't that mean my sister-in-law
would control everything?

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,780
And then what?

90
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,580
I want to find

91
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,977
a way that doesn't involve bloodshed

92
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,900
to solve the problem.

93
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,620
(This Pei Er is shameless.)

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,177
(He wants to seize
his eldest brother's property.)

95
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,740
Sure.

96
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,980
Mr. Pei.

97
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,140
Your business

98
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,500
isn't difficult.

99
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,900
It's just that...

100
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,060
Everything is under control.

101
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,530
It's out of control!

102
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,240
Why is this donkey out of control?

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,990
Come back here.

104
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,480
How dare you defy me?

105
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,510
Mr. Pei, don't worry.

106
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,460
(Hanyuan Hall)

107
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,580
Yunnuo.

108
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,820
Are you handling security

109
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:07,555
for this year's Lantern Festival again?

110
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,180
That's right.

111
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,866
Do you have any instructions?

112
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,300
The Lantern Festival
was originally a small matter.

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,422
Xilin Kingdom
happens to be paying tribute this year.

114
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,290
There's no room for slackness.

115
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,570
Don't disgrace Luzhao Kingdom.

116
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,700
I will not fail you.

117
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:25,860
During today's tribute ceremony,

118
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,140
Xilin Kingdom's envoy

119
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,980
mentioned marriage to me.

120
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,700
Luzhao Kingdom and Xilin Kingdom

121
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,088
have always had
the tradition of marriage.

122
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,780
Jin.

123
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,380
It's your responsibility
as Prince Jin to marry.

124
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,850
You have to consider the people.

125
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,900
This marriage

126
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,320
isn't up to you.

127
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,620
Father.

128
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,430
I suffer from a leg condition.

129
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,777
I don't want to wrong
the princess of Xilin Kingdom.

130
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,580
Yunnuo is in good health.

131
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,860
Why not...

132
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,380
This princess is a well-known doctor.

133
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,500
If you marry her,

134
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,780
you can also cure your leg.

135
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,260
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

136
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm afraid that there's no cure
for this chronic disease.

137
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,080
Besides,

138
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,260
getting married isn't in my plan at all.

139
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,260
Self-discipline, family harmony,

140
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,940
national order and world peace.

141
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,020
Jin.

142
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Your marriage

143
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,340
is both a family matter

144
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,500
and a national matter.

145
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,820
I'll give you three days.

146
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,260
Don't let me down.

147
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,540
Okay.

148
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,500
Mr. Pei.

149
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Take care.

150
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,070
Don't worry.

151
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,300
I will make sure
your affairs are properly sorted.

152
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,560
Look at what you do all day long.

153
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,460
Mr. Ji, look at this.

154
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,300
Money.

155
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,220
Money?

156
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,260
Is it from Pei Er?

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Pei Er isn't a good person.

158
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,780
How can you take his money?

159
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,500
Everything Guild is in so much debt.

160
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,820
I have to think of a way
to make some money.

161
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,980
Don't worry.

162
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,700
I've done all the research.

163
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,580
Here.

164
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,100
Mr. Ji, sit down.

165
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
Take a look.

166
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,940
Now that Pei Da is dead,

167
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,660
Madam Pei isn't good at business.

168
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:09,140
The child is only seven years old.

169
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,620
You can't count on him at all.

170
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,540
I guess

171
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,820
even if the family elders
support Madam Pei,

172
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Pei Er might still cause them trouble.

173
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,980
So what do you mean?

174
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,010
Ask Madam Pei to take this money

175
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,060
and their savings, leave the capital,

176
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
stay away from Pei Er

177
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,460
and raise the child well

178
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,540
to prevent any more accidents.

179
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Can this solve the problem?

180
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,500
Mr. Ji.

181
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,060
No matter what method
is used to solve the problem,

182
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,500
let's save Everything Guild first.

183
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,533
You've finally
got to the root of the matter.

184
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,980
How about this?

185
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,860
How about you lend me Ji Mo's savings

186
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,940
to get by?

187
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,980
You're overthinking.

188
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,260
What I mean is
that you should accept your fate

189
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:04,620
when it's time to do so.

190
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,266
(Wedding and Funeral)
Mr. Ji, you don't believe me, do you?

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,540
Mother.

192
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,260
You must bless me to make a fortune.

193
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,060
Make a fortune.

194
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,020
Hello, who's in charge here?

195
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,860
I am.

196
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,540
We have a major business deal.

197
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,420
(My wish came true so quickly.)

198
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,580
Coming.

199
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,890
(Inn)
She's Princess Aliya from Xilin Kingdom.

200
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,488
Everything Guild is said
to provide a wide range of services,

201
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,822
so we came to entrust Ms. Qiao
with an important matter.

202
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,540
Your Highness.

203
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,380
You've found the right place.

204
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,620
Just ask.

205
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,860
There's nothing
that Everything Guild can't handle.

206
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,590
Speak freely.

207
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,140
Our work is top-notch.

208
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,860
As long as you pay us well,

209
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,220
we'll satisfy any of your wishes.

210
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,620
Anything?

211
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,820
Of course.

212
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,620
I want you to help me
break off my engagement.

213
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:10,940
(Break off an engagement?)

214
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,220
Ms. Qiao, is there a problem?

215
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
Your Highness.

216
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Don't worry.

217
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,380
That's not a problem at all.

218
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,180
Your Highness.

219
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,220
You and Princess Aliya have never met.

220
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,460
Now, you're going to meet
at the Lantern Festival.

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
How are you
going to identify each other?

222
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,580
She mentioned in the letter

223
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,311
that she'll carry
a mandarin duck lantern

224
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,500
and meet me at the entrance
of Fated Connection Bridge.

225
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,020
Mandarin duck lantern

226
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:40,133
and the entrance
of Fated Connection Bridge?

227
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,940
Princess Aliya's eagerness
to get married

228
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,820
is obvious.

229
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,300
But Your Highness,

230
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,020
I'm still worried
about you meeting her alone.

231
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,300
Let me go with you.

232
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,420
No need.

233
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,780
Just protect me in secret.

234
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:53,180
The purpose of this trip
is to break off the engagement.

235
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,380
If you're there,
you might embarrass her.

236
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,700
Besides, even if there's danger,

237
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,820
I'll just go to somewhere crowded.

238
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,950
How fun. It moved.

239
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,700
That's it.

240
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,260
Here you go.

241
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,100
Thank you, Sir.

242
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,000
Thank you.

243
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,000
I think his painting of you
looks just like you.

244
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,820
It's very realistic. What do you think?

245
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,700
It's as pretty as you.

246
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,700
(Mandarin duck lantern...)

247
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,780
(Mandarin duck lantern...)

248
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,420
(Princess Aliya is so eager
to cancel the engagement.)

249
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,340
(That prince)

250
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,380
(must be ugly.)

251
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,940
(I also heard)

252
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:51,666
(he's paralyzed from the waist down.)

253
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,740
(I mustn't take off my mask later.)

254
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,980
(I'm so good-looking.)

255
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,620
(What if he clings to me?)

256
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,490
Your Highness.

257
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:02,540
Rest assured, Your Highness.

258
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,490
Mr. Jiufeng
has made all the arrangements.

259
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,680
We're all lying in ambush nearby
to protect you.

260
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,780
Bao, don't run.

261
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
(Xinglong Inn)

262
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,540
Look, what happened?

263
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Are you the prince?

264
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,650
Yes.

265
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,740
(How should I break off the engagement?)

266
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,500
(How should I break off the engagement)

267
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,460
(to solve this unexpected problem?)

268
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,260
Your Highness.

269
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,900
Sorry.

270
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,220
I was late.

271
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,660
Late?

272
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,540
In my residence, I've driven away

273
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,180
anyone who is late.

274
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,980
(Driven away?)

275
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
(That ruthless?)

276
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,020
(Perfect.)

277
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,300
How unfortunate?

278
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm always late.

279
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,860
I'm late for school.

280
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,710
I'm late for shopping.

281
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,980
I'm even late for meals.

282
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,460
What do you think

283
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,620
I should do?

284
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,820
(What is she up to?)

285
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,810
Your Highness.

286
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,380
All arrangements
for the Lantern Festival

287
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,220
have been completed.

288
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:06,444
Nothing will go wrong.

289
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,180
Your Highness, someone reported

290
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,244
that Prince Jin
is also at the Lantern Festival.

291
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,180
Brother never likes bright lights.

292
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,860
Why would he leave his residence

293
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,060
and join in the bustle?

294
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
After investigation,

295
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,100
there's a woman next to him

296
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,820
wearing Xilin Kingdom's clothing.

297
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
Could she be...

298
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
Guihu.

299
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,060
This Lantern Festival
is full of all kinds of people.

300
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,100
If you're not careful,

301
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,740
you'll be in danger.

302
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,060
Father loves Brother very much.

303
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,780
Let there be no accidents.

304
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,180
Xilin Kingdom
enjoys horseback riding and hunting.

305
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,950
Your Highness,
you can't really use your legs.

306
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,840
I also think

307
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,100
Luzhao and Xilin Kingdom's
customs and habits

308
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
aren't exactly the same.

309
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,500
If you marry me,

310
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,270
you may not be able to adapt.

311
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,210
Your Highness.

312
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,380
You're so thoughtful.

313
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm

314
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,570
bad at adapting.

315
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,740
I won't get used to it.

316
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,950
(Could it be
that Xilin Kingdom's princess)

317
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,500
(doesn't want to marry me either?)

318
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,980
We will decide the best couple

319
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,580
through a competition.

320
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,980
All couples are welcome to participate.

321
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,340
Are there any couples

322
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,377
who are willing to go on stage
and give it a try?

323
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:32,580
- Are there any?
- Aliya, look.

324
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,560
There's a best couple competition ahead.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,110
- It's about
- Do you want to try it?

326
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,300
- the suitability of the couple.
- Yes.

327
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Please wait at the back.

328
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,340
- A forced melon isn't sweet.
- Any other couples who want to try?

329
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,580
(What does he mean?)

330
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:44,740
(I didn't expect
that the prince didn't want)

331
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,920
- (to marry Aliya either.)
- Anyone else?

332
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,222
- We want to participate.
- We.

333
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,400
- Alright, this way.
- Your Highness, you're right.

334
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,980
Not only a forced melon isn't sweet,

335
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,240
but it's also likely
to be sour and bitter.

336
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,730
Love can't be forced.

337
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:59,540
Looks like
we're not suitable for each other.

338
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,010
Your Highness.

339
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,660
Since we have come to this point,

340
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,340
let's just be frank.

341
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
Your Highness.

342
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,777
I'm here to break off our engagement.

343
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,540
I share the same idea.

344
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,460
I didn't expect this unexpected surprise

345
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,180
at our meeting today.

346
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,955
Let's bid farewell
and never see each other again.

347
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,460
Alright, please wait.

348
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,100
Any other couples

349
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,780
willing to give it a try?

350
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,140
- Any more?
- Hurry up.

351
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,060
Wait for me.

352
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,700
Watch out.

353
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,900
It's too dangerous.

354
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,140
Watch out.

355
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,940
Jiufeng!

356
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,800
Jiufeng!

357
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,700
Young Master!

358
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,540
Gosh.

359
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,870
What a heavy fall.

360
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,720
Yes.

361
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,730
They're eager to go on stage.

362
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:58,540
This...

363
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,460
Why are you holding me?

364
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,260
I wanted to catch His Highness
but missed.

365
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,260
Save His Highness!

366
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,780
Young Master!

367
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,940
Make way.

368
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,620
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

369
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,180
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

370
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,500
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

371
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,740
- Are you alright?
- Are you okay?

372
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,220
It's good that you're alright.

373
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,460
Coming.

374
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,940
Make way.

375
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,420
Make way.

376
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,540
Here.

377
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,780
Your...

378
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,700
Young Master Wang, are you alright?

379
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,820
Life is full of surprises.

381
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,940
Meeting you is an accident.

382
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:42,700
Since you've gotten on stage,

383
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,140
why don't you participate

384
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,700
in the best couple competition?

385
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
No.

386
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,920
Go.

387
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,300
We prepared a generous prize.

388
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,970
- (Generous prize?)
- No thanks.

389
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,660
No, wait.

390
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,220
We'll participate.

391
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,380
Alright.

392
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,340
- Good.
- Good.

393
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,940
Your Highness,
just bear with me for a while.

394
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,060
Xilin Kingdom doesn't have
such fun couple competitions.

395
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:14,890
(She kept saying she wanted
to break off the engagement just now.)

396
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,980
(Now, she's joining the competition.)

397
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,780
(Will she regret it?)

398
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,820
(I've broken off the engagement.)

399
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:24,822
(If I can win this generous prize...)

400
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,222
- (I can save Everything Guild.)
- We'll ask the musicians to play music

401
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,980
and let the three couples
dance together.

402
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,460
Every time the music stops,

403
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,980
the three ladies fight

404
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,100
for the embroidered lucky bag
at the top.

405
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
When the music plays again,

406
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,700
the three ladies must continue dancing

407
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,420
until one of the ladies

408
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,140
gets the embroidered lucky bag.

409
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,500
And the game will be over.

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,880
Alright.

411
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,170
- Aliya.
- Do you understand the rules?

412
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,460
Do you think I can dance?

413
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,288
Later,

414
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,020
- our competition begins officially.
- Xilin Kingdom has a dance

415
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,380
where I'm the only one moving.

416
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,620
I'll show you.

417
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,460
The couples on stage

418
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,780
can get ready.

419
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,100
(She dances so passionately.)

420
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,020
(Looks like she regretted it.)

421
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,660
(I'm winning this prize.)

422
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,660
(If this goes on,)

423
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,860
(not only her,)

424
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,420
(everyone here will think)

425
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,540
(we're a perfect match.)

426
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,660
I like this.

427
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,100
- Me too.
- Great.

428
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,060
I think they'll win.

429
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,780
Why did you grab me?

430
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,260
What are you doing?

431
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,370
Don't grab me!

432
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:02,688
- Don't push me.
- Give it to me.

433
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,580
It's mine.

434
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,020
(How dare she kiss me?)

435
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,210
- It's mine.
- (I'll make you regret it.)

436
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,250
Go away.

437
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,740
What are you doing?

438
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,340
Your Highness.

439
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,020
How can I win
if you don't cooperate with me?

440
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,860
Aliya.

441
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,620
I didn't say I wanted to win.

442
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,620
In that case,

443
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,220
don't blame me then.

444
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,140
You're uncooperative.

445
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,260
Aliya, what are you doing?

446
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,300
Watch out.

447
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,540
Are you alright?

448
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,740
(This darn prince!)

449
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,540
(I will settle the accounts
with you later.)

450
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,100
- Good.
- Good.

451
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,420
- Good.
- Good.

452
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
What a beautiful face under the veil.

453
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,620
It's alright if you won't help.

454
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Why make trouble?

455
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Make trouble?

456
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,380
Can you get the bag without me?

457
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,500
Congratulations.

458
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,540
Congratulations.

459
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,140
Miss, please come forward.

460
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,740
These two are compatible

461
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,300
and good-looking.

462
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,620
They're a good match.

463
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,700
They're tonight's perfect match!

464
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,940
Good.

465
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,380
- Good.
- Well...

466
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,620
- Good
- Good.

467
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,220
Where's the generous prize
you mentioned?

468
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,900
Open the bag and see.

469
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,180
Is that all?

470
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,300
The red rope symbolizes

471
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,660
a love that never leaves.

472
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

473
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,700
Isn't this prize generous enough?

474
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,044
- Yes.
- Let's congratulate them.

475
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,540
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

476
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,400
Congratulations.

477
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,860
Aliya, you went to great lengths

478
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,700
for a coin.

479
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,580
A coin is still money.

480
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,300
I don't like
to take advantage of others.

481
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,140
This is yours.

482
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,820
What's wrong?

483
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,380
- Over there.
- Fire.

484
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,340
Danger.

485
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,540
Fire.

486
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,060
Run!

487
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,570
Fire!

488
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,420
There's a fire.

489
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,133
I got to go. Take care, Your Highness.

490
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,620
Wait for me.

491
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,660
Over there.

492
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Fire!

493
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,500
Go there.

494
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,820
Run!

495
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,340
Hurry!

496
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,820
This side is on fire.

497
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,820
(Mother!)

498
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,900
(No, Mother!)

499
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,380
(Mother!)

500
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,180
Run!

501
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,340
Fire!

502
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
Run!

503
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,300
Wait for me.

504
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Over there.

505
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,220
Fire! Run!

506
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,980
Go there.

507
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,420
Fire! Run!

508
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,100
Hurry up!

509
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Put out the fire!

510
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,620
Over here.

511
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,540
Hurry up!

512
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,180
Go!

513
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,700
- Run!
- Hurry!

514
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,740
Run!

515
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,620
Over there!

516
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,780
Run!

517
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
- Stay alive!
- Hurry!

518
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,060
Run! Hurry!

519
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,260
Follow me!

520
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,740
Over here.

521
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,700
Put out the fire!

Tell me

533
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,540
why so many people want to kill you.

534
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,340
How would I know?

535
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,620
Are we going to die here?

536
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,460
Aliya.

537
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,820
You don't have to panic.

538
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,260
How about you leave first?

539
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,300
No.

540
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,111
I should be a good person
through and through.

541
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:53,980
How can I abandon you?

542
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,820
Chase!

543
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,980
Don't run!

544
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,660
Where did they go?

545
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:31,060
(Ningyuan Inn)

546
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,780
Who is it?

547
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,700
Who is it?

548
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Ms. Qiao?

549
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,180
Ms. Qiao.

550
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,420
Ms. Qiao.

551
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,140
We're incompetent and deserve to die.

552
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,180
Who gave you the courage
to assassinate Prince Jin?

553
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,180
Your Highness!

554
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:12,900
Brother was attacked
at the Lantern Festival.

555
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,066
I was responsible
for the safety of the Lantern Festival.

556
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,540
Since the defense failed,

557
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm accountable for it.

558
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,180
(Hanyuan Hall)

559
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,020
Father.

560
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,900
I failed to protect Brother.

561
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:40,460
Please punish me, Father.

562
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
Father.

563
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,580
The fire last night was an accident.

564
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Don't blame Yunnuo.

565
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,340
Jin, it's great that you're not hurt.

566
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
Thank you for your concern.

567
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
Jin.

568
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,500
Your private meeting
with Xilin Kingdom's princess

569
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,620
is improper,

570
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,180
but

571
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm still glad.

572
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,940
Father.

573
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
I think

574
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,740
that something so dangerous happened

575
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,620
after first meeting
Xilin Kingdom's princess

576
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,580
is a bad omen.

577
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,220
I think we should
break off the engagement

578
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
to appease God's wrath.

579
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,100
Jin, when did you
become so superstitious?

580
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,460
On the opposite,

581
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,700
I think

582
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,500
this is a blessing from God.

583
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,222
They're trying to bring you together.

584
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
What do you think?

585
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,230
Your Majesty.

586
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,260
As we all know,

587
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,100
the best couple competition
was held in the capital last night.

588
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,320
Prince Jin and Princess Aliya
defeated their opponents

589
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,180
and won.

590
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,020
It was an accident.

591
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Besides that,

592
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,860
another scene

593
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,100
lingers long

594
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,740
in my mind.

595
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,460
Hurry and present it.

596
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,300
Yes.

597
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,980
They say that everyone flees
when disaster strikes.

598
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,860
Looks like Princess Aliya

599
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,900
has deep feelings for you.

600
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,260
It's your first meeting,

601
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,260
but she risked her life to save you

602
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,820
and didn't abandon you.

603
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
Good.

604
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,480
Your Majesty.

605
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,420
I think

606
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,320
this painting

607
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,980
will surely become a famous tale.

608
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,430
A courageous act like this

609
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,640
should be announced.

610
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,580
Hurry and get it done.

611
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,420
Yes.

612
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,660
Father.

613
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,820
Father.

614
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,940
I will

615
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,460
remember her kindness,

616
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,460
but it doesn't mean

617
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,980
I must marry her.

618
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,940
Jin.

619
00:28:42,044 --> 00:28:43,620
Now that things have come to this,

620
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,060
stop dodging it.

621
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,660
This also involves
our diplomatic relations.

622
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,590
We can't break off
the engagement lightly.

623
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,540
Father.

624
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,380
Pass on my order.

625
00:28:51,422 --> 00:28:52,420
Choose an auspicious day

626
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,940
and order Prince Jin
to marry the Princess of Xilin Kingdom.

627
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,980
Yes.

628
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,740
Father.

629
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,820
Please give me

630
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,220
a chance to redeem myself.

631
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,100
Let me handle
Brother's bride welcoming ceremony.

632
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,540
I will not fail you.

633
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,540
Go to Imperial Hospital
to get some good herbs

634
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,222
and send them to Prince Yunnuo.

635
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,340
Yes.

636
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,420
Thank you, Father.

637
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,555
(Prince Jin's Residence)

638
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,580
Your Highness.
His Majesty has bestowed the marriage,

639
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,940
and we can't disobey his order.

640
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,140
And Princess Aliya is a miracle doctor.

641
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,660
What if she

642
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,340
finds that your leg condition is fake?

643
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,510
Won't your plan
to escape from the palace fail?

644
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,733
I asked you to investigate
last night's assassins.

645
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,022
Have you made any progress?

646
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,420
Not yet.

647
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,260
It's just as I expected.

648
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,020
Things aren't that simple.

649
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,500
Your Highness, who do you think

650
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,020
sent these assassins?

651
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,260
Little one, you climbed so high.

652
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,260
It's dangerous.

653
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
Your Highness.

654
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,300
Why are you worried about it?

655
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,940
Hurry and help me analyze

656
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,060
last night's incident.

657
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,900
Whether something happened

658
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,420
to me or Princess Aliya last night,

659
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,340
it would affect
Luzhao and Xilin Kingdom's

660
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,700
diplomatic relations.

661
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,820
If it's serious,

662
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,300
it may even lead to war.

663
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,740
The ones who will suffer then

664
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,180
will be the innocent people.

665
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,620
If that's the case...

666
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,800
- You and Princess Aliya are in danger.
- It's alright now.

667
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,580
The most important thing now

668
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,844
is Princess Aliya's safety.

669
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I understand.

670
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,940
What about the marriage?

671
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,500
We can only think of other ways.

672
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,500
(Ningyuan Inn)

673
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,480
How is she?

674
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,380
Still sleeping.

675
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
But Your Highness,

676
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,140
luckily, I was the one
who found her last night.

677
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,300
If General Hu's men had found her,

678
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,980
wouldn't it be a mess?

679
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
Keep your voice down.

680
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,220
Everything Guild's Ms. Qiao

681
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,500
is unreliable.

682
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,140
We asked her
to break off the engagement.

683
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Now, great.

684
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,822
The wedding date has been moved forward.

685
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,460
The most urgent thing now

686
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,180
is to find a way to solve this.

687
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,040
Yeah.

688
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,500
Look at General Hu Ersa's people.

689
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,820
They keep an eye on us every day.

690
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,140
Afraid that we'll run away.

691
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,860
I'm talking about the person inside.

692
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,900
Me?

693
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,777
If someone finds out that I asked
Ms. Qiao to break off the engagement,

694
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
there may be trouble.

695
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,940
The wedding is in three days.

696
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:44,488
Are you going to accept your fate?

697
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,460
Of course not.

698
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
It's just that right now

699
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,580
we have to solve things one by one.

700
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,060
Got it.

701
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,300
Now,

702
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,460
let's solve Ms. Qiao first.

703
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,220
(What are they going to do?)

704
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,460
Ms. Qiao.

705
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,020
Ms. Qiao.

706
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,620
Ms. Qiao!

707
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,900
Your Highness, she's still unconscious.

708
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,420
Yuetao.

709
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Since Ms. Qiao wants to sleep forever,

710
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,660
let's never let her wake up.

711
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,540
Where am I?

712
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,620
Your Highness?

713
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,340
If there's nothing else,

714
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,180
I'll leave first.

715
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,620
You're busy.

716
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,540
If I continue to bother you,
I'll feel bad.

717
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,180
Ms. Qiao.

718
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,780
(Oh no.)

719
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,580
(I'm doomed.)

720
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,460
(Easter Egg)

721
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,420
Young Master, you're charming.

722
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,930
(Determining Love at One Glance)
I can tell you're a rare talent.

723
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,500
Why don't you let me tell your fortune?

724
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,500
What do you think?

725
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,820
No need.

726
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,511
Young Master.
Just let me tell your fortune.

727
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,177
(Deciding the Future at Two Glances)
There are many people in this world.

728
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:13,066
It's fate that we met.

729
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,088
You have to listen to me.

730
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,140
I have a lot of potential.

731
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,460
I don't believe

732
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
there can be any accident

733
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,620
that can change my life.

734
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,660
It isn't a change.

735
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
It's destruction.

736
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,380
Sir.

737
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,700
I have difficulty walking.

738
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,020
Can you come closer?

739
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,940
Yes.

740
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,820
I'll come closer. Go ahead.

741
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,980
Ten divinations daily,

742
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
reserved for those destined.

743
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,460
(Determining Love at One Glance,
Deciding the Future at Two Glances)

744
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,420
Ten divinations daily,

745
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,500
reserved for those destined.

746
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,340
Miss, ten divinations daily,

747
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,780
reserved for those destined.

748
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,620
Sir.

749
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
The gimmick of ten divinations daily

750
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,620
can't make money.

751
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,140
- No.
- Also,

752
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,620
we must reject feudal superstitions.

753
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,500
I have something else to do,
so I'll leave first.

754
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,888
We'll meet again if fate allows it.

755
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,980
No.

756
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,300
Miss, your forehead
is dark with a purple tinge.

757
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,660
We will never meet again.

758
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,180
The path of deceit is endless.

759
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,220
Even a pheasant can become a phoenix.

760
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,500
The road ahead is full of dangers.

761
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,700
Marrying the right man
in the wrong bridal carriage.

762
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,660
That's for cursing me.

763
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,020
