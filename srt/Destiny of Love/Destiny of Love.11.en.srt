=Episode 11=

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,420
Great!

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,940
Marvelous.

29
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:00,733
She's a great dancer.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,300
Indeed.

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,790
Amazing!

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,900
She's an amazing dancer!

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,860
Wow!

34
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,900
Great!

35
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,350
Terrific!

36
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,620
- Excellent!
- Well done!

37
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,740
Way to go, Mr. Ji!

38
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,900
- Great!
- What an amazing dance!

39
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,230
- Yes.
- Great!

40
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,990
That doesn't look like a Luzhao dance.

41
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,300
I've seen it before. It's a Xilin dance.

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,620
Is she from Xilin?

43
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,460
She is the girl Qiao Manman found

44
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,390
in the village.

45
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:33,511
Her name is Fang.

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,990
Why can't she go out in public?

47
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,510
It's not appropriate for her status.

48
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,270
Isn't she

49
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,288
just a village girl
from the countryside?

50
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,180
Fang!

51
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,620
You mustn't do that!

52
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,270
What I mean is,

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,933
physicians can't treat themselves.

54
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,230
Have you ever seen
Everything Guild this packed

55
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,900
since it opened?

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,350
Take your medicine according to this.

57
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:51,900
Thank you.

58
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,230
Dear, you're back.

59
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,900
This girl is amazing.

60
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,580
What was that dance you performed?

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,350
- Please teach it to us!
- You were stunning!

62
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,990
Sure.

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,860
Dance with me, then.

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,110
All right!

65
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,700
Dear?

66
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:11,490
(Everything Guild)

67
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,620
Back already, Mo?

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,180
Is the gathering over?

69
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,910
Where's my daughter-in-law?

70
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,550
Who is she?

71
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,990
What?

72
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,300
Tell me who she really is!

73
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,860
She's from Xilin, isn't she?

75
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,060
She's not just anyone from Xilin.

76
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,420
She's the Princess of Xilin, isn't she?

77
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,266
Keep your voice down!

78
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:47,420
Yes, she is.

79
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:50,200
What would you have me do, huh?

80
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,500
I had to do it for Qiao Manman.

81
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,860
Impersonating the Xilin Princess
is a crime punishable by death.

82
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,800
I can't believe this! This is crazy!

83
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,110
I'm losing my mind!

84
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,230
She's the Princess of Xilin, and I'm...

85
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:26,910
Dear?

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,740
Dear?

87
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,740
Dear?

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,860
Are you unwell?

89
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,990
I thought his fear of women
had been cured...

90
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,888
Why did it suddenly get worse?

91
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,110
(We've kept this from her for so long.)

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,977
(It really was not right.)

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,666
(How am I supposed
to face Fang after this?)

94
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,350
What am I going to do?

95
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:16,530
(Liuyun Mansion)

96
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,500
Your Highness, I found out the truth.

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,520
That female physician
at Everything Guild

98
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,990
is the real Princess Aliya.

99
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:23,550
Are you certain of this?

100
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:24,755
Without a doubt.

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,940
Good.

102
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:28,466
That is wonderful.

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,150
That means
the current Princess Consort Jin

104
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,030
is not Princess Aliya.

105
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,930
(Everything Guild)

106
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,550
I'm back, Fang.

107
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,940
Where's your husband?

108
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
I don't know.

109
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,590
Where's my brother?

110
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,740
I don't know.

111
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,180
Mr. Ji,

112
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,470
I came today to say goodbye.

113
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,860
Goodbye?

114
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,819
I fear I will not be able
to cure Prince Jin's legs after all.

115
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,180
Take Ji Mo and Fang and get as far away
from here as you can.

116
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,060
We'll leave together.

117
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,910
I can't.

118
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,180
It'd be irresponsible of me.

119
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,060
Yes.

120
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,180
How irresponsible.

121
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:41,711
This won't do.

122
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,230
I need to talk to Ji Mo.

123
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,350
Mr. Ji.

124
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:50,888
What happened between her
and my brother?

125
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,790
Ji Mo found out who she really is.

126
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,990
Now he thinks he isn't worthy of her.

127
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,920
(Hanyuan Hall)

128
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,350
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,820
I have not been able

130
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,300
to sleep at all lately.

131
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,660
What's wrong?

132
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,590
I keep thinking

133
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,860
about that the one-month
deadline is almost up,

134
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,950
and there is still no good news

135
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,470
coming from Prince Jin's Residence.

136
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,470
I'm haunted by worry.

137
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,660
I cannot eat

138
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,740
or sleep.

139
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,380
Your Majesty.

140
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,020
The female physician, Bilian,
has died in prison.

141
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,470
The imperial physician has confirmed

142
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,660
she was poisoned.

143
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,555
Your Majesty.

144
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,740
It must've been
Princess Consort Jin who did it!

145
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,111
Oh, dear.

146
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,500
My lady!

147
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,710
This is bad! Get up! Come on!

148
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,070
Get up!

149
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,110
Let me sleep, would you?

150
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,310
Sleep?

151
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,050
His Majesty has summoned you
to the palace!

152
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:34,860
What?

153
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,830
But it isn't time yet.

154
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:39,933
Where's His Highness?

155
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,970
He's been gone for days.
No one knows where he went.

156
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,577
Even Jiufeng is nowhere to be found.

157
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,990
(Fu Chengjin is heartless.)

158
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,190
(He can't even show up
for my final moment.)

159
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:51,120
(Hanyuan Hall)

160
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,377
Why is Prince Jin not here?

161
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,950
Your Majesty.

162
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,430
Prince Jin has been unwell.

163
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,990
He has been recovering in his residence.

164
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:11,652
Aliya.

165
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,350
We agreed that you would heal

166
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,500
Jin's legs within a month.

167
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,310
That time is now almost up.

168
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,022
What is the condition of Jin's legs?

169
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,230
I failed.

170
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,740
But before, you were so confident.

171
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,710
You assured us
you could cure him within a month!

172
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,110
Father. Mother.

173
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,350
Brother's leg injury

174
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,740
has plagued him for years.

175
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,822
A full recovery takes time.

176
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,710
The deadline has not even passed yet.

177
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,230
Bilian is already dead.

178
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,729
What if we give her more time

179
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,290
and something happens to Prince Jin too?

180
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,070
Aliya.

181
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,311
Do you realize you've committed treason
by deceiving me?

182
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,710
Father.

183
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,110
I went to visit my brother before.

184
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,950
Princess Consort Jin
has always worked hard to...

185
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,660
Silence, Yunnuo!

186
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,311
This matter concerns
your brother's health.

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,688
You mustn't speak carelessly.

188
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:13,444
Princess Consort Jin.

189
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,020
If Prince Jin

190
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,830
can walk in here fully recovered,

191
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,500
then we can let this go.

192
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,990
But if not, then you are guilty

193
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,140
of deceiving His Majesty.

194
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,780
Treason is punishable

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,380
by execution of your entire clan.

196
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,866
Do you think the little kingdom of Xilin

197
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,470
can withstand the wrath of Luzhao?

198
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,860
Mother!

199
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,950
Father.

200
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,660
No one wants to heal Prince Jin

201
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,355
more than I do.

202
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,350
I am...

203
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,780
guilty.

204
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:58,377
I'm prepared to die
to atone for my crime.

205
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,000
Very well.

206
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:00,310
I will grant your wish.

207
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,470
Guards.

208
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,533
Princess Consort Jin failed
to cure Prince Jin

209
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:05,711
within the agreed time.

210
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,990
She has committed treason.

211
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,044
Take her away.

212
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,466
Throw her into the death prison!

213
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,660
Prince Jin has arrived.

214
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,430
Who says my consort failed

215
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,350
to cure my legs?

She healed

237
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,110
my legs.

238
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,866
Let me have a good look at you.

239
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,430
Good. This is wonderful.

240
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,500
Jin.

241
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,990
I'm so glad.

242
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,140
At last,

243
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,230
my son can stand again.

244
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,350
How wonderful.

245
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,230
Father.

246
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,755
This is all thanks

247
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,155
to my consort's efforts.

248
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:57,488
Let me have another look at you.

249
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,020
Good.

250
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,222
Brother, your legs are fully healed.

251
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:03,950
I am truly happy

252
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,660
for you.

253
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,955
Father.

254
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,430
This is a cause for celebration.

255
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,260
Yes.

256
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,500
Yes!

257
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,177
A cause for celebration!

258
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:21,333
A cause for celebration!

259
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,911
Announce my decree.

260
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,230
Prince Jin's legs are healed!

261
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,590
Let the kingdom rejoice!

262
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,844
Yes, Your Majesty.

263
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:42,120
(Prince Jin's Residence)

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,900
(Even after the fire when I was little,)

265
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,780
(people still tried to harm me.)

266
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,466
(I had to fake being disabled
just to survive.)

267
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,860
(Now that my legs have recovered,)

268
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,711
(things won't stay peaceful for long.)

269
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,260
(I need to find
the right chance to leave.)

270
00:15:59,288 --> 00:15:59,900
Your Highness!

271
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,990
Do you know?

272
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,490
Everyone's talking about
how you saved her like a hero!

273
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,620
You were

274
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,780
amazing today!

275
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,377
This is the most heroic
you'll ever be in your life.

276
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,140
However,

277
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,710
now that everyone knows
your legs are healed,

278
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,020
trouble will follow too.

279
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,470
We have the Resurrection Pill.

280
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,620
Worst case, I'll take her with me.

281
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,355
The only thing is
I'm not sure if she'd want that.

282
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,780
Why wouldn't she?

283
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,310
Her identity is fake.

284
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,710
If someone exposes her,

285
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,350
it could mean death.

286
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,470
Besides,

287
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,230
you stepped up for her today.

288
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:40,533
You protected her.

289
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,800
That was very admirable of you.

290
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,470
I'm sure she's fallen for you.

291
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:47,177
Yuetao, do you know what happened?

292
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,533
The moment the doors opened,

293
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,350
he was just

294
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,660
standing there.

295
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,140
He walked toward me,

296
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,200
out of the light,

297
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,380
and gently helped me up.

298
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,950
He was so...

299
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,020
So what?

300
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,670
You are in trouble.

301
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,230
You have fallen for him.

302
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,060
You've developed feelings for him.

303
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,977
What nonsense are you talking about?

304
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,260
Come on.

305
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,190
He is a good man with a great character.

306
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
From his treatment,

307
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,990
you can see
that he's determined and strong.

308
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,300
But we're not right for each other.

309
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,820
Still in denial.

310
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:36,000
(Liuyun Mansion)

311
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,430
A fake "miracle physician"

312
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,950
cured a "cripple."

313
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,260
Looks like

314
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,950
I was right all along.

315
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,444
He has been faking it

316
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,910
all these years.

317
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,890
He pretended to be crippled for years
and suddenly wanted to be healed.

318
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,150
He must have ulterior motives.

319
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,990
Your Highness.

320
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,950
Prince Jin has recovered.

321
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,430
Some of the ministers in our faction
are starting to waver.

322
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,630
And with how much
His Majesty favors him,

323
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,933
Prince Jin's reputation

324
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,430
will only grow.

325
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:16,580
Your Highness.

326
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,430
Do you have a counterplan?

327
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:22,230
Brother has endured and bode his time.

328
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,710
He clearly has ambition.

329
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,950
But for Luzhao,
that is not necessarily a bad thing.

330
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,780
As long as he does not stand in our way,

331
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,820
we will wait and see.

332
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,630
Should we take care
of the fake princess consort?

333
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:38,733
Keeping her around

334
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,020
will lead to future trouble.

335
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,500
Guihu, you're getting a bit too bold

336
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,300
with your ideas.

337
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:47,580
I was out of line.

338
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:50,300
I'll make sure Qiao Manman is sent

339
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,820
somewhere suitable.

340
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,580
Focus on your own tasks.

341
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,470
You may go.

342
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,300
Yes, Your Highness.

343
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,430
(Little Ears, do you still remember me?)

344
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,500
(Do you remember our promise?)

345
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,470
(Why does no one like me?)

346
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,710
Little Cloud!

347
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,060
Get down from there!

348
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,630
Little Cloud.

349
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,488
I told you to wait for me in the street.

350
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:38,540
Why didn't you?

351
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,540
You're lucky I checked

352
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
our secret base.

353
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,020
I might not have found you otherwise.

354
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,780
Look.

355
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,150
I brought your favorite shaobing.

356
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,710
Eat it

357
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,340
while it's still warm.

358
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,340
If you're going to be my follower,

359
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,060
you have to obey me.

360
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,260
Disobey once, I hit you.

361
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,500
Disobey twice,
and I don't want you anymore.

362
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,740
Little Cloud, look.

363
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,910
If you think that bridge is high,

364
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,150
that's because you've never been

365
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,311
to the mountains beyond it.

366
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,870
Once you climb those,

367
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,390
you'll see

368
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,870
even taller mountains.

369
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,540
And even if you reach the tallest one,

370
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,260
there's still the sky above us.

371
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,630
The world is big.

372
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,630
Let's go see it together,

373
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,230
all right?

374
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,670
All right.

375
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,390
We'll go to higher places together.

376
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:32,177
All right.

377
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,300
It's a promise.

378
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,300
I promise to protect you,

379
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,820
and take you

380
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,950
to the highest peak

381
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:51,260
to see the most beautiful view.

382
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,060
Stop, stop, stop...

383
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,710
It does seem a bit short.

384
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,870
Here, lean on me.

385
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,300
I shouldn't, Your Highness.

386
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,300
I'll lean on Yuetao.

387
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,740
No.

388
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,060
Yuetao.

389
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,910
Yuetao.

390
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:29,990
Come to me.

391
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:31,870
Stop.

392
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,870
That looks about right.

393
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,333
That should do it.

394
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,400
All right.

395
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,555
You can go now, Jiufeng.

396
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:48,111
Get going.

397
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,670
Wait.

398
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,355
I just remembered.

399
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,300
So,

400
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,820
if His Highness asks why you were here,

401
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,470
just say

402
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,060
you came to chat with Yuetao.

403
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,150
You went to chat with Yuetao?

404
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
Tell me the truth.

405
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,340
I wasn't done.

406
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,950
That was the excuse
Her Highness gave me.

407
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,230
I think

408
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,990
she wanted to use this
as an excuse to make you a cane.

409
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,390
My legs are already healed.

410
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,540
Why would she give me a cane?

411
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,060
Maybe she thinks you've just recovered,

412
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,470
and your steps are still unsteady?

413
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,400
(Benevolent and Kind)

414
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,111
Your Highness.

415
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,060
This is something I had made for you

416
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,470
to thank you

417
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,022
for standing up for me that day.

418
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,990
Would you like to try it?

419
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,230
Not now.

420
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,630
Tell me.

421
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,910
What is it made of?

422
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,390
Rosewood.

423
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,870
Expensive. Elegant.

424
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,355
Perfect for someone of your stature.

425
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,470
So considerate.

426
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,500
So thoughtful and meticulous.

427
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,740
Her Highness put care into this.

428
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,190
Yes.

429
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,780
She very much wants to remind me that,

430
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:26,670
"Fu Chengjin,

431
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,190
you were once a cripple.”

432
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
This is not a cane.

433
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,870
It is a shackle.

434
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,710
It drags up my worst nightmares.

435
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:34,733
It is a chain that keeps me
from a bright future.

436
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,540
That is not what I meant...

437
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:41,044
One more thing.

438
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,990
This cane is way too short.

439
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,133
How is anyone supposed to use it?

440
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,590
That can't be right.

441
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,909
I measured it perfectly that day.

442
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,488
How...

443
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,190
This height is just right.

444
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,950
See?

445
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,340
Feels great.

446
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:05,422
What's wrong with you?

447
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,430
Isn't this height exhausting to lean on?

448
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,630
You just reminded me.

449
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:13,230
This is the perfect height.

450
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
We can even do this.

451
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,500
And this.

452
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,060
Isn't this nice? Convenient?

453
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:23,360
Take the crutch or leave it.

454
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:31,155
Your Highness,

455
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:32,911
what was that all about?

456
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,190
She is doing all this
because she likes me.

457
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,500
She just hasn't figured it out yet.

458
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,600
I should take the initiative

459
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,340
and help her realize her feelings.

460
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,260
Well,

461
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,630
it's said that a graceful lady
and a gentleman make the perfect match.

462
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,390
If you like Her Highness,

463
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,910
just tell her.

464
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,430
I'm just waiting for the right moment

465
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,870
so that it happens naturally.

466
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,910
The cane didn't work.

467
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,340
What else can I give?

468
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,990
What should I do?

469
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,260
Yuetao.

470
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,300
What do you think I should give him?

471
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,780
It's already dark.

472
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Are you still sewing?

473
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,950
Why not continue tomorrow?

474
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:43,022
If you keep this up,
you'll wear yourself out.

475
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,580
I can't.

476
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,190
I'm too slow

477
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,733
and I keep changing the stitches.

478
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,600
I won't make it in time if I stop now.

479
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,111
It's all right.

480
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:53,266
Get some rest, Yuetao.

481
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,555
Don't worry about me.

482
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:56,470
I've already learned everything
you taught me.

483
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,950
I'm going to sleep, then.

484
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,060
Go on.

485
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,511
You should sleep soon too.

486
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:21,660
(Benevolent and Kind)

487
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,200
Your Highness, you're awake.

488
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,422
Let me tell you something.

489
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,390
Her Highness has...

490
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:32,260
I've already prepared

491
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,500
what I'm going to say.

492
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,390
No matter what she brings,

493
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,780
I'm ready to handle it.

494
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,060
Please,

495
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,540
don't do that to Her Highness.

496
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:40,340
Last night, she...

497
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,950
Your Highness!

498
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:43,733
Your Highness.

499
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,820
Since the cane didn't turn out well,

500
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,500
I prepared a small gift instead.

501
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,500
Would you like to take a look?

502
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,100
Sure.

503
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,060
Wow, this really is a small gift.

504
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,670
Aliya.

505
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,820
Who embroidered this?

506
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,780
Such exquisite embroidery.

507
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,060
Really?

508
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,590
This pair of...

509
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,580
These ducks are not only plump,

510
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,590
but they look strong too.

511
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,630
Ducks?

512
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,911
These are clearly mandarin ducks!

513
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,870
What?

514
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,733
Is this the legendary
"Mandarin Ducks Drowning in the Water"?

515
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,260
You...

516
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,670
I get it.

517
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,300
I brought this upon myself.

518
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:41,270
I shouldn't have come
to make a fool of myself.

519
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,666
I will leave.

520
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:52,500
She just left like that?

521
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,910
Not only that.

522
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,066
She looked genuinely heartbroken.

523
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,670
Her Highness embroidered
that handkerchief herself.

524
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,060
She worked all night on it.

525
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,630
Why didn't you say so sooner?

526
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,470
You never gave me the chance!

527
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,820
This is bad.

528
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,430
Guanguan.

529
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Why are you here?

530
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,230
He doesn't even like you.

531
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,910
Yet, you keep throwing yourself at him.

532
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,020
It's different for me.

533
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,430
I...

534
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,390
I gave him a gift
because I was grateful.

535
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,990
What do you know?

536
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,710
So what if you put all that effort in?

537
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,870
He still doesn't care.

538
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,060
I'm just a fake.

539
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,190
I'm not from his world.

540
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,777
He won't like me
no matter how much effort I put in.

541
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,020
Why aren't you saying anything?

542
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,950
I've decided.

543
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:57,540
I'm done overthinking.

544
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:00,377
I'll just do what needs to be done.

545
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,470
What do you think?

546
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
I don't think much of it.

547
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,870
No matter what I say or do,

548
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,422
you always think it's not good enough.

549
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:13,990
No.

550
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:15,340
That's not what I meant.

551
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,740
You don't have to explain to me.

552
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,020
Explain it to the cat.

553
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:24,990
Your Highness,

554
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,190
I think

555
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,866
you really broke her heart this time.

556
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,820
What should I do?

557
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,150
Winning a woman back?

558
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,990
Romance, ambiance,
good food, and fine wine.

559
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:38,800
Make the preparations.

560
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,150
Got it.

561
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:39,910
Wait.

562
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,740
She prepared the gifts herself.

563
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,300
I should show some sincerity too.

564
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,580
Your Highness.

565
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,100
You wanted to see me?

566
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,390
Please have a seat.

567
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,740
Why did you

568
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,820
call me here?

569
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:28,470
A foreign envoy

570
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,910
gifted this to Father.

571
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,430
It's made from fermented grapes.

572
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,430
Try it.

573
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,670
It's sweet.

574
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,844
Is it to your liking?

575
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,870
Does it matter

576
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:01,740
whether I like it or not?

577
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:08,200
You went through all this trouble
just to humiliate me again,

578
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,390
didn't you?

579
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,670
I did this to apologize.

580
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,060
I was wrong these past few days.

581
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,670
The cane was finely crafted
and meaningful.

582
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,950
The handkerchief was lovely too.

583
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,670
I'd love to carry it around with me.

584
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,740
Then, why did you
criticize them so harshly?

585
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,340
I was being picky on purpose.

586
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,540
Why?

587
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,390
Because...

588
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,580
Because...

589
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,670
My legs had just recovered,

590
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,470
and I wasn't feeling the best.

591
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,230
That's why I acted poorly.

592
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,150
Anyway,

593
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,630
it was all

594
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,100
my fault.

595
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,950
Please be the bigger person
and forgive me.

596
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,300
I promise it won't happen again.

597
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,820
Aliya.

598
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,060
Let's have a drink together.

599
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,020
Your Highness.

600
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,340
Aside from teaching you how to cook,

601
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,990
did those foreign envoys teach you

602
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,470
anything else?

603
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,740
They did.

604
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,870
They taught me a type of dance.

605
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,950
Let me show you.
