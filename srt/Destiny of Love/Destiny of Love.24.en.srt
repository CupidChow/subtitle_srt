(Adapted from Lin Nan's novel, Destiny of Love.)

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,400
=Episode 24=

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:43,910
Brother.

28
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:47,200
Life in the wild must be hard
with plain food and little comfort.

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,333
You're used to the finer things.

30
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,711
I was worried
you wouldn't be able to endure it.

31
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,600
I invited you over for a gathering

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,700
because I cared about you.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,270
Don't worry, Brother.

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,266
You came alone,

35
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:10,110
so you must be fully prepared.

36
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,644
If anything happens to you here,

37
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,933
I will not escape public scrutiny.

38
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:17,909
We are both distinguished figures.

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,230
There's no need to make things
difficult for one another.

40
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,911
And if I insist on leaving?

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,177
If you insist,

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,900
I can't stop you.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,110
But I'll be sure to take good care

44
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,888
of Father and the Empress Yan.

45
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,600
If you must go, then go.

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,977
You're threatening me.

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,300
Guihu.

48
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,200
My brother has traveled far
and is weary.

49
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,110
Make sure he is properly settled.

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,177
Without my permission,

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,110
no one is to disturb him.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,466
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,177
The basket.

54
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,550
Distribute the rest for me.

55
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,620
Here you go.

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,790
Take one for your child too.

57
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,830
Thank you.

58
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,580
Here.

59
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:17,990
Here you go.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,860
Thank you.

61
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,350
Thank you.

62
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:27,666
I didn't expect there to be
many displaced here.

63
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,533
How's His Highness?

64
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,510
As planned,

65
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,860
I met with His Highness last night.

66
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:31,670
Though confined,

67
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,000
he is safe and well.

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,300
Looks like

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,350
Prince Yunnuo is waiting for me
to show up.

70
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,244
Let's move on to the next step.

71
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,155
I wonder if I can still

72
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:44,466
mislead his judgment now.

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,377
I'll keep you safe, Your Highness.

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,600
How is His Majesty?

75
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,666
Your Highness, walk with me, please.

76
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,060
His Majesty's breath is faint.

77
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,620
He may not have long.

78
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,733
It has only been a few days.

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,060
How could it have worsened so quickly?

80
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,044
If he doesn't have long,

81
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,820
then stop wasting resources on him.

82
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,620
Insolence!

83
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,030
Why are you here?

84
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,060
I came to pay my respects to Father.

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,820
With my efforts,

86
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,800
everything in court is running smoothly.

87
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,670
Father.

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,066
The annual Sacrifice to Heaven Ceremony
is approaching.

89
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,860
I request permission
to perform the rites on your behalf.

90
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,500
You...

91
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,470
You unfilial son!

92
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,044
Your Majesty.

93
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,550
Thank you for your consent, Father.

94
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,740
Beast!

95
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,910
You animal!

96
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,688
Where is Jin?

97
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,860
I want to see him!

98
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,590
Jin?

99
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,822
He is currently enjoying
a short stay at my residence.

100
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,150
You...

101
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,022
Listen to me.

102
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,500
Even without Jin,

103
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,180
you are unworthy!

104
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,550
I'm unworthy?

105
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,590
You will soon see

106
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,888
that your judgment
has always been misguided.

107
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,860
And by the way,

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the day I perform
the Sacrifice to Heaven Ceremony

109
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:15,488
will be the day
you and your son reunite.

110
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,230
You...

111
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,940
Don't you dare touch my Jin!

112
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,288
You...

113
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,590
Your Majesty!

114
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,860
Your Majesty!

115
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,500
Your Majesty!

116
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,790
Father.

117
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:39,150
Hurts, doesn't it?

118
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
Painful, isn't it?

119
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,740
What you are feeling now

120
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,110
is exactly what I felt back then.

121
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,940
But rest assured.

122
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,670
Under my governance,

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,060
Luzhao will prosper,

124
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,150
and the world will know peace.

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,155
I won't disturb your rest any longer.

126
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,860
I take my leave.

127
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,110
Don't touch my Jin...

128
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,030
You...

129
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,670
You...

130
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,380
Beast!

131
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,600
Your Majesty!

132
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,590
Physician!

133
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,511
Your Majesty!

134
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,266
Prince Yunnuo.

135
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,888
Manman.

136
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,350
You're finally back.

137
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,670
I knew you were still alive.

138
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,022
I'm just glad you made it back safely.

139
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,590
Come, I brewed your favorite tea.

140
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:10,955
You imprisoned Prince Jin, didn't you?

141
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,550
Manman.

142
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,300
After all this time,

143
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,000
you have nothing else
you want to say to me?

144
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:22,066
Of course I do.

145
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:24,666
You murdered my closest kin,

146
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,419
burned Yinyi Village to the ground,

147
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,470
and turned a blind eye
to the suffering of refugees.

148
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,620
I just have one question.

149
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,830
Do you not have nightmares at night?

150
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,540
Manman, none of that matters.

151
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,710
What matters is that you are alive.

152
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,333
That you came back to me.

153
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,511
That is what matters most.

154
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,044
Prince Yunnuo!

155
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,950
Stop being so delusional!

156
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,190
If you turn back now,

157
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,777
everything can still be made right.

158
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,020
Manman.

159
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,066
The Day of Sacrifice to Heaven
is the day after tomorrow.

160
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,470
I want you to be by my side

161
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,830
in my brightest,

162
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,977
most glorious moment.

163
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,020
That's what matters most.

164
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,020
All right?

165
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,860
I thought seeing me again
might change you.

166
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,350
But clearly, I was talking to a wall.

167
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,422
I'll be at the Everything Guild.

168
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm leaving now.

169
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,500
No matter.

170
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:28,066
As long as you came back.

171
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,070
Your Majesty.

172
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,740
Your Highness.

173
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,140
Since this is Jin's plan...

174
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:06,420
(Imperial Guard)

175
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,990
Jiufeng,

176
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,620
you must deliver this

177
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,780
to Prince Jin.

178
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,120
(Imperial Guard)

179
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,430
Please.

180
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,470
I will not fail you.

181
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:32,250
(Hanyuan Hall)

182
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:33,774
(Rule with Diligence, Cherish the Wise)

183
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,155
Your Highness, heavy rains
have been pouring in Taizhou.

184
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,350
The canal overflowed,
causing severe flooding.

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,710
Your Highness. On the northwest border,
foreign tribes are stirring up conflict,

186
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,820
leading to a territorial dispute
between nations.

187
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,133
I volunteer to lead an expedition.

188
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,500
Your Highness,
the famine has driven prices up.

189
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:48,666
The people are in misery.

190
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,022
We should open the grain stores

191
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,133
to stabilize the market.

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

193
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,955
Your Highness.

194
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,288
I'm feeling a bit tired.

195
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,822
Let's discuss this another day.

196
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,540
But...

197
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,020
These are no small matters.

198
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,900
What are we supposed to do?

199
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,190
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

200
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:22,688
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

201
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,777
Your Highness!

202
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,688
What's the meaning of this?

203
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:27,311
Why are you all here chasing me down?

204
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,830
Refugees have flooded
into the capital in large numbers!

205
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,900
We can no longer turn a blind eye!

206
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,780
We beg you to think of the people!

207
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,830
Open the grain stores!

208
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,540
Please open the grain stores!

209
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:38,830
Please open the grain stores!

210
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,740
Open the grain stores!

211
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,930
I have been busy
with the Sacrifice to Heaven Ceremony.

212
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,430
Do not bother me
with petty issues like refugees.

213
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,650
Luzhao has always been governed
with wisdom and benevolence.

214
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,740
Prince Yunnuo.

215
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,230
You are not worthy to be
Luzhao's crown prince!

216
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,710
Then just wait and see

217
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,900
whether I am worthy or not.

218
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,960
(Everything Guild)

219
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:20,066
Tomorrow is the Sacrifice
to Heaven Ceremony.

220
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,590
I hope you will attend as promised.

221
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,066
Thank you for the invitation,
Prince Yunnuo.

222
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,380
I will be there on time.

223
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,830
How's Manman?

224
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,990
All is well.

225
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,533
Any news from Aliya?

226
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,860
Princess Aliya is on her way
back to the capital.

227
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,733
Your Highness, please enjoy.

228
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:05,977
Your Highness.

229
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,590
His Majesty has handed me
the Imperial Guard token.

230
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:12,700
(Imperial Guard)

231
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,110
When Fu Yunnuo ascends the throne,

232
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,020
that will be our best chance.

233
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,470
You must be careful.

234
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,660
Fu Yunnuo wouldn't move

235
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,955
against me now.

236
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:26,830
He wouldn't dare make any move

237
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,333
before his coronation.

238
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,311
And now that
I have Father's command token,

239
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,310
I can finally give

240
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,133
my younger brother a lesson.

241
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,977
He has always hated being rejected.

242
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,500
I'll let him taste

243
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,755
what it's like
to be rejected by the whole world.

244
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,088
Your Highness, please.

245
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,317
(Prince Jin acts today...)

246
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,380
(Prince Jin acts today.)

247
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:06,780
(Your Highness, be careful.)

248
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,900
(From Jiufeng)

249
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:13,550
(Hanyuan Hall)

250
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,540
As expected, you kept your promise.

251
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,470
You never truly saw
the good I did for you.

252
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,740
I'll show you

253
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,780
that I have everything

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,222
that Fu Chengjin has too.

255
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,380
After today's Sacrifice to Heaven,

256
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
this world will be mine.

257
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,430
Prince Yunnuo shall perform
the rites on behalf of His Majesty.

258
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,660
The auspicious hour has arrived.

259
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,660
Welcome His Highness.

260
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,190
The sacrificial rites begin.

261
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,990
Offer music to welcome the deities.

262
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,666
Offer jade and silk as tribute.

263
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,533
Offer a libation.

264
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,540
Read the ceremonial proclamation.

265
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,500
Prince Yunnuo honors
Heaven and ancestors,

266
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,830
praying for Luzhao
to enjoy fair weather, prosperity,

267
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,990
and a lasting dynasty

268
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,444
(Ceremonial Proclamation)
for thousands of generations.

269
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,430
- Thousands of generations.
- Thousands of generations.

270
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,880
Your Highness! Something has happened!

271
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,230
A large number of refugees

272
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:56,560
are protesting outside the palace!

273
00:15:58,088 --> 00:15:59,511
Who allowed them to cause a scene

274
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,711
outside the palace?

275
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,244
That is something
you should ask yourself.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
If you had treated the people well,

277
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,400
why would they turn against you?

278
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,620
You're here.

279
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,540
Then, stay and watch the ceremony.

280
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,710
I once thought
you could bring peace to the world.

281
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,710
But it turns out, you never cared

282
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,377
for your kingdom.

283
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,830
You imprisoned Father and Mother,

284
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,577
massacred innocent people
in Yinyi Village,

285
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,540
and held my consort hostage.

286
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,620
Under your rule,

287
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,533
Luzhao faced disaster after disaster,
and the people's resentment grew.

288
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,590
I'm here to seek justice

289
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,540
for the 132 people of Yinyi Village

290
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,350
and all the refugees in this land.

291
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,488
If you don't wish
to witness the ceremony,

292
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,533
then go and take care of Father.

293
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,155
Fulfill your duty as a good son.

294
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,110
Prince Yunnuo.

295
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,020
You've done so many wrongs.

296
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,911
Do you still feel no remorse?

297
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,430
What wrongs?

298
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,870
Everything I did

299
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,540
was simply in line with Heaven's will.

300
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,340
Guards.

301
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,020
Seize them!

302
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,780
We'll see about that.

303
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:19,977
(Imperial Guard)

304
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:22,280
This token holds the same authority
as His Majesty himself!

305
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,550
By His Majesty's verbal decree,

306
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,100
the entire Imperial Guard answers to me.

307
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I knew it.

308
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,177
Father held you in such high regard.

309
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,400
(Imperial Guard)
He would surely entrust that to you.

310
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,000
It's no wonder
I searched the entire palace

311
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,644
and couldn't find it.

312
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,133
Imperial Guard, hear my order.

313
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,300
Seize Prince Yunnuo.

314
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,133
Confine him in Liuyun Mansion
under strict watch

315
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,888
until His Majesty delivers judgment.

316
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,666
Nobody moves!

317
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,488
If Prince Jin wants
to keep Princess Consort Jin safe,

318
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,222
allow Prince Yunnuo to leave the palace.

319
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,150
Let her go first!

320
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,688
I'm afraid I can't do that.

321
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,470
Stand down! Stand down!

322
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,044
All of you, stand down!

323
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,820
Or I'll kill her!

324
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,470
Lower your weapons!

325
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,780
Your Highness, we must go.

326
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,888
Guihu! Hurry!

327
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,688
Go die!

328
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,020
Guihu!

329
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,580
Manman!

330
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,990
Go...

331
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,470
Guihu...

332
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:01,822
Come on!

333
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,740
Your Highness!

334
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,066
Let go of me!

335
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,111
Prince Yunnuo!

336
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,230
Prince Yunnuo,

337
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,950
this is the end.

338
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,910
No.

339
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,400
There must be another way.

340
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,430
Little Cloud!

341
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,733
Let go of the past.

342
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,990
If I let go of the past,

343
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:29,222
will the promise we made
when we were children still count?

344
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,000
Of course.

345
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,300
Otherwise,

346
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:35,755
I would never have met you again,

347
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:36,990
or reunited with you.

348
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,390
All of this feels like destiny.

349
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,870
But sometimes I wonder,

350
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,580
if you could let go of your obsessions,

351
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,111
would you have gone down a better path?

352
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,355
Would you have found happiness?

353
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,933
If I let go of my obsession,

354
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,150
could I really be happy

355
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,022
in this life?

356
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,710
Could I truly start over?

357
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,430
Manman!

358
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,500
Stay back!

359
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,260
Fu Yunnuo! Release Manman!

360
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,990
If you turn back now,

361
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,150
Father will forgive you.

362
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,100
Shut up!

363
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,533
I don't need anyone's forgiveness!

364
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,020
Prince Yunnuo,
don't make another mistake.

365
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,266
There's still hope for new beginnings.

366
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:32,800
A new beginning?

367
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,466
I used to believe in that too.

368
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,470
Me and my brother,

369
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,710
my father and my mother...

370
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,150
Even after reuniting with you,
I thought there was hope.

371
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,230
But now look.

372
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,155
