(Two little kids?)

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,670
(Why does that sound so familiar?)

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,390
Little Cloud, look.

31
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,533
Don't these look like
a pair of little ears?

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,190
They do! It's adorable!

33
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,470
This is my one-of-a-kind
bandaging technique.

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,420
(How does he know about my childhood?)

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,350
(Could it be...)

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,830
(If he really is that boy,)

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,390
(then he must know I'm not...)

38
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,955
Prince Yunnuo.

39
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,020
You came up with an interesting story.

40
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,700
Unfortunately, I'm too dull

41
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,270
to understand what it's trying to say.

42
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,300
It means

43
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,900
the little boy is me.

44
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,790
And the little girl...

45
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,510
I know.

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,390
She must be that sweet girl

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,270
you mentioned.

48
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,555
That's right.

49
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,900
That little girl

50
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,550
was you.

51
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,900
Me?

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,700
Prince Yunnuo, you must be joking.

53
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,110
I grew up in Xilin and never left.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,350
How could I possibly be that girl?

55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,790
I don't know exactly

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,844
where you grew up.

57
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,020
But I am certain

58
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,070
that the only person who knew

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,700
that special bandaging method
was the girl I met

60
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:24,860
when I escaped the palace as a child.

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,950
You don't have to worry.

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,350
I didn't expose you before,

63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,350
and I won't in the future.

64
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,620
Prince Yunnuo.

65
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,140
Why are you doing this?

66
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,320
I know you're that girl

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,740
from back then.

68
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,140
So please, trust me.

69
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,230
Prince Yunnuo.

70
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,977
Honestly, I never meant
to take Princess Aliya's place

71
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,266
and marry Prince Jin.

72
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,088
It was all just
one big misunderstanding.

73
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,230
A single misstep led to a whole mess.

74
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,900
Thankfully,

75
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,511
I kept meeting people who helped me.

76
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,580
I had no choice but to go along with it.

77
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,590
I knew it.

78
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,488
You never wanted
to be Princess Consort Jin.

79
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,790
Don't worry.

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,550
You won't have
to keep going down this path.

81
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,244
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

82
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,420
Get out of here?

83
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,420
All right.

84
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,060
Prince Yunnuo.

85
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,710
Since we're on the same side,

86
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,019
I'd like to show you something.

87
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,180
Why don't you head back first?

88
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,200
I will see you later.

89
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:41,666
Very well.

90
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,470
Prince Yunnuo.

91
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,990
This is the Golden Box.

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,740
It's very important to me.

93
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
I have to open it.

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,940
Do you have any idea how to unlock

95
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,910
the cloud pattern on it?

96
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,150
The pattern looks

97
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,940
quite complicated.

98
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,733
I will help you figure it out.

99
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,470
Thank you.

100
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,100
(Benevolent and Kind)

101
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,740
Princess Consort Jin?

102
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,300
Princess Aliya of Xilin, right?

103
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,790
You're exactly who we're looking for.

104
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,180
Kill her.

105
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,200
Don't worry.

106
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,066
Leave this to me.

107
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,380
You healed Brother's legs.

108
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,088
Probably someone
wants to get rid of you.

109
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,377
From now on,

110
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,670
the danger will be hard to avoid.

111
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,180
I...

112
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,060
Believe me.

113
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,180
Today's attack

114
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,990
is just the beginning.

115
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,670
More people could get dragged into this.

116
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,444
You'd be better off leaving Brother.

117
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:49,311
Your Highness.

118
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:50,740
His Highness is asking to see you.

119
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,110
I am a bit tired.

120
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,110
Maybe tomorrow.

121
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,940
He said it's very important.

122
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:57,620
He needs to see you no matter what.

123
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:00,230
(There has been progress
with the cloud pattern.)

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,710
(It's time for me to leave.)

125
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,260
All right.

126
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,300
Tell him I'll be right there.

127
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,377
Understood.

128
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:33,670
Your Highness.

129
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,230
I'm sorry for being late.

130
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,060
It's fine.

131
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,180
Sit.

132
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:50,310
- There's something I need to...
- I have something to say...

133
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,380
Let me speak first.

134
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,590
I need to tell you the truth.

135
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,500
If you talk first,

136
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:58,666
it might be too late.

137
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
My leg injury

138
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
has been fake all along.

139
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,990
I never meant to lie to you.

140
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,590
I have faked it for over ten years

141
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,550
because the palace is too dangerous.

142
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,620
This was the only way
I could protect myself.

143
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,350
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,620
I hope you won't be angry.

145
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,500
You hid your strength

146
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,350
to escape from the world.

147
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,030
But you stood up for me.

148
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,110
How could I be angry?

149
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,230
Thank you.

150
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,230
Thank you

151
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,470
for everything.

152
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,990
Actually, I...

153
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,910
I have something to ask you.

154
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,590
Do you still mean

155
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,266
what you said before?

156
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,380
I always keep my word.

157
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,110
Then, please keep the promise

158
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,470
you made on our wedding day.

159
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,110
Let me go.

160
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,990
Neither of us wants this marriage.

161
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,822
But we have no choice
but to go through with it.

162
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,060
When the time is right,

163
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,910
I promise I'll find a way to let you go.

164
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,222
Let you go?

165
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,577
What do you mean by that?

166
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
You can repudiate me or divorce me.

167
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:02,950
Either is fine.

168
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,620
As long as you set me free.

169
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:13,950
All right.

170
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:16,666
You say you want to leave.

171
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,710
Then tell me, where will you go?

172
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,830
The world is wide.

173
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,660
Anywhere can be home.

174
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,590
But this is your home.

175
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,380
His Majesty ordered me
to cure your legs.

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,430
Now that you're healed,

177
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,710
I will go see His Majesty

178
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,622
and come up with a reason to leave.

179
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:40,990
No.

180
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,350
Your Highness...

181
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,222
I won't allow it.

182
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,830
I've already made up my mind.

183
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,950
You want to leave? Fine.

184
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,260
Father's birthday is coming soon.

185
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,355
It is highly inappropriate for you
to leave at a time like this.

186
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,990
I have thought of a compromise.

187
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,470
Stay until
the birthday celebration is over.

188
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,140
Once that is done,

189
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,470
I will speak to Father
about this matter.

190
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:26,860
Your Highness...

191
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,660
It is decided.

192
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,620
Good night.

193
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,650
(Benevolent and Kind)

194
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,230
What?

195
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,310
She plans to speak to my father.

196
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,660
Looks like she is set on leaving.

197
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,470
That can't be right.

198
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,780
From what I have seen between you two,

199
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,150
Her Highness doesn't seem like
she wants to leave at all.

200
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,950
This came way too suddenly.

201
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,660
Maybe I misunderstood.

202
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,133
Maybe she really doesn't like me.

203
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,540
No way.

204
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,500
You clearly like him.

205
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:07,470
So why were your words so harsh?

206
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,950
That's exactly why I said what I said.

207
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:14,844
I don't understand.

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,260
We agreed you'd
be honest with His Highness.

209
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,900
But instead,

210
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,590
you not only hid the truth,

211
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:22,830
you asked for a separation.

212
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,740
Your mind certainly works
in unusual ways.

213
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,950
Yuetao.

214
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,830
You know what?

215
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,350
It actually makes perfect sense.

216
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,110
I knew pretending to be
someone else was risky,

217
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:41,577
but I refused to believe it.

218
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,190
If I don't leave now,

219
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,555
I might end up
hurting both myself and others.

220
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,830
When you love someone,

221
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,377
you want what's best for them.

222
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,070
You don't knowingly let them

223
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,140
walk into danger.

224
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,830
What if he wants
to face that danger with you?

225
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,140
But I don't want him to.

226
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,540
He's Prince Jin of Luzhao.

227
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,110
He has a noble status

228
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,540
and great responsibilities.

229
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,900
He can't have a walking disaster like me

230
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,990
by his side.

231
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,710
But...

232
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:17,888
Why two people

233
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,070
who love each other can't be together?

234
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,333
Your Highness.

235
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,740
I have a perhaps naive guess.

236
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,350
Go on.

237
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,660
Could it be that Her Highness

238
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,830
thinks her identity

239
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,540
might bring trouble to you

240
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,070
by staying in the residence?

241
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,500
So what if it brings trouble?

242
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,260
I've already stood up for her.

243
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,660
I'll protect her no matter what.

244
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,470
Or does she think

245
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,430
I'm not capable of protecting her?

246
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,070
In that case, I'll prove her wrong.

247
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,380
How?

248
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,380
Based on what he said tonight,

249
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,710
I think I'll be leaving soon.

250
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,350
You mean...

251
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,244
- The birthday banquet.
- The birthday banquet.

252
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,010
(Hanyuan Hall)

253
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,470
What kind of gift

254
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,620
should I prepare
for His Majesty's birthday?

255
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,380
The birthday celebration?

256
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,070
Your Highness.

257
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,950
You don't have to put
so much effort into the gift.

258
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,380
His Majesty has never liked
any of your gifts

259
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,900
all these years anyway.

260
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,780
Mind your words!

261
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,710
Ridiculous!

262
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
I apologize.

263
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,380
How can someone as intelligent as me

264
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,590
end up with someone
as dumb as you serving me?

265
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,660
I've no idea how you've survived

266
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,860
all this time in the palace.

267
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,260
Your Highness.

268
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,500
Should we consult Prince Yunnuo?

269
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,740
I'd love to.

270
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,190
If only I could actually see him.

271
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,380
Who knows what he is busy with

272
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,260
all day?

273
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
I heard

274
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,660
ever since Prince Jin recovered,

275
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,310
Prince Yunnuo has been turned away

276
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,129
every time
he visited Prince Jin's Residence.

277
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,230
After a few failed attempts,

278
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,950
he just stopped coming out altogether.

279
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,044
It must be
because of Princess Consort Jin again.

280
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,590
But I heard

281
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,110
it was Prince Yunnuo
who kept going to see her.

282
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,380
That's only because

283
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,830
that temptress seduced my Yunnuo.

284
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,830
She cured Prince Jin's legs,

285
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:29,288
and she's even
taken over my role in organizing

286
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:30,880
His Majesty's birthday celebration!

287
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,310
Deliver a message

288
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,230
to Prince Yunnuo.

289
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,200
Tell him to focus on planning
the celebration for His Majesty.

290
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,470
No unwarranted outings.

291
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,260
I'll take care of everything else.

292
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,540
Yes, Your Highness.

293
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:49,650
(Liuyun Mansion)

294
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:53,688
Your Highness.

295
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,190
What is it?

296
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:56,830
Noble Consort has issued a decree.

297
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,511
You, Prince Jin,
and Princess Consort Jin

298
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:00,970
are to handle His Majesty's
birthday celebration with utmost care.

299
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,380
Got it.

300
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,070
Guihu.

301
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,020
Have you prepared
everything I asked for?

302
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:10,950
Your Highness.

303
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:12,780
The gifts for His Majesty have been...

304
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:13,950
I'm not talking about that.

305
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,950
I meant the cloud pattern mechanism.

306
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,500
I found a few leads.

307
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,070
Based on your description,

308
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,830
it sounds like
a Xilin cloud-pattern lock.

309
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,020
How do we unlock it?

310
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,620
I haven't found the method yet.

311
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,140
It was created decades ago,

312
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,511
exclusively for the royal family.

313
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,266
The craftsmanship
is incredibly intricate.

314
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,140
It has been lost for over a decade now.

315
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,500
There are very few clues remaining.

316
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,540
Keep looking into it.

317
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:37,755
Yes, Your Highness.

318
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,290
(Prince Jin's Residence)

319
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,830
At least eat something.

320
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,230
You have important business today.

321
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:53,977
You've to discuss the birthday banquet
with Prince Yunnuo.

322
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,710
It's fine.

323
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:57,500
Prince Yunnuo is on our side.

324
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,430
What about Prince Jin?

325
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,990
He'll be present too.

326
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,660
Please eat something.

327
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,260
Yuetao.

328
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,990
I'm full. Let's go.

329
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,380
Aliya.

330
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,470
Today's meeting will be

331
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,990
mentally draining.

332
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,590
You really should eat more.

333
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,200
Thank you for your concern.

334
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,140
I really am full.

335
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,380
I'll excuse myself.

336
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:39,140
Greetings,
Princess Consort Jin, and Brother.

337
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:41,710
I just finished breakfast
and was waiting for you.

338
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:45,230
You came at the right time.

339
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,660
Let's begin our discussion

340
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,190
about the birthday celebration.

341
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,070
Sure.

342
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,540
Come, Aliya.

343
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,620
Prince Yunnuo.

344
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,780
Follow me.

345
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,155
Let's move the banquet to start
at the hour of Wei.

346
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,500
One hour for greeting guests

347
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,710
is definitely not enough.

348
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:18,177
What do you think, Your Highness?

349
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,630
Agreed.

350
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,733
- One hour is short...
- Princess Consort Jin.

351
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,990
How about this change?

352
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,390
Let me see.

353
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,500
Here.

354
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,630
You removed the steamed duck slices?

355
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,740
We already have

356
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,340
the roasted stove-hung duck.

357
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,580
It might be too repetitive,

358
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
so I removed it.

359
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:38,288
What do you think?

360
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,430
Well, One's a side dish,
and the other is sliced on a platter.

361
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,390
They taste different.

362
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,622
Then we'll keep both.

363
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,430
Is there anything else
you need help with?

364
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,190
Well, what is this
"Eight Immortals with Mu Shu Pork"?

365
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,540
I'm not familiar with it.

366
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,710
It is a traditional folk dish.

367
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,190
Made with black fungus, eggs,

368
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,060
and cucumber.

369
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,630
Do you think Father

370
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:09,950
would like a dish like that?

371
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,390
I think so. He cares for his people.

372
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,020
I'm sure he'd enjoy

373
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,155
a humble commoner's dish.

374
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,430
Let's include it then.

375
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:19,066
All right.

376
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,990
We still need one more soup.

377
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,020
Soup...

378
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,888
How about abalone and sea cucumber soup?

379
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:30,570
(Abalone and Sea Cucumber Soup)

380
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:31,711
We already have that.

381
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,580
How about

382
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,300
the Refreshing Three-Ingredient
Shredded Soup?

383
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,990
Refreshing Three-Ingredient
Shredded Soup?

384
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,470
That's a great idea!

385
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:47,821
(Refreshing Three-Ingredient
Shredded Soup)

386
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,390
Your handwriting

387
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,670
may be a little messy,

388
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,533
but it's kind of endearing.

389
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,910
- This...
- I think we should stop here.

390
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,540
You must be tired, Aliya.

391
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,710
Let's retire to our room.

392
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,990
I wasn't done writing!

393
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,666
Come on.

394
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,230
Let me go!

395
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,990
Let me go! What's your problem?

396
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,200
What's my problem?

397
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:23,780
What were you doing just now?

398
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,390
What did I do?

399
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:27,333
Do you seriously not understand
what you did?

400
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:30,222
The way you acted was completely
unbefitting of a princess consort.

401
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,820
Have I not always been like this?

402
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:34,300
That just proves
I haven't been strict enough with you,

403
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:36,533
which is why you acted
so disgracefully just now!

404
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,990
So now I embarrass you, is that it?

405
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:46,777
No matter.

406
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,060
You only have to endure a little longer.

407
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,100
Once Father's birthday is over,

408
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,260
I won't embarrass you any further.

409
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,150
I didn't mean it that way...

410
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:18,911
Your Highness.

411
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:19,688
Your Highness.

412
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,430
Well?

413
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,150
Yuetao told me

414
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,340
Her Highness had already eaten.

415
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,800
She's currently working on preparations
for the birthday banquet.

416
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,950
Is she still upset?

417
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,333
I couldn't get a clear answer.

418
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,390
Then what took you so long?

419
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,470
Your Highness.

420
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,630
I think there was no need to even ask.

421
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,111
Her Highness is definitely upset.

422
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,260
You went too far

423
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,540
with your words.

424
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:40,990
But

425
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,540
was I

426
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,190
wrong?

427
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,500
Your Highness.

428
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,340
In my experience,

429
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,000
when it comes to feelings,

430
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,577
there's no such thing as right or wrong.

431
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,300
Moreover,

432
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,910
Her Highness and Prince Yunnuo

433
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,266
have always interacted like that.

434
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,710
Why were you so worked up today?

435
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,100
They've always interacted like that?

436
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,060
That close?

437
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,740
I should've guarded her
more closely from the start!

438
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,820
But

439
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,430
it was you who pushed her

440
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,844
toward Prince Yunnuo back then.

441
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,870
I didn't need that reminder.

442
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,430
You think I don't know what I did?

443
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,244
I regret it too, all right?

444
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:22,911
I just didn't have the courage

445
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,020
to tell her how I felt.

446
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:25,955
Your Highness.

447
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:30,580
I think you can't keep stalling.

448
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,540
You need to explain everything
to Her Highness

449
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,060
before the birthday celebration ends.

450
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,060
If you delay any longer,
you'll lose her for good.

451
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,540
Explain to her?

452
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,670
Will that really

453
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,630
make her stay?

454
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,190
You've got to try either way.

455
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,060
Let me think.

456
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,177
We're seeing Noble Consort tomorrow.

457
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,500
She always tries
to make things hard for her.

458
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,870
Then tomorrow,

459
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,990
I'll stay close
and protect her at all times.

460
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,580
What do you think?

461
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,266
Your Highness.

462
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,150
Are you asking me for my opinion?

463
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,100
Your

464
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,300
personal

465
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,390
guard?

466
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,100
Forget it.

467
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:20,977
Pretend I didn't say anything.

468
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:25,133
One really does make a mess of things

469
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,540
when one cares deeply.

470
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:31,730
(Benevolent and Kind)

471
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,340
Your Highness.

472
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:37,200
Your Highness.

473
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,500
What brings you here?

474
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,230
I admit

475
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,340
I went too far yesterday.

476
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,910
It's fine.

477
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,710
You were already quite gentle about it.

478
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,910
I haven't behaved
like a proper princess consort.

479
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,780
I've already apologized to you.

480
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,422
Please don't be upset.

481
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,300
I am not upset.

482
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:07,540
We have to go see
Noble Consort soon.

483
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,933
It won't look good if we're late.

484
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,390
We should leave now.

485
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,260
Is she not

486
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,150
bothered by this at all?

487
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,644
Does that mean she doesn't care
about our argument at all?

488
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,990
Her Highness

489
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,820
is magnanimous indeed.

490
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:32,911
But she didn't used to be like this.

491
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,820
(Hanyuan Hall)

492
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,020
You're early, Yunnuo,

493
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,870
as always.

494
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,630
And you're right on time,

495
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:48,580
as always.

496
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,340
You're all here.

497
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,430
- Your Highness.
- Mother.

498
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,740
If His Majesty's
birthday celebration goes well,

499
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,150
then I will be well.

500
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,910
Your Highness is right.

501
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:11,870
Your Highness, here is the detailed list
I put together overnight

502
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,340
(Guest List for the Birthday Banquet)
for the preparations.

503
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,300
Please take a look.

504
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,630
Princess Consort Jin.

505
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,910
His Majesty's birthday may be
a celebration with his subjects,

506
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,990
but your guest list is far too long.

507
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,100
What if His Majesty is exhausted

508
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,500
after all those formal greetings?

509
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:33,780
That...

510
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,488
And what is this?

511
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,190
3,000 in spending?

512
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:41,060
His Majesty has always valued frugality.

513
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,990
This is far

514
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,600
too extravagant.

515
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,340
Your Highness, I...

516
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,444
Let me take another look.

517
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,740
Silk drapery decorations.

518
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,100
Too much.

519
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,060
Blessing dance.

520
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,260
Gaudy.

521
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,870
Various opera performances.

522
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,710
Too noisy.

523
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,260
From where I stand,

524
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:57,910
none of this is appropriate.

525
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,060
Your Highness.

526
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:00,670
I think it is excellent.

527
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:03,000
What did you say, Prince Jin?

528
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,670
I said I think it is excellent.

529
00:25:08,444 --> 00:25:10,260
First of all,
she referenced your guest lists

530
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,740
from past years.

531
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,150
And this year's guest count is less.

532
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,230
Secondly,

533
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,150
my father values simplicity,

534
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,580
but this is not a family banquet.

535
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,710
I believe 3,000 is just
the right amount to spend.

536
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,470
As for the silk drapes,

537
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
the opera performances, and the dance...

538
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:27,540
If you knew my father

539
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,190
as well as Aliya does,

540
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,300
you'd know that these touches

541
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:34,288
suit my father's preferences quite well.

542
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,060
You...

543
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,670
There's no need to defend Her Highness.

544
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:39,500
She has her own ideas.

545
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:43,755
Your Highness.

546
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,500
This is my first time organizing
my father's birthday celebration.

547
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,630
Oversights are inevitable.

548
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:49,340
I appreciate your guidance

549
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:50,470
and will keep it in mind.

550
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,100
Once I return,

551
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:53,990
I'll review everything
and revise the plan

552
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,100
based on your past arrangements.

553
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,266
Based on my past arrangements?

554
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,580
That will not do.

555
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,190
His Majesty entrusted

556
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,133
this year's celebration to you all
for a reason.

557
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,390
He wants a surprise.

558
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
If it ends up the same

559
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,300
as every other year, he'd be displeased.

560
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,780
Mother.

561
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,710
Actually, I helped with the entire list

562
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,470
you just reviewed.

563
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,780
Truly?

564
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,870
Then I must say,

565
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,150
some of the arrangements

566
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,870
are quite fitting.

567
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,230
The silk drapery adds

568
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,540
a lovely splash of color.

569
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,630
The blessing dance

570
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,820
is festive and auspicious.

571
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,500
And the opera performances are...

572
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,100
Very lively.

573
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,740
Yes! With several performances going
at once, it'll be quite the spectacle.

574
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,100
Well done, Yunnuo.

575
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,230
Mother.

576
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,190
The truth is, it was
all Princess Consort Jin's idea.

577
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,630
That matters little.

578
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:46,470
What matters is
that this birthday celebration

579
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,111
must outshine everyone before it.

580
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:49,266
Princess Consort Jin.

581
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm giving you seven more days.

582
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,266
At the end of that time,

583
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,340
I want a real surprise.

584
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,580
Your Highness.

585
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,260
Seven days is far too short a time.

586
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,710
You think so too?

587
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,870
Your Highness.

588
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,150
I will do my best.

589
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,670
Excellent.

590
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,540
It's settled, then.
I'll see you in seven days.

591
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,888
If you need anything,

592
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:21,870
just come to me.

593
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:24,670
Thank you.

594
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,260
Guanguan?

595
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,580
Guanguan?

596
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:47,990
Guanguan!

597
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:50,990
Guanguan!

598
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,870
You can't eat that!

599
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,470
You'll get poisoned if you eat that.

600
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,230
Don't eat it again.

601
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,190
Aliya.

602
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,190
Aliya!

603
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,430
Do you hate me that much?

604
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,470
You see me and immediately turn around.

605
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,670
It's not that I hate you.

606
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,888
I just have
no intention of arguing with you.

607
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,422
No intention of arguing?

608
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,190
Then why does everything you do

609
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,780
feel like you're starting a fight?

610
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:37,178
♪The clouds stretch endlessly
across the sky♪

611
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,300
This is all my fault.

612
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:39,740
I'll be going now.

613
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:45,483
♪Looking down at eyes
that gaze into the distance♪

614
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:46,888
You're overstepping, Your Highness.

615
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,230
That is nothing for a married couple.

616
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,540
But we won't be husband and wife
for much longer.

617
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,460
Soon,
we'll be nothing more than strangers.

618
00:28:54,566 --> 00:29:01,427
♪It's more than
just the courage to yearn♪

619
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:05,920

626

Your Highness.

627
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,422
Did you find out
what you wanted to know?

628
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,950
Do you know

629
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:43,990
cats can't eat luoying grass?

630
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,430
Of course.

631
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,500
Cats get poisoned if they eat it.

632
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,390
But I saw it eating just now,

633
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,990
and I didn't stop it.

634
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,740
Why?

635
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,990
It likes it,

636
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,260
so I let it eat.

637
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,470
If it gets poisoned,

638
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,740
I'll do everything I can to cure it.

639
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,300
It's its favorite, after all.

640
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:06,740
Your Highness.

641
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,990
This is about you and Her Highness,
isn't it?

642
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,540
Do you love her that much?

643
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,990
Then there's an easy solution.

644
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,022
We've got two Resurrection Pills now.

645
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,260
Just tell her

646
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,260
you've already known who she really is.

647
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,950
Then the two of you
take the pills together.

648
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,230
Problem solved!

649
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,470
But luoying grass doesn't move.

650
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,710
If it could,

651
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,300
it would run far away from the cat

652
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,670
that keeps nibbling at it.

653
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,670
She just wants to stay away from me.

654
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,470
I think you went too far today.

655
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,710
Even I can tell

656
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:54,111
His Highness genuinely likes you.

657
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,230
You're aware of that too.

658
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,500
You like him.

659
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,740
He likes you.

660
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,020
Just tell him

661
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,500
who you really are.

662
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:10,800
What's on your mind?

663
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,630
Say something.

664
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,630
What do you really want?

665
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,470
I want him to stay away from me.

666
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:18,300
That way, no matter what happens to me,

667
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,540
he won't be dragged into it.

668
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,540
But you really like him.

669
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:23,950
That's exactly
why I have to stay away from him.

670
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:29,140
(Benevolent and Kind)

671
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:33,810
(Liuyun Mansion)

672
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:41,844
Prince Yunnuo.

673
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,430
You asked me to come alone.

674
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,266
Do you have a lead on the mechanism?

675
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,470
Not yet.

676
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,990
I wanted to ask

677
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,470
if you've thought more

678
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:53,733
about what I said last time.

679
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,710
I've already brought up

680
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,200
the separation with Prince Jin.

681
00:31:59,630 --> 00:31:59,950
Good.

682
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,260
That's good.

683
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,870
When do you plan to leave?

684
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,500
I promised Prince Jin

685
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,580
I'd leave after Father's

686
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,044
birthday celebration.

687
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:11,955
All right.

688
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,670
Don't worry.

689
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,177
I'll take care of everything

690
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,622
after you leave his residence.

691
00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:18,333
That's all right.

692
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,060
I can take care of myself.

693
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,066
You don't have to be so polite

694
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,020
to me.

695
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,190
Prince Yunnuo.

696
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:28,050
You kept my identity a secret,
helped me out of tight spots,

697
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:29,955
and even looked
into the cloud pattern for me.

698
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,100
I have no way to repay you.

699
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,470
Then,

700
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,670
does our promise still stand?

701
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,430
That was just childish talk.

702
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,300
What if

703
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,430
I was serious?

704
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:49,300
Let's go see taller mountains,
and visit farther places, together.

705
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:55,060
Then I'll take it as a joke
you meant sincerely.

706
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:56,630
I still have things to do.

707
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,666
Please excuse me.

708
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:09,844
Your Highness.

709
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,459
Everything you ordered

710
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,950
for His Majesty's birthday celebration

711
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,710
is ready.

712
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,230
This time,
we will take Prince Jin down for good.

713
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:20,088
I didn't ask you to act on your own.

714
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,540
What?

715
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:22,060
Your Highness.

716
00:33:22,422 --> 00:33:23,990
We must not act out of sentimentality.

717
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,466
If we let this chance slip,

718
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,950
the consequences could be unfathomable.

719
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,260
She'll leave his residence

720
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,780
after the celebration.

721
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,590
I will have no more need
for this kind of opportunity.

722
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:35,400
I don't want anything that will put her

723
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,190
in harm's way.

724
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:37,260
Your Highness...

725
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:41,950
Understood.

726
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:53,630
Your Highness.

727
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,150
I went to see Prince Yunnuo

728
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,780
about some personal matters today.

729
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,780
I...

730
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,220
See whoever you want.

731
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:11,444
We won't be tied together
much longer anyway.

732
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:22,540
Your Highness?

733
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,350
Your Highness!

734
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,910
That wasn't the plan!

735
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,730
Weren't you going
to explain everything tonight?

736
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:28,222
Forget it.

737
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,511
No matter how hard I try,
I can't make her stay.

738
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,350
If she no longer wishes to be here,
I'll let her go.

739

741

(It's still money.)

742
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,511
(I never take advantage of others,
however small.)

743
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,466
