1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,640
Good morning...

2
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,280
Man!

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,120
Good morning, Man!

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Sangmin?

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,000
Mom!

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Dinneaw.

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
This is Sangmin, the boy I told you about.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,560
The Korean boy I kept talking about.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,840
Actually,

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,000
Dinneaw wants to be a tour guide.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
Why did you decide to show up now?

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,840
It's personal.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
Thank you, Mom.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,760
Don't you have your own Mom?

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
Take Sangmin to soju place.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,280
We have to sneak out.

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,120
Okay.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,720
Okay.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,200
Serving time.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
Sangmin, what would you like?

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,759
This one,

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,120
Tiger Power.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,720
Or this one,

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,560
Horse Stomping.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
Or this one,

26
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,360
Endless Erection.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,280
Endless Erection?

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,200
What is it?

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
How should I explain?

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,840
You tell him.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,360
We men are strong.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,080
When we wake up, it stands up too.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,440
Sangmin.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,360
Oh!

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,760
Get it?

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Endless Erection!

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Yeah.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,040
Endless Erection.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
Come on.

40
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,240
Let's take an oath with this drink.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
We'll get an erection together!

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,760
We'll get an erection together!

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Jan!

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
What does "jan" mean, Sangmin?

45
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,920
Oh?

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,960
"Jan" means...

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,680
cheers.

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
Oh, cheers?

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,920
Jan!

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
- Jan!   - Jan!

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Bottoms up!

52
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,760
Oh yeah.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,320
By the way, why won't you call him "Big Bro"?

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,320
Doesn't that seem disrepectful?

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,360
He looks way older than you.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,040
That's right.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,760
Dinneaw must say...

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,200
Big Bro Sangmin.

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,760
One more drink,

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
and I'll call you Big Bro.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Okay?

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,079
Sangmin.

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Okay.

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,920
- Jan!   - Jan!

65
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
Dinneaw...

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
You're wasted.

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
What?

68
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,760
I won't call you Big Bro now.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,000
Big Bro Sangmin.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,640
Uncle Sangmin.

71
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,560
No, no.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Big Bro Sangmin.

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
You Sangmin.

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Big Bro Sangmin?

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
Uncle Sangmin.

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
You Sangmin.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Big Bro.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
Big Bro?

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Big Bro...

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Uncle.

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,440
Uncle.

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Uncle.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,240
Hey! Don't!

84
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Sangmin.

85
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,680
Are you up? Let's have breakfast.

86
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Sangmin?

87
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Ah!

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
Last night...

89
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
I don't remember.

90
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,120
Just forget it.

91
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Why do I have to forget?

92
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
It was hot, so we took our shirts off and just slept.

93
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,880
Didn't we?

94
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,640
Mom.

95
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,560
Stop talking.

96
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
I don't want to hear it.

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,800
Hot porridge with salt.

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
For your hangover.

99
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,080
Eat it while it's still hot.

100
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,240
Eat up.

101
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
Is there nothing else, Mom?

102
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,800
There's nothing

103
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,680
because someone spent our breakfast money on booze.

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,200
What money do we have left to spend on good food?

105
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
Eat up.

106
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
Sangmin doesn't like salt.

107
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,679
You don't like salt? Do you like booze then?

108
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
You didn't even drink alone.

109
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,960
You took our little boy with you.

110
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,840
Sigh!

111
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,280
Both my sons are giving me a headache.

112
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,320
Sigh.

113
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,680
You told me to apologize to him last night.

114
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
When Korean people apologize,

115
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,040
they go out for a drink.

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,400
It's just a little. We weren't too drunk.

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,280
Right?

118
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,440
A little? You weren't drunk?

119
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Sangmin sorry.

120
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,720
This family accepts working instead of apology.

121
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Money is work. Work is money, which brings happiness.

122
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,160
Working is the best way to say "I love you".

123
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,280
You're in trouble, Sangmin.

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,680
What trouble?

125
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,800
Hey! Stop!

126
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
Both of you, stop!

127
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,280
You will mold my new collections

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,680
and sell them at the market.

129
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,040
If you don't sell out, I won't forgive you for real!

130
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
Last night...

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,280
I said forget it.

132
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Sharing a bed doesn't mean we're family.

133
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,560
Try this.

134
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Yeah.

135
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Dip your hands in water.

136
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,600
That's right.

137
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,680
Put your hands there.

138
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,600
Like this.

139
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Press on one side.

140
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,960
Here.

141
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,400
Hold this with your other hand.

142
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,720
Hold it.

143
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,840
Use your thumb.

144
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
It's flawed, right?

145
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
Umm...

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,600
It's bent.

147
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,440
But...

148
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,920
still okay.

149
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Hey, Dinneaw.

150
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Last night,

151
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,200
did you get home safe?

152
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,400
You guys were so drunk.

153
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
We got home safe.

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,960
Nothing happened.

155
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Right, Sangmin?

156
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,160
Okay. Just play nice together.

158
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,320
Don't fight so much that your customers run away.

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
You worry about others?

160
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
What about you?

161
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
Did you know what you did last night when you were drunk?

162
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
What did I do?

163
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,440
I was drunk. It doesn't count.

164
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,080
Why would I remember?

165
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,160
I like you...

166
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,680
Dinneaw.

167
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,320
Hey.

168
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,840
Is that how you speak to your VIP customer?

169
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,560
I can't take that.

170
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,280
You can't take that?

171
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Eat somewhere else.

172
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,800
Oh?

173
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,840
I was kidding. Just kidding.

174
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,600
Hey!

175
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,320
Stop. That's too much.

176
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Just kidding.

177
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,960
Okay. You know what?

178
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,080
Give me some hot meatballs.

179
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,200
Ten sticks of them.

180
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Okay?

181
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,800
That's what I like to hear.

182
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Ten sticks.

183
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,160
Yeah.

184
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,320
Okay. Coming up.

185
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,200
Sangmin. You're not helping.

186
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,160
We're not getting customers.

187
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,720
Because of Sangmin?

188
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,960
Last time, customers bought anything you touch.

189
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,800
They didn't.

190
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,680
They did.

191
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,560
Didn't.

192
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,400
Okay. They didn't.

193
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,440
You want to help selling stuff, right?

194
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,200
Yeah.

195
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,200
So...

196
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,280
Big Bro Sangmin, could you help me please?

197
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,440
Big Bro?

198
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,720
Big Bro.

199
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,400
Young man.

200
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,320
Miss.

201
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,040
Miss?

202
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,040
What color would you like?

203
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,040
White...

204
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
So white!

205
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
Whitest ever!

206
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,800
We don't have one in white.

207
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,359
Oh!

208
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,040
I'll have the one the model's holding.

209
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,359
I'm just buying it as a...

210
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,839
godforsaken...

211
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,119
I mean a keepsake.

212
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,120
Here.

213
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,000
Thank you.

214
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,040
These things look like they'll sell more online.

215
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Oh, Mr. Sainam.

216
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,560
Well...

217
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,640
I'm not good at using social media.

218
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,320
These things can be taught.

219
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
Right, Pony?

220
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,800
That's right.

221
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Dinneaw...

222
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,800
doesn't like selling.

223
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
Dinneaw wants to be tour guide.

224
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
Please take a look around.

225
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,080
See if there's something you like.

226
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Think of it as supporting a silly guy.

227
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,040
Silly?

228
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,120
What does it mean?

229
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,360
Silly means lovely.

230
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,280
Right?

231
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,880
That's right.

232
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,160
Lovely.

233
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,040
Well, this one looks lovely.

234
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,520
This drawing looks like a riverside house.

235
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,800
Where is this place?

236
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,240
It's my family's homestay.

237
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,560
It's not far from the market.

238
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,240
Just a few minutes walk from here.

239
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,320
What is your homestay called?

240
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,240
Ban Dinneaw Homestay.

241
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,800
Ban Dinneaw.

242
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,520
What a lovely name.

243
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,560
What about you? What's your name?

244
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
My name is Din....

245
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,560
My name is...

246
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,640
Sangmin.

247
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,800
My name silly?

248
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,520
It's silly, Sangmin.

249
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,320
What about you?

250
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,000
My name is Dinneaw.

251
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,840
Dinneaw.

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,320
If I'd like to buy all of these, would you sell them all?

253
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
Of course.

254
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
You can take a look at everything.

255
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,760
Pack them in a box and bubble wrap them for me.

256
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,040
I'll have someone pick it up to be shipped to Amphawa.

257
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,560
Amphawa?

258
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,800
Well, my boss, Mr. Sainam...

259
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,600
is the owner of Na Tree Tara in Amphawa.

260
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
I would like to see other collections too. Do you have more?

261
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,800
Well...

262
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,240
That's very nice, Boss.

263
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
Honey.

264
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,880
You've been waiting for me to draw this, right?

265
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,760
Do you remember that night?

266
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
The night you asked me to dance with you at the school party.

267
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,000
You're the most beautiful memory in my life,

268
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,320
and you always will be.

269
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,120
Is it cold up there?

270
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,880
You don't like cold weather.

271
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,600
Do you have someone to put blanket on you?

272
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,880
Get a blanket, okay?

273
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,800
Let's dance, shall we?

274
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,400
Come on.

275
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,480
Mom.

276
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,040
What?

277
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,080
What are you doing?

278
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,320
Oh gosh!

279
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,000
You came in all of a sudden.

280
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
Who did you bring with you?

281
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,880
Why didn't you tell me someone's coming?

282
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
Good day, sir.

283
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,760
Welcome to Dinneaw Homestay.

284
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,600
Hello to you.

285
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,240
Hello.

286
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Hello.

287
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
- Hello.   - Mom.

288
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,880
Mr. Sainam...

289
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,720
bought our entire stock of plates, bowls, and cups.

290
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,600
Really?

291
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,560
Really, Sangmin?

292
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,760
Yes.

293
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,360
Thank you. Thank you so much.

294
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,480
Thank you so much.

295
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,560
Oh!

296
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,640
Who would stay mad at you like this?

297
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
Money doesn't really matter.

298
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
It's how you make money the right way. That's the most important.

299
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Well done, Sangmin.

300
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
Won't you praise me too?

301
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,880
You're the best.

302
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,320
I need to take this call. I'll be back.

303
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,720
I'm coming too.

304
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,480
Oh? You guys!

305
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,280
You're leaving your customers just like that?

306
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,240
It's fine. I can wait here.

307
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,400
I'll just take my time to shop around.

308
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,320
Come on.

309
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,840
I'll show you our newest collection.

310
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,280
Hello?

311
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,080
Ayuddhaya Tour?

312
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,240
I got the job as a tour guide?

313
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Starting tomorrow?

314
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,640
I'll be happy to.

315
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,280
Thank you so much.

316
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,120
Be a guide?

317
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,080
Why did you listen?

318
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,080
Hurts.

319
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
Hurts.

320
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,480
Do you have medicine?

321
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,160
You got sunburned.

322
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,040
Welcome to Ayuddhaya.

323
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
There are so many tourist attactions around here.

324
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,240
If you want to book a very handsome tour guide,

325
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,840
it's me!

326
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,760
My name is Dinneaw.

327
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
Ready to show you Ayuddhaya,

328
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,760
my hometown, and anywhere in Thailand!

329
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,640
You get to follow your dream now.

330
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,160
"Kum"?

331
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
Kum means a dream?

332
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,800
Dinneaw did it.

333
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,400
Make...

334
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,480
dream...

335
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,960
Oh!

336
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,280
Follow my dream.

337
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,800
I don't know if I should go to work.

338
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm worried about my mom.

339
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,480
Ever since my dad died,

340
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
she has always been alone.

341
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,320
She's got the homestay to run.

342
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,280
Dinneaw has to be happy.

343
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,560
How can I be happy...

344
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,000
if I leave my mom here by herself?

345
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,520
Sangmin?

346
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,600
You're staying with my mom?

347
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,800
This won't hurt.

348
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,560
Come on.

349
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Thank you so much

350
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,880
for supporting our local products.

351
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,800
I just don't get it.

352
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,480
Why did you buy so many things?

353
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
They're beautiful to me.

354
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,160
You see?

355
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,880
If I display them at my hotel in Amphawa,

356
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,600
my guests will love them.

357
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,320
Oh gosh!

358
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,160
Am I talking to a hotel's owner?

359
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,560
Oh no!

360
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,080
I'm honored. Why didn't you tell me?

361
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,120
Actually, this homestay...

362
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,320
was built by Dinneaw's father.

363
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,880
Now that he passed away,

364
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,800
we have to keep it going as mother and son.

365
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,760
We don't really get many guests at this homestay.

366
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,000
Selling these products is how we get by.

367
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
I think you're really lucky.

368
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,160
You have a very good son.

369
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,080
I saw Dinneaw selling them at the market.

370
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,560
He was working so hard.

371
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,040
Yes, he does work hard.

372
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
He actually wants to be a tour guide.

373
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,240
He wants to travel the world.

374
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,880
The problem is me.

375
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,800
He's worried about me.

376
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,080
I tried to push him to get training and get a job.

377
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,160
He just won't go.

378
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,280
How about working at my hotel?

379
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,120
We have a trainee exchange program.

380
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,360
We do exchange staff between two organizations

381
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
to learn new things.

382
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,080
Huh?

383
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,640
You can do that?

384
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
Of course, Ma'am.

385
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,400
I'll give you an easy example.

386
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,160
Let's say we want to grow organic veggies,

387
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,320
or we want to develop a local food recipe.

388
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,800
Dinneaw can train and learn how we work at the hotel.

389
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,320
He can learn booking, serving welcome drinks, and international standards.

390
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
Most importantly,

391
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,240
Dinneaw won't have to worry you'll be alone.

392
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,080
Mr. Sainam.

393
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,160
Please...

394
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,960
take my son as a trainee.

395
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,280
I don't really understand anything you said,

396
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,120
but I just know it's going to be good for my son.

397
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,320
Could you please?

398
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,240
With your permission,

399
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,800
I'll invite him.

400
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh!

401
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,040
Please do. Invite him.

402
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,080
Let me get you some coffee, on the house.

403
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,480
This way please.

404
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,120
This our café.

405
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,040
Right this way, please.

406
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,840
Are you blowing ghosts away?

407
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,560
You're always mean! Let's cool down together then.

408
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,800
Coffee's here.

409
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,640
We've got some hot coffee.

410
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Thank you.

411
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
You're welcome.

412
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,520
- It's fragrant and hot. Try it.   - Thank you.

413
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
I got a job, Mom!

414
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,040
I'll try working as a tour guide for foreigners.

415
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Really?

416
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,320
Oh!

417
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,280
My son finally got the courage to face the outside world?

418
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,880
I got a job in Ayuddhaya. I won't be far from you.

419
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,080
I'm so happy.

420
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
This is unfortunate.

421
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah. It's so unfortunate.

422
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,080
Pony!

423
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,640
This is not the time for this!

424
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,400
You're right. I'm sorry.

425
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,400
It's unfortunate.

426
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I wanted you as an exchange trainee at my hotel.

427
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,040
Yeah.

428
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,280
That's right.

429
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,320
You'll learn to work in an international level hotel.

430
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah. International universe, understand?

431
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
An exchange trainee...

432
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,800
is not the same as a tour guide, Mom.

433
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,080
I want to be a tour guide.

434
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,600
Also, I want to use my own skills,

435
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,480
not anyone's connection.

436
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Oops.

437
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,320
I'll support every decision of yours, Dinneaw.

438
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,720
I saw your determination...

439
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,560
and your abilities as well.

440
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,520
Huh?

441
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,600
What is it?

442
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,840
Uh-oh.

443
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Whoa.

444
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,760
You're lying on my thighs at this age?

445
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,760
Regardless of the years,

446
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,880
I'd still be lying on your thighs.

447
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,640
I don't know how long...

448
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,320
I can live to let you lie on my thighs?

449
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,280
Don't say that, Mom.

450
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,000
You'll be with me for a hundred or thousand more years.

451
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,240
Mom.

452
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Yeah?

453
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Am I good?

454
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,760
I got a job as a guide in Ayuddhaya on my own.

455
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Very good.

456
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

457
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,480
You have the courage to chase your own dream.

458
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
My dream.

459
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,280
"Kum".

460
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,320
What goom?

461
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
Goomba?

462
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,960
"Kum". It's Korean.

463
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,800
It means a dream.

464
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
This place's called...

465
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,600
Ban Mai Market.

466
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,960
And this is the...

467
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,800
delicious...

468
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,880
meatballs...

469
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
of the world.

470
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,360
And...

471
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,240
Dinneaw Homestay's Souvenir.

472
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
You've got a tour group.

473
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,960
I thought we'd sell more.

474
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,600
They've just had lunch.

475
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
Walking around will probably make them hungry.

476
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,800
They'll be back.

477
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,000
Ah!

478
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,760
Help me!

479
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,560
Help!

480
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,880
This is bad!

481
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Are you okay?

482
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm not okay!

483
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,560
This happened to my tourist.

484
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,240
I'm gonna sue you for damage!

485
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,640
It was an accident.

486
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,840
How could you blame Dinneaw?

487
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,600
Maybe working here is bad luck.

488
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,120
You're new guide?

489
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Would you like to work somewhere else?

490
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,800
Wait a minute.

491
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,560
This is not fair.

492
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,720
I'm sorry.

493
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,320
I believe in luck.

494
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,320
This is your first day,

495
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
yet you bring such bad luck.

496
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,560
You'll only have bad luck from now on.

497
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,320
Our fortunes are incompatible.

498
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,560
You're fired.

499
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,360
Sigh. Too bad.

500
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,120
First day on the job and you're already in trouble.

501
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,120
Yes?

502
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,560
There's not much time left?

503
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,000
Did the doctor say that?

504
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,600
Okay.

505
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,800
I'll be in Bangkok in a few days.

506
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,159
Mom.

507
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,159
Sangmin?

508
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,560
What is it?

509
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,440
Mom.

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,840
Sangmin will be with you...

511
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,080
two more days.

512
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,960
And then...

513
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,199
will have to go do my thing.

514
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,719
I'm gonna be so lonely then.

515
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,679
Dinneaw just got a job too.

516
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,920
Sangmin will miss Dinneaw and Mom.

517
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,120
Can you tell me now...

518
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,360
what did you come to do in Thailand?

519
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,720
I have a business with a friend.

520
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,680
Be careful if you're doing business.

521
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,240
Yes, Mom.

522
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,200
Good boy.

523
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
Well done.

524
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Dinneaw?

525
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,000
Why are you home so early?

526
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,560
I got fired.

527
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,360
What?

528
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,520
Sangmin!

529
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,240
Bring some pizza to Dinneaw at the market, please.

530
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,760
Pizza Phad Kaphrao, from Mom.

531
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,000
I applied as a tour guide in many places.

532
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,840
I got one job, and it was near my home.

533
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,560
In the end, I only got to work for a day.

534
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,120
Don't give up.

535
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
What did you say? "Jima"?

536
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,600
Jima?

537
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,160
What does that mean?

538
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,400
Oh?

539
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,280
Don't give up.

540
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,040
If you don't want to give up,

541
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,080
why don't you come to work at my hotel?

542
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,680
I don't want to go too far.

543
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,080
You know what?

544
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,560
I'll send my exchange trainee...

545
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,840
over here to be with your mom.

546
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,520
The job I have for you is not your dream job as a guide,

547
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,280
but you will be one step closer.

548
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,640
Hey!

549
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,920
That's your mom's pizza!

550
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,840
Sounds like a "yo mama" joke.

551
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,680
I mean that is Dinneaw's mom's Pizza Phad Kaphrao.

552
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
Did she make it for you?

553
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh?

554
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,000
Mr. Sainam.

555
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,880
Are you here to visit the market again?

556
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,880
Did something catch your eye?

557
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,920
Someone did.

558
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,440
I hope he goes to Amphawa.

559
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,400
Wow!

560
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
You're something, aren't you?

561
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,120
Sangmin...

562
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,920
is leaving.

563
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,240
Dinneaw...

564
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,240
you must follow your dream.

565
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,400
You said you'd be with my mom.

566
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,080
You mad...

567
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,280
at Sangmin?

568
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,720
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

569
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,640
Sangmin just found out.

570
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,560
Will we meet again?

571
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,960
Don't know.

572
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
You're so cruel. You know that?

573
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
When you first came here,

574
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,640
you left and didn't keep in touch.

575
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,000
My mom kept thinking of you.

576
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,240
She spoke of you almost every day.

577
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,080
Why didn't you call her at all?

578
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,640
Sangmin...

579
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,080
sorry.

580
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,480
Mom said...

581
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,880
you were sent to a boarding school.

582
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,080
Was that true?

583
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,640
Dinneaw must go with Sainam.

584
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,520
I said I'm not going!

585
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,240
Everyone is leaving my mom.

586
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,600
Dad left her.

587
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,040
You're leaving her.

588
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,080
How can I leave her too?

589
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,360
Sangmin sorry.

590
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
My mom just misses everyone who leaves her.

591
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,040
She never cries,

592
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,160
but her drawing always looks sad.

593
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,280
I don't want to see her sadness anymore.

594
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
"Sigan".

595
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,080
It means...

596
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,440
time.

597
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,920
Why would you talk about time?

598
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Time...

599
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,240
heals.

600
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,080
Make your dream...

601
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,880
come true.

602
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,920
"Kkum-eul ilwo"?

603
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,160
Time heals.

604
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,480
Make your dream come true.

605
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
You're still up?

606
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,400
I...

607
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,560
can't sleep.

608
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,280
Star.

609
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,560
Pretty.

610
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,920
Stars are pretty.

611
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,880
Stars are pretty.

612
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,440
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

613
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,160
Sangmin...

614
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,680
understands.

615
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,120
Dinneaw...

616
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,640
is sad.

617
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,280
The one who leaves...

618
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,560
might not feel anything.

619
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,080
The ones left behind...

620
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,640
will miss you.

621
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Sangmin...

622
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
will miss you...

623
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,640
every day.

624
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,480
Do you know...

625
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,760
what "kum" means in Thai?

626
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,880
It means to hold hands.

627
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,040
Like this.

628
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
Hold hands.

629
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,680
Come back again, Sangmin.

630
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,680
At least,

631
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,000
come visit my mom.

632
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,080
You wanna see...

633
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,000
Sangmin?

634
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,200
Yeah.

635
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh?

636
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,960
Sangmin.

637
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,760
It's your last day here. What do you want for your meals?

638
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,240
Oh...

639
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,600
What does Dinneaw like?

640
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,920
Well...

641
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,560
That one always goes for stir-fried morning glory,

642
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
with a sunny side up.

643
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,720
Can you teach me to cook?

644
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,000
Umm?

645
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,160
You wanna cook for him?

646
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,760
Why do you want to please him today?

647
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,520
Tell me what happened.

648
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,720
You're like brothers.

649
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
It's good to care about each other.

650
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,640
So...

651
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,520
let's begin, shall we?

652
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,720
Come on.

653
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,560
Sangmin.

654
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,160
Do you want to try flying morning glory?

655
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,120
I want.

656
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,280
Okay.

657
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,920
Stand over there.

658
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,560
Okay.

659
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,240
Sangmin.

660
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,080
Ready?

661
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,560
One, two...

662
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,200
three!

663
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh!

664
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,760
Dinneaw!

665
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,360
Dinneaw!

666
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,600
Sangmin...

667
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,280
sorry.

668
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,840
Sangmin.

669
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,480
I've decided.

670
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,560
I'm going to work as a trainee in Amphawa.

671
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,480
Oh, hi.

672
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,400
Pop.

673
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,320
Can I ask you something?

674
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,520
But...

675
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,200
you have to promise not to tell anyone.

676
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,480
Ask me.

677
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,840
I won't tell anyone.

678
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,480
Well...

679
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,840
if you like someone,

680
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,440
should you...

681
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,880
tell them you like them?

682
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,120
Or...

683
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,040
let them know with your actions?

684
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Well...

685
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,960
Honestly?

686
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,120
If you like someone who likes you too,

687
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,400
you would never doubt,

688
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,280
and you would never be anxious like this.

689
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,400
Anxious?

690
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,120
How do you know that's my feeling?

691
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,960
One-sided love...

692
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,800
is my specialty.

693
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,040
Who's your one-sided crush?

694
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,080
See?

695
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,960
If you're not the right one,

696
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,360
they'd never even look at you.

697
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,280
Listen.

698
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,200
Do you really not know...

699
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,360
that I've always had a crush on you?

700
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,480
Pop!

701
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,520
You're my freaking VIP customer!

702
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,200
Hey.

703
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,000
Are you swearing at me now?

704
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,000
Well...

705
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,640
If you like me,

706
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,560
why didn't you tell me?

707
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,480
Because I know...

708
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,040
that you have a crush on Dinneaw.

709
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,000
How can I compete?

710
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,960
Don't raise your voice!

711
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,680
Someone's gonna hear you.

712
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,160
Tor.

713
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,480
You should love someone who loves you.

714
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,840
Please be my boyfriend.

715
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,920
Dinneaw...

716
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,480
probably has someone on his mind.

717
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,000
If you mean Sangmin,

718
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,600
I think...

719
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,920
those two are more like brothers.

720
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,000
But I think...

721
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,400
those two...

722
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,320
look at each other in a weird way.

723
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,120
By the way,

724
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,960
Dinneaw invited us to the workshop in Amphawa.

725
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,480
Are you going?

726
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,080
What about you? Are you going?

727
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,160
If you go, I will.

728
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,000
But...

729
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,400
you have to promise me.

730
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,360
After that trip,

731
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,480
you'll be my boyfriend.

732
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,560
Promise me you'd never disappear again.

733
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,160
Promise.

734
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
See you later.

735
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,080
You do this.

736
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,480
See...

737
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,760
you again.

738
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,600
I know that phrase.

739
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,200
It means...

740
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,640
"see you again".

741
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,640
Yeah.

742
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,160
See you again.

743
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,440
See you again.

744
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,680
Welcome to our training program.

745
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,680
Why is your shirt so wrinkly?

746
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,640
What are you doing?

747
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,920
What are you doing?

748
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,200
How did you get so popular?

749
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,000
Everyone's got a crush on you.

750
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,040
Sangmin wants to be with Dinneaw.

751
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,360
Tor.

752
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,600
That night whe nyou were drunk, do you remember what we did?
