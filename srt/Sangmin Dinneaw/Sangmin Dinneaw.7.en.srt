1
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,200
Dinneaw!

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,880
Hey!

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,640
- Hey.
- Hey!

4
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,520
Hey!

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,720
In your case,

6
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,560
you could lose your memory.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,080
Please tell Sangmin

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,760
to get this surgery.

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
No surgery.

10
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,000
Why didn't you tell me

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,280
you were in so much trouble?

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,840
Huh?

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,680
Are Sangmin and Dinneaw dating?

14
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,200
So...

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
are you okay with that?

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,680
Sangmin...

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
won't forget...

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Dinneaw.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,200
He's been in surgery for hours.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Why are they still not done?

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Your dad was in surgery for a long time too.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,039
Don't you remember?

23
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,680
Calm down, Dinneaw.

24
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,400
Yeah.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,039
Come on.

26
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,120
Come and take a seat.

27
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
- Okay?
- Take a seat.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,759
Sit down and relax.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
Sit down.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,480
Sit down.

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
How is Sangmin doing?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
Well...

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
You said we could trust you?

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,680
What?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
How did this happen?

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Calm down, Dinneaw.

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
We all know there was a risk to this surgery.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,680
Let me go, Pop.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
Tor, let me go.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
Oh...

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
Why couldn't you save Sangmin?

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,600
The doctors did their best, Dinneaw.

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,560
I don't believe it.

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,400
- Dinneaw!
- Dinneaw!

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Sangmin can't die.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,600
He didn't die.

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,400
I was sorry...

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,079
for taking too long.

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,360
His heart stopped for ten seconds,

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
but Sangmin fought through

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
and made it.

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,840
Oh, Dad!

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,360
Oh man.

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
You paused too long.

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
Everyone's got the wrong idea.

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,840
I wasn't joking.

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
It's Dinneaw.

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
He complains too much.

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
I couldn't finish my sentence.

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,640
Yeah. It's okay.

63
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,720
Thank you.

64
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
Thank you so much, Doctor.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
We wish you guys well.

66
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I apologize for my son too.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,840
He's safe now.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
Yeah.

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
Dinneaw...

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
Sangmin made it!

71
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,960
Thank goodness.

72
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,120
Dinneaw.

73
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,120
Dinneaw.

74
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,480
Oh!

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,560
Oh my!

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
Dinneaw!

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,920
You're not a small child now.

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
Didn't you go home already?

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Hmph.

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
If I had gone,

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,280
I wouldn't have seen someone forcing himself
to the point of collapsing.

82
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,160
Sweetie?

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,160
But...

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,159
I can't leave yet,

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,000
not until I see Sangmin wakes up.

87
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,280
He's got visiting hours.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
After those hours, he needs rest.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,880
Mom...

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,159
Don't be stubborn.

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,840
Okay.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
If Sangmin wakes up,

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,680
and sees us sick,

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,159
he wouldn't like it.

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
Do you want to see the one you love...

96
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
upset about that?

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
No, I don't.

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,800
If you want to take care of a patient,

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,240
you have to be healthy.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Don't get sick together.

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,040
Who would take care of you then?

102
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,800
If it's too much, don't force yourself.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,720
Okay?

104
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
Come on.

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,680
Go home with Tor and Arthit.

106
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,040
This time, I got him.

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,720
If Sangmin wakes up,

108
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,680
I'll call you.

109
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay?

110
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Yes.

111
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
I'll be right back, Sangmin.

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,040
Wake up soon.

113
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,040
Dinneaw.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,000
Have you had any sleep these past few days?

115
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm here to get some sleep as my mom told me.

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,120
I keep waking up.

117
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
It's hard to stay asleep, Pop.

118
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm worried about Sangmin.

119
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,920
He hasn't woken up yet.

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm okay.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,400
I...

122
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm just feeling dizzy.

123
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,560
Hey, Dinneaw!

124
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,120
Hey!

125
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,040
Hey!

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,720
Dinneaw!

127
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
Dinneaw!

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
Is my eyesight going bad?

129
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
He already rejected you.

130
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,840
Yet you still kissed him?

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,720
No!

132
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,240
I...

133
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
You already know...

134
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
you can't stop...

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
anyone's feelings.

136
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,120
- I...
- Actually,

137
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I should have known where I stand by now.

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Won't you listen to my explanation?

139
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
I caught you red handed.

140
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,560
Is there something to be said?

141
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
Pop, you...

142
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
you're more easily upset than I thought.

143
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,000
You said...

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
you understand me no matter what.

145
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Why are you making it a big deal now?

146
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Because I don't want to be stuck...

147
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
in this relationship,

148
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,840
and be the dog that keeps chasing you.

149
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,840
If you don't want to be a dog,

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
then listen to the human's language.

151
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
But what I see...

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,120
doesn't need an explanation.

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,080
And if Dinneaw finds out,

154
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,520
can you still be friends?

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
Tor.

156
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,760
Pop, don't fight.

157
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,880
We're not fighting.

158
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
I've just run out of patience.

159
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
I want to give up.

160
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
I told you it's not what you think.

161
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
Here. Look.

162
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, Mom?

163
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
Sangmin woke up?

164
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
Okay. I'm on my way.

165
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,840
Sangmin woke up.

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,600
Who are you?

167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
What?

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,480
Sangmin asked...

169
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
who you are, Mrs. Orn.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,000
She's your adoptive mother.

171
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,480
Don't you remember?

172
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
And...

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
who are you?

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
Sangmin.

175
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,320
Don't you remember Mommy Orn?

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
He doesn't remember me either.

177
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,520
What?

178
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
Sangmin.

179
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,480
Do you remember Dinneaw?

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Mom.

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,880
How is Sangmin doing?

182
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,360
Here.

183
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,120
This is Dinneaw.

184
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,360
Do you remember him?

185
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
Umm...

186
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,960
Yeah...

187
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,880
Dog.

188
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
What?

189
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm not a dog.

190
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,720
Hey.

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
Dog.

192
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,240
Who does Sangmin remember, Mom?

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,840
Do you remember Tor and Arthit?

194
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
For a patient...

195
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,000
who underwent a brain surgery,

196
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
if he makes it through his critical moments,

197
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,320
there could be complications.

198
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,360
We're lucky for our instrument.

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,760
It only caused a small wound.

200
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,480
Moreover, his medicine is a product of research.

201
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
It made him healthy.

202
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
As for...

203
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,960
who he remembers or not,

204
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,840
that could take time.

205
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,200
If Sangmin doesn't remember,

206
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,840
let's not pressure him, guys.

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,520
Don't give him a headache.

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
Okay?

209
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,480
Yes.

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
Even though I expected...

211
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
that he wouldn't remember me,

212
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,720
when it really happened,

213
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,840
it's still hard, Mom.

214
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I feel somewhat shocked.

215
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
If you're my son, you have to overcome this.

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,240
What must you do if he doesn't remember?

217
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
Huh?

218
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,880
Umm.

219
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,440
Get to know him again.

220
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,120
Make new memories.

221
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
That's good, sweetie.

222
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
Think positive.

223
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,000
At least,

224
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,440
if he doesn't remember anything,

225
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
that means...

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,080
he forgot bad memories.

227
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,880
Now he will only have joy in his life.

228
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,240
What if he wants to remember his past?

229
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,640
What do we do?

230
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,840
We'll just tak about good things,

231
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,240
and keep other things a secret.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,120
Don't let the past haunt him again.

233
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Right.

234
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Sangmin.

235
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Are you hungry?

236
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,360
Hungry?

237
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
Dinneaw.

238
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Sangmin.

239
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,200
How can you see him as food?

240
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,200
Does that mean you've hooked up with him?

241
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,600
You remember my face as a dog,

242
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,600
but you remember the name "Dinneaw"

243
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
as food.

244
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,360
I should hit you.

245
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
Don't make that face.

246
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,840
I can't stay mad.

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
You shouldn't be mad at a sick man, right?

248
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
Watch your steps, Sangmin.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
Does your head still hurt?

250
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
A little.

251
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,120
Al least he still understands Thai.

252
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,760
That means...

253
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
he hasn't lost all his memories.

254
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
He'll remember us soon.

255
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,000
Talk to me, Pop.

256
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Tor.

257
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you guys still fighting?

258
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
I've been trying to talk to him all day.

259
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,200
If this were a chat,

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,520
you would only see the right side.

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,760
So...

262
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,520
I gotta go, Sangmin.

263
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,120
See you later.

264
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,440
Hey...

265
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,120
Tor.

266
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,440
Hey.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,840
You should talk it out with Pop.

268
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,520
If you're still doing nothing,

269
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,720
your chance will be gone.

270
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,480
Go.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah...

272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,640
Just go.

273
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,240
Trust me.

274
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,720
Yeah, okay.

275
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,120
Are you home already?

276
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,080
Whoa.

277
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm still cleaning up the house.

278
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Sangmin.

279
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,080
Hi.

280
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
We're home, Mom.

281
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
I want Sangmin to come home early.

282
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,000
Maybe he'll remember something.

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,840
Oh.

284
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,840
Look.

285
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,520
You shouldn't pressure him.

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,720
I know.

287
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,720
If Sangmin doesn't remember,

288
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
just make new good memories.

289
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
Sangmin.

290
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,240
Sangmin, how are you feeling? Is it hot?

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,120
Huh?

292
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,600
Mom.

293
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,640
Hmm?

294
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,760
Just now,

295
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,880
Sangmin,

296
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,720
what did you say?

297
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,880
Say that again, Sangmin.

298
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,880
Mom.

299
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,600
Oh!

300
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Oh!

301
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,000
Dinneaw!

302
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
Sangmin remembers!

303
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,000
Sangmin remembers!

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,480
Sangmin remembers!

305
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,200
Hey.

306
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
He must have remembered you.

307
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh.

308
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,960
That's right.

309
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,280
All right.

310
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll go get more things to show him.

311
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,720
Maybe he remembers more.

312
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay? I'll be right back.

313
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,240
I'll be right back.

314
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,040
Sangmin...

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,280
Say that again.

316
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,280
Dog.

317
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,160
Sangmin.

318
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,480
Remember this?

319
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,040
What about this?

320
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
See?

321
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,240
Okay!

322
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,560
You surely remember this.

323
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
Ta-da!

324
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,920
Your stinky little blanket.

325
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,720
It hasn't been washed in ten years.

326
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,680
I think he remembers this.

327
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,560
Ew.

328
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,320
Ew!

329
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,880
Ew.

330
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Oh?

331
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
At least he knows it stinks.

332
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Sangmin.

333
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,720
You used to like it.

334
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,400
That's your stinkly little blanket.

335
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,680
You don't remember?

336
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,400
Ah!

337
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,920
What about this?

338
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
Do you remember?

339
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,880
Here.

340
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
Smells good.

341
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,520
Sangmin, you don't remember anything?

342
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,480
Let's get some lunch shall we?

343
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
There's one more thing, Mom.

344
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,040
Sangmin surely remembers this.

345
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,800
What is it?

346
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,040
- Ah!
- Ah!

347
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,680
- Oh!
- Whoa!

348
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,080
Oh gosh!

349
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,200
You scared me!

350
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,440
Hey!

351
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,880
Big piece of mackerel

352
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,040
for Sangmin.

353
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,280
Big piece of mackerel

354
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,640
for Dinneaw.

355
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,920
This is...

356
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,520
a big piece of mackerel

357
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
for Big Bro Sangmin.

358
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,720
And this is...

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,160
a big piece of mackerel

360
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,400
for Dinneaw.

361
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,720
Mackerel!

362
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,920
Wow!

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,720
- Try and see if it's good.
- Mackerel!

364
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,680
Yes.

365
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Mackerel.

366
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Mac...

367
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,800
kerel.

368
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,240
Yeah!

369
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,040
Well done.

370
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,280
My boy is the best.

371
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,480
This is called...

372
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,800
fried omelette.

373
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,160
Facked omelette.

374
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,800
Oops!

375
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,680
No.

376
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,880
Fried omelette.

377
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,920
Fried...

378
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,040
omelette.

379
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
Wow!

380
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,160
You're amazing.

381
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760
Here too.

382
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,160
This is called...

383
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,480
boiled...

384
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,320
veggies.

385
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,720
Boiled...

386
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,560
vecchies.

387
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,800
Boiled...

388
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,160
Boiled...

389
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,880
Veggies.

390
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,160
Veggies.

391
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah!

392
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,880
Well done!

393
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,800
Mackerel.

394
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Mom.

395
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,840
Sangmin.

396
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,080
Oh!

397
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,000
Ah...

398
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,560
Mommy Orn.

399
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,760
Sangmin!

400
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,000
Do you remember me now?

401
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,680
Thank you.

402
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,800
Pop.

403
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
Want some meetballs?

404
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,560
It's on the house.

405
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,160
You know all I do...

406
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
is take.

407
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,040
I don't give.

408
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
I'm giving you this...

409
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
because I want to make it up.

410
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,040
You can stop trying.

411
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,680
I'm done chasing after you.

412
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,400
I said...

413
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,960
it was a misunderstanding.

414
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,680
A misunderstanding or not...

415
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,720
doesn't matter now, Tor.

416
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,880
That day you made me realized...

417
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,800
that everything I try,

418
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
is totally useless.

419
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,560
We're just friends with benefit.

420
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,760
And then what?

421
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,000
You've never truly liked me.

422
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm just your plan B.

423
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,920
Right?

424
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,080
So that means...

425
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,000
you're already giving up?

426
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Don't you regret

427
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,920
your effort all these years?

428
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,560
It's because I regret it

429
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,080
that I want to stop.

430
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Oh yeah.

431
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,640
Thank you, Tor,

432
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,920
for making me realize...

433
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,320
that a marathon...

434
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,800
that you don't know where the finish line is...

435
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
is not worth running.

436
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,280
Pop.

437
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,280
Tor.

438
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,960
Pop.

439
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,280
We need your help.

440
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,000
There he is.

441
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,320
The one you want to see the most.

442
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,400
He's here.

443
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
Pop, not now.

444
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,000
Thing is...

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,480
Sangmin is starting to remember my mom,

446
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,080
so I want to find ways to trigger his momeries.

447
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,480
Let's help Sangmin.

448
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Good idea.

449
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
Let's do something fun.

450
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,920
Maybe Sangmin will remember something.

451
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,240
Please, Pop?

452
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,160
Yeah.

453
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,240
Fine.

454
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,160
But for today only.

455
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,080
Sangmin.

456
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,880
This is...

457
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,760
Tiger Power.

458
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,200
Do you remember?

459
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,160
Tiger Power?

460
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,480
Hmm?

461
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,480
This is...

462
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,920
Horse Stomping.

463
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,920
Horse Stomp...

464
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,000
ping?

465
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,440
And this one...

466
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,200
End...

467
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,880
less...

468
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,640
Erec...

469
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,720
tion.

470
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,040
End...

471
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,680
less... Erec...

472
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,640
tion?

473
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
Yes.

474
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,560
Hmm.

475
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,520
Endless Erection?

476
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,480
What is it?

477
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,920
Sangmin.

478
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,720
Oh!

479
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,240
Hmm.

480
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,640
Right?

481
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
Ah!

482
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,720
End...

483
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,800
les... Erec...

484
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,520
tion!

485
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,240
That's right!

486
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Sangmin

487
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,000
remembers the name "Endless Erection".

488
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,400
So...

489
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
do you remember us now?

490
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
Sangmin.

491
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,160
Do you remember...

492
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,000
who we are?

493
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,320
Umm...

494
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,480
He probably recalls some events.

495
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,160
Ah...

496
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,440
Ugh.

497
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,000
No...

498
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,480
What's this?

499
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,400
Oh?

500
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,000
Hey!

501
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,480
You can't drink yet.

502
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,400
It's fine.

503
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,280
Here.

504
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,720
No!

505
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,480
Drink some water.

506
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

507
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,720
Here.

508
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
"Jan!"

509
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,800
- "Jan!"
- "Jan!"

510
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,760
Hmm?

511
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
Is it good?

512
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,920
Eat up.

513
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,040
Good.

514
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Let me take it.

515
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,680
Lie down and rest.

516
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,480
Lie down.

517
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,520
Good night.

518
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Good night.

519
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,240
Sangmin.

520
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,440
Are you asleep?

521
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,480
When...

522
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,760
your lover...

523
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,920
don't remember you,

524
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
it hurts.

525
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,200
We were...

526
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,800
just in love,

527
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,520
but it's like I have to start all over.

528
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,920
It's hard, right?

529
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,000
Sangmin.

530
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,040
It's okay.

531
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,480
I...

532
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,800
won't put pressure on you.

533
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,320
You...

534
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,720
could get a headache again.

535
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,760
I don't want to become...

536
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,480
your new memory...

537
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,160
that turns out to be bad.

538
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,280
You've been single for a while.

539
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,800
Try opening up to someone.

540
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,560
You won't be lonely.

541
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm open.

542
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
I just don't know...

543
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,640
when I'll find someone who's ready to love me.

544
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,680
Right here,

545
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,000
there's one.

546
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,440
The bar is closed.

547
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,520
This shot?

548
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,720
I got this.

549
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,200
Horse Stomping.

550
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,480
One shot.

551
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm not serving.

552
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,160
The bar's closed.

553
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,680
Take your money back.

554
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,480
Look.

555
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,480
How long will you stay mad?

556
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,200
I told you...

557
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,880
Dinneaw and I are just friends now.

558
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
So what?

559
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,000
Does that mean...

560
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,400
you can be more than my friends?

561
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,200
Well...

562
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,080
Why won't you give me some time?

563
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,240
Time?

564
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,280
How long?

565
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,080
How many years?

566
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,920
I almost got crow's feet waiting for you.

567
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
I'm getting old.

568
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,200
I don't want to stay in this relationship.

569
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
I want a life partner.

570
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,960
You're not old.

571
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,640
Do you have a senior citizen card?

572
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
If you don't,

573
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,160
don't say you're old.

574
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,040
Tor.

575
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,800
This argument...

576
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
will never end.

577
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,200
If you don't have feelings for me,

578
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,800
just let me go.

579
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,720
Let me finally move on.

580
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,800
I...

581
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,320
won't.

582
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
What rights do you have?

583
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,960
We're not a couple.

584
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,080
Then why don't we be one?

585
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,720
Don't play with my feelings.

586
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,880
I'm not playing.

587
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,680
I'm serious.

588
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,760
Are you just drunk?

589
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,880
I've had one shot.

590
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,320
How could I be drunk?

591
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
I don't want you to stay mad,

592
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,720
and...

593
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,320
I don't want to lose you.

594
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,720
But this time,

595
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,280
we won't be friends with benefit anymore.

596
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,640
We won't be.

597
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
So what are we?

598
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,199
Let's be a couple.

599
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,080
Be a couple?

600
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,400
Yeah.

601
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,040
Be my boyfriend.

602
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,080
Will you forgive me now?

603
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,840
No.

604
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,840
It's too soon.

605
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,480
I can't handle it.

606
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,760
As my boyfriend,

607
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,159
do you know...

608
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,480
what you get for playing hard to get?

609
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,760
Hmm...

610
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,480
What do I get?

611
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,440
Sangmin?

612
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,280
Sangmin?

613
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,680
Sangmin!

614
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,840
Sangmin.

615
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
Dinneaw.

616
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,560
Do you remember me now?

617
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,440
You remember me, right?

618
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,440
You don't?

619
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,520
Sangmin.

620
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,120
I'm sorry.

621
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,640
But...

622
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,000
If I do this,

623
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,000
you might remember.

624
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,360
Let my son go!

625
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,640
How dare you do that to my son?

626
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,480
You shameless man!

627
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,520
What's going on?

628
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
What's happening?

629
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,160
Mom.

630
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,680
Who's this person, Mom?

631
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,560
She's Sangmin's mom.

632
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
Why are you staying with these people?

633
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,760
Let's go back to Korea.

634
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,280
Hey.

635
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,880
Where are you taking Sangmin?

636
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,320
You're not a good person.

637
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,200
Leave Sangmin alone.

638
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
You cruel woman.

639
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,920
Dinneaw.

640
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,520
What?

641
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,480
Cruel woman?

642
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Hey!

643
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,000
What about what you're doing?

644
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,360
Is it so decent?

645
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,160
You gender-bender.

646
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,480
That's lowly.

647
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,160
As lowly as a prostitute.

648
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,440
Hana.

649
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,560
What did she say?

650
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,320
She...

651
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,120
said...

652
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,920
what Dinneaw was doing...

653
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,000
wasn't...

654
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,600
something decent.

655
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,080
What else did she say, Hana?

656
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,040
She...

657
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,400
said...

658
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,400
"gender bender"

659
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,080
and "as lowly as a prostitute".

660
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,080
Ouch!

661
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,000
That's for slapping my son.

662
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,080
And this...

663
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,120
is for what you did to Sangmin!

664
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,480
You're the bad people!

665
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,200
What?

666
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,280
Bad people?

667
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,160
You!

668
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,640
You are bad people!

669
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,320
Sangmin!

670
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,400
Sangmin's head is hurting.

671
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,200
Sangmin?

672
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,880
We need to do something.

673
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,520
Mom!

674
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,960
Mom!

675
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,480
Sangmin's head is hurting.

676
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,600
Sangmin.

677
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,520
Sangmin, are you hurt?

678
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,640
- Sangmin, sweetie?
- Sangmin.

679
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,880
Hana!

680
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
Go get Sangmin's bags.

681
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,000
We're going back to Korea right now!

682
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,280
Okay.

683
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,320
Hana, where are you going?

684
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,000
Sangmin's mom...

685
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,880
told me...

686
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,560
to pack his bags.

687
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,680
She's taking Sangmin back to Korea now.

688
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,480
I won't let him go.

689
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,640
Sangmin has to stay with me.

690
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,680
Mom.

691
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,160
What?

692
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,680
Help me stop her.

693
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,640
Don't let Sangmin go.

694
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,960
Hana.

695
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,320
Tell her.

696
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I won't let...

697
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
Sangmin go with a cruel person.

698
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,280
Hana.

699
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,600
What are they saying?

700
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
They...

701
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,440
won't let Sangmin...

702
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,480
go back to Korea.

703
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh yeah?

704
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,480
I'm Sangmin's mother.

705
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,680
I can do anything I want with him.

706
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,160
What?

707
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,560
What?

708
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,800
Sangmin!

709
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,280
No!

710
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,080
Sangmin!

711
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,920
- No!
- Help...

712
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,000
Stop!

713
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,680
- Sangmin!
- Calm down!

714
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,640
Let go!

715
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,080
I said let him go!

716
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,960
- Ah!
- Dinneaw!

717
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,360
- Dinneaw!
- Sangmin, come!

718
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:46,960
Dinneaw!

719
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
- Dinneaw!
- Dinneaw?

720
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,640
Dinneaw!

721
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,880
Dinneaw, stop!

722
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,560
Let Sangmin go!

723
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,480
For his own sake.

724
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,360
Yeah.

725
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,280
Please.

726
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
How is...

727
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,280
Dinneaw...

728
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,160
(This song is for you and me,)

729
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,960
(as we share all our stories.)

730
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,480
(It's about our love,)

731
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,480
(our bond between you and me.)

732
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,480
(I remember every feeling,)

733
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,520
(good things I have with you.)

734
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,000
(I still remember...)

735
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
(everything about you.)

736
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,800
- (I always remember.)
- Sangmin.

737
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,240
Don't forget me.

738
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,680
(In my memories...)

739
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,120
(you are there with me.)

740
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,880
(Please don't let them be just dreams,)

741
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,920
(cause I love you with all my heart.)

742
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,680
(No matter what happens,)

743
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,080
(I want you to know this.)

744
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,960
(I'm always right here with you.)

745
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,760
(I want you to know that I love you.)

746
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,360
(Oh, oh...)

747
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,080
Sangmin...

748
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
won't forget...

749
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,920
Dinneaw.

750
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,360
Of course not.

751
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,880
(In my memories...)

752
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,160
(you are there with me.)

753
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,000
(Please don't let them be just dreams,)

754
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,120
(cause I love you with all my heart.)

755
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,840
(No matter what happens,)

756
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,320
(I want you to know this.)

757
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,960
(I'm always...)

758
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,000
(right here with you.)

759
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,160
(I want you to remember...)

760
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,200
(that I love you.)

761
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,040
(I love you.)

762
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,600
(In my memories...)

763
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,520
(you are there with me.)

764
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,200
(Please don't let them...)

765
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,880
(be just dreams,)

766
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,960
(cause I've fallen for you.)

767
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,560
What about Sangmin?

768
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,280
Isn't he here?

769
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,200
Oh?

770
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,360
Hana didn't tell you?

771
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,880
Sangmin promised to come back.

772
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,360
He will be back.

773
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Mom!

774
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,320
Dinneaw!

775
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,400
Our family is in trouble.

776
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,600
