1
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,600
This is...

2
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,720
my friend's resort.

3
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,840
Hana!

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,440
Are you cheating on me?

5
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,640
My friend. Not boyfriend.

6
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,720
Dinneaw.

7
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,240
Dinneaw.

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,080
Listen to me.

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
Listen to me.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,840
Do you need me to come?

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,560
If you ask...

12
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,120
Maybe,

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,400
it was a misunderstanding.

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,560
What are you doing?

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,560
A thief just broke in.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,120
Dinneaw is stalling him. We need to help!

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,560
Dinneaw!

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,320
- Dinneaw!   - Hey!

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,039
- Hey!   - Stop!

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,840
Sangmin.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,920
Hey!

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,479
Oh!

24
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,039
Hey!

25
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,840
Be careful.

26
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,280
Dinneaw.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Dinneaw, are you okay?

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,320
This way.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,479
Family, please wait outside.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,680
How did you let this happen?

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,200
Dad?

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,919
Do you know that the spot in which he was hit...

33
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,480
is a very sensitive spot.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
I told you to convince your friend,

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
tell him to get surgery.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,160
And yet you got your friend injured.

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,520
What would we do if anything happens to him?

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
I told him, but he keeps refusing.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Does he need to wait until it's serious?

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,120
He's lucky our specialist hasn't taken his flight yet.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,840
Otherwise, Sangmin could die.

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,880
Then can you operate on him now?

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
The surgeons are all here anyway.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,720
This is your chance.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,560
He needs to sign a consent.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
He definitely won't sign it.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,520
Hey, wait.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,840
At first, he agreed to get surgery.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,840
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,400
Huh?

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,440
Hana.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,960
It's come this far.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Just tell eveyone what's wrong with Sangmin.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
They can help convince Sangmin.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,680
Yes.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
As a kid,

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,520
Sangmin had a very hard life.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,280
Sangmin's mother left his father...

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
for another man who's a bad guy.

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,400
He abused Sangmin,

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
but his mom didn't care.

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,800
She let that man hit Sangmin until he grew up.

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,840
The worst...

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000
is when he was hit in the head.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,120
So that's why...

66
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
Sangmin is covered in scars.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,280
So the hit he took in the head...

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,600
caused his headache, right?

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,680
Sangmin's been having headache ever since.

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,800
He's also depressed.

71
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,120
His headache got worse over time.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,160
The only way to completely get rid of it...

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
is surgery.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
Is it necessary, Dad?

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Yeah.

76
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,120
It's a surgery using high power microscope.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
We have special techniques.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,120
It's a  computer guided surgery.

79
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,440
Your wound will be smaller than regular operations.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
You won't need to shave your head.

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
It doesn't take long to recover.

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,680
But...

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
You have to accept one thing.

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,520
There could be a post-op side effect in your case.

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
What is it?

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,520
In your case,

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,399
you could lose your memory.

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,159
This medicine, did you prescribe him?

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Yes.

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,840
It's invented by a reserch institute.

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Back then,

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,840
Sangmin's life was terrible.

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,600
Sangmin lost his purpose to live,

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,600
so he volunteered to test this medicine.

95
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,000
So that's why...

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,159
he said we might never meet again.

97
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:59,120
Sangmin actually said yes to this surgery.

98
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
But later he said,

99
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
he wanted to make memories in Ayuddhaya...

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
before he forgets everything.

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,480
He probably...

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,480
meant Mrs. Orn.

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
But he changed his mind...

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,040
probably because of...

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
Dinneaw.

106
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,400
Please tell Sangmin to get this surgery.

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm counting on you.

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Sangmin...

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,680
won't get surgery.

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,159
Sangmin, don't be stubborn.

111
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Hi.

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Hi.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Hi.

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,480
Mr. Sangmin.

115
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Professor Thaniya told us...

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,360
to deliver a document to you.

117
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
If you're okay with these terms,

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,720
please sign right here.

119
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
No surgery.

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,040
Sangmin.

121
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Do you want to keep having headaches?

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,920
If something happens to you,

123
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
how do you think we'd feel?

124
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
No.

125
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Sangmin.

126
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
In a few days,

127
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
our specialist...

128
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
is going abroad for months.

129
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
If you don't get the surgery now,

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,159
you would lose this opportunity.

131
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,720
We don't want to see you keep having headaches.

132
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,920
He's right.

133
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,800
Seeing you in this condition...

134
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,480
stresses us out too.

135
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
If...

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Sangmin...

137
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,280
wakes up,

138
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
and forgets...

139
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,240
everyone,

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
Is it possible that...

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,040
he won't forget us?

142
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,600
There's a risk to this surgery.

143
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
Mr. Sangmin could regain his memory,

144
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
if he finds the right trigger.

145
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,600
But...

146
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
we can't guarantee...

147
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,280
what he would remember.

148
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
Sangmin...

149
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,920
don't want to forget...

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Dinneaw.

151
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't want to forget...

152
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
Hana.

153
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,920
Don't want to forget...

154
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,040
Tor,

155
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,280
Arthit.

156
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
I don't want to forget...

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,920
Mommy Orn.

158
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,919
Sangmin.

159
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,200
Worry about yourself first.

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
Whether you remember or not,

161
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
whether it's good memory or bad,

162
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,520
whether you want to forget or not,

163
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,000
that doesn't matter as much as staying alive tomorrow.

164
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey!

165
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Finally.

166
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
Mr. Sangmin is so stubborn.

167
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,480
He looked like he would sign, but he didn't.

168
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,840
Complaining doesn't help.

169
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,440
It's our job to convince him.

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
I tried.

171
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
He just kept saying no.

172
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,840
I said no veggies,

173
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,360
yet they keep putting them in.

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
You're an intern doctor.

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,480
You tell patients to eat fruits and veggies.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
But you don't eat them?

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,840
I was just doing my job.

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,120
They put in a lot of veggies.

179
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Yeah.

180
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
I'll take it out for you.

181
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
Where's my fried egg?

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Oh?

183
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,520
I ordered one for you, really.

184
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,480
I think they forgot.

185
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,360
Darn it.

186
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I really ordered it.

187
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,240
I didn't forget.

188
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,080
I can eat it. It's fine.

189
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Let me take this call.

190
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,000
Hello.

191
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes.

192
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,840
Okay. I'll be on my way.

193
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,520
You won't eat that?

194
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,360
You can have it.

195
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,360
Okay.

196
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,640
Have you slept at all?

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
You've been wearing this since yesterday.

198
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
Get some rest.

199
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,840
You're gonna get sick too.

200
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,960
Dinneaw.

201
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,120
You look like a zombie.

202
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,520
Take a shower or something.

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,720
I don't want to leave Sangmin's side.

204
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,960
He's being stubborn.

205
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
You're as stubborn as he is.

206
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,120
It's because I care.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,600
See?

208
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,120
Then...

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
we'll go get your clothes.

210
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
By the way,

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
have your mom heard about this?

212
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,360
Oh!

213
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,640
Dinneaw?

214
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,360
Dinneaw!

215
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
Mom.

216
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,880
What?

218
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
What's wrong?

219
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
How is Sangmin doing?

220
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,640
Sangmin is really sick.

221
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,000
But...

222
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,320
he never even thought about telling us, Mom.

223
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,840
Sangmin...

224
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,120
could...

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
lose his memory.

226
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
What?

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,600
Sangmin.

228
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,960
How are you?

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Mom.

230
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,440
It's me.

231
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,840
How are you? Is the headache so bad?

232
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, be careful.

233
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know you have a headache this bad.

234
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
I want...

235
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,320
you to be happy.

236
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't want...

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
to worry you.

238
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
Okay.

239
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,360
Time for a towel bath.

240
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll do it for him.

241
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,200
Okay.

242
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
I'll give you a towel bath.

243
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,600
Does it hurt bad?

244
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
It must have hurt so bad.

245
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,600
It doesn't hurt now.

246
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,720
Physical wounds left so many scars.

247
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,840
Your mental scars must have been worse.

248
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,880
Is this the reason you've been gone for over ten years?

249
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
You've been through a lot.

250
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Why didn't you just run to Thailand?

251
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,240
Sangmin can endure.

252
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,520
Don't endure it anymore, sweetie.

253
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Why didn't you tell me you were in so much trouble?

254
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Stay with me.

255
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,240
I'll take care of you.

256
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,880
It's okay, sweetie.

257
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Stay with me.

258
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,120
Here.

259
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
This is what you asked for.

260
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
And these are your clothes.

261
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,520
Thanks a lot.

262
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
Hey!

263
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Are you okay?

264
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,840
Easy.

265
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,840
Give me the bag.

266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,720
Let go.

267
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,720
You haven't eaten at all, right?

268
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,600
I know you care about Sangmin.

269
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,640
If you want to be there for him,

270
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
you have to take care of yourself.

271
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,880
Wait here.

272
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,640
Tor and I will get you some food.

273
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,640
Thanks.

274
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,720
Just stay here, okay?

275
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Don't go anywhere.

276
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,160
You're harsher than my mom.

277
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,040
- We won't take long. We'll be back.   - Be right back.

278
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,760
Don't go anywhere.

279
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,480
Sit here and wait.

280
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,280
Come in.

281
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,640
Excuse us.

282
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,960
Sangmin.

283
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,720
Would you take a bet?

284
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
A bet?

285
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,240
Yeah.

286
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
I'll bet that after surgery,

287
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
you won't forget me,

288
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
you won't forget Dinneaw,

289
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
and won't forget your friends.

290
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,240
Why not?

291
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,520
Because we're something you want to remember.

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,560
Believe me.

293
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,800
Bad things will be the only thing you forget.

294
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,280
Thank you.

295
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,200
Well done, sweetie.

296
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,720
You've made the right decision.

297
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,720
You will be fine.

298
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Okay?

299
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes.

300
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
Hmm...

301
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,720
He's knocked out.

302
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
He's probably tired and hungry.

303
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,160
Let him sleep for now.

304
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,960
He can eat when he wakes up.

305
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
You seem to care about him so much.

306
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,560
You can't get over him?

307
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,240
Can't I care about him as a friend?

308
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,240
You can.

309
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
You can.

310
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,720
Of course.

311
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm trying to get over him.

312
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,480
And...

313
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,760
I know I can never be more than a friend.

314
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,280
Why would you let me know?

315
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
I want you to wait.

316
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm almost opening up.

317
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
What?

318
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,960
Hmm?

319
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Nothing.

320
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,400
Let's go.

321
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Thank you guys so much...

322
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,000
for doing all these things for me.

323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,480
How many times are you gonna thank us?

324
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,240
Hey.

325
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,680
Can you buy us drinks instead?

326
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Guys!

327
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm here.

328
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,800
Has Sangmin signed the consent?

329
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,680
Hey...

330
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,000
Kids, be quiet!

331
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
Hana, this is my mom.

332
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
Good morning.

333
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,640
I'm Hana, Sangmin's friend.

334
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,480
Good morning.

335
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,240
Just call me Mrs. Orn.

336
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,800
Yes, Mrs. Orn.

337
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,000
Is Sangmin sleeping?

338
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,320
No.

339
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,040
That's good.

340
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,720
We're going in to convince him to sign.

341
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,760
Mrs. Orn.

342
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,880
Please help convince him.

343
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah.

344
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,640
That face...

345
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,080
I did it.

346
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,200
Sangmin already signed the consent.

347
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,240
- Yay!   - Guys, stop!

348
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400
This is a hospital.

349
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Be quiet!

350
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,080
Sorry.

351
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Why are you crying?

352
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm happy.

353
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,760
I was worried.

354
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,000
I was afraid something would happen to him.

355
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,960
Come on.

356
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,760
You can relax now.

357
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,720
Don't cry.

358
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,680
And don't feel guilty

359
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
for making Sangmin change his mind.

360
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,560
I told you. You can't stop one's feelings.

361
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
So big...

362
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Towel.

363
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,000
Towel!

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,880
Towel?

365
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,000
What have you found out?

366
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,440
Well...

367
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,920
If you mean buying Dinneaw's homestay,

368
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,000
you have to wait a bit longer.

369
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,240
Nobody is there right now.

370
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
Why not?

371
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,720
Umm...

372
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,000
It's Sangmin.

373
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,160
He's not feeling so good right now.

374
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,920
He's seriously ill in hospital.

375
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,760
I heard he might not make it.

376
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,680
That's worrying.

377
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,320
I think I need to visit him.

378
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,920
Well,

379
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,480
Mr. Sainam.

380
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,800
I did a lot for you.

381
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't you care about me?

382
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,720
You're getting delusional.

383
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,800
Is he worried about Sangmin or was that acting?

384
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,160
Anyway,

385
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,640
it's huge.

386
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,880
I wanna be the chairman's wife!

387
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,320
Thank you...

388
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,480
for getting the surgery.

389
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,040
If I don't sign,

390
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,040
Mom's gonna hit me.

391
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Sangmin, you're making Hana think I'm a cruel mom.

392
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,680
You're not.

393
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
Sangmin always said good things about you.

394
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,160
He said you're beautiful, kind, and good at cooking.

395
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,240
I think I have to try your cooking sometimes.

396
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,040
You're welcome.

397
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,920
Her cooking is really good.

398
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,880
- I can confirm.  - Hey, hey.

399
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
Okay. You guys will get to feast.

400
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,520
I got this.

401
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,640
Okay.

402
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,800
Today,

403
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,960
you have to eat the hospital's porridge.

404
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh.

405
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Is it too hot?

406
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,400
It's not.

407
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,240
Good.

408
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,760
Eat a lot then.

409
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,880
Dinneaw.

410
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,760
I'm hungry.

411
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,800
Let's get something to eat.

412
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,200
Umm...

413
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,760
You can go ahead.

414
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,720
Tor and Pop just got me some food.

415
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,680
Really?

416
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,240
We'll be eating with you.

417
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,720
Okay.

418
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,440
I saw a lot of places I wanna try.

419
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,000
Really?

420
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,760
Let's go, then.

421
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,080
- Let's go.  - Hana, come with us.

422
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,040
Come on.

423
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,920
Okay...

424
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,560
Come on.

425
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,480
Let's go, Mrs. Orn.

426
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,960
Is it good?

427
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,000
Feed hm well, okay?

428
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,640
Eat a lot.

429
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,000
Tor.

430
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,000
Umm...

431
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,560
Look...

432
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,240
What's wrong, Mrs. Orn?

433
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,560
I need to ask you something.

434
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,480
Tell me the truth.

435
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,320
Umm...

436
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
What is it?

437
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,440
Sangmin and Dinneaw...

438
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,720
What about them?

439
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,680
Do you think Sangmin...

440
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,720
Well...

441
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,400
Does Dinneaw seems overly worried about Sangmin?

442
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Well...

443
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,400
I don't think so. I'm worried about him too.

444
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Dinneaw's just...

445
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,720
a closer friend of Sangmin than us.

446
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,280
It's not like that.

447
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Do you see what I see?

448
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,720
They hold hands. He feeds him.

449
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
Pop and I...

450
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,760
do that too.

451
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Okay.

452
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,800
I'll be direct then.

453
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,720
Are Sangmin and Dinneaw dating?

454
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,920
I knew it.

455
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,040
I noticed something strange when they were drunk that time.

456
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,240
They got drunk and slept together.

457
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,520
I didn't think it would come this far.

458
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
So...

459
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,280
are you okay with that?

460
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Aren't you asleep?

461
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,400
I was.

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,400
But I woke up when you covered me.

463
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,400
Sorry. I shouldn't have bothered you.

464
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,720
You didn't.

465
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,000
You were taking care of me.

466
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
But...

467
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,080
I woke you up.

468
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,680
I should go.

469
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,320
You took veggies from my dish.

470
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
You gave me your egg.

471
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,800
I was feeling cold

472
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,480
and you covered me.

473
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
What are you thinking of me?

474
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,040
Where's Hana?

475
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,520
She went home.

476
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
She said she's worried about Guy and Riktor.

477
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,000
So...

478
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,440
How long was Sangmin asleep?

479
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,240
Not long.

480
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,960
Are you going home now, Mom?

481
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,520
I'll take you home.

482
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,720
It's okay.

483
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,560
I'll go home with Tor and Arthit.

484
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,320
I need to use the bathroom. We're gonna be in traffic for a while.

485
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,080
Be right back, kids.

486
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,720
Dinneaw.

487
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,200
Back there,

488
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,040
your mom asked about...

489
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,720
your and Sangmin's...

490
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,680
relationship.

491
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,040
Did she know?

492
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,480
You were feeding him and taking care of him.

493
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,920
Brothers don't do that.

494
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Is she okay with that?

495
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,880
I don't know.

496
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,200
She went quiet when I asked that.

497
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,160
She's probably still shocked.

498
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
It's nothing.

499
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,800
I don't think my mom's okay...

500
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,680
with me and Sangmin being in love.

501
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,520
What would I do if she doesn't approve?

502
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,400
Don't think about that yet.

503
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,000
So...

504
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,880
What exactly is going on between you two?

505
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Dinneaw.

506
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,520
I want to talk to you.

507
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,800
I like Sangmin, Mom.

508
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,880
Are you sure?

509
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,880
You and Sangmin...

510
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,240
could mistake your feelings because you got too close.

511
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
I don't know.

512
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,400
All I know is...

513
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm used to the life with Sangmin.

514
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
He annoys me.

515
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,560
He irritates me.

516
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,640
He makes me worried.

517
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,720
And I get jealous of him.

518
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,320
So I think...

519
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
if...

520
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,880
one day,

521
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,800
I lose Sangmin,

522
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,240
I'd be devastated.

523
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,520
I...

524
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,920
can't imagine life...

525
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
without Sangmin at all.

526
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,000
I want to be with Sangmin every day.

527
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,840
Dinneaw, do you call this feeling...

528
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,080
love?

529
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,800
I believe that...

530
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,120
you felt this way with Dad.

531
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,480
Hi!

532
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,600
Oh!

533
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,920
Hey!

534
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,000
Still beautiful.

535
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,320
Pony!

536
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,360
Give us a hug!

537
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,840
- Miss you!   - We miss you so much!

538
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,920
You're hugging me so tight my silicone is about to pop off. Let go!

539
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,600
- Oh no...   - Whoa!

540
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,000
You all came rushing in

541
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
because you missed me, right?

542
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,920
It's too bad for you. It's hard to forget a beautiful woman.

543
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes, Sis!

544
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,480
You miss Pony, but what about me, Dinneaw?

545
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,800
- Good morning.   - Good morning.

546
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
Pony, let me take that.

547
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,040
Are you here to visit Sangmin?

548
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,960
Would you like to talk to him?

549
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,320
He just woke up.

550
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
Oppa, how are you?

551
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm okay.

552
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,000
Thank you for visiting me.

553
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Thank you.

554
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,440
I wish you a safe recovery from surgery.

555
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,160
After you completed the training,

556
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,640
you just disappeared.

557
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,280
I miss the joy you brought, Dinneaw.

558
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,000
Do you miss me too, Mr. Sainam?

559
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,360
I do.

560
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Have you been well, Mr. Sainam?

561
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,320
Thank you so much for visiting Sangmin.

562
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,680
You don't have to worry though.

563
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,640
Dinneaw is taking really good care of Sangmin.

564
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Is that right?

565
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,920
Mom.

566
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,680
Stop "Momming" me.

567
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,920
Just tell him...

568
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,000
you two are in love.

569
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes.

570
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,120
That's right.

571
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,880
Thank you.

572
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,480
You're welcome.

573
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,200
Rik, no!

574
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,640
Please, Guy!

575
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,920
- No! Come on out!   - Please...

576
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,800
- No! I'm not doing it!   - Please...

577
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,600
What's wrong?

578
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,680
What's wrong, Rik? What are you doing?

579
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,040
Hey!

580
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,360
Hey! Stop!

581
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,880
No! Don't!

582
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,280
Rik!

583
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,880
You want it so bad, right?

584
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,920
You want it so bad, right?

585
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,120
Hey! Stop!

586
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,720
Let's do it.

587
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,880
I said you need abstinence.

588
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,040
I have a pimple.

589
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,520
You want me in hospital?

590
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,440
I bet it's healed by now.

591
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,200
Eww.

592
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,000
No.

593
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,600
You don't care if I'm hurting or not.

594
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,560
You!

595
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,360
What are you doing in a guest's room?

596
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,040
I told you to clean the rooms,

597
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,680
not to screw!

598
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,000
I told him. He wouldn't listen.

599
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,440
Your penis is for pissing!

600
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,680
That's harsh.

601
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,480
Love is not just about sex.

602
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,920
You guys can do something else.

603
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,840
That's right!

604
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,920
Like every couple does.

605
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,240
How is hooking up not normal, Noona?

606
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,720
Ouch!

607
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,120
That hurts, Noona.

608
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,400
If it hurts, then think.

609
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,760
Sex is important in love life,

610
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,280
but it's not the only thing in love.

611
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,080
You can have something else in your relationship.

612
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,440
Build your future together.

613
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,920
Do something sweet for each other.

614
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,600
Learn what your partner needs.

615
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
These temporary pleasures...

616
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
don't make your relationship last long.

617
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,560
Guy never said he needed anything.

618
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,560
I told you many times

619
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,600
that I want a normal relationship.

620
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,720
You're the one who never listens.

621
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,240
See?

622
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
You only listen to yourself,

623
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,320
and don't hear what the other thinks...

624
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,920
when he keeps repeating himself!

625
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,400
You're lucky Guy is patient with you.

626
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,440
If I were him, I would have dumped you long ago.

627
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,760
You won't dump someone easily, Noona.

628
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,720
How'd you know?

629
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,800
I'm beautiful. I can choose.

630
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
I don't see any choice you have.

631
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,600
Whoa, Rik!

632
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,040
Was that flick earlier too soft?

633
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,720
Do you want me to kick you?

634
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,120
I'll be away for a few days.

635
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,360
I'll be with Sangmin when he recovers.

636
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,200
I'll leave this place with you.

637
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,480
Please do your job

638
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,560
and don't do anything else!

639
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,000
Understand?

640
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,480
Yes, Ma'am!

641
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Go get dressed.

642
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,920
Oh my...

643
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,360
At least they're not single.

644
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
This is driving me nuts. What's wrong with them?

645
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,360
Finally, I get to take a shower.

646
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,600
I feel so fresh.

647
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,240
Are you tired?

648
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,000
Not at all.

649
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
I'm sorry.

650
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,680
Why would you be?

651
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,960
Don't be sorry.

652
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,920
Dinneaw didn't sleep...

653
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,520
because of Sangmin.

654
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,520
I'm sorry.

655
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,600
You're apologizing again.

656
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Remember this. I'm willing to do it for you.

657
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,760
I have something for you.

658
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,360
One for you,

659
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,880
and one for me.

660
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
"Sangmin."

661
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
"Dinneaw."

662
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,600
That's right.

663
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
It's cute.

664
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,240
You're getting surgery tomorrow.

665
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
Are you afraid?

666
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,920
I'm not.

667
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,120
Tonight, can I cuddle...

668
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,880
with you?

669
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,880
When you wake up from surgery, you'll see me beside you just like this.

670
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,920
Stay with me.

671
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,200
What are you smiling about?

672
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,400
I'm happy.

673
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,400
Sangmin won't forget...

674
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
Dinneaw.

675
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,840
Of course not.

676
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,800
Dinneaw.

677
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Please be my boyfriend.

678
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,000
What does that mean?

679
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,400
Be...

680
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,600
my...

681
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,880
boyfriend.

682
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Okay.

683
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,280
Oh?

684
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,000
Mr. Sainam, hi.

685
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,720
- You came early.   - Good morning.

686
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,840
Good morning.

687
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,520
I would like to talk to you about buying your homestay.

688
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,360
Oh.

689
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,040
I don't think this is a good time for that.

690
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Let's wait until Sangmin is done with surgery...

691
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
and recovery, shall we?

692
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,680
But from what I've heard,

693
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,520
your homestay is suffering a loss.

694
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,280
Mrs. Orn!

695
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,920
Mrs. Orn.

696
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,360
Yeah?

697
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,880
Sangmin is going into Operation Room.

698
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,760
Really?

699
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,440
- Let's go. Dinneaw's waiting for us.   - Yeah? Okay.

700
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,000
- Let's go.   - Mr. Sainam, you can come with us.

701
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,760
Come on. Lead the way.

702
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You can just not wake up, Sangmin.

703
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,880
Sangmin.

704
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,600
Be safe. Good luck, sweetie.

705
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,400
His pulse is stopping.

706
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,200
Stop his IV.

707
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,320
Defibrillator.

708
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,600
Two hundred.

709
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,240
Make it three hundred.

710
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Sangmin?

711
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,720
Don't you remember Mommy Orn?

712
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
Mom.

713
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:39,920
Just now,

714
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,680
what did you say?

715
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,720
When your lover don't remember you,

716
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,400
it hurts.

717
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,120
If you don't have feelings for me,

718
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,680
just let me go.

719
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,080
Let me finally move on.

720
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,520
If I do this,

721
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,760
Sangmin might remember.

722
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,600
Let go of my son!

723
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,920
Hey!
