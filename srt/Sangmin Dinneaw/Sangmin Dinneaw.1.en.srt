1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,280
(The day you get too tired to go on.)

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
(The day the world is against you.)

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,360
(Your dream is still far away.)

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,920
(Leave it be. Rest your heart with me for a day.)

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,360
(I'll leave my love for you here to heal.)

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,320
(Forget the trouble that's weighing on you.)

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
(Right here, you have me no matter where you are.)

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
(My care for you will always be here.)

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
(Even if you have no one, you will always have me...)

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
(right here, by your side.)

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,560
(I'll be the home of your heart.)

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,760
Good morning, Father.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
What about your son?

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,120
He'll be here soon, Father.

15
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,680
Is the rice stuck on your scoop?

16
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,280
Yes. It's sticky.

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
When are you coming, brat?

18
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,759
Mrs.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,560
The way you hit your scoop is like calling your dogs to eat.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,200
Yes, Father.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,479
No, I mean...

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
Thanks, Mrs.

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Now we'll pour water to the dead.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
(Buddhist prayers.)

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,000
(Buddhist prayers.)

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,960
Father.

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,680
Please say your prayers loudly.

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,720
Wake him up.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh yeah?

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,600
(Buddhist prayers.)

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,520
(Buddhist prayers.)

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,000
(Buddhist prayers.)

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,960
(Buddhist prayers.)

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
(Buddhist prayers.)

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,240
(Buddhist prayers.)

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,160
(Buddhist prayers.)

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,840
(Buddhist prayers.)

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:07,000
(Buddhist prayers.)

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,160
Sigh.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
You're finally here, Dinneaw.

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,720
A bit longer and I would have died before I get to eat your mother's eggs.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,400
You overslept again!

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,680
You said you didn't need waking up?

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
How many times have I told you...

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,280
- that...
- Dad's birthday falls on a Wednesday.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,160
We give food in memory of him,

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,160
and eat vegetarian food every Wednesday.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
We also pour water to him.

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,880
Of course, I remember, Mom.

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,400
Come on. I'll pour this water on a tree.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,280
It's been a long time.

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,840
I think your...

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
boyfriend... No!

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,680
Your husband is probably reincarnated already.

55
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,000
If he's still up there,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,400
he would have a clogged artery in heaven.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,360
Whoa!

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,280
That's more likely going to happen to me.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,120
I have been eating two eggs in tamarind sauce every day.

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Dinneaw, don't joke about that, son.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,080
Father.

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,840
I promise I'll make new dishes

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,280
that are certainly good for you!

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Is it boiled eggs in sweet soup?

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
That dish is my mom's specialty.

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,839
It's true.

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,720
Eggs again?

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,480
I'll be on my way then. May Buddha bless you.

69
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,360
Oh!

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,920
Sadhu, sadhu.

71
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,840
Put it here.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,240
This Korean boy again?

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,159
You have a son right here,

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
and you keep thinking of someone else's son.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,480
Sungmin came as an exchange student.

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
He lived here as a kid.

77
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,920
You were probably too little.

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,920
He liked to sit by the river, being homesick.

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
I felt so sorry for him.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
Since he went back to Korea,

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,240
he never contacted me again.

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,280
You've told me that story a hundred times.

83
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,480
The drawing looks lonely again.

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,600
This looks lonely?

85
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,240
So...

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,280
Should I draw myself by his side?

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,920
Stop it, Mom.

88
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,240
If you don't make your customer's vests, we'll be out of money.

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,920
Don't worry about that.

90
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,400
These are...

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,920
my new products.

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,920
Ban Dinneaw Soap.

93
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,560
I came up with the formula myself.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,920
Try smelling. It's so nice!

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
- It's really nice.   - Right?

96
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
I promise this will sell well!

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,560
Okay. I'll be with at the reception.

98
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
Okay, sweetie.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,560
This one smells nice too. It's carrot.

100
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm checking out.

101
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
These are your keys.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,240
Do you know the temple with an elephant sanctuary?

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
What's it called?

104
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,000
There's an elephant sanctuary by Wat Maheyong.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,360
There's also a sacred old Buddha.

106
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,240
If you get there before noon,

107
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,280
you will see the first elephant performance at 11.

108
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,800
If you don't have a car,

109
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,560
walk further out. There's a taxi bike stand.

110
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,920
I see.

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,800
Thank you.

112
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,800
You're good at recommending.

113
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,240
You're like a tour guide.

114
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,040
That's my dream job, sir.

115
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,040
I'll be on my way.

116
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
Have a nice day, sir.

117
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
- Okay. Thank you. I gotta go.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Bye bye. Goodbye.

119
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,560
Welcome to Dinneaw Homestay, located...

120
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,800
on the riverside of Ayuddhaya.

121
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,120
There are so many tourist attractions around here.

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,720
If you want to book a very handsome tour guide,

123
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,799
it's me. My name is Dinneaw!

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Good morning.

125
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Good morning.

126
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,120
Good morning.

127
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,840
Good morning.

128
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm trying to sleep. Don't bother me.

129
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,840
Good morning?

130
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
Good morning.

131
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
- Good morning, man!
- Good morning, man! Whoa!

132
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,720
Sorry, sir.

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
You're a foreigner?

134
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
Where are you from?

135
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,360
Korea.

136
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,080
Nice. I learned some Korean.

137
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,600
"Anyeonghaseyo Kamsahamnida"

138
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
Good morning.

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
Do you have room?

140
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,520
You can speak Thai?

141
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,000
I speak Thai...

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
a little.

143
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
Did you book a room?

144
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,120
There's no booking today.

145
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,360
Book?

146
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah! "Booking".

147
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,720
"Booking."

148
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,120
Oh! Booking? I...

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
I didn't book.

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,360
A walk-in guest? Where would you stay if we have no room?

151
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
This house.

152
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,000
This house?

153
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,600
A guest is stirring up trouble.

154
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
He's asking to stay at my house?

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
"Stir up trouble"?

156
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,760
Stir...

157
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,840
Oh!

158
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,480
Stir a caramel candy.

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,640
It's a Thai sweet.

160
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Have you ever had it? It's one of Ayuddhaya's delights.

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,120
I know the phrase...

162
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
"stir up trouble".

163
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
This sucker knows.

164
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
Suck?

165
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm a sucker?

166
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Sungmin?

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,720
Mom!

168
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Sungmin!

169
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,640
- Mom!
- What brought you here, Sungmin?

170
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,600
Sungmin, I've missed you so much!

171
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,840
You look so handsome all grown up!

172
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Whoa!

173
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,240
Dinneaw.

174
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
This is Sungmin, the boy I told you about.

175
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,200
The Korean boy I kept talking about. This is him!

176
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
Your other favorite son?

177
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,720
So it's this freak after all.

178
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,600
Hey!

179
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,000
Why are you saying that? Talk to him nicely.

180
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,480
Sungmin, do you remember my little boy?

181
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,840
Dinneaw.

182
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
When he was little,

183
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,120
you helped me babysit him.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
The little baby...

185
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
who pissed on you all the time.

186
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,000
That's why you wouldn't hold him.

187
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,640
- Oh!
- Remember?

188
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,240
Remember?

189
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,240
Dinneaw?

190
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,480
Yes! That's him!

191
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
You're embarrassing me, Mom!

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,640
What's wrong?

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Sungmin, your Thai is still as fluent as ever.

194
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,600
My boy, I've missed you so much!

195
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Where have you been? You didn't keep in touch.

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,520
Look.

197
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Do you still remember the elephant song?

198
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,080
Oh!

199
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,880
Sing with me and dance with me too!

200
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,480
All right?

201
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,600
One, two, three!

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,000
(Elephant! Have you ever seen one?)

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,960
(An elephant is big. It has a long nose called trunk.)

204
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,000
(It has fangs under there called ivory.)

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,240
(It has ears and eyes and a long tail.)

206
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Good job! You're the best!

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,240
You're the best.

208
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,200
I've missed you so much.

209
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,960
You didn't keep in touch.

210
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,440
What brought you here today?

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Surprise!

212
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Surprise!

213
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,520
Surprise?

214
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah. What a surprise.

215
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,240
Mom, you're still petty as ever.

216
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,720
Petty? No, it's pretty.

217
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,640
Right?

218
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
Not petty.

219
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,200
Please stay longer this time.

220
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,880
I'll set up a nice room for you.

221
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
I'll close the homestay.

222
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,960
Nobody can come in, right?

223
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
Stay with me.

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,240
I've missed you so much, Sungmin. Okay?

225
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
Be with me.

226
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
I've missed you too.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Let me stay in this house with you.

228
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Stay.

229
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,200
Okay. You stay,  alright?

230
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,440
Oh!

231
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,320
You're soaking.

232
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,360
You're sweating.

233
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,360
It's the weather here.

234
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,240
Thailand is different from Korea, right?

235
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,240
Ah!

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,880
I happen to be making soap.

237
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm making soap.

238
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
They smell so nice. It's going to make you feel cool and fresh.

239
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,320
Hey.

240
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,120
Take Sungmin to the bathroom upstairs.

241
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Go.

242
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,640
Just go. What are you waiting for? Let's go, Dinneaw.

243
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
You're sleepy, aren't ya?

244
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,080
- Come on. Shower, shower.
- Shower.

245
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,120
Good! Perfect! Come on. Go on, son.

246
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,120
Take a shower.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
I'm so happy!

248
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
What should I do first?

249
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,720
Go straight! It's straigt ahead!

250
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,840
What?

251
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,840
Tip me.

252
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't you know?

253
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,360
I carried your luggage.

254
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
Oh!

255
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Tip. Tip.

256
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
The bathroom is outside.

257
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,000
Enjoy your shower.

258
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,000
Welcome to Ban Dinneaw Homestay.

259
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,120
Yes.

260
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,600
Gecko?

261
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,960
There is a gecko in this house.

262
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,520
It won't hurt anyone.

263
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't tell me you're scared of geckos?

264
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,880
It's okay.

265
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
Sungmin...

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,840
not scared of geckos.

267
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,240
Not scared?

268
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,160
You peek on Sungmin taking shower?

269
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,880
Are you crazy?

270
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm just worried.

271
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,720
I heard the gecko. Maybe it's in there.

272
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,079
No gecko.

273
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Sungmin...

274
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,400
not scared of geckos.

275
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,880
Fine.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,520
Holy gator!

277
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
Gator? Where?

278
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,800
Alligator?

279
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,760
- Sungmin.
- What?

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,480
It's the ge...

281
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,920
- Ge...
- Ge?

282
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,760
Gorgeous are your eyes.

283
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,400
Your eyes.

284
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,640
Oh!

285
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,880
My eyes.

286
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,240
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,760
Nice.

288
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,720
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

289
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,280
Oh crap!

290
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,160
Help me!

291
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,440
Help me!

292
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,400
Gecko!

293
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,240
You said you're not scared?

294
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,000
Gecko!

295
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
Gecko!

296
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Home made stir-fried basil.

297
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,880
I don't know if you still like this.

298
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,720
Is it good?

299
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,440
Hot!

300
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,640
- Oh? It's too hot?
- Hot!

301
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
- Hot, hot!
- It's hot!

302
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,640
Eat some fried egg then.

303
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,200
Eat it. Come on.

304
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,720
Feeling better?

305
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,640
You're weak. You're scared of geckos.

306
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Dinneaw scared too.

307
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
You can't eat hot food.

308
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,480
Thai food is hot but good.

309
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,240
You argue a lot. You can't stay in Thailand at this rate.

310
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,760
Sungmin likes Thailand.

311
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Still wanna argue?

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,440
Eat this. Eat this stir-fried basil.

313
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,000
Sungmin, if it's too hot, eat fried egg instead.

314
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,640
You're spoiling him,

315
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
this Korean boy.

316
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,040
Well, I haven't seen him in decades.

317
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,920
It's normal that I miss him.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,040
We're the host.

319
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,440
When a guest comes, we take care of them.

320
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,640
Also, if I die,

321
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,480
you would be in charge of this homestay.

322
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,000
You have to train your manners as a good host.

323
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,680
Learn to take care of your guests, so that when they leave,

324
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,240
they talk and think about us in a positive way.

325
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,560
Dinneaw.

326
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,200
- Bon appetit.
- Wow!

327
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,880
You should thank him.

328
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
He scooped some food for you. Thank him now.

329
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,000
Thank him.

330
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,320
"Kamsahamnida."

331
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh!

332
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,680
Dinneaw, your Korean is great.

333
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah!

334
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,240
"Kamsahamnida."

335
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
That's cute!

336
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,680
Actually, Dinneaw wants to be a tour guide.

337
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
He's learning quite a few languages.

338
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,640
Oh! Sungmin, if you have time,

339
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,920
please teach him some Korean.

340
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,400
Yes.

341
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,680
You will?

342
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,080
Thank you. I'm so happy.

343
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
I feel like I have two sons. I'm so happy.

344
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's eat.

345
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,920
Get more of this. Come on.

346
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,720
- What's wrong? It's good, right?
- It's good, Mom.

347
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
It's not often that I cook.

348
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,040
I took the gecko out.

349
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,520
Thank you.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm going to bed.

351
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,400
Dinneaw.

352
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,320
Umm...

353
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,440
Why...

354
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
you not tour guide?

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,920
Why am I not a tour guide?

356
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
We all have responsibilities.

357
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,480
How can you just follow your dream?

358
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,640
Responsibilities?

359
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,080
Yeah.

360
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm going to bed. Good night.

361
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
"Jaljayo."

362
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,000
"Jalja?"

363
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,200
Ah!

364
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,320
Good night.

365
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,800
Your dream...

366
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,760
make it come true.

367
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
You think I understand that?

368
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,320
What did he say?

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Did he insult me?

370
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,240
"Goom..."

371
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,240
Dream?

372
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,240
Yes.

373
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm still in Thailand.

374
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm thinking about it.

375
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,680
I hope you understand. I can't give you an answer yet.

376
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Thank you.

377
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Good morning.

378
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,400
Dinneaw.

379
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,440
Don't you wanna go out somewhere?

380
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm getting sick of you.

381
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,680
What do you want?

382
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,960
"Coppee."

383
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,000
If you want coffee, say it right.

384
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,200
What's a copy?

385
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,720
It's "coffee".

386
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Umm.

387
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,760
Coppee.

388
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,880
If you can't say it, you won't get it.

389
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,480
Coffee.

390
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,040
Coppee?

391
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,040
Coffee. In Thai, we say "kafae".

392
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,240
Umm.

393
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,960
"Kapae?"

394
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,960
You can't pronounce the letter "F", right?

395
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,240
Try saying this.

396
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,880
Frank feeds fat fish

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,400
fresh fish food.

398
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh!

399
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,800
Frank feeds fash fit fret fit foosh

400
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,440
Okay. What do you want?

401
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,640
What do you have on menu?

402
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
We have longan coffee today. Wanna try?

403
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,160
It's sweet and refreshing.

404
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,520
It's our place's signature.

405
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,160
Umm.

406
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,240
Longan coppee.

407
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,640
Okay, okay.

408
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
It's longan "coffee".

409
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,000
Coffee.

410
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Sit over there and wait.

411
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,000
Coppee.

412
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,400
Your longan coffee is here.

413
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Umm.

414
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Longan.

415
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,640
Longan, so good.

416
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,520
Oh yeah, Sungmin.

417
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,920
My mom said you used to live here as a kid.

418
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
After you return to Korea, you disappeared for decades.

419
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,440
You never reached out to her.

420
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,320
Why did you decide to show up now?

421
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,920
It's personal.

422
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,240
You mean none of my business.

423
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,320
Dinneaw.

424
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Dinneaw?

425
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,280
Good morning.

426
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,760
Thai massage please.

427
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,200
Okay, okay.

428
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Thank you.

429
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Dinneaw Massage...

430
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,680
at your service right away, sir.

431
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Does it hurt?

432
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,040
A little harder please.

433
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,480
Fine.

434
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,320
Does it hurt?

435
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,320
A little harder please.

436
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Does it hurt?

437
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,920
It hurts, but feels good.

438
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,000
Turn over.

439
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,000
Take off your shirt.

440
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,400
Lift up your arms.

441
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Oh, Sungmin! Are you up? Come on in.

442
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,680
It's good you're here.

443
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,160
Have you seen the production of a vase?

444
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,720
Oh!

445
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,680
You're amazing.

446
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,680
He's my son.

447
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,720
Here, this one. Do you remember this photo?

448
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,240
Do you?

449
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,440
I remember that.

450
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,440
Dad took it.

451
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
After you returned to Korea,

452
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
he got in accident.

453
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,080
Oh...

454
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,400
Sungmin sorry.

455
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,000
It's okay, son.

456
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,160
Humans are fated to depart, alive or dead.

457
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,440
Dad is resting in peace.

458
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,640
It's us that have to live and keep going on.

459
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,080
I believe you have your reasons...

460
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,680
for not contacting us at all.

461
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,400
It's okay.

462
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,040
It's okay if you don't want to tell.

463
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,440
You're here for a vacation. You need enjoy it.

464
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,160
You know what?

465
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,640
You should go and help Dinneaw out at the market.

466
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,480
Right?

467
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,440
Oh.

468
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,240
Dinneaw sells at the market?

469
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes. He has a booth at the market.

470
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,680
You're here now anyway.

471
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,320
You're staying for free so help us out.

472
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,960
The market is just right across the bridge.

473
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,240
Please help him out.

474
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,640
Okay.

475
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,960
Market, okay?

476
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,040
Okay, go on.

477
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,480
You're such a good boy. Go to the market.

478
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,080
Remember it. Market.

479
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,320
My mom made soap for me to sell.

480
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,640
Oh?

481
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,000
It...

482
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,400
looks good.

483
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,560
If the clay pots don't sell,

484
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,480
you can switch to soap.

485
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,480
Tor, screw you!

486
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,920
This is my mom's handicraft.

487
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
Watch your mouth.

488
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,280
Nobody's as lucky as you are.

489
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,280
You got a regular who comes every afternoon.

490
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
Speak of the devil.

491
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,240
There he is, your Pop Arthit.

492
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,000
Don't make fun of me.

493
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Pop.

494
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,960
When will you support me like you do him?

495
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,520
Today, I have some new soap.

496
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,800
In case you want to smell nice and make your armpits smell nice.

497
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,000
Your herbal liquor bar...

498
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,600
will attract more customers.

499
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Dinneaw.

500
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
What the heck is wrong with you?

501
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,920
Don't mess with my regular customer.

502
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,480
Arthit.

503
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,480
Here's your five sticks of meatballs,

504
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,920
with sauce and vegetables.

505
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,760
The usual.

506
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,920
Pop, you eat meat balls every day.

507
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,960
Don't you get tired of it?

508
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,639
For me,

509
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,000
when I like something, I stick with it.

510
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I don't get tired of things easily.

511
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,080
If it's good and I love it,

512
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,840
why would I have something else?

513
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,880
So do you like the meat balls or the seller?

514
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,800
Dinneaw!

515
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,480
If you stop talking,

516
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
I'll buy your soap.

517
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,400
Two bars.

518
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,080
That's a promise!

519
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,920
- Yeah.
- I'll keep talking until tomorrow.

520
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,760
You will threaten to buy it all then.

521
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,160
Our market is quiet these days.

522
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,080
There's a Thai classical dance performance here.

523
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
We got quite a crowd.

524
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh!

525
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,840
Look at that.

526
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,320
We have a Korean visitor today.

527
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,560
Oh hey! What's wrong?

528
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,840
- Hey?
- Crap!

529
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,560
- He's choking!
- What do we do?

530
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,880
- What do we do?
- We're doomed!

531
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,280
Pop!

532
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,320
- Hit his back.
- Hit him?

533
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,680
Is it out, Pop?

534
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,920
Is it?

535
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,920
- Is it out?
- Spit it out!

536
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,680
Amazing!

537
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,480
Are you okay, Pop?

538
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,520
Sir.

539
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,680
You okay?

540
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm okay.

541
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,080
Umm...

542
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm sorry for the trouble, guys.

543
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,920
I was shocked at how good you look.

544
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,880
You almost died.

545
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,880
Here. Have some water.

546
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,320
And then you can flirt.

547
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Are you worried about me?

548
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,280
If you die because of my meat balls,

549
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,160
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.

550
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Hey!

551
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,640
You're so handsome.

552
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,640
Don't tell me you're a K-Drama actor on vacation?

553
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,520
I am Korean.

554
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm not an actor.

555
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Oh?

556
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,440
You're a Korean, but not an actor.

557
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,880
So what's your name?

558
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,840
His name is Gecko.

559
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Gecko?

560
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,120
Dinneaw, you're teasing Sungmin again.

561
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,000
His name is Sungmin.

562
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,520
What a cool name.

563
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Are you here on vacation, Sungmin?

564
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm here to help Dinneaw...

565
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,920
sell things.

566
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,480
If the seller is this handsome,

567
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,320
- I'll buy all the things.
- Tell everyone. Share it.

568
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,880
Yeah. What do you have?

569
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,080
Please pick what you like.

570
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,640
Sungmin, you said you'd help me.

571
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,160
Now sell.

572
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,400
Here.

573
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,480
Pick it up.

574
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
Please buy this.

575
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,560
Please buy this.

576
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,600
Who's that?

577
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,960
A Korean boy.

578
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,640
He used to live in my house ten years ago.

579
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,320
He showed up out of nowhere.

580
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,440
He...

581
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,680
seems like a nice guy.

582
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,480
Really?

583
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,080
I think...

584
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,640
he's weird and silly.

585
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,400
The other day, a gecko at my house almost ate him.

586
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,880
The whole house heard his scream!

587
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That means you didn't scream?

588
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,320
Who screamed? Not me!

589
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,040
Look at my booth.

590
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,600
Tor, you don't have to buy them now.

591
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,760
Look at him go. He's selling better than you do.

592
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,520
Yeah. You're not needed anymore.

593
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,840
Bon appetit, Sungmin.

594
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,280
Thanks.

595
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,000
Hmm! So good!

596
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,920
It's good, right?

597
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Sour curry.

598
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,320
I made this especially for you.

599
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,480
No spice!

600
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,080
Oh!

601
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,680
- Sour curry.  - That's right.

602
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,480
Yes!

603
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,640
Everyone eats spicy food,

604
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,440
except Mr. Sungmin here.

605
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,400
Dinneaw, why do you bully him so much?

607
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,480
He annoys me.

608
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,960
Well,

609
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,280
let me formally introduce myself.

610
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,880
I...

611
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,520
am Arthit,

612
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,960
the owner of a classic herbal liquor bar.

613
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,800
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sungmin.

614
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,800
Yes.

615
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,040
We call him "Pop".

616
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,280
Because the market...

617
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,400
is run by Pop Arthit!

618
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,160
Well said.

619
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,840
My name is Tor.

620
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I sell meat balls.

621
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,880
The meat balls that...

622
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,160
Pop choked on.

623
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,120
You're careless.

624
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,480
Choking on food is bad,

625
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,160
but it's worse...

626
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,360
to choke on obsession.

627
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,200
Easy.

628
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,280
Nice to meet you. My name is Sungmin.

629
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,280
Nice to meet you.

630
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,960
Oh yeah, Dinneaw.

631
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
I counted the money from the sales today.

632
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,840
You made 2,500?

633
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,880
Sungmin helped selling.

634
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,760
Girls buy a lot of things from him.

635
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,280
Really?

636
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,000
Yes.

637
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,560
You have to come more often.

638
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,840
You make our market lively.

639
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,480
Agreed.

640
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,960
Umm.

641
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,000
Did you have fun selling, Sungmin?

642
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I did, Mom.

643
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,000
That's good.

644
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,160
Don't exaggerate.

645
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,960
The products are good.

646
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,080
Of course they sell well.

647
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,960
Anyone can sell those things.

648
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,840
Ever since you opened your booth,

649
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,600
you've never even made a thousand.

650
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,200
That's true.

651
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,320
Sungmin, great job.

652
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,320
Dinneaw.

653
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,960
If you want to be that good, take Sungmin as an example.

654
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,040
Thank you, Mom.

655
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,680
You keep calling someone else's mother "Mom".

656
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,520
Don't you have your own Mom?

657
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,520
Dinneaw.

658
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,040
Hey!

659
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,520
Where are you going?

660
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,000
It's nothing. Don't mind him.

661
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,800
Well done, son.

662
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,000
Okay? Wanna eat? Are you hungry?

663
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,400
Let's eat?

664
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,040
Sungmin, it's me.

665
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,600
Sungmin.

666
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,560
- Mom.
- Yeah.

667
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,320
How are you?

668
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,880
Look.

669
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,520
Do you remember your little blanket?

670
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,760
Oh.

671
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,480
Sungmin's little blanket.

672
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,200
Yeah, right.

673
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,280
You liked this blanket so much when you were little.

674
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,000
You had to have it every night.

675
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,480
Even when it's old and worn. you still needed it every night.

676
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,600
Your mom wouldn't let you take this.

677
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,920
So I kept this...

678
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,160
to hold when I miss you.

679
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,320
Little blanket stinks.

680
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,560
Yeah. It stinks, but I never washed it.

681
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,360
I'm afraid you'd lose your smell.

682
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,160
Would you like me to wash it?

683
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
No.

684
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,280
Sungmin likes stink little blanket.

685
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,600
Sungmin.

686
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,160
Please don't mind what Dinneaw said.

687
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,960
He's just possessive of me.

688
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,000
He's actually a poor boy.

689
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,640
He doesn't have a father like other kids.

690
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,880
Sungmin not angry.

691
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,200
Sungmin understands.

692
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,480
Thank you so much, sweetie.

693
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,040
Think of this place as your home.

694
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,320
You can come and stay any time.

695
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,600
If something troubles you,

696
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,480
we will be your friends

697
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,640
and a safe zone for you.

698
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,040
Thank you, my boy.

699
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,760
It stinks. Let's wash it?

700
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,680
- I like it.
- You like it?

701
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,680
Dinneaw.

702
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,960
What now, Mom?

703
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,880
You shouldn't have said that to Sungmin.

704
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,680
He's really annoying, Mom.

705
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,480
He keeps calling someone's mother "Mom'!

706
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,440
When Sungmin's mom came to take him back to Korea,

707
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,000
she said she would remarry.

708
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,560
He probably went to boarding school.

709
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,160
You saying...

710
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,600
hurtful things to someone...

711
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,000
without knowing what they went through,

712
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,680
is it a good thing?

713
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,880
It's not good, Mom.

714
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,840
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,360
I'll be more careful with my words.

716
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,000
Words...

717
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,920
can't be taken back when they're spoken.

718
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,760
That's why before you say anything,

719
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,200
think about how they feel.

720
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,920
What should I do, Mom?

721
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
What should you do?

722
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,200
Go and apologize to him.

723
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,000
If I apologize, will he forgive me?

724
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,800
Sorry.

725
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,560
Sorry for saying bad things.

726
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Are you mute?

727
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,560
I'm apologizing and you're standing still.

728
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,680
Say something.

729
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,640
Sungmin not accept apology.

730
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,920
Hey!

731
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,600
Don't play hard to get now.

732
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,200
Forgive me already. Let's get it over with.

733
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,200
Take Sungmin to soju place.

734
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,920
Sungmin won't be angry.

735
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,440
Do we have soju around here?

736
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,800
We only got herbal liquor.

737
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,480
Want some?

738
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,360
Herbal liquor?

739
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,400
Pop's bar.

740
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,760
At the market

741
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,280
If we're going,

742
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,120
we have to sneak out.

743
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,640
Mom doesn't let me go out at night.

744
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,600
If Mom finds out,

745
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,160
she's gonna kill us.

746
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,480
Okay.

747
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,040
Okay.

748
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,840
How about your way home last night?

749
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
My way home… It’s okay.

750
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,040
Mr.Sainam, my lovely boss.

751
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,960
