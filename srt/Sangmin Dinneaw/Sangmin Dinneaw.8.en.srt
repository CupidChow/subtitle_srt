1
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,520
Sangmin asked who you are, Mrs. Orn.

2
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,000
When your lover doesn't remember you, it hurts.

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,520
Who's this person, Mom?

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,239
She's Sangmin's mom.

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,560
- Sangmin, come!
- Dinneaw!

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
Dinneaw, stop!

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,560
Let Sangmin go!

8
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,840
Sangmin.

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,039
Don't forget me.

10
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Whoa!

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,280
It's so quiet today.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
Where are all the customers?

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,840
Give me five sticks please.

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,320
Pop.

15
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,120
You're my first customer today.

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,280
So...

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
I deserve a reward, right?

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,479
Well...

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,120
Pop, don't! We're in the market.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,680
You said it's been quiet today.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,840
I said... People might see us. No.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,680
Pop.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Tor, Arthit, I need your...

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,039
Uh...

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,840
Are you two dating?

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not what you think.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
Don't let your imagination runs too far.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,680
Pop.

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
Tell her it's nothing.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
It's too late for that.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Okay. Whatever you say.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,680
Well, I need your help, guys.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,000
Ever since Sangmin went to Korea,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,280
Dinneaw has locked himself in.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
I think my son is turning into a vampire.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,600
Can you two take Dinneaw out to see the Sun?

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,400
Actually,

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
we haven't seen Dinneaw in a while.

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
Let's visit him.

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
Okay.

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you, guys.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,240
- You're welcome.
- Thanks. Please come soon.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
We will.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Tor.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,440
Pop.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
When did you last leave the room?

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,560
Why are you looking like that?

48
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,840
You don't even eat.

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,280
Are you letting yourself rot to death in here?

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
I don't know.

51
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
I don't have the strength to go anywhere.

52
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,360
I don't have the strength to do anything.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,560
Even breathing is hard.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,960
Go out and get some sunlight please.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,680
If you stay inside,

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
would...

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,600
Sangmin come back?

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm a person, not a tree.

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,360
I don't need light to survive.

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,800
You can still argue.

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
You're not that miserable.

62
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,240
If he doesn't want to leave, just leave him be, Pop.

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
He's being annoying.

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,720
Come out sometimes, Dinneaw.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,480
Think about your mom.

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,159
Can I stay inside a bit longer?

67
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
I need a couple more days.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
I don't want to go out yet.

69
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,680
I would only see the places where Sangmin visited.

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,800
So this room...

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,160
has never been visited by Sangmin?

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Sangmin promised to come back.

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,160
He will come back.

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
But now,

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,240
you need to think about your mom.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,680
You know?

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,480
When I walked in,

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,920
your mom was cleaning the homestay.

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,280
And she had to do reception too.

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Why?

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,160
Because her beloved son locks himself in the room.

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,280
My mom is working that hard?

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
Not at all...

84
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,720
when her son is in bed all day like a prince, right?

85
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,560
You're always sarcastic.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm your best friend.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,120
Have some water, please.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,280
Thank you.

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,720
Right. Dessert is coming right up.

90
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
I'll be back soon.

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Oh.

92
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Please watch your steps.

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,280
The floor seems slippery.

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,120
Thank you.

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,160
Fine.

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,800
I'll go.

97
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Yeah.

98
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,720
That's more like it.

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Ouch!

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
Mom!

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
Dinneaw!

102
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,840
How did you slip?

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I don't know.

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm here for a business meeting with your mother.

105
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,680
When I came in, she was already down.

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Can you stand?

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Ouch! My leg hurts!

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
It hurts!

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Tor, call an ambulance.

110
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,800
Okay.

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Let's help her up.

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,360
I feel pain.

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
It's throbbing.

114
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,840
You'll be fine, Mom.

115
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Oh, Doctor.

116
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,040
Hi.

117
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Hi.

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
You have a fractured bone.

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,400
But it will be okay with a few months of rest and care.

120
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,360
When the bone heals, you'll feel much better.

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,400
Doctor.

122
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,720
Can I walk around now?

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
I have a homestay to run.

124
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,600
I'd recommend...

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,560
limiting the use of your legs.

126
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,800
If you overwork, it could result in a nonunion fracture.

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,160
Yeah, well...

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,040
So...

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,240
What does the bill look like, Doctor?

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,800
You will have to ask our Finance Department.

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,240
You don't have to worry about that.

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,800
You have insurance.

133
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,120
Well...

134
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,560
I haven't paid the fees in months.

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,000
Doctor.

136
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,040
I would like to ask for a favor.

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,480
Could you please give us some discount?

138
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,920
My homestay is in trouble right now.

139
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
We haven't made money in months.

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,480
Well...

141
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Please.

142
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Our family is in trouble?

143
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,360
You didn't tell me.

144
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,600
Don't worry about the bills, Doctor.

145
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
She needs to heal.

146
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,840
I'll take care of things back at home.

147
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,280
Of course. Please discuss things with our Finance Department.

148
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
Excuse me.

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
Thank you.

150
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,920
Dinneaw, you don't have to.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
It's okay.

152
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
I only have one mom.

153
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
I have to take care of you.

154
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
All this time,

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,000
you have always been taking care of me.

156
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
If it's too much, don't push yourself too hard.

157
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
I have my solution.

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
What solution?

159
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,120
I'm going to sell our homestay to Mr. Sainam.

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,880
Our homestay's service is heavily criticized in reviews.

161
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,080
It's got to the point where we have no guests.

162
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,960
I can't carry on with all the expenses.

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Hi!

164
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
Dinneaw!

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
We haven't been in touch. How are you?

166
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm good, Sis.

167
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,080
What's the matter?

168
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm just here to talk to Mrs. Orn...

169
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,120
about buying this homestay.

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,000
My mother is injured.

171
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
You can negotiate with me.

172
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,000
So...

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
what do you think about this deal?

174
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,600
This is the place I've grown up in.

175
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,320
I don't want to lose it.

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,600
You don't have to worry about that.

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
I just want to run the place,

178
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600
with your help of course.

179
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,120
Let me renovate this homestay.

180
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,480
And we'll make money

181
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,360
and profit off of it together.

182
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Let me sleep on it.

183
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,000
Of course.

184
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,480
For you, I can always wait.

185
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,520
Mr. Sainam, why do you want this place?

186
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,360
It doesn't seem profitable,

187
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,720
unless you buy up all the land and...

188
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,480
build another hotel.

189
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
You don't look at the big picture.

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
This place has everything.

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,120
With good marketing, all I see is profit.

192
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,120
And I'll also get a bonus.

193
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
What bonus?

194
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
It's Dinneaw.

195
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,080
Mr. Sainam.

196
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,600
Did Mrs. Orn get injured because of you?

197
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,760
Do you have to know everything, Pony?

198
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,000
I have to.

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,960
I happen to be born curious.

200
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,120
Let's just say...

201
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
nobody has to know.

202
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,000
If Dinneaw or anyone finds out,

203
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
you're fired.

204
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
This seems suspicious.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,120
I have to save my beloved junior.

206
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,480
I may look like a villainess,

207
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
but I'm an angel.

208
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
After Mr. Sangmin's operation,

209
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,000
Mr. Dinneaw looks devastated.

210
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
Mr. Sangmin shouldn't have left.

211
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,200
That's just how uncertain life is.

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,520
When the time comes for you to be alone, you'll be alone.

213
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,600
Mr. Dinneaw was the only one he remembered though.

214
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,000
That means he must have loved Mr. Dinneaw so much.

215
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,760
There might have been something beyond his control.

216
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,240
That's why you have to control...

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
what you can control.

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,840
Like control yourself to keep living on?

219
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,360
Control things about us.

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Us?

221
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
So you like me?

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,760
How...

223
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,360
How did you know?

224
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
I can see it from miles away.

225
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
So...

226
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
Why? Why didn't you...

227
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
keep some distance?

228
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
Why would I keep distance...

229
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
when I feel good when I'm close to you?

230
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,120
I'm okay with even closer.

231
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
How close?

232
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,720
Is this close enough?

233
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,720
If I say...

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
this is not close enough, what would you do?

235
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh?

236
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,760
You're pressuring me.

237
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,440
You look like you want me to finish this in ten minutes.

238
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm not pressuring you, Mom.

239
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm just anxious.

240
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,600
I said no to Mr. Sainam,

241
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,080
but I don't have a solution for our homestay yet.

242
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,200
If you can't figure it out, don't worry.

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,520
Worrying too much will give you a headache. That's no good.

244
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
Let's put on some music. Okay?

245
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,360
I'll dance for you.

246
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
Music, music.

247
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,720
We're in so much trouble,

248
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,240
and you don't seem stressed?

249
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
Oh.

250
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,840
Life is stressful sometimes. It's normal.

251
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,000
This is what it's like to be an adult.

252
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,240
Come on.

253
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,480
Dance with me. Get up.

254
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't worry about anything.

255
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
Dance with me.

256
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
Don't move too much, Mom.

257
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,360
- Oops.
- See?

258
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,760
Let's dance. Come on, come on.

259
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
That's a bent vase that Sangmin made.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,360
You didn't throw it away?

261
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
Why would I?

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
It's beautiful.

263
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,440
It's flawed, right?

264
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,720
Umm...

265
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,200
It's bent, but...

266
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
still okay.

267
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,880
Some things...

268
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,520
might look weird to others,

269
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
but to some,

270
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
it might be worth something.

271
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,960
Thank you for your support, sir.

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,280
I feel happy for Mrs. Orn.

273
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
Dinneaw is back in his booth.

274
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,080
You look lively, right?

275
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
How am I lively, Pop?

276
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,680
I barely get any sleep.

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I clean the homestay in the morning.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,680
Then do reception.

279
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,240
Then sell these vases in the afternoon.

280
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Then back to reception.

281
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
Then make vases in the evening.

282
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,800
How would I have time to sleep?

283
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,880
All those things you said,

284
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,240
while you were down,

285
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,400
your mom did it all.

286
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,880
All you do is rub salt in my wounds.

287
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,440
Won't you praise me for once?

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,200
True friends are brutally honest.

289
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,800
Haven't you heard?

290
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
You're my friend indeed.

291
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
By the way, how is your mom doing?

292
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
She's getting another X-Ray next week,

293
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,520
but I have to be ready to pay.

294
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,080
That's stressing me out.

295
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,040
Hey!

296
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,320
Come on, come on!

297
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,760
There's a dead end to every problem.

298
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,160
One day, you can back out of it.

299
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
Trust me.

300
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
Please tell me that's how you show support.

301
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,960
Of course.

302
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,640
Tor is rubbing off on you, Pop.

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,080
Hey!

304
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,320
That hurts...

305
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
Hello, Mr. Parker.

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,720
Do you remember me?

307
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,480
Hi!

308
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
Good afternoon, Father.

309
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
Amida Buddha. Whoa!

310
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,000
I saw you dressed in a monk's color.

311
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,440
Still joking?

312
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,000
If you keep this up, I'll tell him not to help.

313
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,000
What help?

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,000
Let me introduce.

315
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,000
This is Mr. Parker's assistant.

316
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,400
Mr. Parker...

317
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,520
is a world class artist.

318
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
If he likes your work,

319
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,880
it could be featured in an international exhibition!

320
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,560
Hello, Mr. Dinneaw.

321
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,960
Mr. Parker...

322
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,280
saw your vases...

323
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
at Na Tree Tara hotel.

324
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
He loves them.

325
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,200
He told me to buy some more.

326
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,640
Buy more?

327
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,520
That's right.

328
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,480
Please pick what you like.

329
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,440
It's beautiful!

330
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,680
So beautiful!

331
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,560
Ah!

332
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,200
So beautiful!

333
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,920
Oh my god!

334
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,760
All! I'm buying them all!

335
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,720
- He's taking them all!
- Give me all these!

336
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Thank you.

337
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,320
How did it go?

338
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,480
Did you make a lot of money?

339
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,000
I made so much!

340
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,240
He bought them at a price that...

341
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
I didn't believe what I heard.

342
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,680
So after you pay off your mom's debt,

343
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,240
can you still keep running the homestay?

344
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,000
We'll be fine for another six months.

345
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,720
If Mr. Parker features our new products in an exhibition,

346
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,760
international celebrities will see them.

347
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
We'll make more than enough, Pop.

348
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,040
My homestay is gonna be fine.

349
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,040
What a relief.

350
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,200
You're good. I'll give you that.

351
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
Was that a praise or a flattering.

352
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
It's a praise.

353
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,280
I'll be praising you for one day.

354
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,880
Usually, I'd insult you.

355
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,520
So what should we do now?

356
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,320
Let's celebrate!

357
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,560
- Come on, come on.
- Drinks on me.

358
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,480
No.

359
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,000
Keep it.

360
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
Cheers.

361
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,520
Cheers!

362
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,320
- Oh! Guy, Riktor!
- Hey!

363
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,240
What brought you here?

364
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,960
I heard from Hana...

365
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,000
that you guys are from Ayuddhaya.

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,880
So we came by.

367
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,720
Come on. Sit down.

368
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
Sit and get comfy.

369
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,720
Well, Hana...

370
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,200
is closing her resort because she has to help with her dad's research.

371
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,640
We're unemployed for now.

372
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,800
We heard Dinneaw's mom is injured.

373
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,720
So we came to help out in your homestay.

374
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,520
You came at the right time.

375
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Dinneaw...

376
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,960
has been busy making vases.

377
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,440
Thank you all so much.

378
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,960
It's true we'll know who the real friends are in hard times.

379
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,640
Hey. Don't worry about it.

380
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,320
He's right.

381
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,720
We should be drinking.

382
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Here.

383
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,640
- Guy, Riktor, here are yours.
- Take your glasses.

384
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,760
Hey, wait.

385
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,960
Wait for everyone.

386
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,720
- Cheers.
- Yeah, touch glass first. Don't rush.

387
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

388
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,480
Alright.

389
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,320
Hmm.

390
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,240
What about Sangmin? Isn't he here?

391
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
Oh?

392
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,240
Hana didn't tell you?

393
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Mom.

394
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,040
Please, mom.

395
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,640
Come on, Let's get a meal.

396
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,000
Is he asleep?

397
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,880
Yes.

398
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
If he dies...

399
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,520
how much will we get from life insurance?

400
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,040
A hundred million

401
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
We need that money.

402
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,400
That's why I brought him here.

403
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,800
Let him take this medicine.

404
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Guy said I need abstinence. I must obey.

405
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,720
Guy...

406
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,040
Guy...

407
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,440
Guy...

408
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,240
Guy...

409
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Guy!

410
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,160
Guy!

411
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,000
Guy!

412
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,720
Guy!

413
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,000
Guy!

414
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,680
Guy!

415
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,480
Guy...

416
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
Rik, did you call me?

417
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,680
No, I didn't.

418
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,200
Need help harvesting cucumbers?

419
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,920
No.

420
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,640
It's okay.

421
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,520
I got this.

422
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,800
Mrs. Orn made chilli paste dip.

423
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,720
It looks yummy.

424
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,720
Let's go then.

425
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
These cucumbers are enough for me.

426
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,680
Yeah. That's enough.

427
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,680
Oh!

428
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,080
There's one more. Let's not waste it.

429
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,240
No!

430
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,000
- It's fine. Leave it.
- No. It'd be a food waste.

431
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,200
Hey, Guy, leave it!

432
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,280
Chilli paste dip.

433
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,000
And a deep fried fish. hot off the fryer.

434
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,480
Have some of this.

435
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,480
Dinneaw, would you like cucumber?

436
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,920
No, I don't like cucumber.

437
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,040
Me neither.

438
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,680
Rik is the only one who likes it.

439
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,000
Eat a lot.

440
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
It's a shame if it's goes to waste.

441
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,480
That's right. Cucumbers are delicious.

442
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,240
I grew these myself.

443
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,040
I promise. It's toxin free.

444
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,720
Rik hasn't had a bite, Mom.

445
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,880
Try it.

446
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,040
It's good.

447
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,800
Here.

448
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,720
Ah!

449
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,880
If that's not enough, I've got more!

450
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,320
"Ayuddhaya, our old capital,

451
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,960
I tell you of it with nostalgia.

452
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,640
Ayuddhaya...

453
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,280
in the past..."

454
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,640
"...was the city of gold for the Thai people"

455
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,440
Our Dinneaw Homestay...

456
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,640
is located close to historical sites.

457
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,240
We can learn so much history here.

458
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,440
I've made a recommendation in this brochure.

459
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,400
No matter where you are,

460
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,520
you're still determined to be a tour guide as ever.

461
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Mr. Sainam, would you like a stay?

462
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,240
No.

463
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,160
I'm here to follow up...

464
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,880
on whether you decide to sell this place or not.

465
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,480
I've lived in this homestay since childhood.

466
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,240
I want to take care of it myself.

467
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,800
Thank you, Mr. Sainam,

468
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,320
for always supporting me.

469
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,040
Dinneaw.

470
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,040
Your vases on Mr. Parker's social media...

471
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,720
are going viral abroad!

472
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,000
Dinneaw!

473
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,080
Dinneaw.

474
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,240
A foreigner just called. They want to visit our homestay.

475
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,960
They will also help promote us.

476
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,480
Really?

477
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah.

478
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,480
Take the call.

479
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,200
I'm sorry.

480
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm busy right now.

481
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,800
Wait.

482
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
You know, right?

483
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,960
That your mom owes some loan sharks.

484
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,280
Oh, that?

485
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
I already paid them.

486
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,320
Please don't worry about that.

487
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,480
How was that possible?

488
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,040
I don't know.

489
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,000
Whoa!

490
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,400
Mr. Sainam?

491
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,960
Your manhood...

492
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,040
is wounded and bloody.

493
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,240
That's not it!

494
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,200
My pants are red.

495
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,960
It's all messed up.

496
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,080
Why don't you go back and change your pants at the homestay?

497
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,640
Screw that!

498
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,920
Why is his homestay getting so many guests?

499
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,960
I review bombed them.

500
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,320
I made Mrs. Orn injured.

501
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,760
I pushed them to sell.

502
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,160
How do they keep getting lucky?

503
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,920
Mr. Sainam.

504
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
I've heard a saying.

505
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,280
"Ghosts protect good people."

506
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,480
Oh? So I'm a ghost?

507
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,480
Why are you talking to yourself?

508
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,720
Don't act suspicious.

509
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,040
How am I suspicious?

510
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm not sus at all.

511
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,880
We need to find a new way to make him sell the homestay.

512
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,920
Mr. Sainam, just stop!

513
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,040
Whether it's the property or Dinneaw.

514
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,560
In the end,

515
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,400
what's not meant to be yours...

516
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,000
won't be yours.

517
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,440
An innocent love...

518
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,480
is about seeing the one you love happy

519
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,560
and have a good life.

520
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
Is that right?

521
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,920
Project Dinneaw Homestay is off.

522
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,000
That's more like it...

523
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm practicing my dance for next year's Loy Krathong.

524
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,920
Let's go, Mr. Sainam.

525
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,240
Mom.

526
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,240
Huh?

527
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,480
What kind of vases should I make?

528
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,520
I didn't expect them to ask us to hold an exhibition.

529
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,560
Dinneaw.

530
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,240
If you're in the right place at the right time,

531
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,680
people would want you.

532
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,760
Yes.

533
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,720
I didn't think it would happen to me.

534
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,480
You don't know when luck will knock on your door.

535
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,200
That's why we have to always be ready.

536
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Looks like you're not getting ready.

537
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,920
The sculptor still has no idea what to feature in the exhibition.

538
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Rik!

539
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,200
You're destroying his confidence.

540
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,000
Sorry.

541
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,880
I shouldn't have said that.

542
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,719
I'm just worried that he wouldn't get ideas because...

543
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,159
he kept looking at that bent and twisted vase.

544
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,320
My mom once said...

545
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,320
weird things to us...

546
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,960
can be worth something...

547
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,320
to others.

548
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I think...

549
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,760
This bent and twisted vase,

550
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,120
if we make it look better,

551
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
it could be interesting.

552
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,600
Umm.

553
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,320
Working at a homestay is harder than I thought.

554
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,080
No.

555
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,880
The hotel was way harder.

556
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh yeah.

557
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,640
Dinneaw uses Sangmin's vase...

558
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,200
as the source of all his ideas.

559
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,880
I bet he misses Sangmin a lot.

560
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
Yeah, he does.

561
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,360
Are you horny?

562
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,880
Uh-uh.

563
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,960
Who's horny?

564
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,960
Look at me.

565
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,360
I'm not horny.

566
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,560
I'm trying abstinence, as promised.

567
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Don't deny it. Your body's telling me.

568
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,440
I know you want to be a normal couple,

569
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,840
so I try to control myself.

570
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,440
But when we don't do it, I can't help but think of it.

571
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,840
Noona said...

572
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,200
these things are meant to coexist.

573
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,960
Let's meet halfway, shall we?

574
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,480
I don't want you to keep resisting anymore.

575
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,120
Have sex when you want

576
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,520
while also having a romantic relationship?

577
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,440
Yeah.

578
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,480
Let's adapt bit by bit.

579
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Not too much, not too little.

580
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,160
Don't be horny all the time

581
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,040
but don't force a dry spell.

582
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,040
Let's take care of each other,

583
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,760
like other normal couples do.

584
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,200
You don't feel it's too much for you, right?

585
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If we're in love,

586
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,480
meeting halfway is not too much.

587
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,280
Then I'm not forcing myself anymore.

588
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Flying butterfly!

589
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,880
Woo!

590
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,440
Landing plane!

591
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,080
Plane in cockpit!

592
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,960
Take off your glasses.

593
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,760
Okay.

594
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,960
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

595
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

596
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,680
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

597
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,680
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

598
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,480
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

599
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,160
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

600
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,000
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

601
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,080
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

602
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,160
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

603
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,880
Hello, Sangmin.

604
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,480
How are you?

605
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,400
Have you been well?

606
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,520
Last time, I told you

607
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
we weren't getting any guests at the homestay.

608
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,800
But now,

609
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,520
we're getting so many guests.

610
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,200
Thanks to Pony.

611
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,000
She brought a world class artist to see my work.

612
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,480
And...

613
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,480
Thanks to you too.

614
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,480
Because you...

615
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,480
are my inspiration in designing.

616
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,000
It's been so long.

617
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,400
Sangmin,

618
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,480
do you remember me now?

619
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,600
What?

620
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,000
Is this a wedding invitation?

621
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,880
When did you have a boyfriend?

622
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,480
I wish, Dad.

623
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,320
These days,

624
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,960
men that call me...

625
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,000
are only delivery riders.

626
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,880
So what's this invitation for?

627
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,360
Dinneaw is holding his own sculpture exhibition.

628
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,640
Dinneaw is really good.

629
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,840
He's come this far.

630
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
For Dinneaw,

631
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,480
we don't have to worry about him now.

632
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,640
But I don't know how Sangmin's been.

633
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,480
Sangmin

634
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Take this.

635
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
Let's take this.

636
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,040
It's time...

637
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,200
You...

638
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,560
You intend to poison me.

639
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,000
What's wrong?

640
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,960
Honey, why is it like this?

641
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,840
Kimchi almost choked to death.

642
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,520
What?

643
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,440
Let him take this medicine.

644
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,800
Karma is real.

645
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,200
You evil son of a bitch.

646
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,440
Since childhood...

647
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,440
You never love me.

648
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,440
Ungrateful?

649
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,200
I wasn't your child from the beginning.

650
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,000
Evil!

651
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,400
From now...

652
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,520
Don't mess with me

653
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,040
Honey!

654
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,640
Honey!

655
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,080
Hi.

656
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,840
This is Mr. Parker...

657
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,760
This work was left out

658
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,000
because it's not perfect.

659
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,480
But I see the beauty in it.

660
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,960
It reflects someone's life.

661
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,480
Someone I know.

662
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,600
This work gave me a chance

663
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,200
to learn more of life.

664
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,440
Nothing is perfect.

665
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Who is he?

666
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,440
Sangmin.

667
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,920
You remember?

668
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,480
I remember now...

669
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,920
because...

670
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,960
of this.

671
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,480
Big Bro Sangmin, is this thing cute?

672
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,360
I'm giving you this.

673
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,160
Thank you.

674
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,000
This is...

675
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,000
a stuffed animal from when we were young.

676
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
I was wondering where it was.

677
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,080
Don't you remember...

678
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,960
you gave it to Sangmin?

679
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,560
I was so young.

680
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,800
Who would remember that?

681
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,840
Because...

682
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,800
Sangmin has Dinneaw,

683
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,200
Sangmin

684
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,000
can smile.

685
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,600
You can smile because of my stuffed animal,

686
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,000
or because of the real me?

687
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,000
Stuffed animal.

688
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,960
You're messing with me.

689
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,960
Because...

690
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,480
of you too.

691
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,880
Are you going back to Korea again?

692
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,760
Oh?

693
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,080
From now on,

694
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,320
Sangmin...

695
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,560
will be with Dinneaw...

696
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,280
every day.

697
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,200
Promise?

698
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
Promise.

699
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,920
(The day you get too tired to go on.)

700
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,160
(The day the world is against you.)

701
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,760
(Your dream is still far away.)

702
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,200
(Leave it be. Rest your heart with me for a day.)

703
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,680
(I'll leave my love for you here to heal.)

704
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,040
(Forget the trouble that's weighing on you.)

705
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,880
(Right here, you have me no matter where you are.)

706
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,200
(My care for you will always be here.)

707
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,000
(Even if you have no one, you will always have me...)

708
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,520
(right here, by your side.)

709
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,200
(I'll be the home of your heart.)
