00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,640
Welcome to our training program.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
Judging from your quick wit,

3
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
being a trainee is a waste of your time.

4
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
I want you as my thinking partner.

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,560
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I thought you would never come back.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,560
Afraid Dinneaw would miss me.

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,039
Our model girl happens to be Korean.

9
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,640
You're going to kill it,

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,480
because you've dealt with a Korean VIP guest.

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,640
You, wait!

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,120
Sigh.

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,480
Where's your model, hag?

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,759
You said you have an idea.

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,560
Where are they?

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,759
Who are you calling a hag?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All you do is trash talking.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
Why don't we see whose face has more wrinkles, old man?

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,000
It's like you aren't aware of the grey hair on your head.

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
Your mouth is smart, unlike your look.

21
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,680
If you keep talking too much,

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,479
I'm gonna quit this job!

23
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,280
Hey, no!

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
Mr. Director, calm down please.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
Sit down please. Calm down, sir.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,479
I've never met a kinder director...

27
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,400
or smarter,

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,039
or look better than you. You look like Tom Cruise.

29
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,840
So please calm down.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,280
That's better.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,120
Mr. Sainam.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,759
I don't know what to do anymore.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
Relax. I trust Dinneaw.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
Our model...

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,280
is ready.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
Anyone can tell that's a man.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
That's nothing.

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
You can photoshop him.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
Can you do that?

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,680
If you can't, I'll get another director.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh. I...

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Lesson of the day.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,160
Don't be too confident.

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
(Please.)

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,280
Please.

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,400
Please.

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,400
Big Bro Sungmin, please help me.

50
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,960
No.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
If you help me this time,

52
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,360
I'd do anything you ask.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,560
Really?

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Hmm.

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,680
Hang out with Sungmin.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
Just two of us.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,720
"Yagsog."

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Promise?

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,600
Promise.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Promise?

63
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,560
Just get ready.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
Ready?

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Yes,sir.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,280
All right.

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,920
No. I don't need a face wipe.

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,680
Front...

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,159
Okay now?

70
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,400
Yeah, are you ready?

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,480
He's been ready for a whiie.

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,160
Umm...

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,160
Is this okay, Mr. Sainam?

74
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,160
Not as pretty as I am

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
but he kinda ate.

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
Ate what?

77
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,160
It means okay.

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,720
It's young people's slang. OLD people don't understand.

79
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,800
Do you think it's okay, Mr. Sainam?

80
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,480
The photos look nice.

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,280
When you photoshop him, please don't make it too obvious.

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes, Mr. Sainam.

83
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
All right.

84
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm calling a wrap for today.

85
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,480
That's a wrap!

86
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,720
Sungmin is awesome!

87
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Thank you.

88
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,280
Dinneaw.

89
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Dinneaw.

90
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
Dinneaw!

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,480
Promise?

92
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,840
I have work to do.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,240
I need to get it done.

94
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
You lied.

95
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,360
I always keep my promise.

96
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,160
Promise?

97
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay?

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,040
Okay.

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm not a kid.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
You're ruining my hair.

101
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,800
No.

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,240
Dinneaw is a kid.

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
So cute.

104
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,400
Stop.

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,720
No.

106
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
I like.

107
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
I need to go back to work.

108
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
What?

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
Are you going to wipe my lips?

110
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,560
With my lips.

111
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey!

112
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,600
You lovebirds.

113
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
Have some decency.

114
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Do it in your own room.

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,000
Laugh all you want.

116
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,480
Hey! That's Pony.

117
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Hi, boys!

118
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,880
This way!

119
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,520
Very good. I thought you'd let it go.

120
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
What'up, Sis?

121
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Later, Mr. Sainam will be here to talk to you all.

122
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
All of us?

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,480
That's right. All lalalal.

124
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
Oh?

125
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,720
You've woked in my training program

126
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,320
and you're still got drink all over you?

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,520
This is not our hotel's standards, understand?

128
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,120
Yes...

129
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,640
Come here.

130
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
This right here.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,480
Oh.

132
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Is it good?

133
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,240
It's good.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
This must be our hotel's coffee.

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,600
Slurp.

136
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
He'll be here in a minute.

137
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,000
What?

138
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,480
We need to host a Loy Krathong event this evening?

139
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,720
You heard that right.

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,720
I just checked and found out today is Loy Krathong's day.

141
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
But it's already late.

142
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
Do we have enough time?

143
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,600
He's right.

144
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Hmm....

145
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,000
Problem-solving skills...

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,520
are what you need as trainees, guys.

147
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
That's harsh.

148
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
More importantly,

149
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
I want Sungmin dressed as a Thai traditional girl to wecome our guests.

150
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,360
He already helped you this morning.

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,760
He should be fine if he does it again, right?

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
But Mr. Sainam,

153
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,600
I can be a Thai traditional girl myself.

154
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,520
Sainam...

155
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,720
is exploiting Sungmin.

156
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Big Bro Sungmin, please help me.

157
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
This is really important to all of us.

158
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,000
Mr. Sainam said we'd fail our training.

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,720
Please.

160
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Please.

161
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,120
Please...

162
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,720
No!

163
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,880
- Please.
- No!

164
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,000
Whoa!

165
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,760
What are you doing?

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,520
"Pyeha!"

167
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
Help us.

168
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,240
Help us.

169
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,720
Your Majesty.

170
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Please help us.

171
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,440
Sungmin...

172
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
is not an emperor.

173
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,840
Don't do this.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
Please help us.

175
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,200
Please save us, Your Majesty.

176
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,840
Please save us, Your Majesty.

177
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,360
Okay.

178
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,840
Sungmin...

179
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,240
will help you.

180
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,480
But...

181
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,440
But...

182
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,880
Do I look gorgeous?

183
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
- Whoa!
- What are you "whoaing" for, guys?

184
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,480
You scared me for a second.

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
People these days don't see beauty on the inside.

186
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,960
Is that right, Mr. Sainam?

187
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,320
Where are Dinneaw and the others?

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,760
They're probably making preparations.

189
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,360
It's unlikely they'll be here in time.

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,000
On the other hand, I've been ready since late afternoon.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm all dressed up, ready to go.

192
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
You can use me instead.

193
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,840
Why would you need those boys?

194
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,640
I gave those guys so little time.

195
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,640
I knew they couldn't have done it.

196
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,840
I just wanted to test their capabilities.

197
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,480
I'll go and check them out for you then.

198
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,200
All eyes on us.

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,480
These are the most expensive flowers...

200
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,880
of Na Tree Tara.

201
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,840
Applause!

202
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,760
They made it in time.

203
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,000
It was okay.

204
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,120
Oh...

205
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,840
My neck hurts.

206
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,360
Me too.

207
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
My ears hurt too.

208
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,600
Oh?

209
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Why are...

210
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,600
you guys still in costume?

211
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,000
We wanted to take more photos.

212
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
It's not often we get a chance to dress up.

213
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,000
Right?

214
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,840
Yeah.

215
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,480
Thank you too, Sungmin.

216
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,440
You're welcome.

217
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you all so much.

218
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Thank you.

219
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,480
Yeah.

220
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,720
We're leaving now. See you tomorrow.

221
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
See ya.

222
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,640
Bye.

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,760
Hungry?

224
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
I was too focused on work...

225
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
I forgot to eat.

226
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,240
Then come with me...

227
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,280
Come and eat with Sungmin.

228
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,520
Sungmin will order room service.

229
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,800
Look.

230
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,640
Dinneaw's taken care of.

231
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
Let's go, shall we?

232
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
Come on.

233
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,160
Eat up.

234
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Yes, Mr. Sainam.

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,640
Okay.

236
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
I'll see you at the pool.

237
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,680
Mr. Sainam said it's urgent.

238
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
Dinneaw is hungry.

239
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,200
It's fine.

240
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,400
Just save some for me.

241
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
I'll come back to eat later.

242
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,760
You can eat without me.

243
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,440
"Kasalong!"

244
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
"I want curry with clams!"

245
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
"You can't have it today!"

246
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
"You dare disobey me!"

247
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
"Why can't I?"

248
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
Actually...

249
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,720
when you're dressed like this,

250
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,240
you look like your mom.

251
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
And you...

252
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,720
look like Madam Funny.

253
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,960
It's nice to be in costume sometimes.

254
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,520
And we're both Thai ladies.

255
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,440
You like it? It's a change of pace.

256
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,480
Don't you get bored...

257
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,960
doing it with only me?

258
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,720
Isn't that a good thing?

259
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Staying faithful to one person all your life?

260
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,720
You're my first

261
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,480
and my only one.

262
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,640
And it will stay that way for life.

263
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,720
Let me stay like this for a while.

264
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,160
Yeah.

265
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,720
Why has Dinneaw...

266
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,240
never noticed that I like him?

267
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
I've known him since we were little.

268
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,240
You know it. Why would you ask?

269
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
Why would you still have your eyes on him?

270
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,000
You can consider someone else...

271
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,240
that's not me.

272
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Will you consider someone else then?

273
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,960
We both share the same feelings.

274
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,080
Love is hard.

275
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,720
Honestly,

276
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,240
I don't really know...

277
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,240
which hurts more.

278
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
I'm with you right here,

279
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,720
but your heart's never been with me.

280
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,000
Dinneaw.

281
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,400
Do you know how well you did today?

282
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,760
Our guests gave you a lot of praise.

283
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,280
Thanks.

284
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,960
You called me here...

285
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,040
for work?

286
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,280
No.

287
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
I just want to do a Loy Krathong with you, just the two of us.

288
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,520
Do it with me.

289
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,760
Let's do it.

290
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Come on.

291
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,000
How was work today?

292
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,720
It was fun.

293
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
Sungmin was really kind.

294
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,040
Thank you.

295
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,880
Come on.

296
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,040
Let's make a wish.

297
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,760
Close your eyes completely, okay?

298
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,560
Okay.

299
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,440
Hold this.

300
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,320
Dinneaw.

301
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
What did you wish from the Goddess Ganga?

302
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,960
I didn't wish for anything.

303
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,640
But I did.

304
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,960
I wished for...

305
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,280
Dinneaw!

306
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,280
Dinneaw?

307
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,760
Dinneaw!

308
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,000
Dinneaw!

309
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
Dinneaw!

310
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,240
Dinneaw!

311
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,320
Dinneaw!

312
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,640
Dinneaw!

313
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,520
Dinneaw?

314
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,720
Dinneaw!

315
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,640
Dinneaw?

316
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,520
Dinneaw!

317
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,640
Are you okay?

318
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,320
Sungmin?

319
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm sorry.

320
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
You okay?

321
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,800
(*inaudible)

322
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,560
Are you okay?

323
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,760
Thank you.

324
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm feeling better now.

325
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,000
I'll go back to sleep in my room.

326
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,680
You can't!

327
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,480
Why can't I?

328
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,400
This is your room.

329
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,040
You need to sleep well.

330
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,640
Sungmin horried..

331
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,720
"Worried."

332
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,560
Stay with Sungmin.

333
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Here.

334
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,480
Dinneaw is sick?

335
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,640
Is this nice and warm?

336
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,480
So...

337
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,920
why have you come to Thailand?

338
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
Well...

339
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,640
Sungmin...

340
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
doesn't want to tell.

341
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,640
Why don't you want to tell me?

342
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Are you afraid I'd hate you?

343
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,160
You've been my best friend.

344
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,080
Friends?

345
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,160
Friends don't cuddle like this.

346
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,880
Sungmin?

347
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,480
Sungmin!

348
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Sungmin!

349
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,280
Did you have a bad dream?

350
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Med.

351
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,160
Med?

352
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,520
My head hurts.

353
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,000
My head hurts.

354
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,400
Med.

355
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,000
Put my med in water.

356
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,480
Your medicine.

357
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,040
Drink it up.

358
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,480
Feeling better?

359
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,080
What's causing your headache, Sungmin?

360
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,760
Migraine.

361
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,560
Migraine?

362
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,040
This is not medicine for Migraine, is it?

363
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,159
Well...

364
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,760
Sungmin...

365
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,880
wants to sleep.

366
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,120
Easy.

367
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,560
Dinneaw.

368
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,080
How are you?

369
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,840
Do you have a headache or fever?

370
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,160
Can you work? If you can't, you can take a day off.

371
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,120
So many questions.

372
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,680
What should I answer first?

373
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,160
You can answer any one.

374
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,440
It's up to you.

375
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm feeling okay.

376
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,600
I collapsed last night probably because I didn't eat.

377
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I'm sorry for making you work too hard.

378
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,360
It's fine. It was my fault I didn't manage my time.

379
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,280
Dinneaw.

380
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
I like you.

381
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,960
Would you give me a chance to be there for you?

382
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,560
Thank you for everything, Mr. Sainam.

383
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,520
You support my mom's products.

384
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,120
You gave me an opportunity to work here.

385
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,680
Can I trade a "thank you"...

386
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,120
for a "yes"?

387
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,920
I'm waiting to hear that.

388
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,280
I'm sorry.

389
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,480
I already have someone in mind.

390
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,680
Is it Sungmin?

391
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,400
I gotta go now.

392
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,680
Oh?

393
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,440
Dinneaw?

394
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,000
Your headache is gone?

395
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,560
Well...

396
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Yeah.

397
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,160
Where are you going on Friday?

398
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,160
I noticed you're checking out on Wednesday.

399
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,360
Well...

400
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,840
I travel with friends.

401
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,080
Next Friday, my friends and I have a completion ceremony.

402
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,880
Everyone's family will be here.

403
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,320
But...

404
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,400
I don't think my mom can come.

405
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,120
Completion ceremony?

406
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,280
I'll get a certificate.

407
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,360
Forget it.

408
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm going to bed.

409
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,000
I have an early day tomorronw.

410
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,160
Check out, please.

411
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,520
Okay. I'll take care of it.

412
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,440
Please be safe.

413
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,560
We all have to thank you, Pony.

414
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,960
Sadhu.

415
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,000
Can you bless us?

416
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,920
What?

417
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,000
You tied me up like a dead body and asked for my blessing?

418
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,880
- Huh? You...
- Whoa!

419
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,160
You brats...

420
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,000
- I'll get you...
- What's wrong?

421
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,120
Hello.

422
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,800
Come on.

423
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,480
It's okay, Mom.

424
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,320
I know you want to come.

425
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,120
Tor and Pop's families aren't coming either.

426
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,480
We'll be family to each other.

427
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,040
I miss you too, Mom.

428
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,560
I want to come home and give you a hug soon.

429
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,800
Bye.

430
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,520
Our training program...

431
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,080
is the beginning of success.

432
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,640
I got to where I am today because of our training program.

433
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
That's why today,

434
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,120
I want to congratulate all of our trainees.

435
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:19,080
Na Tree Tara.

436
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,520
Next, please welcome Mr. Sainam,

437
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,840
our CEOABCDEF,

438
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,080
Na Tree Tara's executive!

439
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,840
First up,

440
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,280
Mr. Thanphisit Lapsamritphon.

441
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,640
Mr. Tharin Preechachaisurat.

442
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,880
Mr. Ratchanon Kanpriang.

443
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,680
Mr. Chaloemdet Thammawut.

444
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,880
Mr. Dinneaw Eamsa-ad.

445
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,400
Dinneaw, here.

446
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,120
Here.

447
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,040
Pony!

448
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,400
Sungmin?

449
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,320
Hana.

450
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
Are you cheating on me?

451
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,880
My friend.

452
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,360
Not boyfriend.

453
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,920
If there's nothing,

454
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,360
then don't kiss.

455
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,120
Dinneaw?

456
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,480
If you want to make up with Dinneaw,

457
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,520
make an effort.

458
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,880
What's wrong with you, Tor?

459
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,480
We're friends.

460
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,200
Will you give me a chance?

461
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,440
So you like me?
