1
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,360
What?

2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,960
"We need to host a Loy Krathong event this evening?

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,800
Big Bro Sangmin, please help me.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
All eyes on us.

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,000
These are the most expensive flowers...

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,520
of Na Tree Tara.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,320
So...

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,600
why have you come to Thailand?

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,880
Dinneaw.

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
I like you.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,320
Next Friday, I have a completion ceremony.

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,720
I don't think my mom can come.

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,160
"Congratulations.

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,080
Dinneaw."

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,520
Huh?

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
"Dinneaw?"

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Is this your handwriting?

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,680
Yes.

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh.

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,440
Umm.

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,960
Thank you.

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
Sangmin, you're the best.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,240
Dinneaw is happy.

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,800
Sangmin is glad.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,800
Ah...

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,800
Ugh...

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,080
Ugh...

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
- Ugh...   - Oh?

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,520
- Ugh...   - What's wrong?

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,240
Nothing.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
Nothing.

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Promise?

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,400
That's all you keep saying.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,120
Where do you want to go?

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,320
Huh?

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
Promise?

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Promise.

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Oh!

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,160
A kite!

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,280
What's it called in Thai?

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,440
"Wao".

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
- "Wao?"   - "Wao."

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,600
Wao.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,440
Sangmin, have you ever played a kite?

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,200
I have.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,920
Sangmin likes flying a kite.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400
When I was young,

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,440
I really liked stroking a kite's handle.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
When the kite catches the wind,

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,840
you have to stroke it harder.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,160
It feels so good.

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,280
Umm...

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,640
I don't get it.

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,040
Oh...

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,880
When the kite catches the wind,

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,720
you have to stroke it more.

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,320
- Stroke it?   - To keep it from falling down.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Ah!

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,440
Does it feel good?

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,920
It feels great.

61
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Let's fly a kite, shall we?

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,560
Yes.

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,160
Dinneaw strokes...

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,040
Sangmin's kite.

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,880
Oh!

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,600
Wow!

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
How's that?

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,400
That's high.

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,600
Whoa!

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
There.

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,000
So...

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,040
we'll be staying here?

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,839
This is my friend's resort.

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,040
It's been a long time.

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,880
What does that mean?

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh?

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Long time.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,040
It's been a long time since you were here.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,960
I missed it.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,280
Let's go.

81
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,080
Come on.

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,880
Ready to serve!

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,880
Go!

84
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,760
Steady.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Your hands must be steady when serving coffee.

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,760
Whoa!

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,640
Why are you shaking like a man possessed?

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
Well...

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,640
I...

90
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,720
I...

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,200
- Well...   - Just tell Miss Hana what you did.

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Hey! Don't call me Miss.

93
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
Call me Noona.

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
It means Big Sis.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Understood?

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Yes, Noona.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Yes.

98
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Gosh!

99
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
This new staff...

100
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,760
is looking sus.

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,400
Your hands are shaking so hard.

102
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,640
That couldn't have been a regular exercise.

103
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,520
Riktor.

104
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,760
Tell me.

105
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,960
What did you do?

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Riktor!

107
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,520
Hey! Hey, Rik!

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,080
I think you're too obsessed with this thing, Rik.

109
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,960
You have to try abstinence. Like a Vegetarian Festival or something.

110
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,760
Eat some veggies.

111
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,280
I've always been this way.

112
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,280
Why do I have to change all of a sudden?

113
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,840
I just wanna cuddle sometimes.

114
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,760
You can't.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,400
Just seeing your face...

116
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,160
turns me on.

117
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,840
Hey!

118
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,280
Oh yeah!

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,960
I have a pimple on my butt.

120
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
I saw a doctor.

121
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,080
He said I can't do it for a week.

122
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,640
After it heals,

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,080
I have to do it less often.

124
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,440
Let me see.

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,840
Hey, Rik! No. It hurts.

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,280
It hurts, Rik.

127
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,640
Did I cause that?

128
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
If not you, then who?

129
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,200
I think you need to try abstinence. Maybe you can focus on work more.

130
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,400
Can I jerk off then?

131
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,080
No!

132
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,400
You know what?

133
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,520
If you can last until I heal,

134
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,880
I'll give you a special reward.

135
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,640
What is it?

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,400
A special position.

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,520
Any position you want.

138
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,840
I'll do anything.

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Okay?

140
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Yeah, fine.

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,640
Okay?

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay.

143
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Rik, what are you doing?

144
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
Whoa!

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,920
Are you nearly done? Can you just come out?

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,120
Almost done.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
Hurry up, Rik!

148
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,840
Yeah! Anytime now.

149
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
I can't hold it anymore.

150
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,720
Anytime now.

151
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Hurry up, Rik.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,520
What's on your face?

153
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,559
Did you masturbate?

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,799
It's my face mask.

155
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,160
What are you looking at? Don't you need to piss? Just get in there.

156
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,640
Hey...

157
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,680
Oh gosh, gosh, gosh! Oh no, no no!

158
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,400
"Oh gosh, gosh, gosh! Oh no, no no!"

159
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,280
Sangmin?

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Hana.

161
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,520
Oh!

162
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
I thought I wouldn't get to see you, Sangmin.

163
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,920
- Oh, Dinneaw?   - Dinneaw!

164
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
I didn't expect to see you here.

165
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,280
Who's that woman?

166
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,520
Oh...

167
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,000
Hello.

168
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Welcome to Sarang Resort. My name is Hana.

169
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,280
What is your name?

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,160
My name is Dinneaw.

171
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Dinneaw?

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,760
Well, Sangmin.

173
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,040
You took your handsome boyfriend to a resort alone.

174
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,520
Are you cheating on me?

175
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,400
No.

176
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
My friend.

177
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,640
Not boyfriend.

178
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,560
That's good.

179
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,240
I won't get jealous then.

180
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,280
Guy, Riktor.

181
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,520
Give our guest a welcome.

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,400
Oh.

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,680
Well to cum...

184
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey!

185
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,640
Is your tongue twisted too?

186
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,680
Welcome to Sarang Resort, pal.

187
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,920
Guy, Riktor, go and take our guest's luggage.

188
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,800
Yes, Ma'am.

189
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Come on. I'll take you to your room.

190
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,120
How is your head?

191
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,160
Are you okay?

192
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
Yeah.

193
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm okay.

194
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,640
My dad is so worried about you.

195
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,560
Next time,

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,520
let my dad give you a check up.

197
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Okay?

198
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
Got it.

199
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
What are they talking about?

200
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,880
All I could understand is "gwenchana...

201
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,000
teng neng neng neng."

202
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,560
The woman called Hana...

203
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,400
is lovely, right?

204
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,360
Yeah.

205
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,560
She's lovely.

206
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,480
Sangmin's friend...

207
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
is lovely.

208
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,520
If she's that lovely,

209
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
why don't you hit on her?

210
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,280
Hmm. No.

211
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,160
Are you already dating?

212
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,480
Here's your luggage!

213
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
Come in.

214
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Ugh!

215
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,560
All right.

216
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,560
Here.

217
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Here's some brownies, a special welcome snack from Sarang Resort.

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,920
Special?

219
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,800
Do you give this out to every room?

220
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,400
It's a special gift from Miss Hana to Sangmin.

221
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,160
Oh?

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,760
Hana only gives this to Sangmin.

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,920
Does the woman called Hana...

224
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
have a boyfriend?

225
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,760
With a mouth like Noona's, she probably has no one.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,560
Don't worry.

227
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,400
Hey!

228
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,280
You just got this job! You wanna get fired?

229
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,240
Dinneaw.

230
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,560
If you need anything, call us.

231
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,760
Okay, guys.

232
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
- We're off. See ya.   - See ya.

233
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
- See ya.   - Come on.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,640
Brownies?

235
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Special gift from Hana.

236
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,400
To you, Sangmin.

237
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,760
Oh?

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
It's delicious.

239
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Sangmin likes it.

240
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,640
You like the brownies...

241
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
or the one who gives it to you?

242
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
Maybe...

243
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
you like the one who gives it to you.

244
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
Umm...

245
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,280
The one who gives it?

246
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,680
I like too.

247
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
If you like her, sleep with her then.

248
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,640
Dinneaw, try this.

249
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,680
Brownie...

250
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,160
is really good.

251
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,760
It's from a stranger. I don't want it.

252
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Hey.

253
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,640
Where are you going?

254
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,880
I can go anywhere. I'm an adult.

255
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,520
Hey, wait, wait.

256
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,760
Try it.

257
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
It's good.

258
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,040
One cup of cappucino, please.

259
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,360
Miss Hana,

261
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,880
it seems like you and Sangmin are close.

262
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,040
Sangmin and I went to the same school in Korea.

263
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,760
He's my best friend.

264
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,880
You're too close...

265
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,760
for a friend.

266
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,280
If I'm not a friend,

267
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,120
what can I be?

268
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,160
Another cup, just like this, please.

269
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Yes, sir.

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,160
Here's your cappucino.

271
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
It's not the same.

272
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,160
You ordered a cappucino, right?

273
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,760
Sangmin!

274
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,680
Have you had a coffee? I'll make one for you.

275
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Sit down.

276
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
You don't have to.

277
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,160
I ordered one for him.

278
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Sangmin.

279
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Which cup would you like?

280
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,760
Oh...

281
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,040
I...

282
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,760
It's fitting that Sangmin chooses the heart,

283
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,920
because...

284
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,040
the flower is more like you.

285
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,480
It's more like you.

286
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,240
Hmph.

287
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,760
Here. You can have it.

288
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,760
Hmph.

289
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,920
Yeah, it's like me, indeed.

290
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,000
Sangmin.

291
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,760
Let's go swimming this evening.

292
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,800
Swimming?

293
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,360
Yeah.

294
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,040
Yeah.

295
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Sangmin likes swimming.

296
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
Dinneaw.

297
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
Can you swim?

298
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,480
Do you still need a swim ring?

299
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,720
My house is on the riverside.

300
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,839
Of course I can swim.

301
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,079
But Dinneaw...

302
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,760
drowned just days ago.

303
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,839
It's because I fainted.

304
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,920
Perfect. See you guys tonight.

305
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,720
I'll be in an extra sexy swimsuit.

306
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,920
Sangmin, wait til you see me.

307
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,359
Whoa! This is so much fun!

308
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Hi! I'm here.

309
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,520
Am I sexy?

310
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,680
Ah!

311
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,000
Is that called sexy?

312
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,600
Hana is drunk.

313
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm not drunk!

314
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Who said I'm drunk? I'm gonna slap them!

315
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
I will!

316
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,280
Miss Hana is drunk! What should we do?

317
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,520
Oh! Guy, Riktor!

318
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,240
Oh...

319
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,200
What should we do?

320
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,320
Ah!

321
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,320
Well...

322
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,800
Guy, Riktor!

323
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,960
Come here.

324
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,240
Swim with me!

325
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,760
No! Noona!

326
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,200
No! Let go!

327
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,280
- Ah!   - No!

328
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,080
Oh!

329
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,960
Hey!

330
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,920
You guys...

331
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,280
Come swimming with me now!

332
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,040
- No!   - Swim with me!

333
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,840
Hey!

334
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
No, Noona!

335
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,480
- Noona!   - Guy, Riktor!

336
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,720
Oops!

337
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,280
- Come on! Let's go!   - Swim with me!

338
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,760
Ah!

339
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,760
- Swim...   - No...

340
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
Come back!

341
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Won't you go after her?

342
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,440
Your girlfriend is gonna misunderstand.

343
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,000
Hana...

344
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,360
is not my girlfriend.

345
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,280
If she's not,

346
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,760
just ask her out.

347
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,760
Aren't you close?

348
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,800
Sangmin...

349
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
doesn't like Hana.

350
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,680
So who do you like?

351
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,040
Hmm?

352
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
If there's nothing,

353
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,240
then don't kiss.

354
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,440
Umm...

355
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,040
Hey!

356
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,600
"Jan."

357
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,760
Yeah.

358
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,600
"Jan."

359
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,120
Hey.

360
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
Hey.

361
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,720
Uh-uh.

362
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,680
Can I kiss you?

363
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm sleeping. Don't bother me.

364
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,600
Sleeping?

365
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,360
How did you answer?

366
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,960
Darn it! I shouldn't have.

367
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,520
Good night.

368
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,040
We're not dating.

369
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,760
Why would you ask to kiss me?

370
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,040
We're not dating

371
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
but we can kiss.

372
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Hmm...

373
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,760
Here.

374
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,680
Here.

375
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,080
Here.

376
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,560
Umm...

377
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,440
How did you get these scars?

378
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,520
Do you have tattoos?

379
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Why did you get them?

380
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,800
To forget...

381
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,360
my pain.

382
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,320
I'll help you forget your pain myself.

383
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Ugh!

384
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,800
So...

385
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,520
you really are happy,

386
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
my dear friend.

387
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,760
Are you sober now?

388
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,000
So...

389
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,040
did you sleep with him?

390
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,760
So...

391
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,800
is he the one you want to be with?

392
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,840
Yeah.

393
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,280
Sangmin?

394
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,280
Yeah.

395
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,760
You've already fallen for him, right?

396
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,600
He seems...

397
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
to like you too.

398
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,960
That's why I tried to make him jealous.

399
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,320
And it worked.

400
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,000
You already know.

401
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,840
I shouldn't be in love.

402
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,520
This is bad.

403
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,520
Love...

404
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,560
is so difficult.

405
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,560
That's love.

406
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,000
It's just how it is.

407
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,520
Sometimes, you're happy.

408
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,240
Sometimes, you're tired.

409
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,480
That's because...

410
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,840
it's love.

411
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,520
Sangmin.

412
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
It's okay.

413
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
It's okay.

414
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
It's okay.

415
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,440
Dinneaw.

416
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,480
Dinneaw, listen to me, Dinneaw.

417
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,120
Dinneaw, listen to me. Let me explain.

418
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,880
It's nothing serious.

419
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,560
You two are in love. It's...

420
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,560
not wrong, right?

421
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,080
We're not dating anyway.

422
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,240
Is that right?

423
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Sangmin?

424
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,520
I...

425
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,640
Yeah.

426
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,200
Yeah.

427
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,360
See?

428
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,280
I wish you two...

429
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,560
a long lasting love.

430
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,720
Dinneaw!

431
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,520
Dinneaw!

432
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,040
Listen to me! Listen to me please!

433
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,800
Dinneaw, would you listen to me?

434
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,200
Why didn't you say something?

435
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,840
He's got it all wrong!

436
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,560
How did this happen?

437
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,040
Hello, Dinneaw?

438
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,040
It's hurting so much.

439
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,000
Sangmin did it, right?

440
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,680
Do you need me to come?

441
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,160
If you ask,

442
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,360
I'll be right there.

443
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
Can you come?

444
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
See you tomorrow.

445
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,320
Tap!

446
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,159
Ouch.

447
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,239
It hurts.

448
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,760
It hurts.

449
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,520
Ugh.

450
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,600
Why didn't you say something?

451
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Freaking mosquitoes!

452
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,960
Freaking mosquitoes!

453
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,600
(You took your handsome boyfriend to a resort alone.)

454
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,400
Are you cheating on me?

455
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,440
My friend.

456
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,000
Not boyfriend.

457
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,520
Psst.

458
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,240
You two are in love. It's...

459
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,160
not wrong.

460
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,200
We're not dating anyway.

461
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
Is that right, Sangmin?

462
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
What's causing your headache, Sangmin?

463
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,640
Migraine.

464
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
This is not medicine for Migraine, is it?

465
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,160
So...

466
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,360
why have you come to Thailand?

467
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,480
Oh.

468
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,320
That's Sangmin.

469
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Oh.

470
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,400
Arthit.

471
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,720
Why are you sleeping here?

472
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,520
Ah...

473
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,040
Ugh.

474
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Had a fight with...

475
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,160
Dinneaw.

476
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,160
So he kicked you out?

477
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,040
Yeah.

478
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,040
Let's see Dinneaw.

479
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,440
What about him?

480
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,200
He made our friend cry.

481
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,760
Just leave him here.

482
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah...

483
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,680
Well...

484
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,680
I'll be with Sangmin.

485
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,080
We should listen to both sides.

486
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,440
Suit yourself.

487
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,520
Prepare for interrogation, Sangmin.

488
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,360
How are you feeling?

489
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,360
Your eyes are so red.

490
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,600
It's just as I told you last night.

491
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,560
Just now,

492
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,880
we saw Sangmin in a tent.

493
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,760
He's covered in mosquito bites.

494
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,120
I don't think he wanted to see Hana.

495
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,560
If he really likes her,

496
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,960
right now,

497
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
he would be in Hana's arms.

498
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,040
He's just still feeling guilty.

499
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,360
He will go be with her.

500
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,080
Maybe,

501
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,160
it was a misunderstanding.

502
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,480
Sangmin seems to like you.

503
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,920
He does anything you say.

504
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,560
Who would be crazy enough to cross dress multiple times...

505
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,680
if it wasn't for someone he likes?

506
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,960
As for...

507
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,960
Sangmin's medicine...

508
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,480
that you asked me to search,

509
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,760
there actually are fizzy tablets...

510
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,760
for people with Migraine.

511
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,640
But that brand is not sold in Thailand,

512
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,320
and not sold in Korea.

513
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,640
It's probably for something else.

514
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,760
Did I overthink things?

515
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,400
So it could be just Migraine.

516
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,560
You still care.

517
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,120
That means...

518
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,880
you're willing to talk things through.

519
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,200
Last night,

520
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,840
maybe it was all in my head.

521
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,360
You got bitten all over.

522
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,240
Ah...

523
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,560
Let me see.

524
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,880
Wow.

525
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,640
This is no good.

526
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,560
This will hurt a little.

527
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,200
Nobody likes indecisiveness.

528
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,360
You were holding him.

529
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,760
What else would he think?

530
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,080
I was consoling Sangmin.

531
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
He was troubled.

532
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,480
Why did he need consolation?

533
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,560
Things were going well between him and Dinneaw.

534
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Sangmin and I are friends.

535
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,000
My father is his doctor.

536
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,760
What doctor?

537
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,880
I...

538
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,840
Well...

539
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,240
Dinneaw is angry.

540
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,440
Please help Sangmin.

541
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
All you need to do is tell him the truth.

542
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,960
Dinneaw is really upset with me.

543
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
He won't talk to me at all.

544
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,680
I...

545
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,360
tried to talk to him.

546
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,760
Hmm...

547
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,320
If you want to make up with Dinneaw,

548
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,360
make an effort.

549
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,600
I know how to.

550
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,240
Whoa!

551
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,120
I thought you were Korean!

552
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh?

553
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,240
Who am I?

554
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm Arthit, the owner of a classic herbal liquor bar.

555
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,840
Drink one each.

556
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,680
That's all?

557
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,960
Here. Pork belly.

558
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,960
With fatty parts.

559
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,520
That's Dinneaw's favorite.

560
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,320
What?

561
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,720
You guys are spoiling me today.

562
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,480
Oh?

563
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,680
We just want you to be happy.

564
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,680
Are we wrong?

565
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,320
Dinneaw, eat this.

566
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,320
Sangmin grilled it.

567
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,040
Dinneaw.

568
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,680
I cut some apple for you.

569
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,480
Why would you?

570
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,320
We're still eating meat.

571
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,760
Do you want me to finish my meal already?

572
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,080
Apple in Korean...

573
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,560
is "sagwa".

574
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
Sorry in Korean...

575
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,640
is "sagwa" too.

576
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,640
Do Koreans use an apple as an apology?

577
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,040
I just want to apologize to Dinneaw.

578
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,920
I just...

579
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,200
did a prank by getting close to Sangmin.

580
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
I didn't think you'd be upset for real.

581
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,600
I mean...

582
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,600
I thought...

583
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,000
you were friends, so you wouldn't be jealous.

584
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,960
It's okay.

585
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,560
We're really not dating.

586
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,160
Then why don't you start now?

587
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,360
Just make it official.

588
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,440
Let's get this over with.

589
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,080
Sometimes,

590
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,160
being indecisive has its perks.

591
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,000
You can remain friends,

592
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,680
so you will never break up.

593
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,640
That's right.

594
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,320
But sometimes, indecisiveness makes you feel lost.

595
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,840
You're not friends, yet you're not exactly a couple.

596
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
That's right.

597
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,960
Lost? What do you mean?

598
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,440
Well...

599
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,920
Sometimes you're happy. Sometimes you're not.

600
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,240
How are you feeling lost, Pop?

601
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,240
You and Tor seem to be a loving couple.

602
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,880
What loving?

603
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,040
Tor doesn't like me.

604
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,080
- He likes...   - Shut up, Pop!

605
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,040
I need to use the bathroom.

606
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,080
Tor!

607
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,600
What's wrong with you?

608
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,480
What's wrong with you, Tor?

609
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,960
You suddenly lashed out at Pop.

610
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,360
You don't have to know.

611
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,600
It's for the best.

612
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,640
Hey.

613
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,640
We're friends.

614
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,000
You can tell me.

615
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,680
This is...

616
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,440
something you shouldn't know.

617
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,040
If you know,

618
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,360
you and I may not be friends anymore.

619
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,200
Why not?

620
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,200
If I tell you,

621
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,000
will you give me a chance?

622
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,680
Or...

623
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,400
you only have...

624
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,960
Sangmin.

625
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,880
So you like me?

626
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,520
"Jan."

627
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,440
"Jan!"

628
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,120
"Jan."

629
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,080
"Jan."

630
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,680
Is Tor okay?

631
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,920
He's okay.

632
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,240
Ugh...

633
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,200
Ah...

634
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,120
Sangmin.

635
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,120
Ugh...

636
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,560
Sangmin?

637
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,000
Where's your med?

638
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,640
It's...

639
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,640
Where's your med?

640
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,080
In the room.

641
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,160
In the room.

642
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Guy, Riktor.

643
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,520
Go get the medicine in Sangmin's room.

644
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,040
- Yes!   - Go get it.

645
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,760
- Ugh...   - You okay?

646
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,640
Ah...

647
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,360
What's wrong?

648
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,400
What's wrong?

649
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,560
He's having a headache.

650
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,840
Look over there.

651
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,520
Where the heck is that med? It's not here.

652
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,200
Hey.

653
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,400
I found it.

654
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
What's wrong with Sangmin?

655
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,560
Why does he have a severe headache?

656
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,040
Yeah.

657
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,160
It looks worrying.

658
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,000
I'll bet Miss Hana knows what's wrong with him.

659
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,560
Yeah. They're friends. Of course she knows.

660
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,520
Rik.

661
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,120
If someday I get sick,

662
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,840
don't leave me, okay?

663
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,720
I won't leave you.

664
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,760
But I would ask you one thing.

665
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,520
What is it?

666
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,760
Let me jerk off please.

667
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,440
I can't hold it in anymore.

668
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,760
Why are you talking about this now?

669
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,560
I never knew...

670
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,560
that you liked me.

671
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,840
Why would you know?

672
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,920
I've been hiding it all this time.

673
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,080
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,880
Are you sorry...

675
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,680
that you can't give me a chance?

676
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,520
Because you...

677
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,520
still like Sangmin.

678
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,680
Well...

679
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,480
I...

680
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,760
Don't waste your time then.

681
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,040
Just get with him already.

682
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,640
Don't worry about me.

683
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,040
I can live.

684
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,920
I don't know.

685
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,080
Sangmin is indecisive.

686
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,760
Sometimes...

687
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,920
he acts like we're a couple.

688
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,560
But...

689
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,360
sometimes...

690
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,960
he acts like he doesn't want me.

691
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,200
He probably has a reason...

692
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,600
that he couldn't tell you.

693
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,600
Like me.

694
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,040
I didn't want to tell you because...

695
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,960
I was afraid to lose a friend.

696
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,000
Why?

697
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,640
What could be his reason?

698
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,080
I'm okay with anything.

699
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,960
I'm grown up.

700
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,160
Whether you're okay or not...

701
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,720
doesn't matter.

702
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,160
Everyone that loves you...

703
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,160
doesn't want to see you sad.

704
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,040
Ah...

705
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,640
Ah...

706
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,080
Ah...

707
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,200
I think...

708
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,040
you should tell everyone what's wrong with you.

709
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,560
No.

710
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,360
Don't tell anyone.

711
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,040
How do you think it helps...

712
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,440
if you don't tell anyone?

713
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,320
If I find out later,

714
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,520
I'd be even sadder.

715
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,000
At least,

716
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,600
before you find out,

717
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,040
you can still smile.

718
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,360
That's like playing me for a fool.

719
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,720
Did you...

720
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,840
feel like I played you for a fool?

721
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,720
Or...

722
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,680
do you feel deep down...

723
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,640
that it's better not to know?

724
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,560
Don't think that way, Tor.

725
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,560
You are my friend.

726
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,080
Life...

727
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,840
is too short to worry about indecisiveness.

728
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,080
Who's there?

729
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,720
A thief.

730
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,120
Look.

731
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,040
Get everyone here.

732
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,040
I'll stall him.

733
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,880
Hey.

734
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,080
What are you doing?

735
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,960
Stay away.

736
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,080
Tonight is a critical night for my father.

737
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,040
If I don't get the money,

738
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,640
my father in hospital...

739
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,440
I...

740
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,160
I understand how you feel.

741
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,080
Things are getting expensive these days.

742
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,640
Everything is more expensive than ever.

743
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,040
Fruits are more expensive.

744
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,400
Everything costs more money.

745
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,360
The only thing that stays the same...

746
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,720
is our wage.

747
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Life is hard.

748
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,960
If you understand, pretend you don't see a thing.

749
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,640
Why would you stop me?

750
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,080
If you get caught,

751
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,720
who would take care of your father?

752
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,200
You can turn back now.

753
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,120
It's not too late.

754
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,400
I can't turn back now.

755
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,720
You think I want to do this?

756
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,040
I don't have money!

757
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,640
How much do you need?

758
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,520
I'm gonna help you.

759
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,560
Guys!

760
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,160
A thief just broke in. Dinneaw is stalling him. We need to help!

761
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,520
A thief...

762
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,840
- Really?   - Dinneaw!

763
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,880
- This way!   - Be careful!

764
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,320
Sangmin, be careful.

765
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,000
A kid like you?

766
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,440
How can you help me?

767
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,440
A kid like me...

768
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,960
can help you.

769
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,120
You think others would help you?

770
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,640
They probably...

771
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,120
won't trust you at all.

772
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,520
I don't believe you!

773
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,880
My dad...

774
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,640
died of an illness years ago.

775
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,600
That's why I know how you feel.

776
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,760
I know...

777
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,120
that a farewell...

778
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,000
makes you afraid.

779
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,560
My mom and I...

780
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,520
traveled from Ayuddhaya through Sing Buri,

781
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,360
Chai Nat, Nakhon Sawan, Kamphaeng Phet,

782
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,080
Tak,

783
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,920
Lampang, Phayao,

784
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,840
all the way to Chiang Rai. That's over 800 kilos.

785
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,400
We went to see my dad.

786
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,600
We had to work hard...

787
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,640
to pay for his treatment.

788
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,080
Bastard.

789
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,120
Sounds like your life's hard, right?

790
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,560
Yeah, it's hard.

791
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,240
That's why I understand you.

792
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,400
Please put down your knife.

793
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,040
Let's figure this out together.

794
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,760
And if...

795
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,200
I die,

796
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,520
everyone will be sad.

797
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,040
Your father will be sad.

798
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,680
He would feel the guilt of you becoming a killer.

799
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,920
- Dinneaw!   - Dinneaw!

800
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,880
You thief!

801
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,080
I'm gonna call the cops on you!

802
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,120
Hey!

803
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,960
Hey.

804
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,040
Stop!

805
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,560
No!

806
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,560
Hana.

807
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,120
It's come this far.

808
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,240
Just tell eveyone

809
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,320
what's wrong with Sangmin.

810
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't want to forget...

811
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,600
Mommy Orn.

812
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,040
Sangmin is really sick.

813
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,720
He never even thought about telling us, Mom.

814
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,960
Stay with me.

815
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,680
I'll take care of you.

816
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,160
I have something for you.

817
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,040
One for me,

818
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,960
and one for you.
