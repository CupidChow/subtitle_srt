1
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,440
Ah!

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,160
Dinneaw.

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
Last night,

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,240
did you get home safe?

5
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
We got home safe.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
Well, my boss, Mr. Sainam...

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
is the owner of Na Tree Tara

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,520
in Amphawa.

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
I got the job as a tour guide?

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,360
You're new guide?

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,320
Would you like to work somewhere else?

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,240
You're fired.

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,600
What does that mean?

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,039
Don't give up.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,720
If you don't want to give up,

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,720
why don't you come to work at my hotel?

17
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,640
Dinneaw must go with Sainam.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Oh!

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
This is your mom's vase.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
They're displaying it right here.

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,440
Are you guys trainees too?

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,320
Yeah. I'm Dinneaw.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,720
This is Tor.

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,039
That's Arthit.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm Riktor, and this is...

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
my boyfriend, Guy.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,320
The three of us look like...

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
the boys who work in the parking lot.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
But they're like...

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,840
real professional hotel staff.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
You're all here.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,640
Let me introduce you to...

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,480
Miss Pony.

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,160
She's the hotel's manager.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,600
She will be supervising you throughout your training.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,200
Good monring, all you guys.

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Welcome to...

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
our training program.

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
Good morning.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Your nails.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,320
You're working in a hotel.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
Why did you let your nails...

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,560
grow long...

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,040
and dirty?

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:57,920
Hey...

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,320
Well...

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
I'll take care of them soon.

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
Good.

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,320
Your shirt.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why is your shirt so wrinkly?

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,160
Why?

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,560
At this hotel,

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,320
even one wrinkle is not okay.

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,280
Understand?

55
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,880
Yes.

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
I'll buy an iron.

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,600
Good!

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
Oh!

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,720
Why does your shirt stink so much?

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Do you do your laundry at night?

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
Do you?

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,000
Redo all of your laundry!

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
I will.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,880
Your hair is long.

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,160
Very long.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Cut it short ASAP.

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,080
Yes. I'll get my hair cut soon.

68
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,520
Good.

69
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,959
Yeah.

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
This one looks good.

71
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,600
You're the only one that's neat and up to our standards.

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,080
At this hotel,

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,200
what's most important is...

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,640
you can't have bad breath.

75
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,760
Hahaha.

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,080
Let me tell you this.

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,280
Working with me is never easy.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
All you'll face is hardship.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,080
Are you ready to fight?

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,400
Will you fight?

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
We'll fight, Ma'am!

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,840
Will you fight?

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,400
We'll fight, Ma'am!

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,640
Your strictness is going to scare them all away, Pony.

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,520
Come on.

86
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
Mr. Sainam.

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,760
Mr. Sainam.

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm just too gorgeous and classy,

89
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
so I want our trainees...

90
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
to feel that my training...

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,040
is sacred.

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Is it sacred like a shrine, Ma'am?

93
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,840
If so, let's give our offerings for good luck.

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
You brat!

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,040
Remember this!

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,280
I'll be watching you!

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm scared now.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,400
Dinneaw.

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,080
I want you to be my assistant.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,520
What about my training?

101
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,080
Judging from your quick wit,

102
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,320
being a trainee is a waste of your time.

103
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,960
I want you as my thinking partner.

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Let's improve this hotel together.

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,440
I'd rather be a trainee.

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
If you become my assistant,

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,640
you will get more opportunities.

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,840
But...

109
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,280
I won't get to follow my dream.

110
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,040
I want to be a tour guide.

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,440
I'd meet more tourists as a trainee.

112
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,760
I can also recommend them Thailand's landmarks.

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
If that's the case,

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,880
you have to take me on your tour later.

115
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,040
Of course.

116
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
Open up, quick.

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,640
Hey!

118
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
Whoa!

119
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,640
Wow!

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
What's this?

121
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,280
How'd you like this?

122
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,040
- So soft.
- Agreed.

123
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,280
Is this your room?

124
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,400
It's ten times bigger than ours.

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,840
I bet Mr. Sainam is hitting on you.

126
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,640
What?

127
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,880
You're overthinking things.

128
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,080
Just go and take your break.

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,840
Wait.

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,520
- Pop!
- Let me see your toilet.

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,200
Don't be naughty.

132
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Your toilet looks so comfy!

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,280
Yeah, man.

134
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,840
- Let me roll on your soft mattress...
- I wanna take a dump.

135
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
before I go to my hard bed, will you?

136
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,080
What's wrong with you?

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,640
You dropped your phone.

138
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,760
Pop, get up!

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,640
There's nothing here.

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,760
- Let's go. Fine. We're leaving.
- Don't get so excited.

141
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,520
Okay. See ya.

142
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm good.

143
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
Where are you?

144
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,159
(Right now...)

145
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
(traveling with...)

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
(Korean friend...)

147
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,200
(in Bangkok.)

148
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,400
I thought you went to Bangkok for work. You're traveling with your friend.

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,960
I thought you cared about my mom.

150
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,760
Do you miss Sangmin?

151
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
Miss...

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
"Bogo..." "Gobo..."

153
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,840
"Bogosipda!"

154
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,640
"Bogosipda."

155
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
"Babo!"

156
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
"Idiot?"

157
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,640
What's wrong?

158
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
I asked if he misses me.

159
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,240
Why did he say that?

160
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
("Neodo!")

161
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,640
"You too?"

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,400
So you're returning my insult?

163
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,800
Fine!

164
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,880
"Babo, babo, babo!"

165
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,560
(Idiot, idiot, idiot!)

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,920
This is our first time sharing a bed.

167
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,480
What's wrong, Pop?

168
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,040
Do you feel like a ghost is watching you?

169
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
My heart is racing.

170
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,400
I'm so close to my crush.

171
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,160
Sigh. It's a shame. He's not thinking about me.

172
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,280
And someone else is hitting on him.

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,160
Won't you comfort me?

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm hurting, you know?

175
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm freaking hurting too.

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
You're swearing again.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,560
Sorry. It's a habit.

178
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,760
What's wrong, Pop?

179
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
I...

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,360
I he...

181
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,400
I heard a thud from the other side.

182
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,680
Tor.

183
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,480
Do you think there's a ghost here?

184
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,040
Huh?

185
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
You're overly anxious.

186
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,400
How can there be one?

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,560
Whoa!

188
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,360
Tor?

189
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,040
I...

190
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I heard it too.

191
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,880
What are you looking at?

192
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
Nothing.

193
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm just thinking...

194
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,120
it might be good if there's a ghost here.

195
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,760
Whoa!

196
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,400
Hey!

197
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
It's not good at all, Pop!

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
It's good to be close to you.

199
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,000
What?

200
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,240
Wait.

201
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,800
Those are repeated thuds.

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,760
I don't think it's a ghost.

203
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Wait...

204
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Are you sure you don't want round two?

205
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm tired.

206
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Do it for me, please?

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,880
I'm still in the mood.

208
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
You're still in the mood?

209
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
Which one should I go for?

210
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Which one?

211
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,040
This is the last one.

212
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,520
Ah!

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,920
Great!

214
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,560
Ah!

215
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,440
- Oh!
- Ah, Rik!

216
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't come! I got protection!

217
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
Have mercy!

218
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,920
Thank you.

219
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,000
Hmm.

220
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm feeling so pretty.

221
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,400
I'm surrounded by men.

222
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Nobody's prettier than you.

223
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,240
You're the prettiest.

224
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,880
Oh!

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,040
Such sweet talkers. It's true though.

226
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,160
Because you're the only girl.

227
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,520
Whoa!

228
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm gonna deduct your points. Go!

229
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Your boyband time is over! Go back to work.

230
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,680
Hey.

231
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,000
Show me how you raise your hands and greet our guests.

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,680
Now.

233
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,120
As a hotel staff, you can't raise your hands like that. Got it?

234
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
Bow down.

235
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,680
And then show them your sincere smile.

236
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,160
Do it.

237
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,920
Your sincere smile.

238
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
That's it.

239
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
And this...

240
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
is the information about our guests.

241
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,440
Take a look.

242
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,680
Thank you.

243
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,320
Take a look.

244
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,040
Thank you.

245
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,800
Take a look.

246
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,400
Thank you.

247
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,240
You too.

248
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Read carefully.

249
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
Will you fight?

250
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,120
We'll fight, Ma'am!

251
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Will you fight?

252
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,840
We'll fight, Ma'am!

253
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,680
Will you fight?

254
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,440
We'll fight, Ma'am!

255
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
We're fighters!

256
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
We're quick and agile!

257
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,560
We're fighters!

258
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,160
We'll keep fighting on and on!

259
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,920
Hmph.

260
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,680
That's it?

261
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,880
You think you can fool me with that?

262
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,480
You wanna take a nap that much?

263
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,920
(Humming lullaby sound.)

264
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
(Singing lullaby in local dialect.)

265
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,440
(Singing lullaby in local dialect.)

266
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,160
(Singing lullaby in local dialect.)

267
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,160
(Singing lullaby in local dialect.)

268
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,200
(Singing lullaby in local dialect.)

269
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,720
(Singing lullaby in local dialect.)

270
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,560
(Mimicking Instruments.)

271
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,200
(Mimicking Instruments.)

272
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
(Mimicking Instruments.)

273
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
(Mimicking Instruments.)

274
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,320
What were they doing last night?

275
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,120
Ahem.

276
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,720
Guys.

277
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,160
This next session...

278
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,400
is a workshop...

279
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,440
of how to serve a VIP guest.

280
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,680
Dinneaw, come here.

281
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,480
You'll try serving this...

282
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,720
welcome set.

283
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,040
You go first.

284
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,640
Here.

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,600
Right.

286
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,840
Wait.

287
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
Listen carefully.

288
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,800
This VIP guest...

289
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,440
will be staying here for several nights.

290
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,040
More importantly, he booked our most expensive room.

291
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,600
Seems like he's really rich.

292
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,680
He's also a foreigner.

293
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,720
He's too handsome to handle!

294
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,400
More importantly, he was giving me a weird look.

295
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,360
I think he has a crush on me.

296
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm too pretty.

297
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,360
But...

298
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
you have to focus, son.

299
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
Don't ever let me down.

300
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,360
Understand?

301
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,080
Got it.

302
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,400
Please don't ruin our standards.

303
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,360
Go.

304
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
As for you guys,

305
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,840
make sure everything here's done.

306
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,160
Next one, prepare yourself.

307
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,880
You can choose who goes next.

308
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,200
I'll be watching our VIP guest.

309
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,080
You go.

310
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,480
This is...

311
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,920
welcome drink from Na Tree Tara.

312
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
Thank you.

313
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,840
Sangmin?

314
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,680
How did you get here?

315
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,080
Walking.

316
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,360
Walking?

317
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah, right.

318
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
You said you were traveling with your friend?

319
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
Did you lie?

320
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,480
That's done.

321
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,400
Sangmin misses Dinneaw.

322
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,880
Okay.

323
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,120
Have your welcome drink.

324
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll go back to work.

325
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh.

326
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,160
Dinneaw.

327
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
What?

328
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,080
Help Sangmin.

329
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
I'll call a bellboy for you.

330
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,560
No.

331
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,040
Dinneaw do it.

332
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,080
- No.
- Do it.

333
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,880
Only because you're our VIP guest.

334
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,360
Thank you.

335
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
You're welcome.

336
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,720
Wow.

337
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
So nice.

338
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,200
Did he buy a new suitcase?

339
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,360
Your suitcase is heavier than before.

340
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
Dinneaw.

341
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,480
Tip.

342
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,880
Tip.

343
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,480
No.

344
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,080
Okay, okay.

345
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,720
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

346
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,160
I thought you would never come back.

347
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,480
Hmm.

348
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,400
Afraid Dinneaw would miss me.

349
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,160
Huh?

350
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,880
You're afraid I'd miss you?

351
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,240
You're a narcissist.

352
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
It's you who miss me, Sangmin.

353
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,160
You came here to see me.

354
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
You're right.

355
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,480
Can you not go and work with Sainam?

356
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,960
Why not?

357
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,160
Are you suddenly jealous?

358
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,800
Sangmin worried.

359
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,160
You said I should...

360
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,160
follow my dream.

361
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,800
Right now,

362
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,680
the hotel in Amphawa is the only way...

363
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,080
to get closer to my dream.

364
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
Does Sainam approach you?

365
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,640
Sometimes.

366
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,400
Don't hang out with Sainam.

367
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Don't hang out with Sainam?

368
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Why not?

369
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,160
Why not?

370
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,240
Are you jealous?

371
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,560
Jealous?

372
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,640
Oh!

373
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,160
Worry.

374
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,160
That's right.

375
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,800
Sangmin worried about Dinneaw.

376
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
So it's a different word?

377
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,880
I'll make you worry a lot.

378
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,560
I gotta get back to work.

379
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,120
The manager's gonna scold me.

380
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,320
I need to finish my training.

381
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
What are you smiling about?

382
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,160
Did your VIP tip you 10,000?

383
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,920
What smile? I'm looking upset.

384
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,360
Yeah, you're so upset all your 32 teeth are showing.

385
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,840
So...

386
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,920
what got you in a good mood?

387
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,840
I said I was upset.

388
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,920
Sangmin came all the way to bother me here.

389
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,200
You...

390
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,640
How did you get so popular?

391
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
Everyone's got a crush on you.

392
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
There's Mr. Sainam.

393
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,560
There's Sangmin.

394
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:03,880
Crush?

395
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,720
Are you crazy?

396
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,720
It's just a coincidence.

397
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,040
Yeah, coincidence.

398
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,680
Hello, this is Na Tree Tara Hotel.

399
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
(Dinneaw.)

400
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,120
(Sangmin can't use remote.)

401
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,160
You're using an old trick again huh?

402
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Sangmin.

403
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,320
Bothering me at the homestay wasn't enough.

404
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,120
You're bothering me here too.

405
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,480
No.

406
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,320
Sangmin not bothering.

407
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
TV...

408
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,600
is not working.

409
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,560
No battery.

410
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,200
If I find out this was your scheme...

411
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,920
No.

412
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,800
No.

413
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,640
Umm...

414
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,240
Umm...

415
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,400
You're scheming a lot.

416
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,840
Well...

417
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,120
Sangmin...

418
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
didn't know.

419
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Oh?

420
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,120
How didn't you know?

421
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,120
What are you trying to pull?

422
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,200
Sangmin...

423
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,040
wants to...

424
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,960
be with Dinneaw.

425
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,960
Don't bother me.

426
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,840
I need to work.

427
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,480
I'll see you after work.

428
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,640
Okay?

429
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,360
Okay?

430
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,240
- Okay?
- Okay.

431
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,480
(One noodle in gravy please.)

432
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,040
Thank you.

433
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,400
I said don't bother me.

434
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,440
No.

435
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,640
Sangmin not bothering.

436
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,320
Sangmin hungry.

437
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,120
If you're hungry, eat it.

438
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,160
(Forgot fish sauce.)

439
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,400
Should I go instead?

440
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,160
No.

441
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,640
I got this.

442
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Sangmin doesn't need anything.

443
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,640
He just wants to see me.

444
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
And you're going?

445
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,680
Yeah.

446
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,160
Forgot fish sauce.

447
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,040
Extra salty for you.

448
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,240
Thank you.

449
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,640
(Spa details please.)

450
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,800
Oh, come on...

451
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,360
You...

452
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,200
- Hey!
- Ah!

453
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,160
I want a lot of bubbas.

454
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,440
Bubbles?

455
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
You don't have a bath tub.

456
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,960
Why would you want bubbles?

457
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,640
No.

458
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,880
Sangmin wants the hotel's service.

459
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
You want the hotel's service?

460
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,360
Yeah.

461
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,640
Oh?

462
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,120
Hey.

463
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,480
What are you doing?

464
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,400
You've been asking for it today.

465
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,160
What are you doing?

466
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Come here.

467
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,360
Oh...

468
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,880
Ugh...

469
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,480
Hey.

470
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,440
No...

471
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,800
Ugh...

472
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,400
Come on...

473
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,880
What are you doing?

474
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,640
What are you doing?

475
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Take...

476
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,880
Uh...

477
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,560
Ugh...

478
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:18,920
Hey...

479
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,600
You...

480
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,400
Let...

481
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,880
Oh?

482
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,120
Hey, wait.

483
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,400
Hi, Oppa.

484
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,720
This is special service for you.

485
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,480
Thank you.

486
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,320
Oh?

487
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,480
This is...

488
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,840
essential oil.

489
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,480
Oh?

490
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,640
Ah.

491
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,400
Well...

492
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,320
Thank you so much.

493
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,040
Um...

494
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,560
I'll take this inside for you.

495
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,400
Oh, no!

496
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,120
Stop.

497
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,600
Stop...

498
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,600
Wait...

499
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,680
Stop.

500
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,400
- Wait.
- Oh.

501
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,560
I...

502
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,160
Well...

503
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,120
Can you speak Thai?

504
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,800
So that means...

505
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,480
you must like Thai women.

506
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,600
Well...

507
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Sangmin sleepy.

508
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,600
Huh?

509
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,160
Let me sleep please.

510
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,840
You're sleepy?

511
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,320
If you are,

512
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,040
I'll just...

513
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,440
drop it inside.

514
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,920
Hmm...

515
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,920
Okay.

516
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
I'll just put it here.

517
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,040
Oh?

518
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,320
This scent is not our essential oil.

519
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,240
What is this?

520
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,640
Oh...

521
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Sleepy.

522
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,360
Sangmin sleepy.

523
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,400
You're sleepy? Wait.

524
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,840
- I haven't given you the special service...
- It's okay. Maid, please!

525
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
Dinneaw.

526
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,440
When you put on a bed sheet at this hotel,

527
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
you can't do it like you do at home.

528
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,200
We have our standards.

529
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,160
We use three pieces of bed sheets.

530
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,760
Every piece have been sanitized...

531
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,960
at the temp of 70 degree Celsius.

532
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
When you put one on,

533
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
you need to watch the stitches.

534
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,640
See?

535
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,000
See this?

536
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,560
Stitches should be on the inside.

537
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,320
After that,

538
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,320
stand exactly in the middle.

539
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,560
Aim in the middle.

540
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,640
And spread the sheet to cover the entire mattress.

541
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,240
Again.

542
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,840
Try it.

543
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,480
Come on.

544
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,840
You go.

545
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,800
Yeah.

546
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,600
Good.

547
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,680
That's it.

548
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,960
Help your friend, will you?

549
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,440
Yes.

550
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,560
Go, try a 90 degree angle.

551
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:06,920
Right there.

552
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,239
Come on, Pop. Help me.

553
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,280
When you fold a towel, at this hotel,

554
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,199
we have our own unique signature.

555
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,760
Other hotels fold them into...

556
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,480
swans or some shape.

557
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,840
What we do is...

558
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,800
we fold them into...

559
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,719
A monitor lizard?

560
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes.

561
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,120
Monitor lizard my butt!

562
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,320
What hotel would have a lizard on the bed?

563
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,159
Hey, a monitor lizard...

564
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
is like a dragon to foreigners.

565
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,120
Whoa!

566
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
See?

567
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,199
Look at this.

568
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,080
Our elephant.

569
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,040
See how cute it is.

570
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,440
The trunk is our true signature.

571
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,639
All right.

572
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,760
It's your turn to try.

573
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,280
Make one exactly like this.

574
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,199
I'll be checking out on other trainees.

575
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,639
H...

576
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:53,840
How...

577
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,440
How do we fold this?

578
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,640
Won't you teach me?

579
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,160
Do you see the sample?

580
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,680
I do.

581
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,160
Can you try?

582
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,520
I didn't have to teach you other things.

583
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Sigh. Kids these days.

584
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,360
Here. I'll do it.

585
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,720
Dinneaw...

586
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
seems to have a crush on Sangmin, Pop.

587
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,160
I offered to deal with Sangmin in his place.

588
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,280
He wouldn't let me.

589
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,640
He acted like he didn't like it, but he went to see him.

590
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,520
This behavior...

591
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,960
is what we call...

592
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,040
getting manipulated knowingly.

593
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,440
Incredible.

594
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,800
It's what someone in love does.

595
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,120
Tor.

596
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,640
Seriously.

597
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,560
That night when you were drunk,

598
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,520
do you remember what we did?

599
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,320
Do you?

600
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Umm...

601
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,120
Oh...

602
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,160
Do you remember now?

603
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,720
Hey...

604
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
Stop. What are you doing?

605
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,800
You remember!

606
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,160
You just pretend not to.

607
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,280
You sly.

608
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,520
More?

609
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Do you know...

610
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,240
my thing...

611
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,840
is bigger than an elephant's trunk?

612
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,680
I don't remember that, Pop.

613
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
What I remember is...

614
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,800
mine's bigger.

615
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,440
Let's measure it then.

616
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,720
Let's find out.

617
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,960
Oh.

618
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,520
Rik?

619
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,800
Rik!

620
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,920
We're working.

621
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
If we don't get it right today,

622
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,680
Pony's gonna scold us.

623
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,960
Don't mind me then.

624
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,640
Rik.

625
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
We're working.

626
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,560
Our relationship...

627
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,600
can't be just about this kind of things.

628
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,160
It's normal.

629
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,120
We go on trips. We met each other's families.

630
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,200
We're together. We live together.

631
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
But you're doing this everywhere.

632
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,280
Isn't it normal?

633
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,480
It's not weird.

634
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,800
You know I'm an addict even before we started dating.

635
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,960
It's too often.

636
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,720
Do you like it?

637
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,120
What are you doing?

638
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,840
Crap!

639
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
I should ask you. What did you do?

640
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,160
Why are you all wet?

641
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,200
I watered the plants.

642
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,200
Why didn't you dry yourself off?

643
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,600
This is not a hotel staff's standards.

644
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,600
Wait.

645
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,840
Our VIP guest...

646
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,800
requested you as his tour guide.

647
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,680
The guest's name is Sangmin, right?

648
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,640
Yes.

649
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,520
The one who's hitting on me.

650
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,640
Sigh.

651
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,520
He said he needs to see you in 30 minutes.

652
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,920
Let's go out.

653
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,920
I already have plans.

654
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,160
Sangmin...

655
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,800
is...

656
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,600
VIP.

657
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,200
I got someone bigger than a VIP.

658
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,640
The...

659
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,560
hotel's owner wanted me as his tour guide.

660
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,080
Dinneaw.

661
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,080
Come with Sangmin.

662
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,920
If you're upset that my staff...

663
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,760
is unable to fulfill your request...

664
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,720
you're welcome to move to another hotel, Mr. Sangmin.

665
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,120
I'm willing to give you a refund.

666
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,120
I already paid you.

667
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,280
What more do you want?

668
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,960
I'm in trouble.

669
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,080
I would like to charge a bit more to keep this a secret.

670
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
I won't pay.

671
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,320
What are you gonna do?

672
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,440
If you won't pay,

673
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,480
the boy will find out...

674
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,560
that you hired me...

675
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,360
to snatch her purse and get him fired.

676
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,760
Dinneaw.

677
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,680
Come with...

678
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,240
Sangmin.

679
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,080
I'm sorry, Sangmin.

680
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,960
I already said yes to Mr. Sainam.

681
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,200
Let's go tomorrow.

682
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,000
Excuse us please.

683
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,000
You want me to guide you on a tour.

684
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,600
But...

685
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,000
why are we eating steak at the hotel?

686
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,920
A restaurant can be included in a tour's itinerary.

687
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,640
Don't tell me...

688
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,200
you've never taken your tourists on a food trip.

689
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I have.

690
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
Visiting a restaurant is good.

691
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,200
You can drink in the atmosphere.

692
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,080
You get to watch your tourists' behaviors.

693
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,360
You can adapt that into your work.

694
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,680
Yes.

695
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,920
Relax.

696
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,120
Have you reserved a table?

697
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,120
No.

698
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,440
This way please.

699
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,840
Yes.

700
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,480
Sigh.

701
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,760
I don't know how much time I have left.

702
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,960
So...

703
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,280
I want to do what I want.

704
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,960
Yeah.

705
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,560
I would be happy if I get to be with him.

706
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,680
But...

707
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,560
he's with a nasty person right now.

708
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,040
I'm so worried.

709
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,600
Yeah.

710
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,640
Sigh.

711
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Guide Dinneaw will take you on a tour.

712
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,280
This way please.

713
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,640
- Umm...
- Come...

714
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,640
Come on.

715
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,520
No, no.

716
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,680
Don't be scared.

717
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Come with me.

718
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,920
Hey, come here.

719
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,960
Watch your steps.

720
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,680
Sigh. I'm so tired. My neck feels so stiff.

721
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,640
Hi!

722
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,440
I have a task as big as an elephant for you today.

723
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
And not just a regular elephant, guys.

724
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,040
This time,

725
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,120
it's an XL-sized elephant.

726
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,040
Oh?

727
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,480
Ugh...

728
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,600
So what task is it?

729
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,040
It's a project...

730
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,120
(Full Moon, 12th Lunar month.)

731
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,920
(High tide fills the river banks.)

732
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,160
(All of us...)

733
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,720
(men and women...)

734
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,920
(are having fun on Loy Krathong.)

735
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,240
(Loy, Loy Krathong.)

736
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,480
Yeah.

737
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,240
Speaking of which...

738
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,840
In this project,

739
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,200
the one who will lead the charge...

740
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,280
is...

741
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,240
Dinneaw, my baby!

742
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,680
Clap your hands!

743
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,600
Yeah!

744
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,240
Good.

745
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,240
So I'm finally your favorite, huh?

746
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,240
Don't ruin my mood please.

747
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,600
Our model girl...

748
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,200
happens to be Korean.

749
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,160
"Kamsahamnida."

750
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:29,960
Yeah.

751
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,920
So I think...

752
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,800
you're going to kill it,

753
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,320
because you've dealt with...

754
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,640
a Korean VIP guest.

755
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,760
This shouldn't be too hard for you.

756
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,040
You're okay with this, right?

757
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,280
Can I be not okay?

758
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,480
You wanna get your points deducted?

759
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,800
I can do it.

760
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,520
Very good.

761
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,240
Dinneaw, my baby.

762
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,160
Never ever let me down, okay?

763
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,160
Anyway, I'll...

764
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,120
leave this with you.

765
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,000
We need to start rehearsing right away.

766
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,120
We need perfection!

767
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,960
Rehearse now!

768
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,360
Nail it now! Yes, sir!

769
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,440
Sigh.

770
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,280
Oops.

771
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,520
We haven't even started yet.

772
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,560
Sigh. I'm so tired.

773
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,240
In front...

774
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,560
Umm...

775
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,000
In the front.

776
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,920
Ton, quick! Come on!

777
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,200
Yes, sir.

778
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,640
Try out the frame.

779
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,640
Again? We've been waiting all day.

780
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,240
Whoa!

781
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:15,840
Try...

782
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,720
Come on. We're just trying it out.

783
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,560
Yeah. Just trying it out.

784
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,160
Now we're...

785
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,680
Come on.

786
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,200
Set it up.

787
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,760
Okay, pan the camera.

788
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,280
Come here if you're done.

789
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,920
Look at the frame.

790
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,560
Come and look here.

791
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,720
- Check the lighting.
- No, thanks.

792
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,480
Okay. Yes. That's good.

793
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,240
- Shoot something. Try out the lighting.
- Yes, sir.

794
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,720
Okay. A second please.

795
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,360
Okay.

796
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,600
Mister, step back a bit.

797
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:34,720
Your dress.

798
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,120
What?

799
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,200
Ton, quick.

800
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,160
Why are you saying this?

801
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,840
You have another woman?

802
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,520
Oh, okay.

803
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,240
Do you wanna die?

804
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,760
Hey!

805
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,000
Hey!

806
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,360
Argh!

807
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,360
You, wait!

808
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,200
Wait!

809
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,600
Wait!

810
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,840
Hey, you!

811
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,640
Ton.

812
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,600
Chok.

813
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,160
What's going on?

814
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,000
She left.

815
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,600
Who left?

816
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,560
The model.

817
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,080
She's gone.

818
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,160
What are you standing there for?

819
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,040
What are you doing?

820
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,960
Go after her!

821
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,440
After her. Go go!

822
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,080
Do I have to go too?

823
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,520
Just don't move.

824
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,680
What did the model say?

825
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,800
She didn't say a word.

826
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,920
She just got in the car.

827
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,280
What?

828
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
She got in the car?

829
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,720
This is bad. What will we do now?

830
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,040
We don't have a model.

831
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,480
We won't get anything done now!

832
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,080
Whoa!

833
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,640
(Mimicking instruments.)

834
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,680
(Mimicking instruments.)

835
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,600
In this dire situation,

836
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,640
Pony will be your model.

837
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,560
You can't!

838
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,240
You look old! You're full of wrinkles!

839
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,640
Look at yourself!

840
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,760
You're too Thai!

841
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
How can we do this campaign in Korea?

842
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,320
It's specified in the contract...

843
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,680
that it has to be a Korean!

844
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,240
Screw you!

845
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,160
As if you're so handsome, you director!

846
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,720
You keep bullying people!

847
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,560
Do you see ONE Korean person here?

848
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,360
"Eottoke?"

849
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,160
"Oppa!"

850
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,240
I have an idea!

851
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,560
Whoa!

852
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,120
Please save us, Your Majesty.

853
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,280
All eyes...

854
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,560
on us.

855
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,800
These are the most expensive flowers...

856
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,320
of Na Tree Tara.

857
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,680
Why has Dinneaw...

858
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,920
never noticed that I like him?

859
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,440
Will you consider someone else then?

860
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,200
Dinneaw is a kid.

861
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,560
So cute.

862
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,080
Dinneaw?

863
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,200
Dinneaw!

864
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,640
Dinneaw.
