1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Thanks!

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,800
Mmm, this is really delicious.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,500
How about going out together this Sunday?

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,700
Sunday?

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,660
Singing karaoke and stuff like that.
Aren't club activities only in the morning?

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,300
The weekend might be a bit tough.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
I see.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,399
I can sing for you anytime.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,449
Don't be so down.

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm not upset at all.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Aaaaahhh!!

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,799
What are you doing?!

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,499
I saved the caramel on
purpose so I could eat it last!

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,300
Don't take pudding so seriously, kid.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,999
- Huh? Hand it over!
- Aaaaah!

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
- Hey!
- Then I won't hold back!

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,769
Stop eating already!

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,200
I haven't even had any yet!

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,400
After that, I stopped asking
Mashiro out on weekends.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,500
So back in high school, I only ever
saw Mashiro in his school uniform.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,589
When we met again after growing
up, he was always wearing a suit.

22
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:31,424
So today is the first time I've ever
seen Mashiro in casual clothes.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,700
Thanks for waiting, Kanade!

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,300
So cool!

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Hm?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Where did you get that T-shirt?

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Isn't it cute?

28
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,900
No, that's not what I meant.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,200
I just thought dressing too
formally would feel a bit weird.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
After all, this is
basically our first date.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Huh?

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,699
Even though we did go out
for drinks together a while ago.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,009
But making plans to meet up
and hang out like this on a day off...

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,570
This is probably the first time, right?

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Let's go inside.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Yeah.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Oh, really?

39
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,876
Today is my first date with Mashiro.

40
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,200
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

41
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,500
(Episode 3)

42
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:35,313
Honestly, when it comes to going out and having fun, there
really aren't as many options in Tokyo as you'd think.

43
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
It does feel a little weird for just
the two of us to go shopping together.

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Yeah.

45
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,400
Come to think of it, the aquarium
really is a classic date spot.

46
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,461
How do we look to other people, I wonder?

47
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
What's wrong?

48
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,492
It's nothing, really.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
No, no, I'm just overthinking it.

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Ah! Look, jellyfish!

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,900
Wow!

52
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,500
I could watch this forever.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,169
Are you tired?

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,700
Watching jellyfish can be
really soothing, don't you think?

55
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,200
Yeah, that's true.

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,579
Did you know? The pattern on
a jellyfish is actually its stomach.

57
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,270
Oh! Are you trying to show
off how knowledgeable you are?

58
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,000
Go on, please.

59
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Stop teasing me, seriously.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
Just kidding.

61
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,800
Speaking of which...

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
I want to kiss you.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
This time, I definitely won't drink again.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Could it be that Mashiro
planned today's date for…

65
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,292
Kanade, do you come to the aquarium often?

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,590
No, it's just that I really
haven't been here in ages.

67
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,530
The last time I came here was
probably back when I was still a student.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,300
Pretty much.

69
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Yeah, it's hard to come
to a place like this alone.

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm really glad we could come today.

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,300
Hey! Can I ask you something?

72
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,690
Hm?

73
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,900
Why did you fall for me?

74
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,476
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,300
It's okay! Just tell me.

76
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
Getting asked that out of the blue...

77
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:06,675
-You can't put it into words?

78
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
No.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I just can't really put it into words.

80
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,900
How should I put this?

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
It's when I'm with you.

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,900
It's just that I feel a little
ticklish inside, you know?

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
It feels... tingly?

84
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,180
I don't really know either.

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,009
People's hearts are
always hard to figure out.

86
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,500
Isn't that what you said, Mashiro?

87
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,300
That's true.

88
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,690
What about you?

89
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,500
Why did you fall for me?

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ah...

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
You're the one who asked
first, so hurry up and answer!

92
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I felt set free.

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Because you did all these things for me.

94
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,800
Set free?

95
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,700
And also, when I'm with you,
my heart feels all tingly, you know?

96
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,499
That's so sneaky! Don't copy me!

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,599
This guest,

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
please keep your voice down inside the venue.

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,530
- Huh?
- Shh! We'll really get in trouble!

100
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,000
Ah! My heart feels all tingly.

101
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Sure enough, whenever I'm with Mashiro,
I get that ticklish feeling inside.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Sorry, just a moment.

103
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
MITSUKO...?

104
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,300
Is it okay not to answer?

105
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,100
Yeah, it's fine.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,700
Who's MITSUKO?

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's go! On to the next spot.

108
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Yeah.

109
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,430
What's that red one over there?

110
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,070
It says golden perch on it!

111
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,200
Huh, is that a striped pufferfish?
Isn't it this one?

112
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,069
Wow! They have it here too!

113
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,200
That's really interesting.

114
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,430
Blue damselfish...

115
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,100
It's our very first date, after
all. I should really enjoy it.

116
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,435
This really is the best spot to watch from.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Wow! It's really beautiful.

118
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
So cute.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,019
Hey! What are you taking pictures of?!

120
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,569
Just felt like taking a
picture all of a sudden.

121
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,819
- Hey, stop taking pictures already.
- Oh, that expression right now is perfect!

122
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm so embarrassed! Hey!

123
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,700
- Go take pictures of the fish, the fish!
- Wow! That shot is amazing!

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,000
We definitely have to save this one.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,100
Huh? What's going on!

126
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,400
This is payback.

127
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Huh?

128
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,566
If you're going to take the shot,
this is the right angle, isn't it?

129
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,510
- What's that supposed to be?!
- Oh, this side actually looks even better.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
This way isn't so bad either.

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,700
How is it?

132
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:16,800
So lame!

133
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,100
Just kidding, it's really cute.

134
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I like...

135
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
Huh?

136
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
I just feel like...

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
I guess I still like Kanade best.

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,330
What is it?

139
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,731
Bringing that up all of a sudden...

140
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Th... Thirsty.

141
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Huh?

142
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,500
Do you want to go grab a drink together?

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Yeah, let's go get something to drink…

144
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
What am I even doing?!

145
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,020
Do you want to go grab
something to eat or something?

146
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,700
I'm not hungry.

147
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah, you're right.

148
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,800
Mashiro is still bothered by it after all.

149
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,800
- About earlier, I...
- I'm sorry!

150
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Huh?

151
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,400
I got too impatient again.

152
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,000
I acted impulsively without
considering how Kanade felt.

153
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,000
My feelings?

154
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,260
Kanade, you said it before, right?

155
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
It's our first time...

156
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,620
This is our very first date, you know.

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
And it was outside, too.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,040
So it still made you feel
uncomfortable, didn't it?

159
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,600
No, that's not what I meant just now.

160
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,940
So we're switching it up this time, huh?

161
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Huh?

162
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,500
Since I didn't answer on LINE,
she switched to calling me instead.

163
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Mom?

164
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Ever since we started living
apart, she's been calling all the time.

165
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,564
This is already the third time today.

166
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,900
Could it be that Mom's name is...

167
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Name?

168
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Mitsuko?

169
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
Oh, come on...

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
It's your mom.

171
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,850
Huh?

172
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,500
By the way, is it really
okay not to answer?

173
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:00,801
She's called three times already.
Maybe it's something urgent?

174
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,000
It's fine, it's always
nothing important with her.

175
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Do you want to call her back?

176
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,220
It'll turn into a long call,
so let's talk about it later.

177
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
I'll wait for you.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
No... but...

179
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,330
Your mom is just worried about you.

180
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,300
Isn't this proof that you're loved?

181
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,476
Then I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

182
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
Make sure you call back, okay?

183
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Got it.

184
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Hello?

185
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,080
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

186
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Mom called you so many times.

187
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,719
I'm outside right now.

189
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,100
Do you have any idea how
worried I am about you, Kosuke?

190
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,419
Kosuke has always been a
good kid since he was little.

191
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,800
I thought you would understand how I feel.

192
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,500
You have no idea how much effort I've
put in for you, Kosuke, all these years.

193
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Mashiro.

194
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,500
Calm down and listen to me.

195
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,500
It seems like your dad
just had an accident.

196
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Kosuke.

197
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,200
All I have left is Kosuke.

198
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,200
There's only Kosuke left now.

199
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Yeah.

200
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,670
Mom's going out to eat with her friends.

201
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,600
Just grab something for dinner on your own.

202
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Mom.

203
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
What is it?

204
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm... running out of money.

205
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,370
I've put up with a lot for Kosuke's sake.

206
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,630
Kosuke, you should try
to hang in there a little, too.

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Mm...

208
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm heading out now.

209
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,300
Take care on your way.

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Why did you go get a
part-time job without telling me!

211
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,660
If the neighbors find out, they'll probably
think I haven't been taking good care of you!

212
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,700
But the money...

213
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,300
Kids shouldn't have to
worry about things like this!

214
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,600
Anyway, Kosuke, you...

215
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,100
You must think your mom
is pretty useless, right!

216
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,200
That's not true at all!

217
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Kosuke.

218
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,700
Do you want to come
stay at Grandma's place?

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Huh?

220
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,800
If we lived together, life
would probably be a little easier.

221
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:24,283
It's fine to join the new track team, but you
still need to help out at home on the weekends.

222
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Yeah.

223
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,400
I have club activities in the morning,
but I'll be back in the afternoon.

224
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Let him do things his own way.

225
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,400
Always making Kosuke put up with things.

226
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,830
How can you say that!

227
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm thinking about Kosuke too, you know.

228
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Kosuke should be a little
more understanding of me, too...

229
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,440
It's okay.

230
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll be home this weekend.

231
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,700
You haven't contacted me at all.

232
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,640
So, little by little, you're drifting further
and further away from your mom, aren't you?

233
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,500
You don't really care about
your mom at all, do you?

234
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
This place is really amazing.

235
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:36,360
I saw it online and have been
wanting to come check it out.

236
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,100
It really feels just like
being in the ocean.

237
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,400
It's really beautiful.

238
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,000
What did you buy?

239
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Huh?

240
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:57,216
When you were on the phone just
now, I found it in the souvenir section.

241
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Here you go.

242
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
For me?

243
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Because I think it really
looks like you, Mashiro.

244
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,159
Thank you.

245
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,880
But does it really look like me?

246
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,550
It really does!

247
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,700
Just like the way Mashiro smiles.

248
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,500
Are you really going
to quit the track team?

249
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Yeah.

250
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,860
Because we have to practice on weekends before the
matches, I feel like it's a bit too much for me.

251
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Oh, I see.

252
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,100
Don't look so down!

253
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
But you've been practicing so hard.

254
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,200
Frustration, sadness, or loneliness
if you just hang in there, feelings pass eventually.

255
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,100
I don't think that's true.

256
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
Huh?

257
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:02,415
There are so many things you
just can't force yourself to endure.

258
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,000
You're just ignoring your
own feelings, that's all.

259
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
I...

260
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,640
I don't want Mashiro to
force himself to endure it.

261
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,100
The way you smile suits you best.

262
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,000
Attention all guests: The East
Aquarium will be closing after 5:00 PM.

263
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,500
They're about to close!

264
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,999
Thank you so much for visiting us today.

265
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,700
- Let's go.
- Okay.

266
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,100
And just like that, my first date
with Mashiro came to an end.

267
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,900
Is it really okay for it to end like this?

268
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Mashiro...

269
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
I...

270
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Kanade-kun?

271
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,499
- Kanamori!
- What a coincidence!

272
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,969
I'm here with my family too.

273
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,000
I see.

274
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,440
I was wondering who was being so lovey-dovey,
turns out it was you and your group, Kanade-kun!

275
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,996
Stop it, you're embarrassing me!

276
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,840
We're just friends!

277
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
I see.

278
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,000
If you put it that way, your
girlfriend might get upset.

279
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Huh?

280
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,650
Sorry!

281
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,870
I heard it from Sumire-chan.

282
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,310
And then I found out that
you have a girlfriend, Kanade.

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,500
I didn't know anything, and I even
tried to set you two up. I'm really sorry.

284
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
No, I won't…

285
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Hello?

286
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,900
I just stepped outside.

287
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,400
Are you still inside?

288
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,850
Then just wait for me there.

289
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,950
Okay.

290
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
- See you at the office then, Kanade.
- Okay.

291
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
Sorry to bother you.

292
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,760
It's someone from my company.

293
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

294
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,600
No, that's not it.

295
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,999
Of course I was just kidding.

296
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,900
It's actually a hassle to explain.
Saying it like this is just... easier.

297
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,840
It's just easier this way.

298
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,300
Hmm... I get it!

299
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:23,619
Let's go home.

300
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
So useless.

301
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:33,515
Always worrying about what
others think has hurt Mashiro.

302
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,000
Why am I like this...

303
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,799
(Next Episode)
- No contact at all. - No contact at all.

304
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,396
(The two are drifting further apart.)
This is a mental battle.

305
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,156
I really can't stand seeing
Sumire-chan like this.

306
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,550
(Closed off heart)
I don't want anyone to know about me.

307
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,499
To have the person I like
tell me they like me back.

308
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,533
It really is just like a miracle.
