1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,300
It's all your fault!

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
Kanade!

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
Who the hell are you?

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,570
Who do you think you are?!

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,700
Don't be like that.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,259
Kanade didn't do anything.

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,500
Shut up!

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,899
He was the one who made
a move on you first, right?!

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,540
You've got some nerve getting
cozy with someone else's girlfriend.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let go of me.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,700
What the heck?

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Let's go.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Sorry...

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,300
Are you okay?

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Mashiro...

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,081
I can't help but feel… it's
just one thing after another.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,000
When someone forces their kindness
on you, it just feels bothersome.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was just a dream...

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Hello?

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,700
Kosuke.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,700
Why do you always ignore Mom's calls?

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,519
Sorry, sorry.

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,000
Is "I'm sorry" all you ever say?!

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
What's going on with you?

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
You don't really care about
your mom at all, do you?

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,100
I have to go to work.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,500
I'll call you tonight.

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
No... that's not it.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,900
Of course I was lying.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,480
It's actually a hassle to explain everything.
Saying it like this is just easier...

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A bit more relaxed.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,799
(Do you hate your mom?) (Mom only has you now.)
(Do you not even care about how I'm doing?)

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,361
(Are you listening?) (You just think I'm annoying,
don't you?) (Listen to what I have to say.)

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,600
Being considerate of others and

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
be honest with your own feelings.

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Is it really impossible to have both?

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,000
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,300
(Episode 4)

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,499
Can you take care of
this for me right away?

41
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,729
You've really been a huge help.

42
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,029
No problem, I'll check the inventory.
The rest will be delivered by tomorrow.

43
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,800
Next week works for me too.

44
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,600
I have the day off tomorrow.

45
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,599
Oh, I see.

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,520
Sometimes you've got to cherish the
time you spend with your family, too.

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,300
I had a fight with my wife a while ago.

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
Huh?

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,449
You really have to deal with things like this
early on, or else if you just leave them alone...

50
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,250
It really can become
something you can't fix.

51
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,399
I'll leave it to you, then.

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Alright.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,900
Is it really beyond repair...?

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Since then,

55
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,660
Mashiro hasn't contacted me since then.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,700
(Sorry about what happened last time...)

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,500
What if I get rejected…

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,379
Are you okay?

59
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,000
Have you had lunch yet?
I'm about to go get some ramen.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's not right.

61
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Sorry about the awkward
atmosphere last time.

62
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,700
This isn't right either.

63
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Who are you texting with
that serious look on your face?

64
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,300
It was a little awkward when we parted last time,
so I've thought about how I should reach out.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,500
Things are going pretty well
with that girl from last time, huh?

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Huh?

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
What is it?!

68
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,000
It's best not to reach
out at times like this.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,840
You need to watch how
the other person reacts.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Reaction?

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
It's just playing hard to get.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,609
If doing this makes the other person
grow distant, then what should I do?

73
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,200
That just means that's all you
really are to them in their heart.

74
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm back.

75
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,900
Could you please help
explain it? Thank you.

76
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,400
Why not?

77
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Kanade-san.

78
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
Do you have a girlfriend?

79
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
- Aizawa-san.
- Yes.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,979
Regarding the room for Friday's meeting,
the number of attendees might increase.

81
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,100
Could you help move it to Room B?

82
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,010
I understand.

83
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,089
I'll go check if that room is available.

84
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,100
Thanks for your help.

85
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Um...

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,400
I've already put the new book inventory
sheet I checked yesterday on your desk.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Ah! Thank you.

88
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't think about anything else today,
just head home early.

89
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,580
Kanade, are you getting off work?

90
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,029
Yes, but if you still have
work to do, I don't mind staying.

91
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,100
Yeah, actually, it's not about work.

92
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Can I talk to you for a bit?

93
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Huh?

94
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,300
Sorry for making you come
all the way out to my place.

95
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
No worries, it was on my way too.

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,206
And besides, it's not really a
good idea to talk near the office.

97
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you.

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
What did you want to say?

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,599
Well, actually...

100
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Here you go, enjoy.

101
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,960
Ah! I'm getting a little hungry.
Want to order a sandwich?

102
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,200
The mackerel sandwich
here is seriously delicious.

103
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,500
Ah! But the BLT sandwich
sounds pretty good too.

104
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Then...

105
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,599
Let's go with the mackerel sandwich.

106
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Is that okay?

107
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes.

108
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,600
Then I'll have a mackerel sandwich.

109
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,530
Looks like it's their signature item.

110
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,379
It's really delicious. You'll be amazed!

111
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,600
Mashiro really likes it too...

112
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Huh?

113
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,100
No, that's not it.

114
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,400
So, Kanamori-san, what
are you trying to say?

115
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Hmm...

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,030
No, that's not it.

117
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,700
How should I put this...

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
That's not like you at all, Kanamori-san.

119
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,000
Just say what's on your mind.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Alright, I'll just say it then.

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Alright.

122
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,300
Kanade, the person you're dating.

123
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,000
Could it be...

124
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,100
The boy you were with at the aquarium.

125
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
Huh?!

126
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Sorry.

127
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,661
If you don't want to talk about it,
you don't have to force yourself.

128
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,600
Thinking back on it, it really does
feel like that might be the case.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,459
If that's really the case, I guess I've been
saying some pretty rude things all along.

130
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,300
I should be the one apologizing to you.

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
That's not it.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
I see.

133
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,300
You're right, after all,
you do have a girlfriend.

134
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
You have a girlfriend, right?

135
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,800
No...

136
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Speaking of which,

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,399
why do I have to tell Kanamori-san
something so personal?

138
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,040
This has nothing to do with you, does it?

139
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Sorry.

140
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
That's true.

141
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
It's just that...

142
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I can't stand seeing Sumire-chan like that.

143
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Huh?

144
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,600
Knowing it's not possible, but still holding on
to it in your heart that must be really painful.

145
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,000
I feel really bad about
asking Kanade to handle this.

146
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,600
If you have a real reason to turn her
down, I hope you'll tell her honestly.

147
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,110
If she can understand
the reason and accept it,

148
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,172
maybe Sumire-chan will be able
to find the courage to move forward.

149
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,500
Why do I have to
go this far for her?

150
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,560
Huh?

151
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:31,534
No, that's not it. I know it
might sound a little strange,

152
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,230
but heartbreak isn't exactly
something unusual, is it?

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,070
Yeah, that's true.

154
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,199
But Aizawa-san will be just fine.

155
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,800
She's really cute and has a great personality;
she'll find someone wonderful in no time.

156
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
There's not just one guy out there.
There are plenty of options.

157
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,649
That line...

158
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,200
Don't you think that's a
bit out of line, Kanade?

159
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
You don't know anything
about that kid at all.

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,500
Even if I don't know everything,
I can pretty much guess.

161
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Anyway, she's just someone
who's always been favored.

162
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not like her.

163
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,400
It's okay if you don't understand.

164
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
My own business.

165
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
I don't want anyone to know, either.

166
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,000
Please stop worrying about me.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sorry.

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,280
I've always thought it's better not to
meddle in other people's business too much.

169
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here's your mackerel sandwich.

170
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,500
Kanade, go ahead and eat.

171
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,200
As coworkers in the same workplace, I hope you
can be a little more considerate of Sumire-chan.

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,000
Forty-seven... forty-eight...
forty-nine... fifty.

173
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,000
One, two, three.

174
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Good job.

175
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Great job out there.

176
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Can I have lunch with you?

177
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Huh?

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah.

179
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
Is it okay to sit here?

180
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah.

181
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,700
Do you eat here often?

182
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Only once in a while.

183
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,500
Only when the weather is as nice as today.

184
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I see.

185
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm really sorry about what happened
with Kanamori-san yesterday.

186
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Huh?

187
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,100
I heard about it.

188
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,000
I talked about my situation when
I went for coffee with Kanade-san.

189
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,200
What did Kanamori-san say?

190
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,600
She only mentioned
what I talked to her about.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is that so?

192
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
She told me it's better to just give up.

193
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm really sorry for always
making things awkward for you.

194
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,476
Kanade-san must feel
pretty troubled by this too.

195
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
No, not at all.

196
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
I just haven't been able
to sort out my feelings.

197
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,300
Why do you like me so much?

198
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
To be honest, I really have no idea.

199
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,000
If you can, please tell me.

200
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Kanade-san...

201
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,500
You're my prince charming!

202
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,000
- Huh?
- Sorry, that was a weird thing to say.

203
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,930
But...

204
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,290
Kanade-san, you're always so gentle and cool.

205
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,337
You take the initiative to organize the
bookshelves that no one else wants to touch,

206
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:59,267
and you thoughtfully write
letters to the bookstore.

207
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,000
This kind of sincere and earnest
attitude really makes me admire you.

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is the first time
I've ever felt this way.

209
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Huh?

210
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I...

211
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,500
I always thought I'd
never fall in love in my life.

212
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,020
Maybe it's because I've
always gone to all-girls' schools.

213
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm still a little nervous around guys.

214
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
But...

215
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,800
When I'm with Kanade-san,
I don't feel scared at all.

216
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
I think it's wonderful.

217
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
So...

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,500
I don't know how to control my feelings.

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Sorry.

220
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Huh?

221
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I...

222
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Actually, I don't even have a girlfriend.

223
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,500
So it really is true, huh.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
You figured it out a long time ago?

225
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,700
It feels like you only said that
because you were following my lead.

226
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,700
Kanade-san, you're actually
not very good at lying, are you?

227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's why I feel even more frustrated.

228
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,800
That's why I just can't
give up on Kanade-san.

229
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm really sorry for lying to you.

230
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
It's just that...

231
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Right now, I...

232
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
There's someone I like.

233
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That person.

234
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,600
It's... a man.

235
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I see.

236
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,670
Um...

237
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,599
So it's not about how you feel, Aizawa-san…

238
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I...

239
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
With a girl...

240
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,800
Well... I guess there's
nothing we can do about it.

241
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I...

242
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,000
There's nothing I can do about it anymore.

243
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
I see...

244
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,780
There's nothing I can do...

245
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,200
Why is Kanade-san crying?

246
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm sorry.

247
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
I know I have no right
to say something like this.

248
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
But I understand how you feel.

249
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
If you're all alone.

250
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,260
No matter what I do, it's useless.

251
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
It feels like there's a hole in my heart.

252
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Kanade-san.

253
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,200
To be liked by the person you like.

254
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,600
This really feels like a miracle!

255
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,500
Will I experience a miracle one day too?

256
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
You will.

257
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,529
Someone as wonderful as Aizawa-san is sure
to meet someone even better in the future...

258
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,000
That's not something Kanade-san
should be the one to say.

259
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,000
Ah! Sorry.

260
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,200
Mashiro gave me a miracle.

261
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,800
What I need to do?

262
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,700
It's not running away.

263
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,200
You have to cherish that miracle.

264
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,500
We haven't been in touch at all.

265
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,700
I can't take it anymore.

266
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,360
I don't care about playing hard to get.

267
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Great job. Are you still at work?

268
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Here it comes!

269
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
That's great!

270
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I have something I want to
say. Can we meet next Saturday?

271
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,719
What happened at the aquarium

272
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,300
I really need to apologize properly.

273
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
And also...

274
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,400
Incoming call from Mashiro Kosuke.

275
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
A call?!

276
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Hello...

277
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,500
Good news?

278
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,000
Or is it bad news?

279
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,970
Huh?

280
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:06,200
So, what is it you want to say? Good news or bad news?

281
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,039
Do we really have to talk about
this over the phone right now?

282
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,860
There are still four days until Saturday.

283
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,080
If I keep feeling this conflicted,
there's no way I can focus on my work.

284
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,900
If it's something that makes you feel this
conflicted, there's no way it could be bad news.

285
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
Huh? What?

286
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,689
What did you just say?

287
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,270
Hey, Mashiro.

288
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,649
Things like this only matter
if you say them face to face.

289
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,700
What do you mean? Stop
keeping me in suspense!

290
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,199
Isn't it always better to get
things done as soon as possible?

291
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,399
Ah! Seriously!

292
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't you have any
sense of romance at all?!

293
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Romantic?

294
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,040
Anyway, let's talk when we meet.

295
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,149
Make sure to keep your Saturday free.

296
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,230
Alright, it's settled then.

297
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
How could I possibly
say that over the phone?

298
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Something like, "Thank
you for giving me a miracle."

299
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
You're not about to
break up with me, are you?

300
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
No way, right?

301
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
Say it's not true!!

302
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,500
Ah~ I can't wait for Saturday!!!

303
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Damn it.

304
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,695
(Next Episode Preview)

305
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,416
- It's been three days without any contact?
- Yeah, what do you think that means?

306
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,880
(Did something happen to Mashiro?)

307
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,469
Don't keep in touch so often!

308
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,910
- Mom, Kosuke is the one I care about the most.
- I'll come home to see you often.

309
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,476
(Conflict with Mother) You seem
to be having a great time in Tokyo!

310
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,199
What should I do now?

311
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,369
Isn't the answer already obvious?

312
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,000
Why?

313
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,199
I'm blocking your way!

314
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,319
- I just didn't want you to worry, that's all.
- Why can't you just let me worry about you?

315
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,900
Mashiro, you gave me a miracle.

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Mashiro?

317
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,950
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:59,031
I can't hold it in anymore.
