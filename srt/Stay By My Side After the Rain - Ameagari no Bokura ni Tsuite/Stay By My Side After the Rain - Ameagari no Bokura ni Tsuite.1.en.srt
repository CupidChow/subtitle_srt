1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,800
As long as you set your mind
to it, you can become stronger.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,500
No matter what happens,
you have to accept it all.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,300
If that's the case.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,720
Then there's nothing
left to worry about, right?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Sorry.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Why not?

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Kanade-san.

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,200
Do you have a girlfriend?

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,700
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm never falling in love again.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,100
As long as you make up your mind, choosing
to keep living isn't all that hard.

12
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
You just have to accept it.

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,860
If you stay in a place like
that, you'll catch a cold.

14
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,000
You and I, we're both alone, aren't we?

15
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Is there something you need with my cat?

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Huh?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,300
Seriously, sneaking out again.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,100
Were you just holding
an umbrella for the cat?

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ah, yes.

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
So that's how it is.

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,420
Sorry about that.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,620
You'll catch a cold.
Come on in and have a seat.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,100
Huh?

24
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,600
Hurry up, come on in, have a seat.

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,900
Would you like some hot coffee?

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,400
Ah... Sorry to trouble you.

27
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
The moment I stepped inside.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
For some reason.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
There's a nostalgic kind of flavor.

30
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Kanade.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,670
-Seriously?!

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,800
Is that you, Kanade?

33
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,049
What a coincidence!

34
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,050
Long time no see.

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,900
Huh?

36
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,600
Could it be... you don't remember?

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,949
Weren't we really close
back in high school?

38
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,400
It's me, it's me, Mashiro Kosuke.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Of course I remember.

40
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,519
How could I possibly forget?

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,999
I'm Mashiro Kosuke.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,570
The first one.

44
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,800
The person I truly fell for.

45
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,300
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
(Episode 1)

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,040
What are the odds of
something like this happening?

48
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:59,276
If we'd run into each other
back home, that'd be one thing.

49
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,628
But this is Tokyo, and in a place like this, no less.

50
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,200
Running into each other again in a place like this.
Honestly, you can only call it a miracle.

51
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Yeah, that's true.

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,969
Honestly, that's just so like you.

53
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,800
You even held an umbrella for a cat.

54
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Huh?

55
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,200
You've always been
gentle, even back in high school.

56
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,900
You haven't changed at all.

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,600
Here, have some mackerel sandwiches. It's treated.

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,759
Sorry.

59
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,809
Thank you.

60
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,400
Looks delicious.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,850
I can't finish it all by myself.

62
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,100
Mashiro, you should have half too.

63
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Is that okay?

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Thanks!

65
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,200
Delicious! This is just way too good!

66
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Kanade, you should have some too.

67
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm going to dig in.

68
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
So delicious!

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Right!

70
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:20,027
What kind of work are you doing now?

71
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
Publishing company, sales.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What about you?

73
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Site management for a construction company.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
The current construction
site just happens to be nearby.

75
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
I see.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Is Kanade's company nearby too?

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,900
No, I...

78
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,600
My place is just around here.

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Do you live alone?

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

82
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
No.

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
What about you?

84
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah, I do.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
I wish I could say that, but actually, no.

86
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
I see.

87
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,940
Thank you for your hospitality.

88
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,700
- Come again next time.
- Sure.

89
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Wait a second.

90
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,520
Tell me your contact information.

91
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,920
Huh?

92
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,560
Since we don't get to see each other often,
let's grab a meal together next time.

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Yeah.

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,229
Why?

95
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,100
Why?!

96
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
He hasn't changed one bit.

97
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,100
I clearly decided that I wouldn't
fall for anyone ever again.

98
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,099
No, there's really no point in doing that.

99
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I even gave him my phone number.

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,900
By the way, do you think
he'll actually contact me?

101
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,400
Let's go have a meal together.
Something like that...

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
He's probably just being polite.

103
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,300
If you're free this Saturday,
let's go have a meal together.

104
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,500
Did you make your own lunch again today?

105
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,200
Kanamori.

106
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,000
Kanade-kun, you've been bringing your own
lunch every day since you first started here.

107
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,300
Actually, I don't mind cooking at all.

108
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:42,456
That's really impressive.

109
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,096
My husband thinks even stepping
into the kitchen is too much trouble.

110
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,279
Kanamori, I've been hearing you
say that to me ever since I was a rookie.

111
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Is that so?

112
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Speaking of which,

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You got confessed to?

114
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,200
Huh?

115
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,000
Sumire-chan.

116
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,500
How did you know?

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,000
That kid might be a little too straightforward
sometimes, but she's really a good person.

118
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,480
She really seems to like you, Kanade-kun.

119
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,067
Not long ago, she even said she wanted
to give something to you, Kanade-kun…

120
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,004
Excuse me.

121
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
I have another appointment.

122
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm heading out now.

123
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Kanade-san.

124
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,700
These are last month's
figures from Sumi Bookstore.

125
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Thank you.

126
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,930
It's perfect, I was just about to head over there.
This really helps me out a lot.

127
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,266
I'm really sorry for confessing my
feelings to you so suddenly yesterday.

128
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,290
But...

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I like Kanade-san.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,689
Sorry to keep you waiting.

131
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,490
- I just got here too, it's totally fine.
- Have you been waiting long?

132
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Sorry...

133
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,609
Falling for you.

134
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,800
Why are you apologizing?

135
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,980
Kanade, you didn't do anything wrong.

136
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
But...

137
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
Let's just stay friends from now on.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Sorry about that.

139
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,450
The train was delayed.

140
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,569
Yeah, there was a bit of a delay.

141
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,200
Is that so?

142
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:32,900
But I'm really glad I still made
it here without any trouble.

143
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,699
Once you've decided on the
order quantity, please give us a call.

144
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,509
As long as it's within today, I can
definitely secure enough.

145
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,200
- Alright, I'll leave it to you.
- Okay.

146
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,200
(Mashiro Kosuke, 2 messages)

147
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,370
There's a message.

148
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,500
Are you at work right now?

149
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,900
Hey, did you see the
message I sent yesterday?

150
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,880
You still haven't read it, so I'm a little
worried you might not have received it…

151
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
Who are you waiting for a message from?

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,800
No... I reached out, but
there's just been no reply.

153
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,700
Could it be that you got rejected?

154
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,000
Huh?

155
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,240
It's just a sign there's no hope.

156
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
Give it up.

157
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
That's not it.

158
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:34,992
Let's change to some fresh water.

159
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,700
Incoming call from Mashiro Kosuke.

160
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Still not giving up, huh?

161
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,000
Sorry, I can't take your call right now.
Please leave your message after the beep...

162
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,500
Hey! Are you busy with work?

163
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Is something wrong?

164
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,299
Honestly, am I being too annoying?

165
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Hello~

166
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,000
Waiting for your reply.

167
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,580
- Sorry for the trouble.
- No problem.

168
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,391
Mashiro isn't contacting me anymore.

169
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,284
This is enough.

170
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,920
The construction site I'm working
at right now happens to be nearby.

171
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,800
What am I even doing?

172
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,100
Out here again, huh?

173
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Come here.

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Take this!

175
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,910
Mashiro!

176
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,600
I knew you'd show up after all.

177
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,100
- Huh?
- I thought you might show up.

178
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,800
So I come by to check every day.

179
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,276
I couldn't contact you.

180
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:41,147
If I didn't do this, I'd
never get to see you.

181
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,799
Are you some kind of stalker?

182
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
Huh? What do you mean, stalker!

183
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,400
We're friends, aren't we!

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,800
You're really heartless, you know.

185
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,299
I was even worried something
might have happened to you.

186
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,940
I was really worried about you over here.

187
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,300
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

188
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,700
Can we talk for a bit?

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hmm...

190
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
What's wrong?

191
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
I...

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,300
Am I really that annoying?

193
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm...

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah.

195
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm gay...

196
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah.

197
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,520
It was the same before, too.

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Even after graduation, after leaving
my hometown, it was still the same.

199
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
A lot of things happened that
were really hard to deal with.

200
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
So...

201
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
Is that why you haven't been
replying to my messages?

202
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,200
Back in high school...

203
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,600
I used to like you.

204
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't want to fall for you again.

205
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,800
So... just leave me alone.

206
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:57,849
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Kanade.

208
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:28,415
We don't need to keep in touch anymore.

209
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,200
Even though I'd already made up my mind.

210
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,600
Even though I'd already accepted it.

211
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Mashiro.

212
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,600
You just said you used to like me, right?

213
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,100
Fall for me all over again.

214
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Because I feel the same way.

215
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,300
Because I like you too.

216
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Stop joking around!

217
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I'm...

218
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,919
I mean it.

219
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,400
I'm serious about you, too.

220
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I would never joke
about something like this.

221
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,200
B-but...

222
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,110
Didn't you have a girlfriend before?

223
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,379
The way you say "like" and the way I say
it are definitely not the same, are they?

224
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,540
There's no difference at all!

225
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,600
Trust me!

226
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,899
If you don't trust me, then we
can't even get started, can we!

227
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
It's okay if we don't start!

228
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,300
A kind of gentleness that feels
like pity is actually a burden for me.

229
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,999
If I could forget about you, things
would be so much easier for me!

230
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm not going to make it easy for you!

231
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
I won't give up.

232
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Until you're willing to trust me.

233
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,500
I'll keep calling you, too.

234
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I'll keep inviting you until you're willing
to have a meal and hang out together.

235
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,600
Maybe I'll even lie in wait for you.

236
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,140
Looking forward to working with you!

237
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,920
If you really don't like me, Kanade...

238
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,940
I'll think about it again.

239
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't dislike you.

240
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
That's great.

241
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,200
The rain has stopped.

242
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,870
Yeah.

243
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Ah.

244
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,350
Mackerel sandwich.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

245
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,200
Here it comes!

246
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,900
This is it! Time to dig in.

247
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah, this is delicious!

248
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
It really is the best!

249
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Mashiro.

250
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
What do you do when you're feeling down?

251
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Never happened.

252
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Huh?

253
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,620
As long as you make up your
mind, you can become stronger.

254
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,900
No matter what happens,
you have to accept it all.

255
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,800
If that's the case, then there's
nothing left to worry about, right?

256
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:15,679
Yeah, is something wrong?

257
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,030
Yeah, it's nothing.

258
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,813
What will happen between
Mashiro and me from here on out?

259
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,800
- Delicious.
- Right?

260
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,000
For now, I'll just set my resolve aside.

261
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,930
(Next Episode Preview)
Great job out there.

262
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:47,749
He's totally my type.

263
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,490
Can I really trust you?
Are you okay?

264
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:51,439
It took a lot of courage for
me to ask you out today...

265
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,040
(Confessing their feelings
to each other for the first time)

266
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,699
Even with just two guys hanging
out, we can still have an amazing time.

267
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,820
Keep your eyes on the court!

268
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,400
I want to kiss you.

269
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,330
Huh?!

270
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,700
What are you talking about?
