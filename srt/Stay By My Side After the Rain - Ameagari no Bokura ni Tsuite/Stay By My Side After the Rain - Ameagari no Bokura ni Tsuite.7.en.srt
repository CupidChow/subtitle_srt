1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,680
Today is the first time Mashiro has come to my house.

2
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,580
Even though I just happened to air out
the comforter while I was at it...

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,500
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
(Episode 7)

5
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,340
They haven't arrived yet.

6
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,150
Huh?

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
You're meeting up with someone, aren't you?

8
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,870
How did you know?

9
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,340
It's written all over your face.

10
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,530
As expected of the manager.

11
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,340
You saw right through everything.

12
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,360
If I can't read my customers' minds,
I can't call myself first-rate.

13
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,350
Hot coffee and a mackerel sandwich?

14
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,820
I'll have it iced today.

15
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,690
This is all I need.

16
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,350
Okay.
Iced coffee.

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,130
Yes.

18
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,380
Wow, this is so good.

19
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,180
That's just unbelievable.

20
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,300
This is seriously unbelievable.

21
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,680
That's just unbelievable.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,890
Delicious.
Seriously, this...

23
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,270
This is seriously amazing.

24
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,550
Mashiro.

25
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,920
Do you want to go sing karaoke together later?

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,980
Let's go together.

27
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,200
Sorry.

28
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,050
I need to hurry home.

29
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,980
I see.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,140
Mashiro, your family is really strict with you.

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,380
Let's go together next time.

32
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,280
Yeah.

33
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,360
See you then.

34
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,770
We're heading out first.

35
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,240
Huh, what songs are we going to sing?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,980
I've already made up my mind.

37
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,900
What? Come on, tell me!

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,340
Is club over?

39
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,740
Don't take a detour, just go straight home.

40
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,180
Kanade.

41
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,680
Are you heading home now?

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,920
I was on cleaning duty today, so I'm a bit late.

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,750
Let's go together.

44
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah.

45
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,810
Do you want to check out the new café
that just opened in front of the station?

46
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,510
You can apparently pick your own toppings and everything.
I heard it's supposed to be really delicious.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,360
But...
I...

48
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,840
I've always wanted to check it out.

49
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,130
You can add things like whipped cream for free.

50
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,280
Isn't it awesome?

51
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,740
Let's go check it out.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,770
Yeah, let's go.

53
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,080
We waited in line for such a long time.

54
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,050
I didn't expect there to be so many people.

55
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,590
What is this? It tastes really good.

56
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,560
Mmm~

57
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,140
Mine tastes amazing too!

58
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,950
For real?

59
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,140
Hey, let me have a sip!

60
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,780
Hey.

61
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,510
Ah, you drank way too much!

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,950
Ah, that's really good.

63
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,660
What do you mean by “so good”?

64
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,140
Who drinks like that?

65
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,150
That was way more than just one sip.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
I really don't want to go home…

67
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,710
Huh?

68
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,140
No, not really.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,080
Do you want to try mine too?

70
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,700
Huh?

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,840
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

72
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,070
Thank you.

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
Tastes great!

74
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,950
Right.

75
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,070
Mashiro.

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.

77
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,830
I just got here.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,940
That's great.

79
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,320
Welcome.

80
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,960
Iced coffee?

81
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,260
Ah...

82
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,580
Yes.
I'll have an iced one.

83
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,640
Right.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,140
What should we do later?

85
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,600
Do you want to go out to eat somewhere?

86
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,920
It's not often we get to stay at home.

87
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,790
Let's cook together.

88
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,840
Yeah.
Sure.

89
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,030
Alright, first we need to go buy the ingredients.

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,730
Mashiro, are you good at making hamburger steak?

91
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,200
Why do you ask?

92
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,400
Because you said you wanted to make it.

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,290
Ah! Because I want to eat it.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,820
That's it?

95
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,150
Yeah.

96
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,520
This isn't your first time making it, is it?

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,960
Yeah, for hamburger steak.

98
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,060
What do you usually eat?

99
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,510
Udon or spaghetti and stuff like that.

100
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,240
Sometimes I make somen noodles too.

101
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
That just needs to be boiled for a bit, right?

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,170
Yeah.

103
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,500
Let me do it.

104
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,200
Mashiro, you make the salad.

105
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,050
OK.

106
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,170
So he's still going to stay over, right?

107
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,260
But.

108
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,060
Even if we end up staying over,
it doesn't necessarily mean something's going to happen.

109
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,720
But what if…

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,050
That really happened...

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,290
Even though I'm a little scared.

112
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,370
I think it would be really happy.

113
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,630
Are you going to cry or laugh? Pick one.

114
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,770
Huh?

115
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,310
I get that chopping onions can make you cry.

116
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,830
Why do you keep giggling?

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,660
It's nothing.

118
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,880
Oh~

119
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,850
This is so much fun!

120
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,680
You sprinkled too much.

121
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,790
Don't sweat the details so much.

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,630
I'll definitely make something super delicious for you, just watch.

123
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,380
You're just mixing it, aren't you.

124
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,900
For hamburger steak,

125
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,000
This kneading step is the real key.

126
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,710
Knead, knead.

127
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Ah! It's spilling everywhere.

128
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,210
Okay.
Okay.

129
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,340
You can answer it.

130
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,840
It's okay.

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,670
This must be my mom again.

132
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,240
I see.

133
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,840
Stop worrying about it so much.

134
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,380
It's not like it's anything important anyway.

135
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,420
Mixing it like this should be good enough, right?

136
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,220
Yeah.

137
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,410
Then let's start shaping it.

138
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,720
I just feel like...

139
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,970
A wall has been built between us.

140
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,400
This is so good!

141
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,370
Oh no, I can't stop.

142
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,800
Calm down, take your time and eat slowly.

143
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,730
If I'd known, I would've bought more meat.

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,080
I haven't touched this yet.

145
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,560
Is that okay?

146
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,530
Never mind.

147
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,950
Huh?

148
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,480
It's not every day we get to make hamburger steak together.

149
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,490
I hope Kanade can also enjoy.

150
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
Well then...

151
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,340
Half for each of us.

152
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,440
Thank you.

153
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,520
This one tastes the best!

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,950
They're all the same.

155
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,300
Is there any rice left?

156
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,350
There's none left.

157
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,130
When you went to get more rice earlier, it was already out.

158
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,110
Oh, really.

159
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,610
By the way, eating 3 bowls of rice is a bit much, don't you think?

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,370
No, that's not it.

161
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,330
The bowls are so small, so eating that much is totally normal.

162
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,290
How come you never gain any weight?

163
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,620
Because I work out.

164
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,110
Ah!

165
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,980
I'm full now, thanks for the meal.

166
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,870
Ah, this is so delicious.

167
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,610
I'm wondering…

168
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,520
Is this the green you put in the salad?

169
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,090
Don't call it grass, it's pea shoots.

170
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,660
This.

171
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,860
Does it taste good just eating it like this?

172
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,750
Ah! No way!

173
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,160
I've been taking really good care of it, you know.

174
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Sorry, sorry.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,590
By the way, are you still hungry?

176
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,520
When it comes to delicious food, I can always eat more.

177
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,720
Oh no.

178
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,290
You're definitely going to get chubby in the future.

179
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,800
- Chubby.
- Cut it out.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,020
It's really ticklish.

181
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,910
If we lived together.

182
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,580
Will it feel like this every day?

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,780
Huh?

184
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,240
If that's the case...

185
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,020
It sounds like it would be a lot of fun.

186
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,780
Right?

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,740
Ah!

188
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,570
I forgot I bought pudding.

189
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,520
Do you want some?

190
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,720
Yeah, I do.

191
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,030
Well then...

192
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,470
I'll do the dishes.

193
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,730
Thank you.

194
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,080
That scared me to death.

195
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,460
Coffee...

196
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,170
Do you want a refill?

197
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,460
I'm good, thanks.

198
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,710
Because I won't be able to sleep.

199
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,660
Oh, I see.

200
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,260
It's getting late.

201
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,060
Is it that late already?

202
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,080
What do normal adult couples usually do at a time like this?

203
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,190
Are there any unspoken rules or anything like that?

204
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,620
Um...

205
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,780
Hm?

206
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,640
Today...

207
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,850
What should we do?

208
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,030
What should we do...

209
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,490
It's ringing.

210
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,490
It's probably better to answer it…

211
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,630
I told you, it's fine.

212
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,640
Wait.

213
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,150
Why?

214
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,090
It should be fine.

215
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,280
No.

216
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,220
I just have this feeling...

217
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,190
Mashiro is so scary.

218
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,400
Mashiro?

219
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,750
Sorry.

220
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,570
I think I'll just head home today.

221
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,830
Huh?

222
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,360
I'll get in touch with you later.

223
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,170
I'll head out first, then.

224
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,430
I...

225
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,670
Did I mess things up?

226
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,780
Ah~

227
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,900
What was I doing!

228
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,790
I see.

229
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,000
Kanade, so you subconsciously reject them?

230
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,680
Yeah...

231
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,650
So.

232
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,920
You're worried that you might have hurt the other person, aren't you.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,990
Sorry for talking to you about something like this.

234
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,760
But I really don't know what to do on my own.

235
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,370
It's really hard to talk to others about something this sensitive.

236
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,610
If you don't mind, I can listen to you.

237
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,430
I'll do everything I can, too.

238
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,640
Thank you, both of you.

239
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,550
So.

240
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,190
Since that day, Kanade, you guys...

241
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,330
Did it get awkward?

242
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,740
No.

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,170
We're in touch almost every day.

244
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,270
You've worked hard.

245
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,910
I just had level 6 spicy curry at the curry shop earlier.
Ended up with an upset stomach.

246
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,710
But it was really delicious.

247
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,750
Let's go together next time.

248
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,800
We also go out together, just the two of us, on weekends.

249
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,300
Did you also get the T-shirt you wore at the aquarium from there?

250
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,030
Yeah.

251
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,260
You don't think it's lame, do you?

252
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,000
I never thought that at all.

253
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,290
You could say our relationship is surprisingly close.

254
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,430
In that case…

255
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
Is there a problem?

256
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,160
We've also

257
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,750
been to each other's houses several times.

258
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,930
Do you want to go see this movie next time?

259
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,410
Sure, but this is a sequel, right?

260
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,880
Mashiro, have you seen the first movie?

261
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,310
I haven't seen it.

262
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,300
I wonder if it's available on any streaming platforms.

263
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,350
Ah.

264
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,800
It's already so late.

265
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,520
Let me walk you to the station.

266
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,350
Yeah.

267
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,430
Then let's go.

268
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,550
Huh?

269
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,090
Let's go.

270
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,680
“That thing” never happened again...

271
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,480
That's because…

272
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,950
He really cherishes you, Kanade, doesn't he?

273
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,650
I also think the other person has probably become more cautious.

274
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,150
Is that so?

275
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,950
So, Kanade-san, in your heart,

276
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,120
What do you think about it?
Yeah.

277
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,930
Huh?

278
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,490
If something like that happened,

279
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,980
You don't mind it?

280
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,860
What do you think?

281
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,280
That's...

282
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,120
If you don't mind,

283
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,950
Maybe next time…

284
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,950
How about you take the initiative, Kanade-san?

285
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh!
I take the initiative?

286
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,030
That's right.

287
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,860
Otherwise…

288
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,180
It'll just keep going like this forever.

289
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,940
It might never change, you know.

290
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,070
Maybe things will just stay the same
and nothing will ever change.

291
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,000
Well then...

292
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,500
What should I do?

293
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,380
If backing down isn't an option...

294
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,360
Just try making the first move!

295
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:51,170
What should I do if I'm supposed to make the first move?

296
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,120
I don't know.

297
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,900
I don't know.

298
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,370
I really have no idea!

299
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,010
Wait...

300
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,230
Why did I stop him back then?

301
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,210
Because I was a little scared.

302
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,010
It didn't feel like the Mashiro I usually know.

303
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Why?

304
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,410
Does Mashiro have a side I haven't seen yet?

305
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,710
Mashiro is really scary.

306
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,170
Then let's go.

307
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,190
Huh?

308
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,220
Let's go.

309
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,840
Why do I feel so restless?

310
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,300
(Mitsuko is calling)

311
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,090
That curry place really is the best after all.

312
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,640
Don't get an upset stomach again, okay?

313
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,710
No problem.

314
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,090
I only had level 5 spicy today.

315
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,670
The movie you were looking for last time
is now available on the streaming platform.

316
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,560
For real?

317
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,350
How about we watch it together when we get home?

318
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,360
Yeah.

319
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,170
- I'm really looking forward to it.
- Yeah, me too.

320
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,870
I wonder if that one's connected to the sequel.

321
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,880
Kosuke!

322
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,790
What's wrong?

323
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,720
What do you mean by "what's wrong"?

324
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,880
As your mother, I have to come see where you live.

325
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,390
Mother?

326
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,430
Are you friends?

327
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,730
Um...

328
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,230
I...

329
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,300
Yes, we're friends.

330
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,100
I see.

331
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,490
Kosuke's always been in your care.

332
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,310
No, I should be the one thanking you…

333
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,640
If you were coming.

334
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,050
You could at least let me know first.

335
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,630
Because you never pick up the phone, Kosuke.

336
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,570
I was really worried.

337
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,380
Why didn't you answer the phone?

338
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,190
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,170
Forget it.

340
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll be living in Tokyo from now on, too.

341
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,500
Huh?

342
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,030
Didn't we talk about this before?
Let's live together in Tokyo.

343
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,610
Did you forget?

344
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,030
No... but...

345
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,700
I don't have any plans to move for now.

346
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,840
And besides, if we're going to live together in my current room…

347
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
I don't mind living in a smaller place.

348
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,950
Because we're a family.

349
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,630
Oh, right.

350
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,880
How about the three of us go out and have some fun later?

351
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,350
Huh?

352
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,580
I would like to check out a shop.

353
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,790
Is that okay?

354
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,560
No, but…

355
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,800
Because it just feels bad to send a friend home.

356
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,020
What's your name?

357
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,620
My name is Kanade Shinichiro.

358
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,250
Oh, so your name is Shinichiro.

359
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,530
You're really good-looking.

360
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,790
If the three of us walk together.

361
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,910
Being sandwiched between two handsome guys
would look like I own a harem.

362
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,310
Right? Kosuke…

363
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,370
Don't touch Kanade.

364
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,610
Huh?

365
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,760
Mashiro?

366
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,950
Don't…

367
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Don't get in my way.

368
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,080
What do you mean by that?

369
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,140
Please…

370
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,270
Stop getting in my way…

371
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,860
(Next Episode)
You've really been through a lot, haven't you.

372
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,430
(Deepening conflict with mother)
I thought I was fine.

378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,840
I really want to be with Mashiro...

00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,780
