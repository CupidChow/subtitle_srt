1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,300
Morning will surely come.

2
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,600
Make a pot of miso soup
with seasonal vegetables.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm digging in.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,800
Having breakfast while
watching the weather forecast.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
Prepare the lunchbox.

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,000
Check on the condition of the marimo.

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
A morning just like any other.

8
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,700
It's just that, except for that one thing.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Are you home already?

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
Yeah, what about Mashiro?

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm here too, taking a shower right now. The
mackerel sandwich is absolutely delicious.

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,880
Three plates really was too much after all.

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,100
Oh no, a sudden wave
of drowsiness just hit me.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,969
Don't fall asleep in the bathroom, okay?

15
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm done with my shower.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,300
As I thought, this isn't a dream.

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,700
What he said yesterday.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
You just said you used to like me, right?

19
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,591
Fall for me all over again.

20
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,300
Because I like you too.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,300
But I still can't fully believe it.

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,100
No matter how I think about it.

23
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,500
It all just feels like a fantasy made
up in the mind of a lonely single guy...

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Can I really trust you?

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,400
If you really don't like me, Kanade...

26
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
I'll think about it.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
I don't dislike you.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

29
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,300
(Episode 2)

30
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,089
A confession from your first crush?

31
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,860
Yeah, we ran into each other by chance a while
ago, and out of the blue, he told me he liked me.

32
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,740
I can't believe something this
dramatic actually happened.

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,000
In the end, I got fooled.

34
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Huh?

35
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,200
He already has a girlfriend.

36
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
I was just played by him.

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,100
Come on, you can't
just believe it right away.

38
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,180
Something that feels like a dream
like that could never actually happen.

39
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:33,600
Sorry, just a moment.

40
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Kanade-kun.

41
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you free tonight?

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tonight?

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,700
If it's convenient for you…

44
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,400
Sumire-chan wants to spend
more time with Kanade...

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,300
Oh, sorry, please wait a moment.

46
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
If you're free tonight,
let's grab dinner together.

47
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,480
I've already made a reservation
at the restaurant for 8 PM tonight.

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,000
If it doesn't work for you, just
let me know and I'll reschedule.

49
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Here's the location!

50
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,600
I haven't even said I'm going yet.

51
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,330
- Hm?
- Huh?

52
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,089
Oh, it's nothing, sorry about that.

53
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,830
I've got something going on tonight.

54
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,800
I see. Let's plan for another time, then.

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Mashiro always manages to cut off
my escape route before I even realize it.

56
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,940
But actually, it makes
me feel a bit relieved.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,500
As long as there's a way out,
I'll always want to run away.

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Got it.

59
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,900
Kanade, over here!

60
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,190
Thank you for waiting.

61
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,700
Wow, here it comes!

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
Is it okay if I just order whatever?

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,300
- Mm-hmm.
- Is there anything you don't like to eat?

64
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
No worries, anything's fine.

65
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Then... the assorted skewers, eight of them,
and the extra-large fried meat patty, and...

66
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,300
He's totally my type.

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,399
No, rather than saying
Mashiro is my ideal type.

68
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,500
It's more like my ideal type has
turned into someone just like Mashiro.

69
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,470
Then let's add an order of potato salad.

70
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,200
Alright.
And some edamame, too.

71
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,345
- Sure.
- That'll be all for now.

72
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,060
Understood.
Thank you for your help.

73
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,600
Let's make a toast!

74
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,900
- Great job.
- Thanks for your hard work.

75
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,800
Feels like I've come back to life.

76
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Kanade, are you doing okay?

77
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Huh?

78
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,900
We just saw each other yesterday.

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,559
I've been thinking about you.

80
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,900
Saying that might surprise you, right?

81
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,430
Are you good with alcohol?

82
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Ah, I'd say I'm pretty average.

83
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
How about you?

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Do you think I look weak?

85
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,600
Mashiro, you're always so bold,
whether it's eating or drinking.

86
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
People often say that about me.
They say I eat way too fast.

87
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,030
I had ramen for lunch today.

88
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,969
There's a place I go to a lot.

89
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,124
I always order the large bowl.

90
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,560
I went with the large bowl
again today, just like always...

91
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,570
Thanks to Mashiro.

92
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm slowly starting to feel less nervous.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,370
But the sense of unease just kept growing.

94
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,480
Thanks for waiting.
Another cocktail, please.

95
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,350
Alright.

96
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,710
- And then, I started wondering...
- Why doesn't Mashiro ever get nervous?

97
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,060
Is he just used to this kind of thing?

98
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,000
Having dinner one-on-one
with someone you like.

99
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,400
Normally, your heart
would be racing, right?

100
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,850
I guess he really
doesn't like me after all.

101
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,899
Sorry, I'm going to the
restroom for a moment.

102
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Okay.

103
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
What am I feeling disappointed about?

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,040
Hasn't it always ended in disappointment
whenever I let myself hope for something?

105
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Sorry...

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,889
Falling for you.

107
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,230
Why are you apologizing?

108
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But...

110
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,340
Let's just stay friends from now on.

111
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Sorry about that.

112
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Good morning.

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,580
Oh...

114
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,300
Hey, can I borrow a pen for
a sec? I forgot my pencil case.

115
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,300
If you could just bluntly turn me down with
some harsh words, it would be so much easier.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,500
What's wrong?

117
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:19,700
Did something happen?

118
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,040
What's going on?

119
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,800
You haven't seemed very energetic lately.

120
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,800
I never realized I was such
a narrow-minded person...

121
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,700
- What?
- Ah, it's nothing, really.

122
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,300
I just want falling for
someone to be normal.

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,500
Just to have a normal relationship.

124
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,900
Just to date like any ordinary couple.

125
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,900
I just wanted something simple like that.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Kanade, you're really interesting.
Want to go on a date next time?

127
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,560
(Sure, I'd like to see you too.)

128
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,000
- Sorry for being late on our first date.
- Oh, it's okay.

129
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Is it okay if we go here?

130
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
What?

131
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Let's go.

132
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,739
Um...

133
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Huh?

134
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,330
Sorry!

135
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,000
Why is it that I just can't do it?

136
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:59,535
I don't want to hurt myself
or anyone else anymore,

137
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:03,092
just for the sake of building a
deep connection with someone.

138
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait for Mashiro to come back.

139
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Let's just go home.

140
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Incoming call from Mashiro Kosuke.

141
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Mashiro?

142
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Kanade...

143
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Help!

144
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,300
Mashiro! Are you okay?

145
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I can't move...

146
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,230
Wait a second.
I'll call an ambulance…

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,560
I feel like I'm going to throw up…

148
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
Huh?

149
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,800
I'm really terrible at holding my liquor…

150
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,599
Ah! No, I can't!

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
Wait! Over there! Hold on, are you okay?

152
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,650
Ah! Just a little longer.

153
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,726
Over here, over here,
over here! Yes, that's it!

154
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,879
Ah! Wait!

155
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
No way!!!

156
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
You saw me in a really embarrassing state.

157
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you an idiot?

158
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,361
You know you can't handle your
liquor, but you still drink like that.

159
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,600
I can't help it.

160
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,100
Because I was really nervous.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Huh?

162
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,500
Drinking alone with someone you like. Just two of us!

163
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Can anyone really stay
calm in this situation?

164
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,200
But Mashiro, you been
totally normal the whole time.

165
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,100
If they find out I'm nervous…
wouldn't that be kind of lame?

166
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,300
Today, I really...

167
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,340
It took so much courage
for me to ask you out.

168
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,000
Was what happened
yesterday really not a dream?

169
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,400
I kept checking my phone over and over.

170
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,040
I was worried about whether it
was okay to ask you out right away.

171
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,800
"First date," "relaxed," "delicious."

172
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,300
I was stressing over what kind of place
to pick that would make you happy.

173
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,800
I really agonized over it for a long time.

174
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,700
I misunderstood.

175
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,860
I thought you were really used
to this kind of thing, Mashiro...

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Overthinking things on my own.

177
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,104
Overthinking?

178
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,700
Actually, what you said
yesterday, Mashiro...

179
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,700
I still can't believe it.

180
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
I understand.

181
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,040
If you think about it carefully.

182
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,400
A lot of things just happened so suddenly.

183
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Meeting again.

184
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,200
Suddenly saying I like you and all that...

185
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Hmm...

186
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm really happy to see you again.

187
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm afraid you'll slip away again.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm starting to get a little anxious.

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When it comes down to it.

190
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,800
Even I'm not really sure how I feel.

191
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Huh?

192
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,800
Doesn't that just mean
you don't like me...?

193
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,800
Like you, don't like you.

194
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,800
Believing, not believing.

195
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
Feelings are just like that.

196
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,500
It's something shapeless
and hard to define.

197
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,700
Being asked to show proof.

198
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,920
This isn't something you
can just show or prove.

199
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,700
That's true, I guess.

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But...

201
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I've always remembered.

202
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
You.

203
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Huh?

204
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Ever since graduating
from high school until now.

205
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,000
The anniversary of Dad's passing.

206
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,300
When I first came to Tokyo.

207
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,220
After I started working at the company.

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,520
The days when everything went smoothly.

209
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,180
On days when things aren't
going so well, and times like that…

210
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,800
Whenever something
happens, I think of Kanade.

211
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,620
I find myself wondering what
you might be doing right now.

212
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
I really want to see him.

213
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,700
I really want to talk to him.

214
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Before that

215
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:21,215
I've never given a name to my own feelings.

216
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,800
But when you told me
you liked me, Kanade...

217
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,100
I think I must feel the same way.

218
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,700
Back in high school.

219
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,200
I've always… liked you.

220
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:58,427
I wonder if I managed
to get my feelings across?

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,400
You got your feelings
across, loud and clear.

222
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Mashiro, you...

223
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,300
You never forgot about me.

224
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Thank you.

225
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Are you okay?

226
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,800
So... so close...

228
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,700
He keeps looking at me.

229
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,500
Um, Kanade...

230
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
W-What?

231
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
I want to kiss you.

232
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,909
What?! What are you even saying?!

233
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,410
You...

234
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,466
Saying something like that out
of the blue… in a place like this…

235
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,300
- Is that not okay?
- Stay away!

236
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Because...

237
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
It's… it's my first time.

238
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,740
I've never had that kind
of experience either…

239
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,509
At our age already.

240
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,230
I know I'll get laughed at for saying this…

241
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,900
I just feel like doing something
like this while drunk isn't really right.

242
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:34,460
Does that mean it's okay
as long as I'm not drunk?

243
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,100
Huh?

244
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,679
Are you saying it would
be okay if I wasn't drunk?

245
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,199
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

246
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,940
Ah!!

247
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:42,100
Why do you need to drink?

248
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm such an idiot!

249
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Mashiro!

250
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Mashiro!

251
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,099
- Damn it.
- Don't be like that.

252
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,000
- Damn it.
- Hey, you two guys!

253
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,500
You've got a lot of energy!

254
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,020
There are lots of cute girls here.
Want to come and join us?

255
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,559
It's a great deal right now.

256
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,000
No, thank you.

257
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,300
Don't say that. Isn't it kind of boring
for just two guys to drink together?

258
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,300
Shut up, idiot!

259
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Huh? What did you just say?

260
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,500
I told you, shut up.

261
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,500
I told you to mind your own business.

262
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,000
Even if it's just two guys hanging out, we can still
have a great time. Don't go saying it's boring so easily!

263
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,380
That's right, that's right.

264
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,430
You've got some nerve, huh.
You guys.

265
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,900
Hey! Let's talk somewhere else.

266
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Huh...?

267
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Run!

268
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,400
Hey!
Stop! Hey!

269
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,769
Stop right there!

270
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,930
Don't look back!

271
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,550
Keep your eyes on the road ahead!

272
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's always like this
when I'm with Mashiro.

273
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Ready.

274
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Go, go...

275
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,139
- Take this!
- Hey! Cut it out already.

276
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Hey!

277
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,900
This really makes me feel alive.

278
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,700
That must be because
Mashiro is by my side.

279
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
I...

280
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I want to have a normal
romance with Mashiro.

281
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,200
I had a great time today, thank you.

282
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,000
You'd better take some antacids.

283
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,200
How about going somewhere
together during this break?

284
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Let's go, let's go!

285
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,720
Let me think about where I want to go!

286
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,000
This time, I definitely won't drink again.

287
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,500
Um... could it be that...

288
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,700
Does that mean you want to kiss?

289
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,320
Are you home yet?

290
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,300
I want to hear your voice.
Can I give you a call?

291
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Hello.

292
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
Sorry I couldn't get in touch with you.

293
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,900
Nothing's really changed.

294
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:38,684
I really want to see you too.

295
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,699
(Next Episode)
Kanade, I've kept you waiting, haven't I?

296
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,269
(First Date)
Today is my first date with Mashiro.

297
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,759
How do you think we look to other people?

298
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,199
Why did you fall for me?

299
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,830
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

300
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,400
(A woman's shadow?!)
Who is Mitsuko?

301
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,599
(Is their relationship
moving at lightning speed?)

302
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
Mashiro, I...
