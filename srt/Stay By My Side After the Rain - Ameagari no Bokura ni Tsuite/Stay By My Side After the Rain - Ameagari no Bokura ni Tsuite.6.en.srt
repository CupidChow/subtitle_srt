1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,390
You're the first person I've ever truly liked.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,520
Kanade?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,100
What a coincidence! Long time no see.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,960
I don't want to fall for you again.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,240
Because I like you too.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,500
Even if it's just two guys hanging out,
we can still have an awesome time together.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,160
I want to have a normal relationship with Mashiro.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,250
I just feel like...

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,400
I guess I still like Kanade after all.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
Do you have a girlfriend?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,000
No, that's not it.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,700
Of course I was lying.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,400
What I should do isn't running away.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
We need to cherish miracles.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,480
Then I'll help you restock a few copies of the missing books.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,800
Could you please add about 5 more copies?

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,340
Alright, got it.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,160
Oh! And one more thing. Next month,
Ms. Kiriyama has a new book coming out.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,390
We're planning to hold a promotional event.

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,000
Could you consider this part?

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,150
In that case, could you get me a set, please?

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,600
Thank you.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
Kanade-san, you seem especially energetic today.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,310
Huh? Really?

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,400
Did something good happen?

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,100
No, it's nothing.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,580
Everything is just like usual.

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,470
Really?
Yes.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
I'll be counting on you, then.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,270
I feel an emotion I've never experienced before.

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,600
It's welling up from a place inside me that even I don't recognize.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,300
It feels like I'm living in a world completely different from before.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,700
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
(Episode 6)

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
I... I can't believe this is happening...

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
My heart's racing this much…

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,260
Ah! This is so delicious!

38
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,550
Alright! Let's head to the next spot!

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,620
Alright, I'll head out first.

40
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,800
Hey, thanks for your hard work!

41
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,860
You worked hard too.

42
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,070
Kanade-san, are you heading back?

43
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,590
Yeah, I have to go to Furin Bookstore
first thing tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,540
Oh, come on.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,900
I was hoping that if we could hang out just the two of us after,
I'd finally get a chance to really ask you.

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,700
Huh?

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,400
So, what happened after you waited in ambush for him?

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm really sorry for making you worry, Aizawa-san.

49
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,060
Did it go smoothly?

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,950
Hmm...

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,500
That's great! Congratulations!

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Thank you.

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,010
Sumire-chan, aren't you coming to the after-party?

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,540
I'll be right there!

55
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,260
Next time when we have some free time,
I'll make sure to really listen to you.

56
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,800
Hmm.

57
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,400
Thanks for all your hard work.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,490
You've worked hard.

59
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
I think I might've had a bit too much to drink.

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,800
(Mashiro Kosuke calling)

62
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Hello?

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What are you doing right now?

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,000
Huh?

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm sobering up in the park right now.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,870
What about you, Mashiro?

67
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,030
Out for a night run.

68
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,700
By the way, is it really okay to be out this late?

69
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,800
If you can't make it home, that's not my problem!

70
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,470
It's fine.

71
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,700
This park is near my house.
It only takes about 5 minutes to walk home from here.

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Get up, you drunk!

73
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,300
Huh? Mashiro??

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You, you.

75
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
If you sleep in a place like this,
someone might call the cops on you.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Why did you come all the way here?

77
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Isn't it obvious? Of course I'm worried about you!

78
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,930
Worried about what?

79
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,700
It's not like I'm a girl or anything.

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Even if it's just a grown man being here alone.

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,400
It's not really a big deal…

82
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,670
Huh?

83
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
I just wanted to see you, that's all.

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,500
Even if it's just for a little while.

85
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,500
By the way, just how much did you drink?

86
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,000
It's been a long time
since I had dinner with the Sales Department.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Was it fun?

88
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,300
Yeah.

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh...

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,050
Huh?

91
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,900
It's nothing.

92
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
What is it?

93
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,520
Just thinking about Kanade having fun
somewhere I don't know about.

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
It just makes me a little mad.

95
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Are you a child?

96
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,200
You're so annoying!

97
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,500
Having Mashiro by my side makes me feel so at ease.

98
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Thank you.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,770
Huh?

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,900
I really want to see Mashiro, too.

101
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I like you.

102
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Me too.

103
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,500
In my world.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm not alone anymore.

105
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,000
It feels so good not to be lonely.

106
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,030
Huh?

107
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,090
Wait a second.

108
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,500
Why are you crying?

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,310
Are you feeling emotional?

110
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,510
Sorry about that...

111
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,100
I just feel like...

112
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,180
Seriously.

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you a child?

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Thank you.

115
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,300
Sorry for making you walk me home.

116
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
It's okay, I insisted on coming along.

117
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
How are you getting home?

118
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,300
I'll run. I was out for a night jog anyway.

119
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Do you want to come in for a cup of tea before you go?

120
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,500
Huh?

121
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,000
Never mind.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
After all, I still have to work tomorrow.

123
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah!

124
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Well then... good night.

125
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,600
Good night.

126
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
Good job, I held it in.

127
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,400
A little more to the right.

128
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,300
Is this okay?

129
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Give me a chin lift pose.

130
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,440
That's awesome!

131
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,500
This shot is so full of emotion!

132
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,700
It's absolutely perfect.

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
Can we take one more shot?

134
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,980
Go ahead, go ahead~

135
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,480
W-wait a second! What are you guys doing?

136
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,980
Hanamura Sensei...

137
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, hello, thank you for everything.

138
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,860
This is a pose reference for my new BL manga!

139
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,780
Pose reference material?

140
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,480
This time, I want to go for a more realistic art style.

141
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,240
I talked it over with them, and it just so happens that both of them...

142
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,630
They said they're willing to help out for the sake of the project.

143
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,800
I see.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,280
I feel really bad for asking you to go this far.

145
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,070
Not at all. If I can be of any help
to Hanamura Sensei, that would be wonderful.

146
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,880
Right?
Yes!

147
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,500
Thank you.

148
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,500
You've really been a huge help.

149
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,500
Um...

150
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,800
Could I ask you to strike one more pose at the end?

151
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,600
Huh?

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,660
I want to know exactly where this hand goes
when hugging from behind.

153
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,600
Kanade-san, could you turn a bit and stand straight facing me?

154
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,260
Yes, just like that. That's it.

155
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,940
- Then, Niijima, put your left hand over from the top from behind.
- Got it.

156
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,000
- And then from underneath.
- Got it.

157
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,410
A little higher.

158
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,690
Yes, just like that.

159
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
And then, Kanade-san,
could you gently rest your hand there…

160
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,340
That's it! This is absolutely amazing!

161
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,600
Let me take a quick photo, then.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,810
Kanade-san, could you move your hand down a little?

163
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,200
- Down a bit?
- Yes.

164
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,930
I'm really looking forward to Hanamura Sensei's new work.

165
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah.

166
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,380
But I've never actually done a kabedon
or hugged someone from behind, so it's kind of tricky for me.

167
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,190
Kanade, you've worked hard too.

168
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,260
- Huh?
- Getting a kabedon from a senior like me and all that...

169
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,500
It'd be awkward to say no, wouldn't it?

170
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,630
Hey, that's not true at all!

171
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,680
Kanade, what do you think about that kind of thing?

172
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,820
Are you talking about a kabedon?

173
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,000
No, I mean "Boy's Love."

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,500
To be honest, I really don't get what's so appealing about it.

175
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,700
- Um...
- I mean, I know there really are people like that.

176
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,900
You really never know what's going to become popular in this world.

177
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,600
Yeah.

178
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
Wanna go grab some ramen?

180
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,700
Sure, let's go eat.

181
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Welcome!

182
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,050
Looks like there are seats available.

183
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah.

184
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Mashiro?

185
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,500
You can choose between thick noodles and thin noodles here.

186
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah!

187
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,400
Which one should I choose?

188
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,200
If Mr. Niijima finds out about me and Mashiro...

189
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,700
He'd definitely be shocked.

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,300
I'll go with the thick noodles.

191
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,910
What about you, Kanade? What do you want to eat?

192
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,650
I'll go with thin noodles.

193
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,000
Thin noodles, huh.

194
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,400
Okay.

195
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,610
Ah! No need!

196
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Let me act like a proper senior every once in a while, okay?

197
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,000
Kanade, you're my adorable junior, after all.

198
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,300
Thank you.

199
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

200
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,760
Thank you.

201
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,610
Here you go, enjoy.

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm digging in.

203
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm digging in.

204
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,500
It's delicious.

205
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,590
Huh... You and Aizawa-san are pretty close, aren't you?

206
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,700
Huh?

207
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,200
Yeah... you could say that.

208
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
I was just asking casually…

209
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Huh?

210
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,200
Are you two dating?

211
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
You and Aizawa-san...

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
No, not at all.

213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,500
I have... someone else I'm seeing.

214
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I see.

215
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
That's good, that's good~

216
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
Why are the messages coming in at the same time?

217
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,700
If Mashiro sees this...

218
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,500
You even went out of your way to send it to us.

219
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,200
Looks like you got some pretty good photos taken of you, Kanade.

220
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh no!

221
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Mashiro, sit down (House)!

222
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,000
You two know each other?

223
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,300
Yeah...

224
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,300
Um...

225
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,000
He's...

226
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm his friend. Hi.

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Hi, I'm his coworker, Niijima.

228
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,490
Thank you for having me.

229
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,200
I'll head out first, then.

230
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,600
About the photo.

231
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
It seems like he doesn't really care that much.

232
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,500
Am I just worrying too much?

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,820
Thank you for buying me lunch, the food was really delicious.

234
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,800
Yeah.

235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Um, about that...

236
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,870
Yes.

237
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,900
Didn't I just say that I don't really get the appeal of BL?

238
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,170
Huh?

239
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,400
That's just...

240
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,500
I just don't have the antenna to pick up on it.

241
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,420
I'm not trying to deny or judge people who like BL…

242
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,000
It's not like I have any particular feelings about real people, either.

243
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,900
Sorry for suddenly saying something weird. Please don't mind it.

244
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,870
Good luck with your outside work this afternoon, too.

245
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,710
Thanks for your hard work.

246
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,800
Thank you for your hard work.

247
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,500
So you found out, huh?

248
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,000
But Mr. Niijima's reaction was pretty calm.

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
Is that so?

250
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,300
We're already adults now.

251
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
He wouldn't meddle in other people's business like that.

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,800
(Wait for me at Ippo Café after work.)

253
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,000
I really need to explain things properly to Mashiro.

254
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,500
- Don't move for a second.
- Okay.

255
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,310
- Ah!
- Huh?

256
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,920
- I really think you shouldn't look back.
- Oh my god, oh my god...

257
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,400
Mashiro...

258
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,900
- Just a little more...
- Is it done?

259
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,030
Just move your hair.

260
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,700
- Just a little longer, just a little longer.
- Okay.

261
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,350
Yes! Got it!

262
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,800
- That's such a relief.
- Thank you.

263
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh, Kanade!

264
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,170
Hey! Where did the stink bug go?

265
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,030
I caught it and let it go.

266
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,720
You let it go? That's impressive!

267
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,050
Come to think of it, using spray in the restaurant
probably isn't a good idea.

268
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,700
Ah... you're right!

269
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
I should be more careful.

270
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,870
You really helped a lot, thank you.

271
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,950
No, not at all. You had a stink bug on your head...

272
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,770
Why am I so shaken up?

273
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,000
That kind of thing really isn't worth worrying about at all.

274
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
But...

275
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,420
Wow, my hand smells so bad!

276
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,600
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- No, not at all.

277
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,800
This little thing is no problem at all.

278
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,600
That stuff can get on your clothes, you know.

279
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,990
Ah, shoot, shoot, shoot!

280
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
Wow! It smells really bad over here too.

281
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,930
I really appreciate it.

282
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Hey, today...

283
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Something happened at the construction site.

284
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,350
My hard hat went missing.

285
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,090
I usually always wear my hard hat,
so there's no way I should have lost it.

286
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,950
But today, I just happened to step away
from the site for a little bit.

287
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,400
And when I came back, I couldn't find it where I'd left it.

288
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,620
Can you guess where that missing hard hat ended up being found?

289
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,700
It turned out to be in a place you'd never believe.

290
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Kanade, are you listening?

291
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey, Kanade!

292
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,300
Huh?

293
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,810
Ah... sorry!

294
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,300
What's wrong?

295
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
You've been looking down this whole time.

296
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,600
It's nothing, really. I'm fine.

297
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,800
Getting jealous over something like that is just childish.

298
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,800
Mashiro absolutely cannot find out.

299
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
By the way.

300
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Isn't it about time you told me?

301
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,190
Huh?

302
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,300
That photo from earlier today.

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
So what was that all about?

304
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,780
Do you care?

305
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,100
Of course I care.

306
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I didn't want to trouble you, Kanade, so I kept it to myself.

307
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,700
I've felt uneasy all day today.

308
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
I see, that's how it is.

309
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,530
Sorry.

310
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,900
Was that something you were forced into?

311
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Isn't that guy just a regular coworker?

312
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,500
That was something I had to do because of work.

313
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,000
Huh? In what situation would you ever have
to get pinned against the wall like that?

314
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,500
- I told you, it was for work...
- You should've turned down that kind of work!

315
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,120
By the way, didn't that guy touch your chin?

316
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,800
Don't just let people touch you!

317
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,900
It's not like I wanted to be touched.

318
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
Honestly, you're in no position to judge others either.

319
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,270
Huh?

320
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,140
Even if a stink bug crawls onto your head,
you still don't have to touch a girl's head, right?

321
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,440
I can't believe you actually care about something like this.

322
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,310
Just use a tissue to get rid of it.
Aren't there other ways?

323
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,560
What if doing that makes the other person get the wrong idea!

324
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,750
There's no way she'd get the wrong idea.

325
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,200
You never know!

326
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,800
I said it out loud.

327
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm really happy...

328
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,520
Huh?

329
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,000
That you're jealous.

330
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,200
You really like me, don't you?

331
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
You too.

332
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,500
When I'm with Mashiro,
he really makes my heart feel all over the place.

333
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,500
Sorry for the wait, here's your puddings.

334
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,720
Looks delicious.

335
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,300
Thank you.
Thank you.

336
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,800
It's sweet, but there's a hint of bitterness too.

337
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,800
Yeah.

338
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Delicious.

339
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,770
This is seriously amazing.

340
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,000
But, Mashiro expressing his feelings so honestly like a child,

341
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
is exactly why I like him.

342
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,000
Mashiro is so cute.

343
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,900
Huh?

344
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Cute?

345
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,090
Me?

346
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Yeah.

347
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,000
You've got the taste of pudding.

348
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,100
You are the one that's cute, Kanade.

349
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,900
That's why I end up worrying for no reason.

350
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,110
Um...

351
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,500
Hm?

352
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,000
Next time we have a day off,

353
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,500
can I come over to your place, Kanade?

354
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So, does that mean…

355
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,400
we are taking things to the next level?

356
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,270
(Next Episode)
Mashiro is coming to my place for the first time.

357
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,450
(Dating at home for the first time)
Will he really end up staying the night?

358
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,320
No way.
Mashiro, you're so scary.

Don't get in my way.
