1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,700
(Tanaka Kaito, Shirahama North High, Class 3-A:
Let's all get together for the Obon holiday!)

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,730
Man, I'm kinda hungry.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,300
(We're having a mini-reunion.)

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,530
Didn't you just eat?

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,430
(Everyone who's not in town should come back for it.)

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,530
I forgot we still have the Mont Blanc.

7
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,870
You want some, Kosuke?

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,150
Definitely.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,370
Looks like you got a message.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,500
Let's all get together for the Obon holiday.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,340
We're having a mini-reunion.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,680
Everyone who's not in town should come back for it.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,310
A mini-reunion?

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,800
Huh?

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,570
Do you remember Tanaka?

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,060
He was in our class in senior year.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,100
You mean Tanaka, the mayo freak?

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,730
That's the one.

19
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,810
On our field trip, we went strawberry picking.

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,300
He's the guy who put mayonnaise even on his strawberries
and got chewed out by the teacher.

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,410
He puts mayonnaise on everything.

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,820
That Tanaka is saying
we should all get together for Obon.

23
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,240
Oh...

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,830
But even though he calls it a get-together,

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,780
including me, it's only five people.

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,870
You guys all still keep in touch.

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,000
Shinichiro, you totally dropped off the map after graduation.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,850
It was like you were avoiding us.

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,400
It wasn't like that.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,480
Thinking back on it just gets me down.

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,660
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,870
I wasn't trying to avoid you.

33
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,010
It's just that...

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,510
I wanted to forget about Kosuke.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,790
Shinichiro.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,940
Yeah?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,050
Want to go back together?

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,040
Huh?

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,590
I was just thinking about heading back home for a bit.

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,630
I haven't seen my mom since then.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,220
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,350
This is how I am...

43
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,380
I see.

44
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,050
Since I'm going back anyway,

45
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,290
it'd be more fun with you there, Shinichiro.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,370
Didn't you say it was about time you went back?

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah.

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,050
Let's go to the mini-reunion together.

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,860
But...

50
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,440
If you don't want to go, don't force yourself.

51
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,500
Huh?

52
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,390
I can just go back by myself.

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,610
The train ride all alone...

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,370
It's gonna be lonely.

55
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,050
Somehow...

56
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,910
- It sounds so sentimental.
- You've got foam on you.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,240
So heartbreaking! Boo-hoo!

58
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,170
Alright, I get it.

59
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,630
I'll go back with you.

60
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,200
Thanks!

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,180
Everyone's going to be so happy.

62
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,720
Going back home with Shinichiro.

63
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,530
I'm so excited.

64
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,680
Chatting on the way, we got here in no time.

65
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,160
That's true.

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,360
Shinichiro, do you always take the train?

67
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,140
No.
I think I took the bus back during college.

68
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Huh?

69
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,680
You don't mean...

70
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,660
This is your first time going home since you started working?

71
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,320
Yeah.

72
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,470
Sorry.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,710
Huh?
No, it's nothing.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,800
I just feel like
I'm forcing you to come back with me.

75
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,450
That's not it at all.

76
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,970
I also think if I'm going back,
it's better to go with you, Kosuke.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,280
That's great.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm really looking forward to the reunion, too.

79
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,060
Yeah.

80
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,730
This is my way.

81
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,790
See you later.

82
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,150
I kept saying it was about time I went back,

83
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,660
but I kept putting it off.

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,760
Since when did I start
to dislike this place so much?

85
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,760
Since when did I start...

86
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,530
to feel like there's no place for me here anymore?

87
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,200
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

88
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,500
(Episode 10)

89
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,740
When I was at the supermarket,
I saw they were selling some delicious-looking watermelon.

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,370
Kosuke.

91
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,020
You like watermelon, right?

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,360
Yeah.

93
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,530
Thanks.

94
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,670
Where's Mom?

95
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,350
Didn't she tell you?

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,420
Huh?

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,800
She got a live-in job at a hotel.

98
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,050
A live-in job?

99
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah.

100
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,870
After she came back from Tokyo,

101
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,110
she suddenly said she wanted to be independent
so she was moving out of the house.

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,150
At her age...

103
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,560
Talking about 'independence.'

104
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,800
I see.

105
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,040
After she talked to Kosuke,

106
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,480
I guess she realized she couldn't go on like that anymore.

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,640
She told me to say hi if you came back.

108
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:42,930
Here.
Eat up.

109
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,170
Mm.

110
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,590
This is delicious!

111
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,690
I've been dying to try this!

112
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,190
You're the best, Bro! Thanks!

113
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,800
You'd better appreciate it.

114
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,420
I will!

115
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,530
I made some tea. Let's all dig in.

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,750
Dad.

117
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,550
Shinichiro's back.

118
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,620
Isn't there something you have to say to me?

119
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,440
Huh?

120
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,250
Um...

121
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,540
I'm home.

122
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,770
That's not it.

123
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,550
Bro, you haven't come home once
since you started working.

124
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,900
That's why Dad's been so mad.

125
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,080
Oh...

126
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,450
Your work can't be so demanding
that you can't even come home for the holidays, can it?

127
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,540
Why didn't you come home?

128
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,460
I... had a lot going on.

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,570
Stop goofing around like you're still a student.

130
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,570
You're 25 years old.

131
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,470
I'm not goofing around...

132
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm telling you to get your act together.

133
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,810
For a grown man to act like this...

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,130
How pathetic.

135
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,800
All right, that's enough. He's back now.

136
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,910
Yeah.

137
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,140
Here.

138
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,250
Dad, this is delicious. You should have some.

139
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,630
Here you go.

140
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,160
Oh, we're out of tissues.

141
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,750
Aren't there extras in the usual spot?

142
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,620
And where is the 'usual spot'?

143
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,800
Geez, just try to remember, will you?

144
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,780
The tissues are in the cabinet over there.

145
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,760
There.

146
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,080
I'll just put the pillowcase here, then.

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, thanks.

148
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,430
Is that kind of T-shirt popular in Tokyo?

149
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,500
Huh?

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,010
Bro, your taste has changed.

151
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,990
Really?

152
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,010
Hey.

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,030
Why didn't you come home all this time?

154
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,690
Like I said, I was busy...

155
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,900
It's because Dad's such a pain, right?

156
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,010
It's nothing like that.

157
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,820
There you go again.

158
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,800
My brother, always so secretive.

159
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,600
Shinichiro.

160
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,070
What time's the class reunion?

161
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,660
Starts at 6.

162
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,920
At the izakaya in front of the station.

163
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,060
Want to get a ride to the station together?

164
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,560
Huh?

165
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,830
Dad has a town hall meeting at 6.
He's driving to the station, so you can catch a ride with him.

166
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,780
No, thanks.

167
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm meeting a friend.

168
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,380
Oh, okay.

169
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,870
Shinichiro's such a crybaby.

170
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,970
Like a little girl.

171
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,840
Let's go.

172
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,590
- You have a piece of paper in your hair.
- Huh? Where?

173
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,600
Wait, hold still.

174
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,600
- Okay, got it.
- You did?

175
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,920
Thanks.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
- Let's go.
- Okay.

177
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,880
Hey, we're going this way today.

178
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,980
In every corner of this town,

179
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,330
there's a part of me I used to hate.

180
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,510
Me who was ashamed, cowardly...

181
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,990
the past me who wanted to throw everything away.

182
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,150
Shinichiro!

183
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,210
Over here!

184
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,530
Drink up.

185
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,400
- Mashiro's here!
- What took you so long!

186
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,160
Hey, sorry about that.

187
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,500
- We already got started.
- Come on, hurry!

188
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,820
For real?

189
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,690
Long time no see.

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,990
Huh?

191
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,710
Kanade...?

192
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,140
It's Kanade!

193
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,220
It's been forever!

194
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,160
You made it!

195
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,300
This brings back so many memories.

196
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,230
I've missed you so much!

197
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,170
I've missed you all, too.

198
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,360
Why didn't you ever give us your contact info?

199
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,090
Yeah, I thought you hated us or something.

200
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,430
Me too, me too!

201
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,440
Um...

202
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,800
My phone broke and I lost all my contacts.

203
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,090
What kind of lame excuse is that?

204
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,440
Forget about that, let's toast!

205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,690
Good point. You two good with beer?

206
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,810
Excuse me, can we get two draft beers, please?

207
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,170
You're such a bad liar.

208
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,930
Shut up.

209
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,260
This is the best!

210
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,980
What is it?

211
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,930
Tanaka, you're still a mayo addict.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,530
Hey, you never outgrow mayo.

213
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,660
Speaking of Tanaka,
remember that strawberry-picking incident?

214
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,010
Oh yeah, strawberries and mayonnaise, right?

215
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,600
Who brings mayonnaise on a field trip?

216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,910
What do you mean? It's totally normal.

217
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,170
You even brought it to our graduation ceremony, didn't you?

218
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,950
That was to dip the celebratory red and white buns in.

219
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,520
And you got totally chewed out by the teacher.

220
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,190
Of course you got yelled at.

221
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,510
You're such an idiot.

222
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,400
What!

223
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,430
If Mashiro's calling you an idiot, you're a lost cause.

224
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,100
What's that supposed to mean?

225
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,600
It means exactly what it sounds like.

226
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,900
- So what do you mean by that?
- I mean it literally.

227
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,630
Okay, okay! I get it, I get it.

228
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,430
I have an announcement for everyone.

229
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,030
An announcement?

230
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,650
I'm...

231
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,570
getting married this fall.

232
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,450
Seriously?

233
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,130
With the guy you've been dating?

234
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,750
Yeah.

235
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,110
He proposed to me a little while ago.

236
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,540
Congratulations.

237
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,900
That's wonderful, Miki.

238
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,520
Thanks!

239
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,570
That's so great.

240
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,860
I want to get married too.

241
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,260
Me too.

242
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,280
I've been going out with my girlfriend for three years.

243
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:36,410
- I guess it's about time to think about marriage.
- We're at that age now.

244
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,560
Speaking of which,

245
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,420
did you guys hear Ryoko
from Class C got married recently?

246
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,750
Yeah, I heard it was to a coworker
from her company. Same age too.

247
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,810
That's nice.

248
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,260
Also, Yuya-kun from Class B
said he's getting married soon too.

249
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,020
Hey!

250
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,250
Kanade, you work at a publishing house, right?

251
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,570
Is the media industry really as glamorous as they say?

252
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,070
No, my company isn't like that at all.

253
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,380
But the pay is pretty good, right?

254
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,610
Kanade's so sweet.
He'd make someone really happy. Marry me!

255
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,540
What are you talking about?

256
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,120
I got cheated on recently.
He was three-timing me. Wanna hear the story?

257
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
When the guy broke up with me, he said...

258
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,750
Okay, okay, Saito. Here, try some of this.

259
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,420
Huh?

260
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,800
We still have yakitori.

261
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,990
There it is. The Mashiro Shield.

262
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,700
Huh?

263
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,750
What's that?

264
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,810
Whenever a girl talks to Kanade,
Mashiro always butts in, doesn't he?

265
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,090
That's why us girls secretly call him
the 'Mashiro Shield.' You didn't know?

266
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,050
I had no idea.

267
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,600
The 'Mashiro Shield.' That's hilarious.

268
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,010
- You're way too into Kanade.
- Totally!

269
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,710
Huh?

270
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm just...

271
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,130
protecting Kanade!

272
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,020
So dense.

273
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,570
I know, right?

274
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,980
Well, see you next time.

275
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,470
I'll send you the wedding invitations, so be sure to come.

276
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,260
- Bye.
- Bye.

277
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:41,930
Heading home?

278
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,090
Yeah.

279
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,670
- This place was really good.
- It really was.

280
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,910
Kosuke, isn't this the long way home for you?

281
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,610
It's fine, don't worry about it.

282
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Whoa!

283
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,830
Are you drunk?

284
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,040
Just a little.

285
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,500
By the way, what was all that about?

286
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,870
The Mashiro Shield.

287
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,950
How should I know?

288
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,360
So it was just something the girls made up?

289
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
When I saw you laughing and talking with other people...

290
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,710
it just bugged me.

291
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,100
You're such a kid.

292
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,410
Huh?

293
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,150
Then maybe I was jealous.

294
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,560
Huh?

295
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,960
Thinking back on it now,

296
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,580
maybe that's really what it was.

297
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,730
Do you remember?

298
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,260
A long time ago, right here,

299
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,240
Mukai suddenly burst into tears.

300
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,860
Was that when he got dumped by the girl
from the next class?

301
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,890
Yeah, yeah.

302
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,170
He just started bawling out of nowhere
and totally freaked us out.

303
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,360
But when we bought him his favorite bread,
he stopped crying right away.

304
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,680
It was hilarious.

305
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,410
Yeah.

306
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,150
We really do have a lot of happy memories, don't we?

307
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,720
Huh?

308
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,500
No, it's just...

309
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,750
whenever I used to come back home,

310
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,110
I'd only remember the version of myself I hated.

311
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,290
But after seeing everyone today...

312
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,460
I realized that's not true.

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
In this town...

314
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,580
I laughed so much...

315
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,640
and made so many happy memories.

316
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,420
I'm so glad I came back.

317
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,280
It's all thanks to you, Kosuke.

318
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,700
Thank you.

319
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,270
I want to kiss you.

320
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,150
Huh?

321
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,170
I don't know why, but I really want to right now.

322
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,060
But... I'm a little drunk. Is that okay?

323
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,320
W-Wait a second...

324
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,400
It's fine, right?

325
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,030
It's not like it's the first time.

326
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,350
Come on.

327
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,940
D-Dad!

328
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,340
Dad?

329
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,760
What are you two doing out here?

330
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,820
I'm...

331
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,810
I'm a classmate of Shinichiro's from high school.

332
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,580
My name is Mashiro.

333
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,390
What were you two... doing out here?

334
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,830
Um...

335
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,580
We were just messing around.

336
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,930
He's had too much to drink.

337
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,340
I'm so sorry.

338
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,200
That's not what it looked like!

339
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Shinichiro.

340
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,650
Explain yourself.

341
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,650
Well... it's just...

342
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,000
Uh...

343
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,640
You're always acting like a timid little kid.

344
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,120
Act like a man.

345
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,860
Stand up for yourself!

346
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,420
Shinichiro, are you even listening?

347
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,960
I've had enough.

348
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,900
What?

349
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,210
I...

350
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,360
I'm with him because I love him! Just leave me alone!

351
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,350
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What's so ridiculous about it?

352
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,570
You're always like that,
forcing your opinions on me.

353
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,420
What did I ever do wrong?

354
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,080
Shut up.

355
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,570
I haven't...

356
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,340
caused anyone any trouble.

357
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,630
I... I haven't done anything at all.

358
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,780
A man shouldn't cry over something like this!

359
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,050
Can't you even speak for yourself?

360
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,590
That's enough.

361
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,760
I'm never coming back to this house again.

362
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,530
I don't care about you, or this family...

363
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,700
I don't want any of it!

364
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,290
Shinichiro!

365
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,630
Fine, do whatever you want.

366
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,860

I'm gay, actually.

367
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,200
(Coming out to my family)
You finally said it.

368
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,840
Have you told your dad?

369
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,690
Being here reminds me
of when Shinichiro and I used to play together.

370
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,760
(The one who's always by my side)
I'm not alone.

371
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,100
(When I break free from my father's grip...)
I knew we were different after all.

372
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,470
I've always just been me.

373
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,850
I'll be back.
