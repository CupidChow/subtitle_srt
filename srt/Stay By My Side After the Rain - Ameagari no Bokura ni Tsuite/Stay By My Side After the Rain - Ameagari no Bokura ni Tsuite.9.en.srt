1
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,490
This is bliss.

2
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm starving.

3
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,880
Mashiro is still fast asleep.

4
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,970
Kanade.

5
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,340
Kanade.

6
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,810
I went to the convenience store.

7
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,560
I wanted to make breakfast, but we were out of everything.

8
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,520
Oh, so that's what it was!

9
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,910
By the way, could you put some clothes on?

10
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,930
Huh?

11
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,820
Can I have the pollock roe one too?

12
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,200
Sure, but you've got a big appetite for this early in the morning.

13
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,640
Because I didn't eat much last night.

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,500
Plus, I worked up quite a sweat afterwards.

15
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,390
Delicious.

16
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,720
You've got a grain of rice on your face.

17
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,030
Something about this feels really nice.

18
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Hm?

19
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,060
I wish we could have breakfast together like this every day.

20
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,060
Yeah.

21
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,940
Hey, Kanade.

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Yeah?

23
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,620
Let's...
live together.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Huh?

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,300
What?

26
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,700
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

27
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
(Episode 9)

28
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,670
Nice work.

29
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,170
Kanade.
Yeah?

30
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,750
Can this go in the closet?

31
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,500
Sure.
I'll help you.

32
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,170
Thanks.

33
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,230
Starting today,
I'll be living here with Mashiro.

34
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,050
By the way, we haven't had lunch yet.

35
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,360
Should we grab something from the convenience store?

36
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,170
We could do that.

37
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,620
But it's our first day, isn't it?

38
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,920
Let's get something exciting...

39
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,630
Like pizza.

40
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,410
Nothing hits the spot like junk food when you're exhausted!

41
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
I know what you mean.

42
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,450
Sorry the room's a little cramped now.

43
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,820
Not at all.

44
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,630
Living together will help us save money.

45
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,540
Once we've saved enough,

46
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,920
we can move to a bigger place.

47
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,260
Yeah.

48
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,660
That said,

49
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,780
it's really hard to save money.

50
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,040
I want to keep sending money to my grandma.

51
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,850
And it'll be a long time before I pay off my student loans.

52
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,870
There's no rush.

53
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,520
Just living with you is enough for me, Mashiro.

54
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,780
Before I forget.

55
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,670
Here.

56
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,690
This is your key, Mashiro.

57
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,390
Um...

58
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,470
I know I have my flaws,

59
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,420
but from now on,

60
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,040
please be patient with me.

61
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,280
I should be the one saying that.

62
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,590
Please be patient with me too.

63
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,060
Kanade is always by my side.

64
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,010
What was that about?

65
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,640
I bought some pudding.

66
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,420
Let's eat.

67
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,750
Pudding again?

68
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,240
I'd like to have a Mont Blanc or something for a change.

69
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,920
But I like pudding...

70
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,180
Ah, wait.

71
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,930
Please don't stack the greasy plates.

72
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,600
Okay.

73
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,440
Pudding, pudding~

74
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,600
Man, work at the construction site was exhausting today.

75
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,200
What do you usually do for lunch?

76
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,100
I usually just go to a ramen shop nearby.

77
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,030
Eating out every day isn't good for you.

78
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,800
How about I start making a bento
for you too, Mashiro?

79
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,960
For real?

80
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,290
Thanks.

81
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,860
I'll make yours extra large, Mashiro.

82
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,390
Um...

83
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,870
Yeah?

84
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,660
About what we call each other...

85
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
From now on,

86
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,870
can I call you "Shinichiro"?

87
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,260
Sure.

88
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,370
Then...

89
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,490
Kosuke.

90
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,860
Shinichiro~

91
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,460
Wait...

92
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,030
Stop it, Kosuke~

93
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,020
Stop it.

94
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,310
Kosuke~ I'm ticklish there.

95
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,500
Good morning.

96
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Good morning.

97
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,100
I made breakfast.

98
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,490
Make sure you eat.

99
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,800
Thank you.

100
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,320
Alright, I'm off.

101
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,770
- Be safe.
- I will!

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,570
Curry first thing in the morning...

103
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,060
Aizawa-san.

104
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,030
Mind if I sit here?

105
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,810
Go ahead.

106
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,440
Thanks.

107
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,890
Kanade-san, did you get a new bento box?

108
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,690
Yeah.

109
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,710
I figured, why not? So I bought us a matching set.

110
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,800
Huh?

111
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,920
Actually, we're...

112
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
living together.

113
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,690
You started living together?

114
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,430
It's been almost a week.

115
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,660
Oh, I'm so happy for you, Kanade-san!

116
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,710
That's wonderful.

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,550
Thanks.

118
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,540
On that note...

119
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,590
Do you mind if I share some good news, too?

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,300
Actually...

121
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,080
Niijima-san and I have started dating.

122
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,160
With Niijima-san?

123
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
Yes.

124
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,850
He confessed to me the other day.

125
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
By the way, Niijima-san...

126
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,700
Just curious...

127
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,700
Yeah?

128
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,600
Are you two seeing each other?

129
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,850
You and Aizawa-san...

130
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,310
So he liked Aizawa-san.

131
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,810
Congratulations.

132
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,270
Thank you.

133
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,840
Kanade-san.

134
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,440
Let's both find our happiness.

135
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm home.

136
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,760
Welcome home.

137
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,320
You were late, so I already ate.

138
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,560
Hey, you need to dry the dishes after you wash them.

139
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh, sorry.

140
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,950
And the laundry isn't folded.

141
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,400
I forgot.

142
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,120
Should we make a rule from now on?
Whoever brings in the laundry has to fold it.

143
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,110
Do we really need a rule for that?

144
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,460
Can't whoever has time just do it?

145
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,950
"Whoever has time," huh...

146
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,450
I'm going to take a shower.

147
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,600
Your phone's ringing.

148
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,020
Thanks.

149
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,620
Are you coming home for the Obon festival?

150
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,060
And, Dad's worried about you.

151
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,840
Yui is your sister, right?

152
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,310
Huh?

153
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,120
It was just lying there. I saw it by accident.

154
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,320
Oh...

155
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,670
Shinichiro, what's your dad like?

156
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,730
He's just an ordinary guy.

157
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,760
I met your mom back in high school.

158
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,430
But I've never met your dad, not even once.

159
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,950
You don't look just like him, do you?

160
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,670
Not at all.

161
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,500
We look nothing alike.

162
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,720
I see.

163
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,930
You should go home for the Obon festival.

164
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,070
Your parents want to see you, don't they?

165
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,790
This has nothing to do with you, Kosuke.

166
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,350
What's that supposed to mean?

167
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm not asking you to tell your family about me.

168
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,020
But you could at least tell me about yours.

169
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,010
There's nothing to tell.

170
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,810
Instead of that, why don't you tidy up the room for a change?

171
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I'll get to it.

172
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,300
You always say that,
but I'm always the one who ends up doing it.

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,030
That's because by the time I get around to it,
you've already done it, Shinichiro.

174
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,920
That's only because you never do it, Kosuke.

175
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,650
I do things on my own schedule, okay?

176
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,140
I make breakfast every day. Isn't that enough?

177
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,350
You just microwave those food pouches.

178
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,020
And who eats curry first thing in the morning?

179
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,960
I happen to like curry!

180
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,190
If you're going to make it, clean up after yourself.

181
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,130
You always get curry all over the kitchen.

182
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,760
Kosuke, you're such a slob.

183
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,800
What are you so mad about?

184
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,570
I'm not mad...

185
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,730
I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.

186
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,430
Huh.

187
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,770
I just don't feel like sleeping in the same bed.

188
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,320
I see...

189
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,560
Fighting and still having to come home
to the same place is exhausting.

190
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,600
Sigh...

191
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,120
Sigh...

192
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,720
Aizawa-san?

193
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,480
Long day?

194
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,850
You too...

195
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,750
What's wrong?

196
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,790
Why the long faces, you two?

197
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,960
You and Niijima-kun...

198
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,430
Did something happen?

199
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,580
It's just that Niijima-san...

200
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,500
Whether it's deciding where to go for a date...

201
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,610
or what to eat...

202
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,740
he always just says it's up to me.

203
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,570
Isn't that just...

204
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,340
Niijima-san's way of being considerate?

205
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,390
Well, that may be true...

206
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,000
But it almost feels like Niijima-san
doesn't even care about going out with me...

207
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,280
I don't know...

208
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm starting to feel really insecure.

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,580
If we can't understand each other now...

210
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,980
can we really make this work?

211
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,920
It's okay.

212
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,220
It's like that for everyone at the beginning.

213
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,100
Huh?

214
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,300
Since you both like each other...

215
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,010
as long as you don't give up, you'll eventually
find a rhythm that works for both of you.

216
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,660
So don't worry about it.

217
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,400
A rhythm that works for us?

218
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,600
What about you, Kanade-kun?

219
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,670
Why did you look so down earlier?

220
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,050
It's nothing...

221
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm fine.

222
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,490
A rhythm that works for us...
How are we supposed to find that?

223
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,200
Kosuke is still mad at me.

224
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,090
It's impossible.

225
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,530
Fried rice ball.

226
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,520
Huh?

227
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,770
But I didn't order this.

228
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,490
I messed up the rice by adding too much water.

229
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,990
This one's on the house.

230
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,610
Thank you.

231
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,230
Go on, eat up.

232
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,700
Huh?

233
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,970
Okay, I'll dig in.

234
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,700
This is so good.

235
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,910
Even if you fail...

236
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,160
don't give up.

237
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,110
You're right.

238
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,380
Once you give up, it's really over.

239
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,050
When he gets back, I'm going to have a proper talk with him.

240
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,650
And I'll really listen to what Kosuke has to say.

241
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,870
Is he avoiding coming home
and just wandering around outside?

242
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,910
The person you are calling is unavailable.

243
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,870
Please leave a message after the tone...

244
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,840
and begin your message.

245
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,800
(9:02 PM: Service on the Toei Line
has been suspended due to a personal injury incident.)

246
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,800
That's the train Kosuke takes...

247
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,560
It can't be...

248
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Kosuke!

249
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,610
Are you okay?

250
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,290
Thank goodness.

251
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,900
Thank goodness...

252
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,300
Huh?

253
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,860
I was so worried about you!

254
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,360
You weren't home, and I couldn't reach you on your phone.

255
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,950
Sorry...

256
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,000
My phone died on the way.

257
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,750
Were you late because of the incident on the subway?

258
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
That was part of it.

259
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,680
This...

260
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,350
I was late because I was waiting in line for this.

261
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,990
The most popular Mont Blanc
from the department store food court.

262
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,720
Pudding again?

263
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,160
Sometimes I want to eat something like Mont Blanc.

264
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,300
No...

265
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,930
I thought I could solve the problem with food...

266
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,290
even though I knew it wasn't the right way.

267
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,430
That was delicious.

268
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,010
My first time having mackerel curry. It was so good.

269
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,270
The cafe owner taught me how to make it.

270
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,020
Since you like curry, Kosuke.

271
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
Thank you.

272
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,810
Should we have the Mont Blanc now?

273
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,310
Before that...

274
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,260
About yesterday...

275
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,120
- I'm so sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

276
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,600
Let's split the chores properly from now on.

277
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,120
Otherwise...

278
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,330
I'll become too dependent on you, Shinichiro.

279
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,040
I'm truly sorry.

280
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,870
No, I'm the one who should be sorry...

281
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,000
When it came to my family,

282
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,830
I said things that pushed you away.

283
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,830
I was too harsh, too.

284
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,510
You have your own...

285
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,130
family situation, Shinichiro.

286
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,390
I...

287
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,770
I don't get along well with my dad.

288
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,770
Huh?

289
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,200
My dad...

290
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,510
He's the type who thinks
a man isn't a real adult until he's married.

291
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:43,920
And I...

292
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,510
can't get married.

293
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,900
That's part of the reason...

294
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,400
I don't go home very often.

295
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,480
Although, I have been thinking it's about time I did.

296
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,680
I didn't know any of that.

297
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,340
I's sorry.

298
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,730
Don't be.

299
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:20,990
So...
let's make up.

300
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,040
Huh?

301
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,310
We've made up, right?

302
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,910
We've made up.

303
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,980
I never want to fight again.

304
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,720
Don't you think so, Shinichiro?

305
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,820
Well, I think...

306
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,560
it's necessary once in a while.

307
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,150
Huh?

308
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,840
That's ridiculous.

309
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,940
It's fine!

310
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,450
What good comes from fighting?

311
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,370
From now on,

312
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,130
even if we clash,

313
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,540
as long as we can slowly figure out
our own way of being together.

314
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,550
As long as we don't give up,

315
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,450
we'll be totally fine.

316
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,900
(Tanaka Kaito, Shirahama North High, Class 3-A
Let's all get together for Obon!)

317
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,400
(Let's have a class reunion!)

318
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,000
(For everyone who's moved away, let's meet up!)

319
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,840
(Next Episode)
A mini reunion?

320
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,840
Shinichiro.
Want to go back together?

321
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,450
(Their first time returning home together)
I've been putting it off.

322
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,210
(Clashing with his strict father)
Stop acting like a student, just messing around all the time.

323
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,380
I'm not messing around.

324
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,630
A grown man like you...

325
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,560
It's pathetic.

326
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,710
In this town...

327
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,710
(Reliving memories from their school days)
is the part of me that I used to hate.

328
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,800
It's really been a while.

329
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,870
Have some of mine.

330
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,730
There it is! The Mashiro block.

331
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,830
I'll cover Kanade!

332
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,240
I'm so glad I came back.

333
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,770
It's all thanks to you, Kosuke.

334
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,840
Thank you.

335
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,170
Dad...

336
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,300
What are you doing?
