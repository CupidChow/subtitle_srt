1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,810
What is your problem?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,700
I went through all this trouble to come see you, Kosuke.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,890
I even took a day off from work.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,810
And paid that expensive train fare just to get here.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,210
How could you say something so horrible?

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,030
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,500
You're right.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm sorry...

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,300
An apology isn't going to fix this!

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,990
Do you even nderstand?

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,230
Kosuke.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,710
Um... excuse me...

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,430
I think it might be best if we all calmed down a bit...

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,690
You, stay out of this.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,360
Kosuke, are you listening to me?

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,980
Don't just stand there in silence. Say something.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,340
Can we talk alone for a minute?

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,370
Why would you be the one to talk to Kosuke?

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,530
This has nothing to do with you.

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:52,460
But...

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
This is a family matter.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,050
Please leave.

23
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,110
Kosuke and I will have a proper talk.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,530
Um...

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,900
Anyway...

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,860
Excuse me.

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,510
Kosuke!

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,110
Are you okay?

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,860
I'm sorry...

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,930
Not a friend...

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,260
Kanade is not a friend.

32
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,090
Mashiro.

33
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,430
He's always been crying.

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,900
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

35
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,100
(Episode 8)

36
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,060
For causing you all this trouble.

38
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,520
It's no trouble at all.

39
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,510
I should go talk to her.

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,520
Huh?

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,080
I'll be right back.

42
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,510
Kanade, just wait here for me.

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,700
Don't shut me out.

44
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,030
Sorry...

45
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,640
It's nothing.

46
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,070
You don't have to apologize.

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,010
We were supposed to watch a movie together.

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,390
Sorry.

49
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,590
That doesn't matter.

50
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,710
My mom always shows up unannounced.

51
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,340
But...

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,410
My mom isn't going to move to Tokyo.
You can rest assured.

53
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,430
That's definitely not going to happen.

54
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,870
Yeah.

55
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,160
It was after my dad passed away...

56
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
that my mom became like that.

57
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,280
Her mental state became... unstable, I guess.

58
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,740
Back then...

59
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,480
it was really...

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,040
That must have been hard.

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
Was it really that hard on me?

62
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,150
I should have been fine...

63
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,090
If I had just made up my mind,

64
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,290
I could have been stronger.

65
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,630
No matter what happened,

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,520
I should have just accepted it all.

67
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,530
If I had done that,

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,480
I probably wouldn't have any more worries.

69
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,910
It's not that I don't trust you, Kanade.

70
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,810
Or that I think you're an outsider.

71
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,330
It's just that, ever since we were young,

72
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,290
the only time I ever felt happy was when I was with you.

73
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,690
That's why I don't want anyone else to get in the way.

74
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,860
That's why...

75
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,500
Just being happy...

76
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,600
isn't enough to stay together forever, is it?

77
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,050
Your strengths,

78
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,240
and your vulnerabilities...

79
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,350
To me,

80
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,650
they're all important.

81
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,230
Please let me cherish you.

82
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,150
Okay.

83
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
(Incoming call from MITSUKO)

84
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,590
Can I tell my mom about you, Kanade?

85
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,550
Huh?

86
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,620
I mean, you can,

87
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,940
but will it be okay?

88
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,000
Whether it's okay or not doesn't matter.

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,720
This is more important.

90
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,490
Hello?

91
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,080
Mommy might be dying.

92
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
Dying?

93
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,080
Anyway, I'm on my way over now.

94
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,470
Why is he so calm?

95
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,240
Also, me and Kanade...

96
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,900
the person who was with me...

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,020
we're dating.

98
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,010
Oh, honestly.

99
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,680
Why didn't you just tell me you were dating?

100
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,180
I don't care about that kind of thing at all.

101
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,180
That was... an unexpected reaction.

102
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm actually pretty open-minded about that sort of thing.

103
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,070
However,

104
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,990
it's probably best to keep this from your grandmother.

105
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,220
I doubt she'd understand.

106
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,320
How should I put it...
it's just a phase young people go through, right?

107
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,310
A phase?

108
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,640
The way I see it,

109
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,760
as long as you eventually get married and have kids,

110
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,050
I don't think there's anything wrong
with experimenting a little.

111
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,030
I'm not prejudiced about it at all.

112
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,810
Somehow...

113
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,530
this feels... wrong.

114
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,350
Mom.

115
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,970
What is it?

116
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,830
I've...

117
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,240
I've never been able to say what I really feel.

118
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,950
But I'm done taking the easy way out
by pretending or running away.

119
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,270
That goes for you too, Mom.

120
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,920
I won't hold back anymore.

121
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
What do you mean?

122
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,130
I think...

123
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,740
from now on,

124
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,930
I'm always going to put Kanade first.

125
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,580
And I hope that you can find your own happiness, Mom.

126
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,780
What are you saying?

127
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,430
Has someone been putting strange ideas in your head?

128
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,050
You're not the kind of boy
who says things like that, Kosuke.

129
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,270
It's because you've been hanging around
with someone strange

130
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,360
that you're not acting like yourself!

131
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,390
Kanade is...

132
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,870
This is for the coffee.

133
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,870
And for your train fare home.

134
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:18,900
Huh?

135
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,470
If you leave now,

136
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,130
I think you can still catch the express train
that leaves Tokyo just after 6:00.

137
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,650
Well then.

138
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,540
We'll be taking our leave now.

139
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,590
I know, you know...

140
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,320
Kosuke.

141
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,970
Whenever you're trying to endure something,

142
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,780
you have this habit.

143
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,560
You tap your chest, just like this.

144
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm sorry...

145
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,690
that I'm this kind of mother.

146
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,870
I think Mom should get to your place around 8:00.

147
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,280
Are you doing okay?

148
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,240
If anything happens,

149
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,050
make sure you tell Grandma right away.

150
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,980
Thank you.

151
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,200
If you come across something you can't forgive,

152
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,730
don't hold it in.

153
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,920
It's okay to be angry.

154
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,030
Okay.

155
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,360
Good night.

156
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,250
Dad, were you on the track team in middle school?

157
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
I've always loved running.

158
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,200
And you love it too, don't you, Kosuke?

159
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,550
You always come in first at sports day.

160
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,040
Maybe I'll join the track team.

161
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,100
Alright!
Let's have a race then.

162
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Huh?

163
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,150
Race to that tree and back.
First one to reach Mom wins!

164
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,160
Ready, set, go!

165
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,840
Hey, that's a false start! Wait for me!

166
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,370
Be careful, you two!

167
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,570
Go, Kosuke! Go, Dad!

168
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,180
You're too fast!

169
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,760
Dad lost!

170
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,560
That was amazing, Kosuke! You're so fast!

171
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,380
I'm amazing, right?

172
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,870
- He's amazing.
- Amazing.

173
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,400
I won!

174
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,080
The coffee's ready.

175
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,540
Mashiro?

176
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,130
Kanade.

177
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,830
Let's stay together forever.

178
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,400
Yeah.

179
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,510
My mom texted. She's home.

180
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,380
Oh, I see.

181
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,020
Was I...

182
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,880
Was I really rude to her?

183
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,390
It feels like I kicked her out.

184
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,750
It wasn't your fault, Kanade.

185
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,190
I should have gotten properly angry myself.

186
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,130
You see,

187
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,340
I feel like I abandoned my mom to come here.

188
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,210
So whenever I'm with her,

189
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,840
I just put on a smile

190
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,670
and brush things off.

191
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,500
I try not to think too hard about it.

192
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,860
It's easier that way.

193
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,430
Easier?

194
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,790
That way, I don't have to feel guilty, right?

195
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,030
I'm the one who ran away to Tokyo alone.

196
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,940
I'm a terrible son, aren't I?

197
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm so glad you came to Tokyo, Mashiro.

198
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,350
Thank you for finding me.

199
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,540
For laughing with me.

200
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,150
And making my heart flutter.

201
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm so grateful.

202
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,360
So...

203
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,570
is it okay for me to think this is right?

204
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,750
Yeah.

205
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,120
Of course it is.

206
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,740
I'm so glad you're here, Kanade.

207
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,930
I...

208
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,490
I was scared I'd end up like my mom.

209
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,070
The more I liked you, Kanade,

210
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,170
the more I worried you'd leave me.

211
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,300
I was afraid of being left all alone.

212
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,090
That's why...

213
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,380
I was so pushy with you that day.

214
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,120
I'm so sorry.

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,050
I'm not going anywhere.

216
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,650
I won't leave you.

217
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,660
Thank you.

218
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,400
But if...

219
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,300
if your feelings change, Mashiro,

220
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
you'd probably leave me, wouldn't you?

221
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,840
Huh?

222
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,840
Because nothing in this world lasts forever.

223
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,110
One day,

224
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,460
Mashiro, you'll fall for someone else...

225
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,320
I'll always love you, Kanade.

226
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,460
So don't worry.

227
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,540
Okay.

228
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,040
You've got it all backward!

229
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,740
It's my turn to be comforted today!

230
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,040
Turn?

231
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,550
Kanade, you're too pessimistic.

232
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,740
Before I knew it,

233
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,980
I got all gloomy.

234
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,590
Sorry.

235
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,450
I guess I am pretty pessimistic.

236
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,930
See? There you go again.

237
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,700
Oh.

238
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,490
By the way, I'm starving.

239
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,810
Huh?

240
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,710
Is there anything to eat?

241
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,720
This time...

242
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,980
why don't you take the lead, Kanade-san?

243
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,070
If I don't work up the courage,

244
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,420
we won't be able to move forward.

245
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,570
Are you okay with eating this, Kanade?

246
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,900
If we go out to eat now,
we'll get home really late.

247
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,050
Tonight...

248
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:24,480
can we... not go home?

249
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,290
Huh?

250
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,580
I actually said it.

251
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,580
Um...

252
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,760
Yeah?

253
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,370
What is it?

254
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,800
Somehow,

255
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,500
you don't seem like the usual Mashiro.

256
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,120
Huh?

257
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,980
I guess it's my fault though.

258
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,360
To be honest,

259
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,960
I've been holding back... a lot!

260
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,020
But...

261
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,070
that's not the most important thing.

262
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,230
If you don't want to, Kanade,

263
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,940
we don't ever have to...

264
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,170
No.

265
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,050
Saying that just puts pressure on you, doesn't it?

266
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,000
But I really...

267
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,450
didn't mean it like that.

268
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,000
I meant every word I said.

269
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,710
I want to, too.

270
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,610
I want to do it with you, Mashiro.

271
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,480
Huh?

272
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,890
Are you sure?

273
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,740
Yeah.

274
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,830
Are you okay?

275
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,620
Yeah.

276
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,250
What about you, Mashiro?

277
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,950
I'm so happy.

278
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,410
I'm so glad.

279
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,050
I love you so much.

280
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,840
Me too.

281
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,640
(Next Episode)
Starting today, we're living together.

282
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,180
(They're moving in!)
- Shinichiro. -Kosuke.

283
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,850
- I'm home.
- Go tidy up your room.

284
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,750
(Their habits are completely different.)
I'll do it later.

285
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,850
You're such a slob.

286
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,110
As long as you don't give up,

287
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,660
(A form of love unique to them.)
you'll find a way that works for the two of you.

288
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,820
Let's have a proper talk when we get back.

289
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,590
(9:02 PM. Accident occurred on the Toei Line,
resulting in casualties. Service is suspended.)
Don't tell me...
