1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,400
What would you like to order?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,800
I have one more person coming. Is it okay
if we wait for them before ordering?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,540
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,300
Is it that person who usually has a big appetite?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,750
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,700
You two are really close.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,500
There are still four days until Saturday!

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,770
If I keep feeling this conflicted inside,
there's no way I can focus on my work.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,700
Anyway, let's talk when we meet.
Make sure to keep Saturday free.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,000
I get to see Mashiro again today.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,100
I need to make sure I get
my feelings across to you.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
I can't help but feel a little nervous!

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
(Mitsuko is calling)

14
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello?

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,560
What?

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,300
(I can't make it today, I'm really sorry.
I promise I'll make it up to you next time.)

17
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,700
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,000
(Episode 5)

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,370
Seriously, don't come running back
just because of something this minor!

20
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,200
Because Mom said on the phone...

21
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,300
Hello?

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,700
Kosuke.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,900
Grandma collapsed.

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,890
What?

25
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,500
Hurry back.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,180
It's just a pulled muscle in the back.

27
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,200
She is just overreacting.

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
Are you really okay?

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,000
I twisted my ankle a bit while walking
and lost my balance for a moment, that's all.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry.

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,000
That's good, then.

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Sorry to have you come all the way back on your rare day off.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Didn't you have something planned originally?

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Nothing special planned, really.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,900
Where's Mom?

36
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
She went out to buy ingredients for dinner.

37
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,300
We made a special feast just because you were coming home.

38
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,700
Honestly, there's just no way to say no to your mom.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,610
(I can't make it today, I'm really sorry.
I promise I'll make it up to you next time.)

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
Did something happen?

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,450
Sharing a meal with the whole family really is the best.

42
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,700
Are you eating well in Tokyo?

43
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,420
Yeah, I just grab whatever.

44
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,000
You shouldn't always just grab
whatever to eat outside, you know.

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Sometimes I cook for myself too,
making udon noodles and things like that.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,050
You should come back here more often.

47
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,900
It only takes two hours by train to get here.

48
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,540
Yeah.

49
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Kosuke has his own life.

50
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
You shouldn't call so often, either.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
Why?

52
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,400
Isn't it only natural for parents to worry about
their children and check in with them often?

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Didn't you used to just leave Kosuke on his own all the time?

54
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,500
You only show concern for Kosuke when
things aren't going well with your boyfriend.

55
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,300
That's mean.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,730
How can you say that?

57
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,400
As a parent, what I care about most is Kosuke!

58
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
What do you even know, Mom!

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I'll come back often.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you.

61
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Kosuke is really gentle.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
(I got it. Let me know when you're done.)

63
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,300
(I'm really sorry about today. If you're free tomorrow…)

64
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,000
Kosuke, I'm going in now.

65
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah.

66
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,500
Did you know there's a new shopping mall
that just opened across from the station?

67
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,700
Yeah.

68
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,460
There's a huge home goods store inside.

69
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you want to go together tomorrow?

70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,050
Huh?

71
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,600
There are so many things I want to buy,
but it's tough to carry them all back by myself.

72
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,000
You'll come with me, right?

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Sorry, I'll be heading back early tomorrow morning.

74
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,200
Why?

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Aren't you off on Sunday?

76
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
Even though I have the day off and I'm not working...

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Are you really in such a hurry to go back?

78
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,900
That's not what I meant.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,600
It's great to see you having such a good time in Tokyo.

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
But we're family.

81
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,100
Don't think it's enough just because
you're comfortable on your own.

82
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,200
It's already the third day today.

83
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,600
I wonder what's going on with Mashiro...

84
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Good job.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,700
Can I sit here?

86
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,300
Sure, have a seat.

87
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,800
You've already talked things through
with Sumire-chan, haven't you?

88
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Huh?

89
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,500
I didn't ask what you two talked about.

90
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
But it looks like Sumire-chan has
already come to terms with it.

91
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,100
Thank you.

92
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,490
It's nothing.

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I...

94
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,500
I said some really out-of-line things to
Kanade a while back. I'm really sorry.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm the one who should really apologize.

96
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I knew I should've gone with
the mackerel sandwich after all.

97
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,870
Huh?

98
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,200
Even though I usually prefer BLT
sandwiches, I really love mackerel too.

99
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,300
If you don't mind, would you like to have this?

100
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,000
It's just mackerel from a can, pea shoots,
and eggs stir-fried together, that's all.

101
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,110
Is that okay?

102
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,900
Sure, I haven't eaten yet.

103
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,800
Then I'll dig in.

104
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Delicious.

105
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Kanade, your cooking skills are really impressive.

106
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,800
I just like it, that's all.

107
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
What a relief.

108
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,700
I was a little worried that Kanade
might end up disliking me!

109
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,700
You're overthinking it.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,500
From now on, I need to be
careful not to meddle too much.

111
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,500
Whenever asked about relationship troubles,
I can't help but get really involved.

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Seems like many people come to you to talk about their relationship troubles, right?

113
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,700
I guess so. Maybe it's just because of my age.

114
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,800
Don't be fooled by how I seem.
I've actually been in quite a few relationships.

115
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Kanamori-san.

116
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,500
What's up?

117
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,800
Do you have some time after work today?

118
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Actually, I am...

119
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
currently seeing someone.

120
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
It's just... the person I'm seeing is a guy.

121
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
I see...

122
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,580
Yes...

123
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,880
Sorry to keep you waiting. Please enjoy.

124
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,790
Thank you.

125
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Is coffee okay for Kanade-san?

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,140
Yeah, thank you.

127
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,390
You were supposed to go out
for drinks together. Sorry about that.

128
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,830
Please don't worry about it.

129
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,600
More importantly, is it really okay for me to be here?

130
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah.

131
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
If it's Aizawa-san, there's absolutely no problem.

132
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,500
I see.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,790
You heard about it from Kanade.

134
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,640
Yes.

135
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,660
I've decided that from now on, I'm
going to support Kanade-san's love.

136
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,100
Huh?

137
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,600
Because I want the prince to keep shining forever.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,030
Prince?

139
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,400
Anyone Kanade-san falls for must be an amazing person.

140
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Not at all.

141
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,600
Even though I don't really know the details,
it seems like you've already let it all go.

142
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,450
Yes.

143
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,000
Kanade-san, no matter what
happens, I'll always be by your side.

144
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,500
Thank you.

145
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
But...

146
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,500
It's never really gone smoothly.

147
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,500
Um... did something happen between you and your boyfriend?

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,020
Yes.

149
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,500
Actually...

150
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,760
Has it really been three days without any contact?

151
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,500
Right! What do you think that means?

152
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,610
Ah! I know I'm overthinking it
and it's making me feel exhausted.

153
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,620
Kanade, calm down.

154
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,520
Why haven't I heard anything from him?

155
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,600
Wasn't he the one who said he
wanted to make it up to you?

156
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,870
Could it be that I deliberately dragged things out,
and that's why there's distance between us?

157
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,600
Maybe he's the one who feels bothered by all this?

158
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,820
Or maybe he just doesn't like me anymore?

159
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,190
Don't be so pessimistic!
If you just talk things through,

160
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,990
Maybe there's nothing wrong at all!

161
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,100
But he's been leaving me on read.
How do I have a proper conversation with him like this?

162
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Um...

163
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,000
The only option is to wait in ambush for him.

164
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,650
Huh?
Lying in wait for someone?

165
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,390
In a shoujo manga I've been reading lately,
the main character can't see the person she likes.

166
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,800
So she waited in ambush for him and confessed her feelings.

167
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,320
Wait in ambush for someone?

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,590
Wait a second, isn't that kind of creepy?

169
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Huh?

170
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,460
Isn't that basically stalking?

171
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,600
But in the manga, the two of them end up together in the end.

172
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Comics and real life are totally different!

173
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,830
But if you don't do anything, nothing's ever going to change.

174
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,400
And besides, maybe the other person has their own reasons too.

175
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,640
First, you've got to confess your feelings
otherwise, nothing will ever get started!

176
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,400
What should I do?

177
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,870
Who could possibly know something like that!

178
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,300
There's really no right answer when it comes to relationships.

179
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm really sorry I couldn't be of any help.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Not at all.

181
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,500
How about looking at it from the other side?

182
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,300
Huh?

183
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
For example,

184
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,700
if you were the one being ambushed and waited for, how would you feel?

185
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,830
Take that! I knew you'd show up after all!

186
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,700
I thought you might show up, so I came by every day just to check.

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,710
It is a little scarry.

188
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,200
Rather than being afraid, it's more like…

189
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
It might be a bit of a surprise.

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,850
Right?

191
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,900
But...

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,100
I'm really grateful.

193
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,540
Huh?

194
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,700
It's exactly because he took the initiative
that I was able to face my own feelings.

195
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,000
In that case, isn't the answer already pretty obvious?

196
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Huh?

197
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,500
Go for it, Kanade-san!

198
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,500
Has Mashiro already gone back?

199
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Mashiro.

200
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,500
How did you…?

201
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,100
Um...

202
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,700
I was waiting in ambush for you!

203
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Does waiting to ambush someone like this really come off as annoying?

204
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,500
What do you really mean?

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,500
You canceled our plans at the last minute
without a single word of explanation.

206
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,400
And then you just completely stopped contacting me...

207
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
Say something.

208
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Just as I was about to head over.

210
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,600
I got the news that my grandma collapsed.

211
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,400
I rushed back to my hometown.

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Is your grandma okay?

213
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Yeah, she just threw out her back a little. Nothing serious.

214
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,000
That's a relief.

215
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,200
But before you found out about that, Mashiro,
you must have been really anxious too, right?

216
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,200
Don't keep it all bottled up inside.

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I wish you'd told me.

219
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,900
I never thought about telling Kanade about this.

220
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,390
Huh?

221
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,800
Because this is my own business.

222
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It would only make you worry.

223
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,700
Why can't you let me worry about you?

224
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Mashiro, if something is important to you,
I hope you'll tell me about it.

225
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,260
When Mashiro is facing difficulties

226
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,800
I want to figure things out with you,
and I want to worry about them with you too.

227
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,400
Even though I might not be able to do much,

228
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,000
But I really want to understand what's going on with Mashiro.

229
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,700
I want to be the person you're willing to share important things with.

230
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Because that's truly how I feel.

231
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,300
My mom told me,

232
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,700
"Don't think that just running off to Tokyo
by yourself is going to make things any easier."

233
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,800
She's mainly upset that
I'm heading back to Tokyo so soon after coming home.

234
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,700
I remember now.

235
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,000
I think I've said something similar to Kanade before.

236
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm not going to make things easy for you!

237
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,100
The moment I thought I might have forced my feelings onto Kanade too...

238
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,500
I suddenly didn't know how to reach out to you anymore.

239
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,000
I always act before I've really thought things through.

240
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Not even thinking about those around me.

241
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I just end up doing things Kanade hates...

242
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't help but wonder if I've been making mistakes all along.

243
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
For me...

244
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,200
When I heard what Mashiro said to me back then,
I was really happy.

245
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,850
Huh?

246
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It felt like someone gave a hard knock
to the part of me that always shrinks back.

247
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,800
I'm still not able to be that positive yet.

248
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
I said I wanted to talk to Mashiro about something.

249
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,800
It's about what happened at the aquarium that day.

250
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
The day at the aquarium?

251
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm really sorry about that day.

252
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,700
Even though Mashiro is right by my side.

253
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,000
But I still keep thinking about how others see me and all of this.

254
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,800
I really hate this side of myself.

255
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,800
But

256
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,700
I've decided not to run away anymore.

257
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Because I want to cherish this miracle.

258
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,200
Miracle?

259
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Someone once told me that.

260
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,500
Hearing “I like you” from the person you like
that's a miracle.

261
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,200
Mashiro is the one who brought me this miracle.

262
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,200
So please stop saying you keep making mistakes.

263
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Because no one really knows what the right answer is.

264
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,500
Let's create together, just the two of us...

265
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,500
our own answer.

266
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,000
You know, I really do like Kanade after all.

267
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Um...

268
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,430
Hmm…?

269
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,000
My place...

270
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
It's just around here.

271
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Do you want to come over?

272
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
Sorry to bother you.

273
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Mashiro?

274
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Sorry.

275
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
I can't take it anymore.

276
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,400
Huh?

277
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Is that okay?

278
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,830
Yeah.

279
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,800
Kanade!

280
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
I can't believe it actually happened…

281
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
My heart's racing like crazy…

282
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,300
What are you going to do after this?

283
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,800
After this?

284
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,000
W-What do you mean by after this?!

285
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,650
(Next Episode)
I don't really get the appeal of Boys' Love, to be honest.

286
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,920
If Mashiro finds out about what's going on at work,
he'll probably be really shocked.

287
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,350
Don't touch me without asking!

288
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,300
(Is this their first fight sparked by jealousy?)
Isn't that guy just a regular coworker?

289
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,120
What if you get misunderstood?

290
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,230
There's no way anyone would get the wrong idea.

291
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,300
Can I come over to your place?
