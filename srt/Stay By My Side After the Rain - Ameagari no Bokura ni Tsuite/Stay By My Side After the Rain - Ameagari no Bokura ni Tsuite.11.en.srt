1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,840
My dad, my family...

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,040
I don't need them anymore.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,180
Shinichiro.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,220
Have it your way.

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,530
It's my fault for kissing you.

7
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,520
I won't just kiss people when I'm drunk anymore.

8
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,580
It's not your fault, Kosuke.

9
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,280
But...

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,810
You see now, don't you?

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,560
What kind of person my dad is.

12
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,070
It doesn't matter anymore.

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,710
I already said I'm not going home.

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,040
Go home.

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,860
Huh?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,310
Talking about abandoning everything...

17
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,780
Don't just say things on a whim.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Even if you want to be with your family,

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,150
you'll lose them one day anyway.

20
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,590
Just try a little harder.

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,190
If it still doesn't work out,

22
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,460
we'll go back to our place together.

23
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,580
Okay.

24
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,180
I still have my luggage.

25
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,710
So I'm heading back today.

26
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,260
Will you be okay by yourself?

27
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,830
Do you want me to go with you?

28
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,820
I'm fine.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,150
I'll go back by myself.

30
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,890
It'll probably be less of a mess if I go alone.

31
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,220
That's true.

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,300
Call me if anything happens.

33
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,620
I'll be there right away.

34
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,750
Thank you.

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,410
I'm not alone.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,230
I have Kosuke with me.

37
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,900
Stay By My Side After the Rain

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
(Episode 11)

39
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,550
I'm home.

40
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,890
Welcome back.

41
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,100
Did you have fun at your reunion?

42
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,910
Where's Dad?

43
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,450
He came home, went to his room, and hasn't come out.

44
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,000
Did something happen
at the neighborhood association meeting?

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,790
Shinichiro?

46
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,900
Mom, Yui.

47
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,690
There's something I need to tell you.

48
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,730
What is it?

49
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,070
You're kind of scaring me.

50
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,600
The truth is...

51
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,030
The person I like...

52
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,110
is a guy.

53
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,680
Huh?

54
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,780
So...

55
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm... gay.

56
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,740
What?

57
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,320
W-wait a minute...

58
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,620
I see.

59
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
I see.

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm sorry if this is a shock.

61
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,520
No, not at all.

62
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,540
Maybe...

63
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,130
you might find me disgusting.

64
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you for telling us.

65
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,550
Huh?

66
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,850
I'm so glad you felt you could tell us, Shinichiro.

67
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,540
Yeah...

68
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah.

69
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,490
What made you decide to tell us now?

70
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,380
It's because...

71
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Dad...

72
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,740
he found out.

73
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,430
Dad found out?

74
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,420
Yeah.

75
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,520
Because Dad's the way he is,

76
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,640
he might...

77
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,920
disown me or something.

78
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,990
But Mom, Yui...

79
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,430
Did you try to have a proper talk with Dad?

80
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,380
N-no...

81
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,770
Not really a proper talk.

82
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,800
You know how Dad is.

83
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,540
He'd just get angry even if I tried talking to him.

84
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,390
That's not true.

85
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,210
It was the same when Yui said she wanted to go
to fashion design school.

86
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,150
Dad was against it too,

87
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
but after hearing Yui out...

88
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,840
he went and checked out a bunch of schools all by himself.

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
Really?

90
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,270
In his own way, your dad

91
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,730
is really trying to understand you.

92
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,020
So,

93
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,560
why don't you try explaining things to him, Shinichiro?

94
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,000
But...

95
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,020
I'm on your side, Shinichiro.

96
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,470
I'm on your side too.

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,810
No matter who you love,

98
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,430
you'll always be my big brother.

99
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,900
Thank you.

100
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,190
Anyway, it's late. Go take a bath.

101
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,660
I'll get a towel out for you.

102
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,860
Okay.

103
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,730
Mom, how can you be so calm?

104
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,110
I had a feeling.

105
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,230
I've suspected it for a while.

106
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,480
Wait, you knew all along?

107
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,600
More or less. I had a hunch.

108
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,640
Then you should've told him!

109
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,510
How could I say anything?
Shinichiro never said a word about it himself.

110
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,630
But... he...

111
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,110
...the fact that he likes men.

112
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,830
He's been hiding it from everyone, right?

113
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,120
He couldn't even tell his own family.

114
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,980
That must have been so hard for him.

115
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,700
Yeah...

116
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,600
Ah...

117
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
It's out in the open now...

118
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
Come in.

119
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,410
Shinichiro, let's all sleep in here.

120
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,310
Huh?

121
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,900
We used to do this all the time
when we were kids, remember?

122
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,640
It'll be fun, just for a night.

123
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,630
No, but it'll be too cramped.

124
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,890
- It's not cramped at all.
- Yeah, there's plenty of room.

125
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,760
Here, a pillow.

126
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,890
Oh, wait. I'll just squeeze in over there.

127
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,210
Shinichiro, are you turning in too?

128
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,610
Yeah.

129
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,660
Okay, lights out.

130
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,980
- Good night.
- Good night.

131
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,520
Can I say something?

132
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,440
Sure.

133
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,280
Hey.

134
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,170
Can I come visit you in Tokyo sometime?

135
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,610
I want to go too!

136
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to go shopping in Yaesu and Ginza.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,730
Me too!

138
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,370
Okay, how about we all go
after Shinichiro gets his bonus?

139
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,270
Yeah!

140
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,020
Hey, don't make plans without me.

141
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,340
Let me know, okay?

142
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,310
Where should we go?

143
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,960
Into my world,

144
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,800
more people have come.

145
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Kosuke.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,480
Hmm?

147
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,240
Is now a good time to talk?

148
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,450
Yeah.

149
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
What is it?

150
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,470
All the money you've sent me until now...

151
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,480
...it's all here.

152
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,600
But this was for you, Grandma...

153
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I know.

154
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,180
You wanted me to use it to take care of your mother.

155
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,120
That's why you sent money every month, isn't it?

156
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,950
I've been saving all of it.

157
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,530
I was planning to give it to your mother one day.

158
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,700
Then why?

159
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,290
I talked to that girl who's so keen on being independent.

160
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,490
I told her about this money.

161
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,770
And she told me,

162
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,790
Give this back to Kosuke.

163
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,980
What?

164
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,650
From now on, I'll contribute to the household too.

165
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,050
And we have Daisuke's survivor benefits.

166
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,520
I don't want to be a burden to Kosuke.

167
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,080
I want to be a proper mother to him.

168
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,960
This is what your mother wants.

169
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,460
So please, take it.

170
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,420
But, Grandma...

171
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,380
Don't worry about me.

172
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,870
I don't have to pay rent for this house.

173
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,060
And I have my own pension.

174
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,900
Plus, your mother said she'll contribute.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,270
So that money...

176
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,570
...you should use it however you want.

177
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,700
That way,

178
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,480
your mother will be happier too.

179
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,430
If you ever need anything, you have to let me know.

180
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,650
Alright, alright.

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,510
I'll be counting on you then.

182
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm going to bed.

183
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,220
Good night.

184
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,030
Good night.

185
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,760
Shinichiro, what time is your train?

186
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,230
Four o'clock.

187
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,580
Want to go shopping for a bit before you leave?

188
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,390
Sure.

189
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,560
Where are you going?

190
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,650
Just for a walk.

191
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,330
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.

192
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,440
Um...

193
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,760
Dad...

194
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,520
Am I still welcome here?

195
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,450
I...

196
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,060
...couldn't become the person you wanted me to be.

197
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,530
I don't expect you to understand me.

198
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,690
But...

199
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,150
I...

200
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,240
What do you take me for?

201
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,710
I'm not as clueless as you think.

202
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,620
After what happened yesterday, I did some research.

203
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,580
I was trying to understand what kind of person you are,

204
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,590
in my own way.

205
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,650
So you looked me up and now you get it?

206
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,040
You think you understand me now?

207
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,350
It's not like I became some alien you don't know.

208
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,040
I've always been me.

209
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,490
So, shouldn't you and Mom
be the ones who know me best?

210
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,510
Stop twisting my words.

211
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,940
You're just confusing me even more.

212
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,650
Just leave me alone for a bit.

213
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,690
Can't you just try a little harder?

214
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,060
Wait.

215
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,180
- We're not done talking.
- I'm tired.

216
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,260
Dad, why are you always like this?

217
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,430
You don't have to talk to me like that.

218
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,150
Try to think about how I feel for once.

219
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,110
I've always...

220
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,830
All this time...

221
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,980
When you were little, you slipped right here

222
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,830
and almost fell into the river.

223
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,270
Huh?

224
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,800
I tried to save you,

225
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,770
and ended up slipping myself.

226
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,330
Ahh!!!

227
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,320
Dad was soaking wet.

228
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,510
I was panicking,

229
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,770
but you were just laughing your head off.

230
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,880
Dad, here.

231
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,720
Oh.

232
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,480
Thank you.

233
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,470
Your hand back then,

234
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,140
it was so small.

235
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,130
Why...

236
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,590
Why are you telling me this?

237
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,550
Every time I held that little hand of yours, I'd...

238
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,300
I'd think about how I had to protect you from now on.

239
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,200
It made me feel so proud.

240
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,430
And so happy.

241
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,340
It made me feel like I'd finally
become a man in my own right.

242
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,290
I just assumed you'd naturally
become that kind of man too.

243
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,870
That's why I wanted you to become
a responsible man.

244
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,370
But...

245
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,490
you and I are different after all.

246
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,700
I keep wondering what all those things
I taught you were for.

247
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
It just makes me feel helpless.

248
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm just a stubborn old man.

249
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,580
For all the time being,

251
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,140
it was always painful for me,
not being able to live up to your expectations.

252
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,510
Why?

253
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,350
I finally understand now.

254
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,600
- Look at you, you're all wet.
- So are you, Dad.

255
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,540
Whoa.

256
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,950
Mom's going to be so mad.

257
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,290
Okay, let's stop by the bathhouse on our way home.

258
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,360
Yeah! Let's go!

259
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,560
Okay.

260
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,800
This will be our little secret from Mom.

261
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,110
Because I love you, Dad.

262
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,900
Okay.

263
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,720
I'll come back.

264
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,020
I'll definitely be back.

265
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,860
You don't have to say that.

266
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,950
This is your home.

267
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,220
The thing I was so afraid of...

268
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,450
...turned out to be just this.

269
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,460
It's okay if I disappoint him.

270
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,360
It doesn't matter if I don't change.

271
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
It's okay.

272
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,500
I can take my time.

273
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,210
Still got 30 minutes.

274
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,820
Looks like we're a little early.

275
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,560
I bought this. Want some?

276
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,840
Yes, please!

277
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,610
Awesome!

278
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,720
Here.

279
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,780
Thanks.

280
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,620
Pudding is always the best.

281
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,190
Is your dad really going to be okay?

282
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,890
Yeah...

283
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,260
It'll work out somehow.

284
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,590
That's good.

285
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,930
I also told them
that I'm living with you, Kosuke.

286
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,520
Oh, you did?

287
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,040
This trip home was so rushed.

288
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,430
Yeah.

289
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,710
But it was fun.

290
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,770
Really?

291
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,770
Yeah.

292
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,460
What about you, Kosuke?

293
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,970
I'm always happy.

294
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,920
Coming back here...

295
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,490
reminds me of the times
I used to play with Shinichiro.

296
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,050
I'm so glad we grew up.

297
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,660
Huh?

298
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,030
It reminds me of a lot of things too.

299
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,060
Like how I fell for you, Kosuke.

300
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
And how I was too scared to do anything about it.

301
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,860
Then I went to Tokyo...

302
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,730
...and left everything behind.

303
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,500
I found someone I like again,

304
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,100
but no matter how many times I try, things never go well.

305
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,730
I can never be the person I want to be.

306
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,620
I just don't know what to do.

307
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,520
All this time,

308
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,570
I've really hated myself.

309
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,080
No matter how many times I start over,

310
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,620
I'm still just me in the end.

311
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,750
I can't change.

312
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,830
But now...

313
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,650
Kosuke is by my side.

314
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,310
As long as Kosuke is here,

315
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,430
I can actually like myself.

316
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,900
Shinichiro.

317
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,000
Seriously, what are you doing?

318
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,020
I was saving that for last!

319
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,960
You're so childish.

320
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,870
Whatever.

321
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,300
Let's clean up.

322
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,890
Yeah.

323
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,310
Ten years from now,

324
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,210
or twenty,

325
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,990
I hope I can still be laughing happily
with Kosuke like this.

326
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,510
I have tissues too.

327
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,830
(Next Episode) The happier I am, the more I worry
about how long a life like this can last.

328
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,160
(Will This Happiness Last Forever?)
We can't get married, after all.

329
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,000
Shinichiro's anxiety.

330
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,340
If you're with me,

331
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,880
(The Future They Choose)
I'm sure we can cut it in half.

332
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,120
So let's...

333
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,590
be together forever.
